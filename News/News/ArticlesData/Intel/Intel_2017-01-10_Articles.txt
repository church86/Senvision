Will you soon be able to buy a virtual ticket the game? Share twitter Tom Taylor Wednesday January 11th, 2017 Half a century after the first VR headset was built by American computer scientist Ivan Sutherland, virtual reality still isn’t quite reality. But Intel’s CEO Brian Krzanich is banking on his company to fix that, and sports, he believes, might be the perfect playground for VR. At Intel’s press event at CES 2017, the company live streamed a Butler-Villanova men’s basketball game in VR, using footage captured by a six-camera pod, and also showed a 3D replay of a Read Madrid-Barcelona soccer game generated using 36 cameras placed around the Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona. For fans, says Krzanich, “our goal is that you could take any sport and through VR pick your seat.” Selling virtual tickets could significantly add to league revenues, especially since major teams already have the untapped potential of fanbases that just won’t physically fit inside their stadiums. FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images Last year, the Pokémon Go craze introduced many people to the idea of augmented reality, where computer generated entities are inserted into a view of the real world. Intel’s spin on this is merged reality, where real-world objects are inserted into the virtual world, and users can explore that world without fear of tripping over reality. The company plans to release its Project Alloy merged reality headsets to consumers by the end of this year, with the focus being on gaming. In a way, virtual reality feels like a solution waiting for a problem. It is fun and interesting to watch sports in VR, but not essential in the way that following a live game is all-but impossible without a radio or a television. And VR headsets are few and far between. Everyone who owns a car almost by default owns a radio, and there are 260 million cars in the U.S. Almost everyone who owns a home owns a TV, and there are 120 million homes in the U.S. In comparison, in 2016, only about 10 million VR headsets were sold worldwide. Ownership numbers are growing, but the available VR content has not yet made the headsets indispensible. Edge Indian brand Boltt aims to change the game with AI-powered fitness wearable devices Sports, according to Krzanich, might offer that content. You need to experience sports events live and they just aren’t the same when you’re not in the stadium. Last year Intel installed its 360-degree replay technology at Levi’s stadium—the 49ers home is barely a mile away from Intel’s HQ in Santa Clara, Calif. Using the footage from 36 cameras, the company can create a 3D model of each Niners home game and recreate a view of the action from any point within that space. The problem, though, is that the system generates two terabytes of data per minute, more than all the data a single person might generate over five years. “That’s a massive compute problem to solve,” Krzanich says. “So that’s why we feel we’re uniquely qualified to solve.” Intel’s current system takes about 90 seconds to generate its 3D world, which is only fast enough right now to be used for game highlights. Krzanich predicts, though, that within two years the system will work in real-time. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images “It is a bit of a fun engineering challenge,” Krzanich says about the data processing demands with a smile, betraying his background as an engineer. “But it’s a huge business opportunity,” he adds more seriously, switching back to CEO mode. Giving fans the opportunity to pick their seats, even if they can’t physically get to a game, means that both real and virtual tickets could be sold. There will be 71,500 people in NRG Stadium in Houston for Super Bowl LI on Feb. 5, paying an average ticket price of more than $2,500. But an unlimited number of people could sit in any single virtual seat, and with Intel 360-degree replay, viewing positions that would be impossible in the real world can be created—perhaps the hash marks at the 50-yard line. If even a fraction of the several hundred million expected to watch the Super Bowl paid a small percent of the in-person ticket prices for a virtual experience that would represent a whole lot of real money.

The anticipation for the new processor series for AMD is growing every day thanks to the marketing machine over at AMD continually showing it performing better than an Intel Core i7-6900K processor that costs over $1000. The thought of AMD releasing a processor that can compete with Skylake-E at any level a year ago, would have caused laughter in the room. Now, it looks like AMD has something that appears to come close to those levels of performance in applications like Blender and Handbrake. Check out the Handbrake results below. While we were at CES 2017 last week in Las Vegas we heard all sorts of people talking on and off the record about Ryzen. This is our attempt to summarize all that information in a single one-page article. AMD Debuts New X370 and B350 boards New consumer desktop boards featuring  AMD X370 and B350 chipsets with the AMD AM4 CPU Socket that supports Ryzen were finally shown off for the very first time at CES 2017. All of the motherboard manufactures were ecstatic that these boards were finally getting to market. Many of the companies designed this boards months ago, and have just been sitting on it waiting for AMD to finalize Ryzen and get them the hooks and data needed to finalize the UEFI. Despite so much being moved to the CPU we’ve been told that the boards will cost more than we expect by multiple sources at CES as the motherboard makers will try to recuperate the money they have spent on R&D. No one was talking numbers, but multiple sources made it sound like we are spoiled by low cost AMD motherboards right now. For example the ASRock 970A-G/3.1 motherboard came out in February 2016 with support for AMD’s flagship FX-9590 Vishera 8-core 4.7 GHz processor for just $68.99 with free shipping.  This is one of the newest AMD AM3+ boards (released February 2016) with support for AMD FX 9590 & 9370 220W CPUs, DDR3 2400MHz memory, M.2 PCIe Gen2 x 4 (20 Gb/s) and even has USB 3.1 Type-A + Type-C 10 Gb/s ports. Don’t expect to see AMD X370 boards this low at launch. AMD informed us that the AMD X370 will be priced comparable to Intel Z270 boards and the AMD B350 will be priced against Intel B250 boards. Motherboard makers like Gigabyte have 31 different Intel 200 based boards with prices ranging from $69.99 for a B250 board all the way up to $519.99 for a Z270 board. One thing to keep in mind is that Ryzen has 24 PCIe lanes with 16 dedicated to graphics, four for the M.2 PCIe NVMe slot and the final four connect to the chipset. The AMD X370 chipset itself has eight PCIe lanes, so running a multi-GPU configuration (NVIDIA SLI or AMD CrossFire) might be a bit tricky. Motherboard makers  could feature two x8 slots for graphics from the CPU and one x8 slot from the chipset. Depending on the features that motherboard markers want, enabling multi-GPU support in the UEFI may disable some board features. AMD Ryzen might have performance comparable to Broadwell-E, but the number of PCIe lanes might become an issue for some power users. Somewhat Boring DDR4 Performance We’ve run DDR4 memory kits on the new Intel Z270 platform with Kaby Lake processors like the Intel Core i7-7770K processor at speeds of up to 4.0 GHz and we saw companies hitting 4.5 GHz clock speeds on DDR4 memory kits with extreme overclocking techniques. Multiple sources wishing to remain anonymous spoke with us at CES 2017 and said that DDR4 support on Ryzen boards is no where near as good and that now and that DDR4-2400 is a good all around kit for these processors. Overclockers might be able to squeeze out DDR4 3000 MHz on these boards, but that has been tricky on the early pre-production processors.  AMD hasn’t finalized Ryzen processors yet and the UEFI still has many updates coming, but we’ve been told not to hold out breath when it comes to high-speed DDR4 memory kits on these boards. Sources inside AMD are saying that they will launch Ryzen with support above the DDR4 JEDEC standard speeds, but noted that Ryzen has a new memory controller with brand new IP over Bristol Ridge and that they are working on making improvements with regards to DDR4 performance here in the home stretch. USB 3.1 Gen 1 and USB 3.1 Gen 2 Performance is Solid It will be interesting to see how AMD’s inclusion of USB 3.1 into the processor goes as implementing new SATA and USB technologies can be tricky as Intel had a small USB 3.0 bug on Haswell processors back in 2013 and then way back in 2011 there was SATA controller issue on the 6 series chipset that led to a recall of that platform for Sandy Bridge processors. AMD has told us that USB 3.1 performance is spot on and a non-issue on Ryzen. That is a good thing as they have four USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports on the Ryzen CPU itself and then another six USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports, six USB 3.0 ports and two USB 3.1 Gen2 (10Gb/s) ports on the AMD X370 chipset. That means the AMD X370 boards with a Ryzen processor can have up to 20 total USB ports. Our industry sources said that AMD did not include ReDrivers into thier IP, so an actual ReDriver chip will need to be used by motherboard makers for USB type-C support. Ryzen Processors Are Multiplier Unlocked AMD Ryzen processors are all multiplier unlocked as long as the motherboard supports unlocked processors. From what we are hearing AMD X370 &  B350 motherboards will both support CPU Multiplier adjustment and are the enthusaist-class boards you need if you want to overclock. AMD A320 and A300 chipsets do not support overclocking. Ryzen Clock Speeds AMD still hasn’t set clock speeds for Ryzen processors, but most recently have been showing them clocked at 3.4 GHz with no Turbo Boost. Everyone we talked to at CES 2017 gave us different stories on Ryzen clock speeds and we left the show without a good feeling on how they are doing. One informant told us that they are only getting 200-300 MHz over the 3.4 GHz clock speeds on their early pre-production sample processors while others told us they were getting over 5 GHz. So, there isn’t a good consensus on what the clock speeds will other than the fact that we are certain that AMD is trying everything they can to get the highest clock speeds possible. With Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake processors shipping with Turbo Clock speeds of up to 4.5 GHz and overclocking beyond 5 GHz on air it feels like AMD is slightly concerned with the gap in clock speeds. Years ago clock frequency meant everything, but an 8-core 16-thread Ryzen processor doesn’t have to be clocked that high to compete with 4-core 8-thread Kaby Lake processors on multi-threaded applications. Hopefully that message will get out there and our fingers are crossed that single-thread performance isn’t horrible on Ryzen. One not good sign about Ryzen clock speeds is that CyberPowerPC had a Ryzen system on display and the placard showed that the AMD Ryzen processor inside was running at 3.15 GHz, reportedly an early ES part. CyberPowerPC quickly pulled the sign, said it was wrong, and denied to know Ryzen clock speeds. We know that AMD will have multiple Ryzen sku’s, so some might be clocked that low? AMD has since clarified that all 8-Core 16-Thread processors will have at least a base clock of 3.4GHz and that they want to give consumers the best performance per dollar in their return home to the enthusiast space. Ryzen Release Date It appears that AMD might have accidentally posted up the official Ryzen CPU launch date. AMD will be holding a session at annual Game Developer Conference (GDC) in San Francisco on ‘Optimizing for AMD Ryzen CPU’ on a TBD date during the show for the ‘recently-launched’ AMD Ryzen CPU. GDC kicks off on February 27th and runs until March 3rd, so could AMD be launching Ryzen at the start of GDC? AMD has been saying for weeks that Ryzen will be launching in Q1 2017 and this would certainly hit that intended launch date. Our sources are quiet on this one, but it will be interesting to see what happens. We don’t see AMD releasing their most exciting processor in years at an industry event, but we could be very wrong.   Ryzen Pricing AMD told us that Ryzen will be priced below the Intel Core i7-6900K ($1000) and that it won’t be $999. Online rumors have put Ryzen at $350 and several people we spoke with at CES 2017 said that the flagship Ryzen processor will cost less than the Intel Core i7-7700K processor ($349.89 on Amazon) or be right around there depending on how final performance looks. That is exciting news if it does turn out to be true, but is that a good sign of Ryzen performance? The demos that AMD have shown are all on 16-threaded applications with the processor pegged at 100% load or close to it. Hopefully the IPC performance on 4-threads or less is solid. Our guess is that AMD Ryzen will be priced comparable to what Intel has to offer. The AMD X370 motherboards are said to be price comparable to Intel Z270 boards, so were thinking that the Ryzen processors will line up with those associated processors. AMD’s flagship FX-9590 8-core processor costs $199.99 right now, so an upcoming Ryzen 8-core processor at $350 or less doesn’t sound out of the question. At the end of the day we can’t wait to learn more about AMD Ryzen and are extremely excited by the upcoming launch. Seeing AMD show off Ryzen and VEGA in the same system at CES 2017 was a good sign, but both the CPU and GPU were run on development boards. Hopefully, AMD will be showing off final consumer boards the next time we see both! Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

Intel's Pentium-class processors, designed for budget PCs, will get hyper-threading technology that lets them run multiple tasks on a single processor core. Intel's new hyper-threading Pentium CPUs are based on the Kaby Lake architecture, which also powers the latest Core i3, i5, and i7 processors. Intel announced those devices at CES last week, and appears to have quietly added the new Pentiums to its product listings, ExtremeTech reports. The hyper-threading feature was last available in Pentium-class chips with the Pentium 4, which was introduced in 2004. At the time, they were the only processors to feature it; even the first-generation Core processors, introduced in 2006, didn't have it. But as the Pentium brand transitioned to lower-end desktops and laptops and the Core series gained hyper-threading technology, newer Pentiums dropped the feature. Now, all Kaby Lake-based processors will support the technology. Related Intel Unveils Kaby Lake Processor Details Intel Unveils Kaby Lake Processor Details There are five new Pentium processors listed on Intel's product page, from the 2.9 GHz G4560T to the 3.7 GHz G4620. The G4620 is 100MHz faster than its predecessor and offers support for Intel's TSX-NI instructions, Memory Protection Extensions, and Intel's OS Guard platform protection technology, ExtremeTech notes. That signals that Intel intends to offer them to enterprise customers, which hasn't been the target market for Pentium-powered PCs. The addition of the new Pentium chips is the latest step in a gradual Kaby Lake refresh that began in August for notebooks and portables, followed by last week's announcement that extended the lineup to desktops and workstations. Meanwhile, Intel competitor AMD announced its own refreshed processor lineup last month. Called "Ryzen," it will be rolled out gradually over a four-year period.

The Lenovo IdeaCentre Y910 AiO breathes Gaming Performance (including VR-Capability) into the All-in-One category, opening a Pandora box that will never be close from now on. The Lenovo IdeaCentre Y910 AiO should have been called Lenovo Legion Y920 AiO. The thing is: Lenovo went public with this computer before the “Lenovo Legion” gaming brand was made official at CES 2017. Therefore, the closest line of product that it would fit in is the IdeaCentre, which is typically family/productivity oriented. This is not your regular IdeaCentre computer (not that there anything wrong with productivity computers, lol). Display “The display is the computer” – this line which NVIDIA came up with fits the all-in-one category. The Y920 AiO display uses LCD TN technology, which offers some (but not all) benefits of LCD IPS, and historically had the better ratio between price, (image) quality and fast response time. Although IPS LCD have come down in price, this is still true overall. As such, this makes this display an excellent candidate for a gaming computer. Quick display specs: 27” (2560×1440) 144Hz LCD TN with AMD FreeSync support. Monitor-only mode (HDMI-in) 96% RGB gamut, 75% Adobe RGB gamut 340 Nit brightness, 5ms response time 144 FPS games possible at 1080p One thing that some of you may notice is that the display is compatible with AMD FreeSync stutter-free technology, while it may ship with an NVIDIA GPU, which has NVIDIA G-Sync, a similar, but otherwise incompatible technology. Important: The Y920 AiO computers configured with NVIDIA GPUs will not have a stutter-free technology because the screen is only AMD FreeSync compatible. I don’t see a Y910 AiO model with AMD GPU on the Lenovo website at publishing time, but sources tell me that Lenovo should come up with an AMD option at some point. You can visit the official site, or contact Lenovo directly to enquire about “when/where”. In theory, it would be possible to support both G-Sync and FreeSync, because the technologies are very similar. However, my understanding is that this is a licensing (and licensing fee) issue, with NVIDIA being the most expensive option. One possible solution would be to choose the standard at order time, but there won’t be such an option. That aside, the display looks good with a resolution of 2560×1440 and a maximum refresh rate of 144Hz. When we played with it, the image quality was quite good. It’s fair to say that you can find better image quality in PC monitors, but many of those monitors would not be “gaming friendly”, so it’s an important distinction to make. The resolution of 2560×1440 also is a fine choice. On the one hand, the GPU should be fast enough to play many current games at 60FPS at the native resolution. On the other hand, the text and interface are sharp and clear because it is still a high PPI monitor. If you decide to play at 1080p (with scaling), some game can even hit the maximum 144Hz rate. From the front, the monitor bezels seem  thin, and to keep that design element, Lenovo has embedded the Intel Realsense webcam into a retractable chassis. It’s a good idea because the computer is not designed to be super-slim. Intel RealSense webcams are 3D capable, in a similar way that the Xbox Kinect camera is. For everyday usage, Windows 10 Hello can let you log-in using a 3D scan of your face. In the future, I hope that Lenovo would even come up with 30”, 32” or even 34” versions of this computer. Industrial Design The Lenovo Y920 AiO is really unique. It has the aggressive design language of the Legion Y-Series line of laptop and desktop computer, but at the same time, it doesn’t look like anything else. The external surfaces are mostly plastic, but the computer doesn’t feel cheap or fragile. At the same time, I’m glad it doesn’t weigh a ton like some all-steel gaming PC chassis do. On the left of the screen, there’s a retractable headphones holder. This is a very nice touch because I’m currently using a terrible Ikea hack to do this (lol). Just below the screen you will find the Speaker, which is place optimally for single-user situations. In my dreams, there would be an analog volume knob somewhere, but for now you can control the volume with the dedicated keys on the Lenovo Keyboard. Designed for User Upgradability The user upgradability is another unique aspect of the Lenovo Y920 AiO. AiO computers are normally not designed to have users change parts. However, this is a frequent requirement from gaming rigs customers. To reconcile the two, Lenovo has managed to create a design that lets people upgrade the SSD (small PCIe card), HDD (2.5”), Graphics card (GPU) and RAM modules – all without tools. This is great because a computer’s lifecycle can last for some years during which upgrading any of those components can make a huge difference in user experience. People can do that for much lower prices down the road as well. Of course, there are sometimes ways to open an AiO to change parts even if it wasn’t designed for this purpose. However, this may void the warranty, and you may get in troubles if the design uses glue, just to cite the obvious. System configuration CPU: Intel Core i5 and i7 6th Gen As you may expect from a Gaming system, Lenovo allows configurations are going from an Intel Core i5 (i5-6500) to an Intel Core i7 (i7-6700) CPU. Note that the current offerings aren’t using the 7th generation Intel CPUs, but rather a 6th Generation. In reality, it only makes a small difference because the performance jump wasn’t that high, and in the end, the speed/price ratio might even be better that way. That said, I wanted to point this out, just in case. Memory configurations go from 12GB up to 32GB max, which is quite comfortable as a maximum. The system storage is an SSD of 128GB or 256GB while the larger storage is a 1TB to 2TB HDD. Again, both are user-upgradable. GPU: Up to NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 8GB (Desktop Card) While most AiO computers have “mobile” (=slower) GPUs attached to the motherboard, this computer uses a full-on desktop GPU that is completely normal/standard and that you can change. Some cables will simply route the native graphics card connectors to the ones found in the AiO chassis. The GTX 1080 makes this computer “VR Ready”. As we said before, we expect Lenovo to have an AMD model at some point, although “when” isn’t clear and no official information is available at publishing time. You will have to mind the GPU card form-factor because there’s a large variety of them out there with various width and height, but the possibilities offered by this AiO chassis are infinitely higher than other AiOs! We have yet to run some benchmarks on this computer, but we will update this article with them at a later time. For now, the CPU+GPU configuration should give you a rough idea of what to expect, if you compare that with computers running with the same components. The system has a 380W Power supply, and you should also be mindful of this when upgrading the GPU. In general, both AMD and NVIDIA make it easy to have powerful updates within the same thermal and power envelope so that I wouldn’t worry about it. Ports/connectors/inputs: well endowed The Lenovo Y910 has a wealth of ports that easily compare to a desktop computer: 7 USB 3.0 ports and a Killer Ethernet network interface for low-latency gaming. Front Ports Pop-up Hideaway Camera Dual Microphone Rear Ports 4 x USB 2.0 Power AC in RJ45 Ethernet 1x HDMI™-in / 1x HDMI™-out Side Ports 3 x USB 3.0 6-in-1 Card Reader (SD, SDHC, SDXC, MMC, MS, MS-Pro) Head and Microphone Array HDMI™-in Switch Button Optical drive Conclusion: excellent, VR Ready If you are looking for a gaming computer that can keep your desk looking neat at the same time, the Lenovo IdeaCentre Y910 AiO is a very attractive “true” gaming computer that offers a lot of power and upgradability in a chassis that will save space and look neat. While it may not (yet) represent the absolute most powerful gaming rig you can buy, it’s fair to say that the trade-off is completely fair, if not advantageous in terms of speed/chassis volume. Performance comes with heat (and top dollars), and heat needs to be dissipated. That’s why absolute fastest gaming rigs will remain in large water-cooled chassis with multi-GPUs for some time. It’s just physics. In the end, the IdeaCentre Y910 AiO is an AiO without performance compromises and a great computer overall. It creates a brand new market segment that I’m sure others will look at and copy. Starting at $1800, the Core i5/GeForce 1070/12GB RAM/128GB SSD/1TB HDD is shipping now. At $2300 there’s a Core i7/GeForce 1080/16GB RAM/256GB SSD/2TB HDD available too. Filed in Gaming. Read more about all-in-one, CES, CES 2017, gaming pc and Lenovo.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 11, 2017 at 1:03PM Analyst Steve Mullane with BlueFin Research Partners (via Barron's) recently said that microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) chip production during December "indicated no signs of slowing down even through the holiday period." Image source: Intel.  This, the analyst says, "strongly suggests that [Intel] could guide March quarter revenues above the current Wall Street consensus of -7.8%." What Mullane is referring to is the fact that Intel's business largely follows a seasonal pattern in which sales during the first half of the year tend to be weaker than sales during the second half of the year. "Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter," Intel's most recent form 10-K filing reads. Perhaps more interestingly, on Intel's most recent earnings call, the company explicitly said that it expected revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 to be "below the average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter," as the company expected "the worldwide [personal computer] supply chain to reduce their inventory." If Intel's chip production remained steady through December, then -- assuming BlueFin's read on the situation is accurate -- that could bode well for the company's first quarter of 2017 guidance (or as BlueFin refers to it, the March quarter, because it ends in March). Let's examine what could be driving this reportedly unusually strong production. Low expectations + better demand = channel refill? Back on Sept. 16, a month before its earnings release, Intel positively pre-announced its financial results, telling investors that it expected third-quarter sales of $15.6 billion (give or take $300 million), compared to a prior outlook of $14.9 billion (give or take $500 million). When the final numbers came in, the chipmaker didn't disappoint, raking in $15.8 billion in revenue, and delivering strong gross profit margin results, too (64.8% on a non-GAAP basis, against prior guidance of 62% give-or-take a couple percentage points.  At the time, the company said that this was "primarily driven by a replenishment of [personal computer] supply chain inventory." It also said that, "the company is also seeing some signs of improving [personal computer] demand." Intel didn't pre-announce this time around, so unless Intel is sitting on a big financial surprise, I'm not expecting anything out of the ordinary from the company when it reports its fourth-quarter of 2016 results on Jan. 26. Intel may have shipped what it expected to ship during the fourth quarter, but due to strong personal computer sales, Intel's customers found that their inventory levels had been drawn down too much. So, to bring/keep their inventories at appropriate levels, Intel's customers may have gotten more aggressive about their chip orders near the end of the quarter, leading Intel to keep production levels up through December. Put simply, we might be seeing a repeat during the first quarter of 2017 of what led Intel to report better-than-expected revenues for the third quarter of 2016. Could it be the non-PC business? The preceding discussion has focused on personal computer sales, but it's important to keep in mind that Intel sells other processors, too. It sells chips into data center applications -- its second-largest business by revenue -- as well as in Internet of Things applications. However, the kinds of chip volumes that Intel sells into these applications are far smaller than the chip volumes that the company ships into personal computers. The much lower volumes in, say, data center applications can be partially offset by the fact that chip sizes there are generally much larger than they are in personal computers. However, Intel's chip production is primarily dependent on its personal computer chip shipments. Combine that with the fact that Intel's recent business trends have pointed to better-than-expected personal computer chip shipments and worse-than-expected data center chip shipments, and I'm inclined to think that any potential upside that Intel may be experiencing is personal-computer-based. Intel's Internet of Things business, though interesting, just isn't large enough from a unit or revenue perspective -- it generates less than a tenth of what Intel's personal computer chip business does in sales -- for shifts in demand to have a measurable impact on the company's overall chip production levels.

Intel’s Compute Card is as small as a credit card, but, packs everything needed for computing, including the CPU, DRAM, storage, communications and I/O. The first cards are set to be introduced in mid-2017. Computing has become so ubiquitous nowadays that almost every more or less sophisticated piece of hardware has a microprocessor inside. Many such devices are designed to operate for years, but, since computer chips inside them get outdated, it is almost impossible to upgrade their functionality (e.g., add new security capabilities, speed up processing, etc.) without replacing the whole unit, or a significant part of it. Alternatively, if a CPU or a memory IC fails, repair of such a device may cost a lot in terms of money and effort. This translates to downtime and lost revenue. Such things happen because of various reasons, but the main two are proprietary platforms with tight integration and no upgrade path, or complex architectures that do not allow for a quick replacement of faulty components. The list of such devices includes everything from business PCs to point-of-sale kiosks and from smart TVs to commercial equipment. The Intel Compute Card has been designed to be a universal computing platform for different kinds of devices, including those that do not exist yet. The ultimate goal is to simplify the way companies develop equipment, use, maintain, repair, and upgrade it. Creators of actual devices have to design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their product and then choose an Intel Compute Card that meets their requirements in terms of feature-set and price. For example, PC makers could create systems in all-in-one or clamshell form-factors and then use Compute Cards instead of motherboards. For corporate customers that need to provide a lot of flexibility (and, perhaps, solve some security concerns too) - every employee has a card and can switch between PCs. In other markets such as automated retail kiosks, vendors can easily provide upgrades to deliver better functionality as Intel releases new Compute Cards in the future. Intel Compute Card at Glance CPU Various Intel SoCs / SiPs, including Intel Core with vPro (up to 6W TDP) DRAM, NAND Integrated Cooling Fanless, but, I/O docks may have their own thermal design Dimensions 94.5 mm × 55 mm × 5 mm I/O Physical USB-C + Extension Logical USB, PCIe, HDMI, DP and additional signals Wireless Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Docking Integrated locking mechanism Launch Partners Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sharp and local companies Initial Availability Mid-2017 From a technology standpoint, Intel’s Compute Card resembles the company’s Compute Stick PC. However, its purpose is much wider: it is a small device that packs an Intel SoC or SiP (including Kaby Lake-based Core processors with vPro and other technologies), DRAM, NAND flash storage, a wireless module and so on into a small enclosure. Nonetheless, there are a number of important differences between the Compute Card and the Compute Stick. The Compute Card is a sealed system with “flexible I/O” in the form of a USB Type-C and an extension connector. The “flexible I/O” is not Thunderbolt (obviously, due to power consumption concerns), but it handles USB, PCIe, HDMI, DisplayPort connectivity and has some extra pins for future/proprietary use. Intel is currently working with a number of partners to enable the Compute Cards ecosystem. The list of global players includes Dell, HP, Lenovo and Sharp. There are also regional partners interested in the new form-factor, including Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk and Pasuntech. At the moment, Intel and its partners are not discussing their Compute Card-based projects, which is understandable. Moreover, do not expect all these companies to release their Compute Card hardware simultaneously because different equipment has different design and validation cycles. Speaking of the form-factor itself, this is by far not the first form-factor the size of a credit card or something close (e.g., Mobile-ITX, Pico-ITX were announced, but never took off). However, this one seems easy to integrate and it is backed by Intel, which gives it credibility. There are a number of applications (and usage scenarios) that could take advantage of the Compute Card right away (e.g., corporate PCs, smart TVs, digital point-of-sales, emerging devices, etc.). However, there are also many embedded applications that just require uninterrupted operation without any need to upgrade. For those, traditional industrial PCs and boards will continue to be the mainstay, and the credit card form-factor will not bring any clear advantages. The other interesting aspect here is the future of the Compute Stick form factor. Given that the ARM-based HDMI sticks are not a popular form factor any more, it is not surprising that Intel has also not decided to update the Compute Stick lineup with Kaby Lake. Intel indicated that they would be evaluating the future of the Compute Stick in 2018, and decide if it warrants an update with the latest processors at that time. Our opinion is that the Compute Stick form factor has reached the end of its life, and it is for the Compute Card to carry on the miniaturization revolution. The Compute Card has much more flexibility in terms of the differentiation from the vendors' side, and it is not encumbered by an active cooling mechanism. Obviously, the ability to just plug the device into a HDMI port is not there, but, the Compute Card, by itself, is light enough to just hang directly off a display's HDMI port. Therefore, it is possible that some vendors can deliver a Compute Stick-like platform with the Compute Card also (albeit, with a slightly different form factor). We expect to hear more about Compute Card related projects in Q3, either during Computex or Intel's Developer Forum.

Reply ddriver - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link doh, it has video output, do you think it has gpu? disappointing it only has ubs connectivity, some lower level analog and digital i/o would have been nice, and allow to avoid the need for a high end mc for interfacing Reply Yojimbo - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link I looked and couldn't see any mention of a GPU. Of course it's hard to get much technical information from Intel's websites without reading their whitepapers. It could have display logic without any hardware acceleration. Reply ddriver - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link They may have a gpu-less version as well, but from the looks of it, it will have gpu. It has hdmi and dp, and the article mentions intended usage in smart tvs and such. You obviously need graphics for that. All intel chips aside from enterprise products and one poor little atom have graphics. Reply MrSpadge - Thursday, January 12, 2017 - link I don't know of any <6 W TDP Intel CPU which has no GPU integrated. MAybe some ultra small Curie-Chip, but you wouldn't want that to handle rich graphical output anyway.

Reply Vlad_Da_Great - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link For automation/industrial equipment that is great product and will fly out of the shelves. For the consumer products, not at all. Companies want you to buy the whole thing. Imagine if Intel comes with a phone, on which you can change the CPU, Memory and the modem. Apple will lose 1/2 of their value in an instant. Reply ddriver - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link It doesn't look like you can change anything on the card. You could get a new card. But that's no different than getting a new phone...

The technology, which has become one of the hottest trends, helps turn products and services human-like, accomplishing computational tasks that were either previously impossible or took far too long. But underneath the AI lays less flashy, yet equally crucial infrastructure that makes everything tick. It’s why computer vision and natural language model companies like Mighty AI are becoming more and more important — and also why investors like Intel, Accenture, and Google just put their money behind the Seattle startup.

Previous investors like Foundry Group, Madrona Venture Group, and New Enterprise Associates (NEA) also participated; total funding in Spare5 is now $27 million. Mighty AI originally launched in 2014 as Spare5, debuting an app that enables everyday people to perform short tasks on their smartphone — like photo tagging, price guessing, and sentiment analysis of text —  in exchange for payment. Then late last year, the startup narrowed its focus on what it calls “Training Data as a Service,” as CEO and co-founder Matt Bencke told GeekWire. The service provides the human insights AI engines need to “think” like people and helps companies across a variety of industries scale their computer vision and natural language models. Mighty AI, the first spin-out from Madrona Venture Labs, is essentially making artificial intelligence more intelligent by using human labor to re-tune those models. Bencke said his team is solving a “big data problem” at enterprise scale by turning “blank slates into simulations of human knowledge,” as the company describes. An example of Mighty AI helping identify objects in a photo and training computer vision models. Photo via Mighty AI. Now Spare5 is having a re-launch of sorts with a new name and a more focused product. Bencke was careful not to call the strategic change a “pivot,” but more doubling down on an opportunity. “Everybody knows AI is probably the biggest wave in technology innovation right now,” explained Bencke, formerly a senior vice president at Getty Images. “Yet there is a lot of anticipation and frustration about seeing it applied successfully across a number of specific use cases. I think our investors are looking at us as providing picks and shovels to the AI goldrush. No one knows exactly where the gold is, but everyone knows you need picks and shovels.” Bencke added that if AI engines don’t have good training data, then you “basically have a really expensive data science team.” He said the AI models need to understand how humans think; Mighty AI provides this via its community of “Fives,” the human users who get paid by the company to perform short tasks that improves training data. “Training data isn’t the sexiest part of AI,” Bencke said. “But it is vital.”  Personal digital assistants like Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri, for example, have the benefit of using conversations with users to improve their data sets. But other applications that aren’t consistently interacting with end users don’t have this benefit — that’s where Mighty AI comes in with help. “A computer is only as smart as the people who train it or teach it,” Bencke said. One customer is GumGum, a computer vision company that sells advertising and visual intelligence solutions for brands and publishers. GumGum uses Mighty AI to help advertisers understand the context of where their advertisement will be placed, either on websites or social media. “They need to train their computer vision models to recognize logos in all kinds of different context,” Bencke noted. Mighty AI, which has also developed its own AI technologies to help improve the quality of the “Fives” community, does have competition in the form of services like Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower, but Bencke said those require more management from employees. “We are agnostic about domains,” Bencke added. “We are just trying very hard to abstract human knowledge and make it available to our customers on demand.” As a result of the funding, Mighty AI will partner with Intel and Accenture, who will promote and sell the company’s training data services to customers worldwide. Ken Elefant, managing director at Intel Capital, told GeekWire that Intel sees AI as the “next major turning point in human history” with applications like automated driving, robotics, healthcare, and IoT. Elefant said Mighty AI has the best CEO and team compared to other competitors.  We are just trying very hard to abstract human knowledge and make it available to our customers on demand. “Unlike other traditional business outsourcing or crowdsourcing sources, Mighty AI can provide high quality, domain specific, on-demand data annotation, gathered via a community of thousands of experts,” he said. The 30-person company, named a Seattle 10 startup in 2015, will use the fresh funding to grow its team and build out its platform. Bencke called the new investor group a “dream team of strategic partners who are also investing.” Along with Bencke, the Mighty AI leadership team is impressive. CTO Daryn Nakhuda is a former CTO at TeachStreet and Director of Engineer at Porch; Patrick O’Donnell co-founded Urbanspoon; and Matt Shobe helped start of Feedburner. Robin Murdoch, a global managing director at Accenture, called Mighty AI “a leader in the critical area of training data.” “It’s an area that is particularly challenging for our clients, and their technology will help us develop and implement AI solutions that help our clients’ businesses compete more effectively,” he said. Mighty AI is one of many new AI/machine learning startups in Seattle, which is becoming somewhat of an epicenter for companies developing technologies related to machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, algorithms, data analytics, and more.

Matching the gross one-sidedness of her Washington Post (WaPo) employer, Kathleen Parker’s January 6 essay «If Obama Is a Muslim, Is Trump a Russian Spy?», overlooks some damning points running counter to her faulty slant. Donald Trump has taken back his comments that questioned whether Barack Obama is American born. For its part, The WaPo continues to denigrate Russia in a factually challenged manner. (The use of the crank Propornot website and the false claim of a Russian hacking of the Vermont power grid being prime examples, along with continuous top heavy anti-Russian op-ed pieces and news reports.) Parker suggests a double standard favoring Muslim bashing over her presented claim of Russian mischief against the US. She describes Russia as an «enemy». Her overlooked hypocrisy concerns the select outrage over anti-Muslim stances (real and hyped), while being soft on the frequent instances of bias against pro-Russian advocacy. Lacking specifics, Parker’s «proof» against Russia is the faith based US Intel report, which unlike her doesn’t refer to Russia as an «enemy», while claiming a concerted Vladimir Putin approved Russian government effort to support Trump by defaming Hillary Clinton. Regarding that report, the mind reading point about the Russian government and Russia’s mass media preferring Trump over Clinton is in the no kidding and so what category. Trump has openly sought better US relations with Russia, as Clinton was the preferred choice of the anti-Russian neocons. The January 8 exchange between Fox News host Chris Wallace and Trump’s Chief-of-Staff Reince Priebus included the latter saying in the beginning that «he thinks» that Trump accepts the claim of Russian hacking of Democratic Party emails. Wallace’s persistent questioning led Priebus to change course later on in the discussion, saying that the president-elect accepted the Intel take of Russian hacking. In any event, Trump (for now) doesn’t seem to believe that this matter should cloud the effort to improve US-Russian relations. There’s a difference between hacking from the Russian government and Russian hackers who hack en masse, independent of the Kremlin. For several years, there’ve been reports of hacking from Russia, the US and elsewhere against ordinary Americans and others throughout the world. Ideally, there should be conclusive proof that the Russian government used a third party to advance their purported cause, as has been suggested in some circles. With confidentiality respected, a CNN host privately asked how I could consider Julian Assange’s take over US Intel? For the record, I didn’t specifically say such. Is Assange less biased than the Democratic Party utilized CrowdStrike, that has also essentially been used to promote negativity towards the counter-Euromaidan rebels in Ukraine? CrowdStrike has ties to the Atlantic Council – a group that has been overly partisan against Russia. I’m not alone in believing that the trustworthiness of US Intel is compromised by its politicized element and a past that has been found to not always be honest. This politicization was noted last week by Fox news host Brett Baier, who said that Trump’s criticism of Intel has been misrepresented. Opposing politically driven and questionable Intel claims doesn’t necessarily belittle the need for accurate Intel and recognizing that not everyone associated with that grouping has the faulty slants of John Brennan, James Clapper, Malcolm Nance and Michael Hayden. (Nance and Hayden are former US Intel personnel, who’re frequent US mass media talking heads.) There’s ample reason to seriously question if the released Democratic party emails (however done) made a difference in the outcome of the 2016 US presidential result. To date, I’m unaware of any poll revealing that the released Democratic Party emails had significantly changed the outcome of that vote. The Democratic Party should be faulted for having a lax cyber security regimen, along with saying some ethically challenging things. Not to be overlooked are the numerous instances of US government meddling in the elections of other countries  and the reality of major powers (perceived allies and otherwise) spying on each other. On January 3, there were two segments featuring different perspectives on the released Democratic Party emails in question. Fox News’ Sean Hannity, had a lengthy one on one with Assange, that brought up the criminal charges made against the WikiLeaks founder. The PBS NewsHour segment with CIA Director John Brennan, included this quote from him: «We see what he has done in places like Crimea and Ukraine and in Syria. he tends to flex muscles, not just on himself, but also in terms of Russia’s military capabilities. He plays by his own rules in terms of what it is that he does in some of these theaters of conflict. So I don’t think we underestimated him. He has sought to advance Russia’s interests in areas where there have been political vacuums and conflicts. But he doesn’t ascribe to the same types of rules that we do, for example, in law of armed conflict. What the Russians have done in Syria in terms of some of the scorched-earth policy that they have pursued that have led to devastation and thousands upon thousands of innocent deaths, that’s not something that the United States would ever do in any of these military conflicts». Own rules as in what Turkey has done in northern Cyprus and the Clinton led NATO in Kosovo? It was a shameful example of journalism on the part of PBS to let Brennan’s comments go unchallenged. PBS had earlier run a pro-CrowdStrike feature. It’s not as if there aren’t any expert cyber security/ intelligence sources offering a different perspective. As for the devastation of thousands of civilians during war (raised by Brennan), consider some past US actions like what happened in Japan during WW II, the Cold War activity in Southeast Asia, as well as post-Cold War actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. The collateral damage emphasis has been hypocritically applied. Along with the subjectively dubious comments of Hayden and Nance, the above excerpted comments from Brennan are indicative of a (past and present) politicized element within US Intel. Among Russia friendly circles, some kudos has been given to Fox News‘ Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Like their employer, these two individuals have a preference for Trump over the Democrats. However, like many pro-Trump sources, Hannity and Carlson maintain some of the anti-Russian biases, as The WaPo and some others speak of a possible unknown money trail linking Trump to Russia. Trump has had known business interests involving China and some predominately Muslim countries. That aspect hasn’t prevented him from saying things that aren’t favored in these countries. There’re other Americans besides Trump who favor improved US-Russian relations in opposition to the neocon/neolib preference. Pat Buchanan serves as an example of an anti-Communist patriotic American, who second guesses the negative image of Putin and Russia. There’s also the community of anti-Communist White Russians in the US and elsewhere, which have a good number opposed to the current hostility towards Russia. From a more left leaning perspective, Stephen Cohen and some lessor known individuals aren’t anti-American in believing that the US (from its interests) shouldn’t be so antagonistic towards Russia. American foreign policy realists include disagreement with the need for having unfriendly US-Russian relations. An example of the ongoing bias is the obligatory «Putin is a thug» disclaimer frequently bandied about. As has been confidentially acknowledged to me, some well meaning folks do this as a means to soften criticism against their commentary, which otherwise goes against the neocon/neolib slant. Talk about «self-censorship». From a distance, Putin (IMO) doesn’t come across as being more mean spirited than Clinton, John McCain and some others who disparage him. With the pro-Trump/anti-Russian leaning people in mind, was Trump elected for being a nice guy? The personal insults against Putin are hypocritically petty. Upon a reasonable objective and comprehensive overview, the litany of negative claims against him are quite suspect. Yet, they keep getting uncritically rehashed in a way that exhibits a lack of diversity in US mass media and body politic. Short of providing greater attention to the likes of Lindsey Graham and McCain, the provocative name calling and other forms of posturing against Putin/Russia haven’t worked. It’s not in America’s best interests to use Russia as a political football to get at Trump and cater to anti-Russian advocacy. Trump should be accorded the opportunity to pursue better US-Russian relations. My last Strategic Culture Foundation article of January 1, counters the presentation of Obama and his predecessors (Bill Clinton and GW Bush) seeking to pursue that endeavor.

Intel's Joule 570x and 550x are powerful computer boards that can be built as a PC, or be used to build robots, drones, or smart devices. But Intel is now seeking government certification so the boards can be cleared for shipment in those countries. Joule shipments have currently been blocked in a number of countries, including Taiwan, Japan, and Israel, all of which have active technology markets where hobbyists design hardware. Users that have ordered Joule boards from retailers abroad can't receive shipments in the blocked countries. China is not listed on the page describing the blocked shipments, and Intel can ship and sell the device in Hong Kong. Intel is currently going through the certification process in blocked countries, which may take some time. The Joule boards are on sale in countries like U.S. and Canada, where the certification process was quick. Device makers have to get certifications from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and other regulatory agencies before putting hardware on sale. Some of the certifications depend on the communications technologies and materials used to make the board. Intel couldn't provide a specific date on when Joule shipments will start in other countries. However, as the boards are certified in countries, shipments will start. Intel will keep its website updated to signify where the Joule boards are available, a company spokesman said. Joule is similar to the Raspberry Pi 3 and targeted at hobbyists and device makers, but it is more powerful. It also has features not found on Raspberry Pi 3 like 4K video and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. The boards are based on Atom x86 processors. The first Joule to go on sale was the 570x, back in August. It is priced at US $219 on Mouser. Recently, the 550x went on sale for $179. The boards can also be bought with development kits, but that costs more. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

PrintCommentRecommend (-) By Abhinav Davuluri | 01-11-17 | 06:00 AM | Email Article We came away from CES 2017 with greater confidence in the prospects for key technology players such as  Intel ,  Qualcomm , and  Nvidia . Pre-eminent trends--including 5G, artificial intelligence/deep learning, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality—that have been exhaustively discussed in theory in recent years were on full display across the premier electronics trade show. We believe investors should not view these burgeoning trends in isolation, but rather as an interconnected tapestry intricately woven with key elements from a host of firms. Given Intel’s expertise in high-powered computing, Qualcomm’s connectivity and mobile chip leadership, and Nvidia’s versatile graphics processing units, we expect all three to benefit immensely from these opportunities. We are maintaining our fair value estimates and moat ratings for these companies. We continue to view the shares of Qualcomm as having an adequate margin of safety, while Nvidia and Intel appear overvalued, albeit to varying degrees. About the Author Abhinav Davuluri is an equity analyst for Morningstar. Contact Author | Meet other investing specialists At a high level, new applications such as autonomous driving have a long list of requirements that can vary from high-powered and energy-efficient chips to overarching regulatory and infrastructure upheavals. As automated vehicles will generate and take in enormous amounts of data to navigate and react instantaneously to abrupt deviations, a futuristic network (5G) that can deliver faster speeds, ultra-low latency, vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity, and reliability is of the utmost importance. Meanwhile, the components in the vehicle itself also must be fit for the task, ranging from basic sensors that identify surroundings to advanced processors capable of almost instantaneously crunching mission-critical data to safely drive a vehicle without human intervention. The data center will also play a pivotal role in this ambitious pursuit. The computational power required to create, simulate, and train self-driving algorithms can only be found in servers accessed by vehicles via the cloud. We believe a successful autonomous vehicle will be the product of an ecosystem of partnerships among an army of firms. Noteworthy announcements from Intel at CES 2017 included a new 5G modem, an automated driving platform called Intel GO, and the expectation of having 40 autonomous test vehicles on the road by the end of 2017 via a partnership with BMW and Mobileye . Intel also agreed to purchase a 15% ownership stake in Here, a global provider of digital maps and location-based services. Strategically, we think this is a prudent move, as location data is a critical component in achieving fully autonomous vehicles. The firm also held a virtual reality news conference, with each participant given an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset powered by a seventh-generation Intel core processor-based PC. We came away impressed by the various VR examples, including a look at a live NCAA basketball game from a courtside vantage point via Voke VR and a live industrial inspection of a solar power plant via a drone. Cumulatively, these products and endeavors show how Intel continues to distance itself from the traditional PC market. Our wide economic moat rating stems from the firm’s scale and ability to invest heavily in developing and making processors, regardless of application. By continuing to diversify, Intel is positioning itself to be instrumental in the success of whatever growth vector proliferates the most, in our view. Qualcomm also provided a host of updates on its contributions to the aforementioned trends. The firm noted a collaboration with Ericsson and AT&T on radio trials for the second half of 2017, intended to accelerate the deployment of 5G. Qualcomm also announced its inclusion in a consortium of telecom and automotive companies to carry out trials for vehicle-to-everything communication. This primarily focuses on vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure, vehicle-to-pedestrian, and vehicle-to-network communications. These developments will form the foundation for 5G and autonomous vehicles, and we expect Qualcomm to leverage these roles into meaningful licensing revenue related to 5G connected devices and chip sales primarily from modem processors. The firm’s incremental progress into cars was bolstered by the integration of Qualcomm chipsets into next-generation Volkswagen vehicles, a new in-vehicle infotainment system being developed with Panasonic, and a new modem tailored to connected cars. We think Qualcomm is appropriately shifting its focus toward more promising avenues of growth as it looks to mitigate its reliance on the smartphone space. We expect the impending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors will augment this undertaking. We reiterate our narrow moat rating for Qualcomm, stemming from intangible assets related to the firm’s CDMA technology patents. Qualcomm continues to innovate on the mobile chip side, introducing its latest Snapdragon processor, the 835, built on Samsung’s 10-nanometer process technology. It is speculated the chip will be featured in the Samsung Galaxy S8. The 835 was designed to support a bevy of devices including virtual reality/augmented reality head-mounted displays, tablets, and mobile PCs. We note process specifications indicate the central processing unit in the 835 is a semicustom architecture, in contrast to the fully custom predecessor 820. When we asked why this was the case, Qualcomm representatives said the strategy was consistent with efforts to cut back research and development spending in mobile chip design, while redeploying the investment capital in other areas such as the Centriq 2400 server chip, which is currently sampling at customers. While we view this move as prudent for Qualcomm’s overall business, we think it also provides second-tier mobile chip competitors such as MediaTek a chance to catch up to Qualcomm. Nvidia’s presence at CES 2017 was balanced between its leading gaming GPUs as well as its well-publicized products tailored to autonomous driving. Nvidia unveiled the GeForce NOW service, which delivers high-performance PC gaming via the cloud using a pay-by-play model. We think this service was inevitable, but we are concerned it will cannibalize Nvidia’s high-end GPU sales, as the GeForce NOW can be used on computers without Nvidia GPUs. Nvidia also reignited its decade-long partnership with Audi, announcing a goal to put self-driving cars on the road by 2020. The graphics leader noted two developments related to mapping for cars: an extension of its existing collaboration with Here and a new partnership with Zenrin, Japan’s leading mapping company. The firm’s Drive PX 2 platform for autonomous driving has gained significant traction in the development of self-driving vehicles, but we expect competition to increase materially. Between Qualcomm-NXP and Intel-Mobileye, we think Nvidia will find it difficult to maintain its current leadership position. Our no-moat rating stems from the fact that gaming GPUs dominate total revenue for the firm and our view that the longevity of Nvidia’s competitive edge in the space is far from guaranteed. With the shares priced as if Nvidia will dominate the self-driving market in the automotive industry, we continue to view the firm as considerably overvalued.

Intel vs. Modesetting X.Org DDX Performance Impact Written by Michael Larabel in Display Drivers on 11 January 2017. Page 1 of 4. 27 Comments With word of Fedora switching away from using the Intel X.Org driver in favor of the generic xf86-video-modesetting driver, following in the steps laid by Debian/Ubuntu, there is fresh discussions over features and any performance impact of xf86-video-modesetting vs. xf86-video-intel DDX drivers. As such, here are some fresh 2D and 3D benchmarks. For those curious about the current xf86-video-intel vs. xf86-video-modesetting performance differences, from a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon with Core i7 5600U Broadwell CPU (GT2 graphics). Various OpenGL and 2D benchmarks were run via the Phoronix Test Suite. Atop Ubuntu 16.10, the system was upgraded to Mesa 17.0-devel, xf86-video-intel 2.99.917 Git, xf86-video-modesetting 1.18.4 with X.Org Server 1.18.4, and the Linux 4.10 kernel. While the default behavior has changed for Ubuntu/Debian and with Fedora 26, you can still load your own modesetting/intel DDX driver preference via the xorg.conf/xorg.conf.d and that's how this testing was facilitated.

Almost every traditional desktop or laptop PC runs on the Santa Clara company’s processors, but that tradition is fast being eroded by more mobile, ARM-powered alternatives. Apple’s most important personal computers now run iOS, Google’s flagship Chromebook has an ARM flavor, and Microsoft just announced Windows for ARM. And what’s more, the burden of processing tasks is shifting away from the personal device and distributed out to networks of server farms up in the proverbial cloud, leaving Intel with a big portfolio of chips and no obvious customer to sell millions of them to. If you want to talk about the most influential chip company in history, Intel’s name is the one you want. But the most influential for the future? That’s a much more open question. AMD (blue) and Nvidia (green) stock prices over the past year Yahoo! Finance During the course of 2016, Nvidia and AMD saw their stock prices skyrocket. Both companies are now trading at multiple times their value from a year ago, and the explanation lies in their massively expanded potential for future growth. All the AI hype that we heard during CES this past week is underpinned by a multitude of algorithms and mathematical calculations, and in its most sophisticated form it harnesses methods of machine learning and deep learning to evolve its awareness without being fed answers directly by a human. All of that new technology requires a lot of processing power, and it just so happens that AMD and Nvidia were already making the perfect processors for the task: graphics cards. GPUs, or graphics processing units, can be thought of as a specialized breed of the CPUs that Intel dominates in. Unlike central processing units, however, graphics chips are less versatile in the tasks they can perform and are best suited to running a ton of parallelized workloads. They don’t have four or eight cores, they have hundreds and thousands, and each of them is frightfully efficient at handling some small recurring tasks over and over again. GPU acceleration has fast become the standard for machine learning, and this year Google’s Cloud Platform will be powered by AMD’s FirePro server GPUs. It’s not that Intel is oblivious to the expanding market being created by the move toward machine learning — the company has an entire aspirational website dedicated to the subject — but its chips are at a fundamental disadvantage and it hasn’t secured the customers or made the same sort of progress that its rivals already have. Radeon Instinct GPUs (click image to expand) AMD AMD now has an entire line of GPUs dedicated to accelerating machine learning, which has been branded as Radeon Instinct. Every single trending thing in tech can benefit from these new cards: from autonomous vehicles, self-piloting drones, and personal robots to fintech, nanobots, and advanced medicine. Investors are buying up AMD stock because they know the processing challenges of the future are practically tailored for the massively parallel architecture of a GPU — and AMD has some really good GPUs. GPU server farms are going to be as significant to our future as ocean-floor cables are to our present Nvidia’s rise is also no surprise. The green graphics giant has been talking about deep learning and autonomous cars for at least three years at CES. It was bemusing at first, intriguing after a while, and now it’s turning into real-world self-driving vehicles thanks to a partnership with Audi. At the same time as Google and AMD were announcing their 2017 plans for Radeon-driven machine learning in the cloud, Nvidia and IBM revealed their own agreement to provide "the world’s fastest" deep learning enterprise solution. These deals might not be rich on hype, but one day soon they’re going to be as significant as the ocean-floor cables keeping the internet connected today. If I had money to invest, I'd buy as much $NVDA as possible pic.twitter.com/0h2aO6v9gh— Darshan Shankar (@DShankar) January 5, 2017 The next time a company offers you a cloud-based service of any kind — such as Google’s system for handwriting recognition in the new Chromebooks — odds are good that there’ll be a GPU farm somewhere churning through the mathematical tasks of making it happen. As AI and VR grow, so will graphics card sales More in line with their traditional businesses, AMD and Nvidia both stand to benefit from the growing consumer interest in virtual reality. The two most promising solutions, the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, both require a reasonably beefy PC spec, replete with a modern and powerful graphics, so the more people buy into VR, the more GPUs each company is likely to sell. But the most interesting dynamic that’s developed over the past year is how, ever so subtly and behind the scenes, AMD and Nvidia have essentially stolen Intel’s future away from it. Intel exists to satisfy our processing needs, but just as we discover a rich new vein of computational power needs, it turns out that Intel’s CPUs have already been surpassed by the basic architectural advantages of chips that were originally designed to push pixelated shoot-em-up targets around a monitor. It’s a fun twist of fate for everyone outside Intel, and the good execution exhibited by both AMD and Nvidia so far also portends well for the speed of improvement in AI and machine learning capabilities. At a time when Intel is still scrambling to find mega-tasking scenarios for its chips, its GPU rivals are more concerned with how fast they can churn out the hardware to satisfy demand that looks set to only continue growing.

A swath of AM4 motherboards and impressive demos—it may be time to get excited. Mark Walton (UK) - Jan 11, 2017 1:54 pm UTC Enlarge Mark Walton reader comments 237 Share this story During AMD's "New Horizons" live stream, which served as a coming out party for the Ryzen CPU, the company showcased a brand new performance demo. It pitched a stock Intel Core i7 6900K processor—an eight-core Broadwell-E chip that retails for just shy of £1,000/$1,100—against an eight-core Ryzen CPU. Both chips were tasked with transcoding a short video clip into the "Apple TV 3" preset in Handbrake, a notoriously CPU-heavy workload that scales well across several cores. The result, according to AMD's demo, was a completion time of 54 seconds for Ryzen and 59 seconds for Broadwell-E; Ryzen was about 10 percent faster. But the real kicker was that while the Broadwell-E chip ran with its standard boost enabled (up to 3.7GHz), the Ryzen chip was locked at its base clock of 3.4GHz. Not only did AMD claim to have caught up with Intel's multithreaded performance, it claimed to have surpassed it—and with TDP of just 95W compared to Intel's 140W. Further ReadingAMD’s Zen CPU is now called Ryzen Naturally, the Internet cried foul. Flick through the various subreddits dedicated to Zen, AMD, and Intel, and you'll find all manner of conspiracy theories about how AMD artificially capped performance on the 6900K by using a sub-par air cooler (it used the Intel-recommended part), or how there were differences in the video files used in the demo. Not all of these criticisms are without merit, of course. For example, it's not clear whether the Intel chip could have reached its full boost with all cores under heavy load. Or why not just lock the Intel chip at 3.4GHz for a straight IPC (instructions-per-clock) comparison? AMD demos Ryzen in a Handbrake test against Intel's i7-6900K. Despite these concerns, AMD has shown enough of Ryzen to make it an exciting product. For the last five or so years, Intel has remained unchallenged in just about every segment of the PC market, and improvements over time have slowed to a crawl. Its latest chip, the Kaby Lake i7-7700K is an incredibly marginal upgrade over its Skylake predecessor. Even a six-year-old Sandy Bridge i7-2600K can still hold its own when overclocked. Ryzen might just be the kick in the butt that the market needs—and thus, AMD is now working as hard as possible to convince the sceptical masses that Ryzen is more than just a tech demo, that Ryzen is a real product that will be on shelves before the end of March 2017. Motherboards galore To that end, AMD wheeled out its motherboard partners at CES, along with 16 of the 50 or so products that will launch alongside Ryzen. All the usual suspects are present and correct, including heavy hitters like Asus, MSI, and Gigabyte. What's most notable about the lineup is just how varied it is. AMD suffered from a lack of support with its AM3 chipset, resulting in a monolithic product line. AM4 changes that. For enthusiasts, there's X370, which brings together dual-channel DDR4, Radeon Crossfire, and Nvidia SLI support (yes, these boards are SLI certified), multiple SATA and M.2 slots, native USB 3.1 Gen 2, overclocking support, and the styling (read: gaudy l33t gamer) and build quality typical of premium motherboards. Further ReadingBad news, rich people: You won’t be able to use your GTX 1080 in 4-way SLIThe only nitpick with X370 is that it has only eight PCIe lanes of its own. Coupled with the 24 PCIe lanes of Ryzen—16 for graphics, four for NVMe, and four to communicate with the chipset—users have 32 lanes to work with. That's comparable with Intel's mainstream chips but lacking compared to Broadwell-E. Crossfire and SLI certainly aren't as appealing as they used to be (and if Nvidia's recent moves are anything to go by, SLI isn't long for this world), but the rapid proliferation of PCIe-based storage means PCIe lanes are quickly becoming a prized commodity. Enlarge / Chipset features. Enlarge / Ryzen processor features. A step down from X370 is B350, which also supports overclocking but drops some USB and SATA ports, two PCIe lanes, and Crossfire/SLI support. A320 drops even more USB and SATA ports, another two PCIe lanes, and overclocking support. Expect the latter to be priced very reasonably indeed. Perhaps most interesting, though, is the X300 chipset. This is a chipset designed explicitly for mini-ITX motherboards. After the longest time, AMD's high-end chips will find a home in small form factor PCs—and with just a 95W TDP, an eight-core Ryzen will make for an imposing SFF workstation and gaming rig. With X300, AMD has ditched all motherboard-based IO, leaving just the USB, SATA, and 24 PCIe lanes that are part of the Ryzen core. Curiously, the 4 PCIe lanes a Ryzen chip would typically use to communicate with the motherboard I/O can be repurposed by motherboard makers to add an extra M.2 slot or more SATA ports. Intel uses PCIe, too, but via a proprietary DMI interface (AMD uses SMI) that can't be accessed by motherboard makers. AMD has an impressive product stack with AM4, but more than that it shows just how invested in Ryzen the industry is. With the lacklustre Bulldozer architecture, high-end AMD chipsets were thin on the ground. Now, there are multiple chipsets, premium features and designs, and support from the biggest players in the industry. Cooling companies like Noctua have even pledged to send out new mounting brackets (AM4 is slightly wider than AM3) for free to anyone with a Ryzen receipt. AMD might not have revealed the product SKUs or the boost clocks of Ryzen itself, but there's no doubt that the ecosystem surrounding it is ready for launch. Enlarge / A selection of AM4 motherboards on show at CES. Mark Walton That said, AMD has promised that all Ryzen chips—whether that's the octa-core used in its demos or the rumoured hexa- and quad-core parts—are multiplier unlocked for overclocking, which is another departure from the mostly locked chips from Intel. The only limiting factor is the chipset. Even then, there may be performance boosts on offer for those with exotic cooling as part of its "Extended Frequency Range" (XFR) feature. "A lot of processors have pre-programmed clock speed voltage tables," explained AMD's Robert Hallock at CES. "We don't. This is very algorithmic. We analyse power consumption limits, thermal limits, silicon utilisation limits, and out of that boundary, if none of those limits are being met, you can just keep raising clock speed until one of them is. Then you level off the boost and then try to sustain it as long as possible. The system is smart enough to know what's going on inside itself, and adaptive enough to prevent sudden drops in clock speeds." Time for a change What's most impressive, though, is just how quick AMD has been to respond to critics. When commenters worried that Ryzen might bottleneck high-end graphics card performance like AMD's older CPUs, the company showed a demo of Ryzen running Battlefield 1 on an Nvidia Titan X Pascal, with a frame rate identical to that of a stock i7-6900K system with its own Titan X. When commenters asked what the value of an eight-core system would be compared to a quad, AMD showed how it would enable gamers to play a game like Dota 2 and stream it to Twitch simultaneously at the highest settings with even less dropped frames and delay than an i7-6900K (a feat AMD says is down to its more efficient inter-core communication). I tried those demos myself at CES, and it's hard to not be impressed. Until Ryzen lands in the hands of reviewers and the public, though, we should take everything with a large pinch of salt and a donning of the great scepticism hat. After all, this is a company that has a vast history of over promising and under delivering. Enlarge / AMD gave press hands on with its Battlefield 1 Ryzen cs. Broadwell-E comparison at CES. But there's a confidence around Ryzen that's been missing from AMD's CPU division for the longest time. Having seen Ryzen in action and just how hard AMD is working to make it a success, I'm hopeful that it will go some way towards helping the company's shaky financials from the past few years and that AMD might finally have a chip that moves desktop CPU performance forward. Further ReadingThe desktop CPU isn’t dead, it just needs a swift kick in the butt Assuming Ryzen's performance really is that good, the big question is: how far will AMD go down the price/performance rabbit hole? At CES, the company openly asked journalists what it should be priced at. Price an eight-core Ryzen at around £400/$500 and you bring down the cost of eight-core chips to that of a six-core—a solid move for consumers, but not one that will greatly affect mainstream performance. Price it the same as a quad-core i7-7700K—about £300/$330—and you dramatically shake up the industry. The decision is yet to be made. "There are a lot of discussions going on," says Hallock. "We're capturing the feedback. We wanna take share, we wanna be the best price/performance option, we wanna be the first on people's minds. That's part of the bounding box for pricing discussions as well as paying off the R&D investment... We're looking at what Intel does—and we're not gonna do that. We think people want the choice, and need the choice. The market needs the choice—hopefully we can turn it around."

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU News 6 Kaby Lake Pentium chips listed on Intel's ARK by Mark Tyson on 11 January 2017, 10:01 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qaddab Add to My Vault: Intel has quietly released information about its more affordable Kaby Lake desktop chips; the Pentium range. With its seventh generation designs Intel has mixed things around a bit. Previously modern Pentium chips didn't offer HT (Hyper Threading) but now they are all 2C/4T designs, with all the benefits that brings. However, another range-wide change won't be so welcome - the removal of support for ECC RAM. You can read up on the five new HT enabled Pentium chips direct on Intel's ARK site: Pentium G4560 Pentium G4560T Pentium G4600 Pentium G4600T Pentium G4620 The above Pentiums might now feature HT but, in general throughout the range, have the following disadvantages compared to a Core i3 counterpart; lower base clock speeds, 3MB rather than 4MB of cache, lack of AVX2 instruction set support, greater power consumption, lower spec HD graphics, and lack of ECC RAM support. The lack of ECC RAM support in the new Pentiums could annoy some who have previously bought/created servers or NAS boxes using these cheaper processors. Of course the other differentiator between Pentium and Core i3 is the price. There is a $50 to $60 uplift in RRP for a corresponding i3 chip. Intel Core i3-7350K Processor Review On the topic of lower end Intel chips, we previously reported on an overclockable Kaby Lake Core i3 chip dubbed the Core i3-7350K. That interesting new i3 has recently been through the Legit Reviews labs. Priced at $168, the unlocked i3 processor on the test bench easily overclocked from its base freq of 4.2GHz to 5.1GHz by tweaking the multiplier and voltage. On lightly threaded tasks the i3-7350K could be a winner, reckoned the Legit guys in the review conclusion.

The Intel Pentium N3700 is a quad core chip for mobile use… They really should have stuck with Atom for low power, low spec mobile chips… Its become impossible to just buy a chip based on numbers without researching which core type they are using (and benchmarks) to actually know what you are getting nowadays. I miss the days where atom meant mobile, celeron, pentium, core where desktop with varying levels of performance. To be fair, model numbers from almost every tech manufacturer has been a complete mess for years and really are not indicative of their performance. My main problem with Intel at the moment is how the features within a range keeps changing….like this with the HT/ECC, we now have Xeons and desktop CPUs on the same socket that requires different chipsets…..like Intel hadn't made motherboard/cpu pairings restrictive enough already…… Posted by cheesemp - Wed 11 Jan 2017 13:57 shaithis To be fair, model numbers from almost every tech manufacturer has been a complete mess for years and really are not indicative of their performance. To be honest it's not a good excuse is it. It can't be that hard to have a model for cheap mobile, expensive mobile, cheap desktop, expensive desktop (and maybe mid level?), a generation and then a performance number?

The range-topping Core i7-7700K isn't massively quicker than 2015's Core i7-6700K, and given the familiarity of the refreshed Z270 chipset, we imagine enthusiasts won't be rushing out to upgrade. We're intrigued to see whether or not AMD's Ryzen can put a cat among Intel's pigeons, but while Kaby Lake may have failed to get our hearts racing, there's no getting around the facts: Core i7-7700K is the fastest quad-core processor available today, making it a prime choice for a new PC in 2017. Furthermore, there's greater overclocking headroom than previous-generation parts, and that plays right into the hands of specialist system integrators seeking to put forth gaming rigs configured at dizzying speeds. Bolton-based Scan Computers is quick off the mark with the 3XS Z270 Vengeance SLI. Priced at £3,000 and aimed squarely at gaming enthusiasts, this eye-catching machine is designed showcase said overclocking potential by running the liquid-cooled Core i7-7700K at a guaranteed speed of 5GHz across all four cores. Acknowledging the trends that are likely to extend throughout the remainder of the year, Scan's premium rig champions tempered glass panels and enough RGB lighting to illuminate a small disco. Corsair's stylish Crystal Series 570X RGB chassis is the enclosure of choice, and we suspect the same case will feature in many SI catalogues as the centrepiece of illuminated builds. Having the components on show opens the door for even more lights and Scan takes full advantage by installing an Asus Strix Z270E Gaming motherboard and not one, but two, Asus Strix GeForce GTX 1080 Advanced graphics cards. There's even an Asus RGB SLI bridge, and all the lights can be customised via the bundled Asus and Corsair software utilities. We're nonplussed by the industry's desire to add lights to every conceivable component, but on the flip side, if you happen to be partial to some RGB-lovin', the Z270 Vengeance SLI will be right up your street. Scan's implementation is, as expected, very neat and tidy, and hats off to the engineer who managed to build into a glass-covered case without leaving a fingerprint in sight. The area behind the 570X motherboard tray can be tricky to keep tidy on account of the fan hub and various cables, but credit where it's due, this PC certainly looks the part. The caveat, however, is that the Corsair chassis has a tendency to favour form over function. It looks pretty, there's no doubt about that, but the position of the I/O ports along the top-right edge isn't ideal, there's no front-facing USB Type-C, and the floating glass panels do little to help contain noise. This, ultimately, isn't going to be a particularly quiet PC. What the Z270 Vengeance SLI will deliver, in spades, is performance. The Core i7-7700K's 5GHz overclock is the star attraction and represents a meaningful gain over the 4.6GHz speed that became commonplace on turnkey gaming rigs from the previous generation. Ticking the relevant boxes, Scan pairs the chip to 16GB (2x8GB) of DDR4-3000 memory, a roomy 512GB Samsung SM961 M.2 SSD, a 2TB WD Blue hard disk for secondary storage and a Corsair RM750i power supply with individually sleeved cables. The 5GHz overclock is interesting insofar as it's an early indication as to what tier-one system integrators will be offering to enthusiast customers. Though, there is still a bit of working out left to do. Our review sample wasn't completely stable to begin with and we had to manually bump-up CPU core voltage from 1.29 to 1.32 in order to complete our benchmarks successfully. Given that new Z270 BIOS releases are coming thick and fast, we imagine it will be a couple of weeks before system integrators strike the perfect balance between voltage and multiplier. Could you build the same machine for less using off-the-shelf components from various suppliers? Sure, but taking the pre-built route offers peace of mind, and Scan's three-year warranty holds weight when a new chip and chipset are being pushed closer to their limits. Going the extra yard, Scan also adds 150MHz to each of the GTX 1080 GPUs, raising boost clock to 1,802MHz. It's a machine crying out for benchmarks, so let's get to it.

SEND ANOTHER EMAIL CLOSE share Apperian Just Got Acquired — Say Hello to Its New Leader The startup's investors included Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Intel Capital 4.0K Dylan Martin - Staff Writer, Tech 1/11/17 @6:00am in Tech 1/11/17 @6:00am Over the winter holiday break, Mark Lorion probably didn't get to relax as much as everyone else. After all, he had just become the new leader of Apperian, a Boston mobile app management and security startup that had raised about $40 million from investors, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Intel Capital and Bessemer Venture Partners. The reason he was taking the lead role? Apperian agreed to be acquired by San Francisco mobile app and IoT security company Arxan Technologies — a deal that was officially announced Wednesday — and Lorion was next in line after its former CEO, Brian Day, decided to step down to pursue a new venture. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Apperian will remain in Boston, where it has "a few dozen" employees and will continue to hire. "The application security and management capabilities Apperian provides are pivotal for organizations to securely deploy and manage their apps and we’re excited to offer our customers Apperian’s [mobile app mangement] products," Joe Sander, CEO of Arxan, said in a statement. "This acquisition puts Arxan in a unique position with the strongest and most comprehensive solution for enterprise application protection and management for both mobile and IoT.” I'm happy to be in the trenches with them. So yeah, with Arxan closing the acquisition and Lorion charged with leading Apperian's transition as its new president and general manager, Lorion, who's also co-founder of Boston TechJam, could probably use an extra coffee if you see him. "Basically by the middle of December, I was responsible for the company," Lorion told me. He was previously Apperian's chief marketing and products officer, having originally joined the company in November 2012 as its CMO. Before that, he was a marketing executive for Palo Alto-based TIBCO Software. "It’s exciting. I've been in the trenches with these guys for a long time. We have the battle scars and trophies to show it," he said of his team at Apperian. "I'm happy to be in the trenches with them." Lorion is taking over from Day, who left after being CEO for two years and became CFO of Cambridge cloud communications startup Fuze in December. Day had joined Apperian as its CFO in 2011 and was promoted to CEO in 2014. Related Meta Search Has a Killer Product — Here's Why It Decided to Get Acquired "He orchestrated and completed the acquisition and then transitioned the Apperian reins over to me," Lorion said. "Arxan liked my customer and product experience and felt that I would be able to lead Apperian." Day told me he decided to step down because he while he enjoyed being CEO of Apperian, he didn't "really want to be a president of a division of another company." Day said Fuze had been courting him to join for a while so he took the acquisition as an opportunity to join Fuze, an IPO candidate whose valuation is reportedly nearing $1 billion. "Apperian is in great hands with Mark," Day said, adding that he recommended Lorion to Arxan CEO Joe Sander. "Between Apperian's tech and Arxan's salesforce, they got a good deal." Between Apperian's tech and Arxan's salesforce, they got a good deal. Apperian began exploring the idea of getting acquired by Arxan about four or five months ago, according to Day. The company was originally looking for a potential partner to expand its business, but after speaking with Arxan, whose majority stakeholder is Boston private equity firm TA Associates, the two decided they could complement each other's business. While Apperian provides mobile app management and security for enterprise customers, Arxan focuses on that space from a consumer perspective. Lorion said both companies were hearing from customers that they were interested in the consumer or enterprise spaces, which signaled to Apperian and Arxan an opportunity to cross-sell each other's products. For instance, a large company that uses Apperian to deploy and secure apps on the mobile devices of employees and contractors might want to have similar security capabilities for consumer apps on a variety of devices. "Apperian does a great job at securing apps in the enterprise — apps used by employees, contractors" for example," Day said of the two companies' strengths. "What Arxan does a great job is securing apps that are publicly available.  No one wants their banking app hacked. If you think about it, it’s a pretty good fit."

Intel refers to its 3D XPoint storage devices under the name Optane, while Micron’s 3D XPoint-based brand is QuantX. The technology has been in development for several years, but Intel’s 7th-gen processors and their support for Optane memory points towards the expected arrival of completed products. Below is an overview of 3D XPoint and why it is an important technology. Architecture and Design 3D XPoint is designed to be the first major memory design overhaul since the implementation of NAND flash. The premise of 3D XPoint involves stacking thin layers of memory in a cross point structure to optimise density. The amount of voltage sent to each memory cell means data can be written or read without a transistor, decreasing both the size and price of the memory. The memory is non-volatile and its lifespan does not degrade due to continuous operation, like conventional SSDs. 3D XPoint is also extremely fast and cheap, meaning it may replace both conventional storage (HDDs and SSDs) and even DRAM memory. Performance Intel outlined the performance improvements of 3D XPoint over conventional storage in its initial announcement. While the hardware was not fully-developed or tested at the time, information released so far gives users an idea of what to expect. 3D XPoint storage is only slightly slower than DRAM, and much faster than SSDs and hard drives. Intel describes the speed of the memory as up to 1,000-times faster than NAND, with extremely low latency. The memory will also be as cheap as conventional storage, although this may only be true later in the production cycle. Products Intel has made steady progress in developing 3D XPoint-based products, with its Optane storage drives set to release this year. Intel has ensured that Optane is supported on its latest CPU architecture, which includes its 7th-gen processors, which means more commercial hardware may be announced soon. Early Optane products will likely be small, lightning-fast storage and cache drives, if development models are anything to go by. Full systems using unified 3D XPoint memory and storage are out of reach for the moment, although further refinement of the technology could make it a possibility.

This provides the hacker - and at the point of using as USB flash drive, any person in the world that can hold a USB stick in their hands - full control over the PC. Worse yet, it is completely undetectable by current security tools.   The possibilities of this are virtually unlimited, as someone could plug a USB 3.0 stick in and upload malicious code, keyloggers, and virtually anything else they want. The same flaw allows someone to make the PC completely inoperable, where it is capable of rewriting the entire BIOS. Yeah, that's a pretty big deal.   When talking about the new hacking potential on Intel's processors, Maxim Goryachy and Mark Ermolov at the 33rd Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany said: "These manufacturer-created hardware mechanisms have legitimate purposes, such as special debugging features for hardware configuration and other beneficial uses. But now these mechanisms are available to attackers as well. Performing such attacks does not require nation-state resources or even special equipment".   Goryachy said: "We have reported this case to Intel. As of today, this mechanism can be exploited only on Intel U-series processors". So while it's not on every Intel processor out there (that we know of anyway), but the Skylake-based U-series processors are found inside of plenty of laptops and NUCs. Goryachy added: "As of today, no publicly available security system will detect it".

Well, it's one that can do everything - but there isn't just one, here are 18 best laptops By Marie Brewis | 04 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments What's the best laptop? Best laptop Price Key specifications Dell XPS 13 9360 £999 Windows 10, Intel Core i5-7200U, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 13.3in 1920x1080 display, 60Wh battery Lenovo Yoga 710 11in £549 Windows 10, Intel Core M3-6Y30, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 11.6in 1920x1080 display, 40Wh battery Asus ZenBook UX310UA £699 Windows 10, Intel Core i5-6200U, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 500GB hard drive, 13.3in 3200x1800 display, 48Wh battery Jump straight to our full best laptops chart What's the best laptop? We round up the best laptops you can buy in the UK in 2017, including best Windows laptops and best MacBooks. The best laptop is the Dell XPS 13, followed by the Lenovo Yoga 710 and the Asus ZenBook UX310, but there are plenty of other options in our list below. Also see: Best Laptop Deals Despite the rise of tablets, there are still plenty of reasons to choose a laptop. Sometimes you just can't beat a bigger screen, a keyboard and Windows for getting stuff done. But, if you want a laptop that's also a tablet, there are plenty of convertible or 'hybrid' laptops which have a touchscreen which folds right back behind the keyboard and can be used as a tablet. The Yoga 710 is one of the best we've seen in this respect, although if its 11in screen is too small, Lenovo does offer larger versions. Before you buy any of the MacBooks in this chart, note that Apple unveiled a new MacBook Pro on 27 October. We will add the new MacBook Pro to our chart once we have completed our testing. Best laptops 2017: Buying guide As with any product we review, the best laptops are rated on various factors - performance, build quality, features and value for money – along with an overall score, potentially with an award, too. Note that star ratings don't always dictate where a product ranks in the list below, as the score applies to the date it was reviewed. If you're looking for a laptop that can handle the latest games, see our up-to-date list of the best gaming laptops. As much as we can, we make sure all the laptops in the chart are available to but in the UK. However, it's not something we can check every day so there's a chance you might not find the model listed. There are also often many different SKUs (versions/models) of a laptop so the specs might vary to those on the model we've reviewed (we can't always choose the exact model to review). Most laptops will come pre-installed with Windows 10 now. Of course, our best laptops group test also includes the best MacBooks, which run OS X (now macOS) out of the box. Macs are often more expensive than Windows laptops, but Apple's laptops are better value than ever before. You might feel that the premium build quality and features warrant spending extra, although many Windows laptop manufacturers have stepped up their game recently. Best laptops 2017: How much should I spend on a laptop?  In this chart, there's no cap on how much the device can cost – sometimes the best does come at a steep price. Equally you can get a lot of laptop for under £300 – provided you only need to do basic tasks like browse the web, email and create the odd document. If so see the best budget laptops. Spending a bit more, around £500 and above, will potentially get you a nice laptop but it's likely to have an entry-level set of specs. We're talking a relatively basic processor, minimal SSD storage and a low resolution screen. It might also be a bit heavy and bulky. Content continues below Ramp up the amount you're happy to splash out - £800 and up - and you'll be looking at the best of the best with a blazing fast processor, plenty of RAM, hordes of storage and a gorgeous display. You should also expect excellent build quality and premium materials. That's why it's crucial to read laptop reviews before you buy.  Best laptops 2017: What screen size laptop do I need?  The size of your screen is an important decision when buying a laptop. After all they typically range from 11- all the way up to 17in. A smaller screen might be harder to work on but it means that the laptop will be far more portable, handy if you need to take it around with you wherever you go. Bear in mind that a smaller device means less space for features like ports. At 17in, you're buying a desktop replacement laptop which isn't deigned to be moved around often. You'll likely get a full-size keyboard, lots of connectivity and possibly even an optical drive, too. Generally, unless you're looking at either end of the spectrum, a 13in laptop is the sweet spot for us combining portability with usability. While many laptops have a resolution of 1366x768, you should look for something more if you want the best. Full HD (1920x1080) and higher should be a tick box and you can even get 4K laptops now, although arguably it's not necessary. If you want a touchscreen, this normally adds to the cost. Most laptops come with a glossy screen but most people prefer a less reflective matt finish so that's something to look out for, too. Best laptops 2017: How much laptop storage do I need?  As usual, storage depends on what you want to use a laptop for. As a general rule of thumb get as much as possible without wasting money on the upgrade (manufactures can charge a premium on this area). An SSD will mean your laptop runs faster but doesn't provide as much space as a traditional hard drive. Remember that there are also plenty of cloud storage options but this isn't so helpful when you don't have an internet connection. If you're going to need to storing a large amount of data (perhaps you make home videos or you simply want all your TV box sets ready to go) then look for 1- or 2TB of space. Don't forget you can buy a portable USB drive to supplement a laptop which has only a small-capacity SSD.  Memory (RAM) is where programs and files are stored only while you're using them, and more is always better. Consider 4GB an absolute minimum, unless it's a Chromebook, with 8- to 16GB the ideal figure if you can afford the upgrade. You can't have too much. Best laptops 2017: Which laptop processor is best?  Unless you're going to run complex and demanding software or gaming, you don't need the latest top-spec processor. It doesn't hurt, of course, but it's best to find a nice balance as there's nothing worse than waiting for a app to load etc. If you're happy to splash out then you're probably looking at the latest generation (6th) Intel Core i7 chip. Entry-level spec models are likely to offer a Core i3 or even a Core M processor instead. A Core i5 sits nicely in-between so check how much extra it is to upgrade before making a final decision. If you're not sure which generation the Intel processor is, look at the model number as the first digit represents this. For example, a Core i5-6500 is a sixth-generation CPU. While most come with Intel processors, you can still find AMD powered devices around. See AMD vs Intel for more information. Best laptops 2017: Ultrabooks and ultraportable laptops Buying an ultraportable laptop is really no different than any laptop, except that your priorities are likely to be different. You might want an ultraportable laptop that's light and will last a long time away from the mains.  However, other people want an ultrabook that's powerful and can handle demanding applications without breaking your back when you carry it around. Both types are available. Some compromises are inevitable if you want a thin and light laptop, though. There's less space for a battery, so it's typical to find shorter runtimes. But some companies have overcome this with clever packaging, such as the MacBook Air.  Another factor is efficient hardware, so a newer processor is likely to sip rather than guzzle power. The same goes for other components. But you should always read our reviews to find out how long a particular laptop lasted in our tests as you can't rely on specifications and it's unwise to go only by manufacturers' claims.  Thin laptops tend to have shallow key travel, so if you need a laptop to do a lot of typing then, again, read our reviews as they're the only way (short of hunting down the machine in a shop) to find out whether a keyboard is a joy or a pain to use.  Many ultrabooks use low-power processors which are better for battery life, but may not have much power for running Windows apps. Our benchmarks sort the speed demons from the sluggards. Best laptops 2017: Warranty and other considerations  We recommend all the laptops here: there isn't a duff one among them. However, we urge you again to read through the full review before spending your hard-earned cash. None of them are perfect and what will suit your needs might not simply be the device ranked at number one. Battery life and warranty are two things which vary between laptops. The latter may well differ depending on where you buy the laptop from, too. John Lewis, for example, tends to offer longer warranty than rivals. After-sales service is something you should consider, not only laptops but pretty much everything you buy. Check whether the company has a UK-based support line, and forums (including our own) are an ideal place to get an idea of whether a manufacturer is generally good or bad at carrying out work under warranty. You might not even have to deal with the manufacturer directly if you have a fault in the first six months as it's the retailer's responsibility to deal with issues. This is when it pays to have purchased from Amazon, John Lewis and others which will often replace or refund without quibble. After al that, it's also worth considering whether a laptop is what you really want. You can get some great bargains on desktop PCs these days, and if you don't want a large tower system taking up space there are plenty of all-in-one PCs to choose between. These integrate the computer behind the monitor, so they're much neater. Also, some tablets offer similar functionality to basic laptops. See our piece about choosing between laptop vs iPad, for instance.  Read on for our pick of the UK's best laptops and links to our best laptop reviews.

Dell XPS 13 9360 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 December 16 RRP: From £999 inc VAT (model reviewed £1499 inc VAT) The Dell XPS 13 is an excellent ultraportable laptop, the best 13-inch Windows model going for many. Dell hasn’t aimed for a single superlative feature, a potential gimmick. Its footprint is smaller than the competition, but it’s thicker. Its screen resolution is excellent, but display colour is normal rather than super-saturated. There’s also a mix of old and new connections, and a combo of a large battery and smart power management means the Dell XPS 13 lasts significantly longer than most a lot of the time. The balance is just right - we'd spend our own money on it. Read our Dell XPS 13 9360 review. 2. Lenovo Yoga 710 11" Rating: Reviewed on: 9 August 16 RRP: £549 inc VAT The Lenovo Yoga 710 wants to offer the best, most convenient ultraportable laptop experience you can get without spending a scary amount of money. It has a 360-degree hinge and a touchscreen, which makes is a fun machine for use while travelling around. You wouldn’t want to go any smaller for all-day work tasks, but there is also a larger 14in version of this laptop if you think the 11.6in Yoga 710 will prove too small. For what it’s worth, Lenovo has nailed the display, glossy, sharp, bright enough for outdoor use, covered in toughened glass and jet black when switched off. Core hardware includes an Intel Core M3-6Y30 processor, 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 128GB SSD. You get a single USB 3.0 port, plus micro HDMI, but no microSD slot for storage expansion. There are stereo speakers, a nice tiled keyboard with two-button trackpad that is mostly comfortable to type on, and this 1.06kg laptop runs on a 40Wh battery. It’s not the fastest Windows laptop, but sufficient for everyday tasks that don’t include gaming. It’s silent in use, with respectable audio and long battery life - 9 hours 45 minutes in our tests. Lenovo’s Yoga 710 is one of the best Windows alternatives to the 12in MacBook. Read our Lenovo Yoga 710 11" review. 3. Asus ZenBook UX310UA Rating: Reviewed on: 6 October 16 RRP: £699 inc VAT The Asus ZenBook UX310A is an ideal mid-range ultraportable laptop. It is what happens when a practical everyday laptop and an expensive all-aluminium Ultrabook fall in love, bringing you the pricey look and feel of a portable, stylish machine with the features of a workhorse and a price way below that of a rival MacBook. Core hardware includes a Core i5-6200U CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM and both a 128GB SSD and a 500GB HDD. There’s a single USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0, plus USB-C, HDMI and SDXC. The Asus sports (albeit so-so) Harman Kardon stereo speakers, and with its 48Wh battery weighs in at 1.45kg. A cheaper version has the Core i3, 4GB of RAM and a lower-res display. The 13.3in screen is a highlight, with unbelievable sharpness (276ppi) and colour saturation at this price, and this matt screen excels in outdoor use. It’s paired with a scissor-mechanism keyboard with backlight and a large, comfortable trackpad. The ZenBook is not perfect - we’d like the display to tilt back further, the shell displays some flexing, and it’s a tad chunky thanks to the HDD inside - but it scored well on performance, provided you avoid intensive gaming. Battery life is solid, at 8 hours 10 minutes. You can’t have it all at this price, but the ZenBook gets close. Read our Asus ZenBook UX310UA review. 4. Dell Latitude 13 7370 Rating: Reviewed on: 22 July 16 RRP: From £1,079 Okay so it’s a business laptop, but check out that 13in edge-to-edge display. You wouldn’t be ashamed to show off the Dell Latitude 13 inside- or outside the office, with design hints taken from the awesome Dell XPS 13 listed higher up this chart. It’s customisable to suit your needs, but the model we reviewed came with an Intel Core m5-6Y57 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. There’s a USB 3.0 port, two USB-C, Micro-HDMI, a microSD card slot and two optional Micro-SIM slots. This 13.3in-screen laptop also sports a 34Wh battery and a fingerprint scanner, and weighs in at 1.12kg. The Latitude 13 has a pleasant matt finish to its base half, but the outer side of the lid is a cool (in every sense) aluminium that is surprisingly sturdy. Or you can add a carbon-fibre lid for an extra tenner. The keyboard is distinctly business-fare, somewhat cramped and with concave, clicky keys, but it’s workable. The trackpad is good, but small. And the screen offers great colours and viewing angles, even outdoors, but it lacks brightness. What really impresses is the Professional version of Windows it ships with, the silent running of the still-powerful processor, and its outstanding battery life of 8 hours 23 minutes in our tests. Read our Dell Latitude 13 7370 review. 5. HP Envy 13 Rating: Reviewed on: 25 February 16 RRP: From £649 inc VAT (model reviewed £799) You won’t find a laptop with a decent-sized screen more portable than this HP Envy 13. It’s incredibly slim and light, powerful, and it doesn’t cost the earth. Magic. Key specs for our review sample include the Intel Core i7-6500U processor with 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 256GB SSD. There’s a 13.3in full-HD screen, three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI 1.4, a fingerprint scanner, SDXC slot, Bang & Olufson stereo speakers and a tiled keyboard complete with numberpad. With a 45Wh battery the Envy 13 weighs just 1.3kg. Cheaper Core-i5 and more expensive higher-resolution-screen options are also available. Sensationally petite, the Envy 13 has plenty of its own visual personality. This ultra-light system offers a mix of officiousness and cuteness: an unusal combo. There’s a pleasant matt screen, a shallow but crisp keyboard, and HP’s trademark ultra-big, ultra-rounded touchpad - one of the best you’ll find on a 13in Windows laptop. Day-to-day performance is excellent, and more demanding tasks such as photo- and video-editing are well within the HP’s remit. With integrated graphics, though, you’ll want to keep games at low settings. In our tests battery life ran to 8 hours 5 minutes. Read our HP Envy 13 review. 6. Acer S 13 S5-371 Rating: Reviewed on: 13 October 16 RRP: £549.99 Introducing the Windows ultrabook for normal people (the ones whose jaws drop when they see the price of a new MacBook Air), the Acer S 13 is an affordable and recommended alternative to such wallet-busters. There’s a quirky trackpad and some parts of the build are cheap, but this is a very decent Windows laptop. The S 13 has an embossed ‘ridged’ plastic lid, offset by a silvery hinge that gives it a recognisable two-tone style. Its underside is plastic too, and the use of this material is one way Acer has managed to keep down the price. Elsewhere the build is more premium, for example the aluminium keyboard surround. On the whole, though, the spec is good. You get an Intel Core i3-610U processor (a Core i5 option is available) paired with 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 128GB SSD. There are two USB 3.0 ports, one USB-C, HDMI, SDXC and stereo speakers. The 13.3in Acer has a 4,030mAh battery and weighs 1.3kg. Day-to-day performance is good and battery life is very good, but the Acer is not a great gaming machine. It’s mostly quiet, with the fans kicking in only when necessary, yet the stereo speakers are loud. Watch it, though, as they’ll distort at maximum volume. Read our Acer S 13 S5-371 review. 7. Microsoft Surface Book Rating: Reviewed on: 30 June 16 RRP: From £1,299 inc VAT Microsoft thinks it has made the ultimate laptop, which is also a tablet. It's difficult to argue. There are five models, with the top offering the new £2,649 Surface Book i7. We reviewed the original Intel Core i7 Skylake model with 16GB of RAM and Nvidia GPU, and found excellent performance but have to point out the Core i5 model offers better value. The Surface Book is very angular, a slightly unusual shape for a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio, though we got used to it quickly. The 13.5in PixelSense display is stunning, with a crisp 267ppi density. Colour reproduction, brightness and viewing angles all excel. The Book itself is made from magnesium alloy, lighter and more durable than aluminium. The Book splits apart into the 724g screen with a 18Wh battery and the 860g keyboard with a 51Wh battery (battery life is fantastic at 16 hours, 25 minutes). The most striking part of its design its the ‘Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge’, which looks cool and improves balance. Meanwhile, an equally cool ‘Muscle Wire Lock’ uses an electrically charged nickel titanium alloy to hold it all together. The Surface Pen attaches magnetically to the side. You’ll find ports for USB 3.0 (x2), Mini-DisplayPort and an SD Card reader. USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 are missing, but this is still an amazing example of Windows laptop tech. Read our Microsoft Surface Book review. 8. MacBook Pro 2016 Rating: Reviewed on: 11 January 17 RRP: Base prices £1,449 (13-inch without Touch Bar), £1,749 (256GB 13-inch model with Touch Bar), £1,949 (512GB 13-inch model with Touch Bar), £2,349 (2.6GHz, 256GB 15-inch with Touch Bar), £2,699 (2.7GHz, 12GB 15-inch with Touch Bar) We're rather in love with the new MacBook Pro, but as with many love affairs there are irritations. The trackpad is huge and wonderful to use; but it's so big that the keyboard has been pushed up to make room, as well as flattened down to make the laptop slimmer. These factors together mean typing on the new Pro is a little harder - especially for touch typists, who will struggle to locate keys at first - than on on previous models. And those arrow keys are a nightmare. The Touch Bar is lovely to look at and fun to use. It's early days, both for us - we're only beginning to grasp its capabilities - and for app developers, who will surely come up with reams of clever Touch Bar features. Right now it's fun, but we're reasonably confident that it will become essential; the key will be getting lots of users on machines with Touch Bars. The tech is in this respect a little further back along the track that 3D Touch is following. This is a fast machine, of course, but maybe not quite fast enough for some tastes; it's worth reflecting on that maximum spec of 16GB of RAM, which may hold this machine back from a role in genuine pro settings. We're somewhat hopeful for a March update to add the option of more RAM and Kaby Lake processors. All in all, this is a fast and beautiful laptop but one with some flaws to consider. And ouch, that price tag is steep. Read our MacBook Pro 2016 review. 9. HP Spectre 13 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 August 16 RRP: £1299 inc VAT The HP Spectre 13 is desperate to appear a laptop of the future, and that comes with substantial pros and cons. Its supreme portability is quite wonderful, and while its design may polarise, it certainly is fancy. There's substance too, with a surprisingly powerful CPU for a laptop this thin and solid build in the keyboard and trackpad. Its message is a little confused, though. The processor courts enthusiasts, but that's exactly who's likely to be most annoyed by the lack of memory card slot and a traditional USB port. There's an audience for the Spectre 13, but if you've not signed-up to a wireless way of working yet you may want to think twice. Read our HP Spectre 13 review. 10. Lenovo Yoga 900 Rating: Reviewed on: 26 February 16 RRP: From £1199 inc VAT (model reviewed £1499) The Lenovo Yoga 900 is a laptop that really asks you to believe in its design style. After all, it doesn’t come cheap and for the price you can get a laptop with much more power if you’re not out for something immensely portable. That’s where this laptop excels: portability. As well as being slim, light and all-round lovely, the smart hinge lets it sit where most other laptops just can’t. The battery should last through a full day’s work as well. The trackpad can feel fiddly and the display isn’t perfect, but if you’re feeling flush this is one of the top ultraportables around. Read our Lenovo Yoga 900 review. 11. 13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015) Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £849 (with 128GB storage), £999 (with 256GB) Buy from Apple After some extensive testing, we found the MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) to be little different overall to the 2014 model. The Thunderbolt 2 update will prove useful for connecting to high-resolution UHD displays, and a few percent of added processor power is never unwelcome. But hoped-for improvements in graphics performance and battery longevity did not arise in our testing, in spite of a new Intel processor which was expected to shepherd benefits in both areas. Launched at the same price as last year’s model it still deserves attention as one of the finest ultraportable laptops available - doubly so now that its flash-drive speed has shot up another 100 percent - and it will remain the more affordable option in lightweight notebooks when the new MacBook launches this month. Read our 13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015) review. 12. Apple MacBook (early 2016) Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £1,049 There's no escaping the fact that this is a very similar laptop to its 2015 predecessor, which so divided the tech community. But we think the problems have been overblown. The engineering on show is superb, and the performance is completely acceptable for a modern-day computer of this size. The arguments that there should be more ports on the MacBook only exist because people want one, and are frustrated that their current set-up needs will not allow for it. Apple has undoubtedly improved the MacBook for 2016. It is a truly outstanding laptop that will be wrongly categorised as a luxury technological item. There's a difference between something costing a little too much and it being luxurious - just like the MacBook Air, this laptop deserves to fall in price and rise in specs to continue to be what we consider an excellent flagship computer. The world and its ports just need to catch up. Read our Apple MacBook (early 2016) review. 13. Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA Rating: Reviewed on: 5 January 17 RRP: From £1099 inc VAT (model tested £1499 inc VAT) The Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA is an extremely light laptop and one that doesn’t compromise performance or kill battery life as a result. It’s also more affordable than some of the alternatives, particularly in its entry-level spec. However, we’re not convinced about all the choices Asus has made. A single USB-C port won’t cut it for a lot of buyers, the ultra-slim keyboard isn’t great for long-form typing and the trackpad’s clicker mechanism has some real issues. The trackpad also seems a bit pointless when it’s reliability is mediocre, even if it’s down to Microsoft’s software. Its portability is just about unbeatable, but some of you may prefer the more accommodating style of the Dell XPS 13 or one of Asus’s cheaper ZenBook models Read our Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA review. 14. Dell Chromebook 11 (3120) Rating: Reviewed on: 9 March 16 RRP: £202 inc VAT Buy from Dell Dell knows what it’s doing when it comes to Chromebooks. This new, rugged model has plenty to offer in terms of speed and durability, but you don’t feel like you’re sacrificing much in return. With the long battery life and unique waterproofing feature it does seem like a device that’s built to last, which is good as you’ll want to keep using it for a long time to come. Read our Dell Chromebook 11 (3120) review. 15. Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Rating: Reviewed on: 14 September 16 RRP: £799 inc. VAT The Dell Inspiron 13 5000 tells you larger convertible laptops have truly entered the mainstream. It’s reasonably affordable, still looks good and has the roughly the same power as some laptops costing way over £1000. Down sides include that the screen isn’t as colourful as the best and that the casing is made of plastic rather than something fancy like aluminium or a magnesium alloy. Oddly enough, though, it actually fits in well among its more stylish peers. Read our Dell Inspiron 13 5000 review. 16. HP Envy 15-as001na Rating: Reviewed on: 13 September 16 RRP: £799 inc. VAT The HP Envy 15 doesn't seem like a desperately interesting laptop at first glance. It's too big to be cool, not quite cheap enough to be a stone-cold bargain. However, the longer you use it, the more you realise quite what a sound fit it is for people who want a larger laptop, but one not ugly, chunky or liable to last 90 minutes between charges. Sound performance, a smart trackpad, a respectable display and sensible price make the HP Envy 15 one of the best laptops for those who don't really need a super-performance PC but still want the desktop-replacer feel you get with a 15.6-inch laptop. Read our HP Envy 15-as001na review. 17. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 June 16 RRP: From £749 inc VAT (model tested £1079) There is a great deal to like and rave about the Surface Pro 4. The design is thinner and lighter for starters. The screen is awesome, there's plenty of power available, the new Surface Pen is better and the Type Cover is a vast improvement on the last one. However, the design is inherently awkward at times, it's more expensive that a lot of laptops and the Type Cover, which you'll pretty much need, isn't included lowering the value.

Intel gives its low-end Kaby Lake Pentium some Hyper-Threading bling to boost sales This performance boost just might make budget users more eager to upgrade. Gordon Mah Ung (PC World (US online)) on 11 January, 2017 23:00 0 - - - - print email Don’t say Intel never gave you nuthin’ for free. Although this news flew well under the radar when the company’s 7th-gen Kaby Lake desktop CPUs were launched last Tuesday at CES, Intel’s newest budget Pentium CPUs have received a performance buff with Hyper-Threading. The Pentium G4600, Pentium G4620, and Pentium G4560, as well as their power-saving “T” versions, all feature Intel’s Hyper-Threading, which delegates unused portions of the CPU for other tasks (you can see the chips here on Intel’s ARK site.) While it doesn’t quite turn these dual-core CPUs into quad-cores, there is a real-world performance boost on most multi-threaded loads. Hyper-Threading was introduced with the Pentium 4 in 2000 and has been a standard feature of Intel’s higher-end processors since then. The budget Pentium series, however, hasn’t had the feature until now. Making budget chips sexier Besides the support for Hyper-Threading, the new Kaby Lake budget chips also support Ultra HD 4K resolution and are capable of playing back 10-bit content easily. That can’t be done on Skylake, Haswell, or Ivy Bridge’s integrated graphics. One issue for Intel, Krewell noted, is the lack of air between its pricier Core i3 CPUs and Pentiums. For example, the dual-core 3.9GHz Core i3-7100 costs $117 in volume and has Hyper-Threading and HD 630 graphics. The dual-core 3.7GHz Pentium G4620 costs $86 to $93, has Hyper-Threading and HD 630 graphics. For that roughly 25-percent increase in price, all the customer gets is about a 5-percent performance boost. Not all are as close, though. Some Core i3 chips have larger caches and much higher clock speeds. Intel also recently unveiled an unlocked “K” CPU with very high overclocking capability. Why this matters: Company officials didn’t tell PCWorld why they decided to make the change, but the move gives Intel’s sub-$100 fare a performance edge compared to previous Pentium chips. Kevin Krewell, a chip analyst with Tirias Research, said the move could signal Intel's desire to offer budget shoppers an incentive to upgrade.

Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

When you look at the evidence presented and the sources it becomes evident that the Russian hack story doesn't stand up against Crowdstrike's own facts. By examining facts, timelines, and sources needed for the DNI report, the only conclusion is the DNI report is strictly political. Because of this Craig Murray- Julian Assange's story showing the emails were leaked is the only version of the story that stands. The facts on hand show criminality and negligence on the part of Crowdstrike, the FBI, and the DNI. The Murray and Assange story stands on evidence many heavyweights in the Intel community are backing up their account as the only way the emails could have gotten to Wiki Leaks. The DNI report uses of information obtained by self-identifying Ukrainian neo-nazis (Pravy Sektor members). For US Intel to offer this proof of Russian involvement is really bizarre. While heading 17 Intel agencies, the DNI was not concerned enough about Russia hacking or influencing the 2016 election to look into. Why is it that during the 10 days following the election, James Clapper knew so little about the subject? According to the Washington Times" As recently as Nov. 17, James Clapper, the nation's top intelligence officer, told Congress his agencies "don't have good insight" into a direct link between WikiLeaks and the emails supposedly hacked by a Russian operation from Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign." But the FBI had it covered for months. James Comey, Director of the FBI is in charge of the domestic version of the CIA. According to the 2006 update of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, "the FBI's job in the streets of the United States would thus be a domestic equivalent, operating under the U.S. Constitution and quite different laws and rules, to the job of the CIA's operations officers abroad. - Advertisement - According to the FBI Director, "there are now 5,000 agents and 2,000 intelligence analysts" 41 in the branch. It is our hope that open source will become an integral part of all intelligence activities (FBI) and that, at some point in the future, there may no longer be a need for a separate directorate." With this in mind, Comey could have and should have simply phoned the NSA and received all the information he needed, chose not to. The question is why? Comey could have asked any of over 2000 analysts to look into it. Why didn't the Director of the domestic CIA request information? "According to William Binney(former Technical Director, World Geopolitical & Military Analysis, NSA), the NSA's "extensive domestic data-collection network," any data removed remotely from Hillary Clinton or DNC servers would have passed over fiber networks and therefore would have been captured by the NSA who could have then analyzed packet data to determine the origination point and destination address of those packets." After spending time in the election spotlight this year the only way FBI Director James Comey could not know any information about the alleged hack is that he didn't want to. - Advertisement - The FBI report is based solely on Crowdstrike's evidence which has become a laughing stock across the cyber security industry. Cyber security professionals are standing up saying how laughable Dimitri Alperovitch's information is. For there to be any evidence of a hack, the DNI report has to use the FBI report and Crowdstrike's evidence. This includes the tool X-Agent. X-Agent was a key proof for Crowdstrike. In the NPR interview with Judy Woodruff, Crowdstrike's CTO, Dimitri Alperovitch says the use of X-agent shows guilt as clearly as DNA results. This proof, according to him is unique to a single hacker group. Crowdstrike labeled this hacker group "Fancy Bear." Just as important is the timeline it was used in. According to Marcy Wheeler, Crowdstrike's story of a Russian hacker falls apart on this point. Part of the problem is that Alperovitch stated his final undeniable and overwhelming proof was that it was used to target Ukrainian artillerymen throughout 2014. She argues given that timeline, the GRU, X-Agent had to be in development at least 6 months BEFORE Victor Yanukovych was ousted in a coup. Ukraine and Russia were on friendly terms. Further, citing Jeffery Carr, X-Agent doesn't have anywhere near the functionality that Crowdstrike claims it does. Carr goes on further to say two other entities have access to X-Agent which Crowdstrike presents as unique. The first is Crowdstrike itself. The second is the Ukrainian hacking group RUH8 which self-identifies with Pravy Sektor. Next Page  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5   - Advertisement - 5   2   2   View Ratings | Rate It I live in Ukraine.

But at least this time you end with an understandable sentence: "Julian Assange and Craig Murray told the truth. The emails were leaked." I don't have the expertise (or the patience) to see how anything you say supports this conclusion, but maybe some other reader will find it useful. You have said you read David Spring's essay. Why do you not mention it here? Spring's essay says clearly that the govt info provides 885 IP addresses in 40 different countries (but mostly in the US) that could be the source of the hack. This presumes that it was a hack, but also shows that it could have come from anywhere. To my non-nerd mind, there does seem to be a question of whether it was a leak or a hack. Assange, Binney and Murray say it was a leak. It is clear that US intel cannot admit that it was a leak because that would put the source inside the DNC and therefore exclude Russian culpability. Hence it has to be a hack, for their purpose. But John McAffee says (again) here, very clearly, that if it was a hack it could have been perpetrated literally by anyone, anywhere, and that it was much too amateurish to have been done by Russian intel. So if it was a leak, it could not have been the Russians, and if it was a hack, it could have been anybody anywhere under the sun. Do you agree?

He said "I think the Russians are behind the hacking..." Then later said it might be someone else. He said of NATO: "It is obsolete" and then "I am a big fan of NATO." OF intelligence, he said he doubted them, then "I am a big fan of intelligence." You are still drinking the snake oil. I want a revolution that overthrows the whole bundle of crooks. Trump, to begin with, serves unjustly because as the Declaration says, those who rule without consent, rule unjustly. Clinton is history. The intelligence community has chosen Trump and then picked a fight to make it look otherwise. Trump says he thinks it was the Russians. That puts him back in tune with the fake intlligence squabble.

The "Russian hacking is an intelligence lie" has been exposed as a farce involving Putin, Assange, Trump, the intelligence agencies and all those pwogs who claimed it was a lie meant to delegitimize Trump. Trump denied, denied and then was shown the classified evidence. He has now admitted "I think it was the Russians." The fake fight between the intelligence agencies (which despised Clinton and Obama) has now been exposed and all those defending the Trump denials have been used and discarded.

Submitted on Thursday, Jan 12, 2017 at 11:02:14 PM     (0+)   David Spring (Member since Apr 13, 2012), 2 fans, 4 articles, 12 comments    Friends, This is David Spring, author of the Report Hack Everything, a Detailed Timeline of the DNC Hack published at Turning Point News.org. I have just read this article by the Ukrainian author and I think it makes some sense. First, as to the debate about whether the DNC was hacked from the outside or leaked from the inside, my conclusion is that it was both hacked and leaked - with more than one hacker and more than one leaker. Security at the DNC was almost non-existent. Read my report for evidence of both hacking and leaking. Second, I briefly mentioned the link between Crowdstrike, Ukrainians and the Atlantic Council in my report. However, I had several other Ukrainian connections to the DNC hack that I did not put in the report. I omitted this information from the report for two reasons. First, I am not an expert on Ukraine - I am an expert on website security. Second, I did not want to get distracted from my main point which is that while the Russians were not involved in the DNC hack, the NSA likely was. I understand this is hard to believe - which is why my report is 85 pages long. I want to thank the Ukrainian author for his article. I agree that there is a very strong Ukrainian connection to the DNC hack and to Crowdstrike and the Atlantic Council. But I do not understand why these three groups are related - other than the fact that Dimitri's dad was perhaps a Russian turned CIA agent and Dimitri does not like Russia right now. The truth about all of this is very complex.

Why would he say that? I read your long article on Ukraine nationalism and was very impressed. Why would all the intelligence agencies and now Trump himself call out the Russians? And why wouldn't Russia seek to defeat Clinton, whom had insulted them and was viewed with hatred and a degree of fear for her warlike provocations? Why did Trump ask Russia to intervene to defeat Clinton. I welcome your revelations but so far, the only thing that adds up is that Russia was listening when Trump asked them to intervene. I don't get it. Can you help explain?

Mirrors indeed, on this question I can not profess that I know Trump's mind but I can say I see a war in this back and forth between the incoming and out going power base/s. There is a lot at stake and this intel battle is only part and parcel or a single battle in a much larger war. This is much like (IMHO) choosing the time and place of battles in the over all war. This could include the selection of which asset/s and which propaganda/truth/s will be challenged/accepted by the real winning of the people's support or trust which without nothing is possible. The word maybe (I recognize what you are saying or some sliver of possibility) does not win or lose but delay the battle until the time is right. I guess what I am trying to convey is that in the story of David and Goliath if David had attacked the army with his slingshot the result would have been disaster. Appropriate weapon for appropriate application to win one battle and then the war.

("Trump says he thinks Russia did the hacking? Why would he say that? ") Trump is a babe in the geopolitical woods. The Deep State will take him aside and convince him of anything they want -- it only takes a slide show. And you can believe there will be a subtle, unspoken threat of "this is a belief you can't refuse" whenever necessary. He'll be ready to bomb Russia by the time the false-flag provocation is engineered.

If the Deep State is controlling Trump, they would influence him NOT to admit Russia did the hacking but continue the fake feud. And Trump is hardly a babe in the woods; he runs businesses in 22 nations involving national leaders. He brags of pay for play, which involves not only the US but internationally. He may be a f*cking idiot, but he knows how to win. If the Deep State had total control of him, he would not have said "I think Russia is behind the hacking...." and ended the fight with the Deep State, which provides cover for his complicity. You have not answered my question, Jim. Your response is naive. I suggest we let it go....I am really bored with our "dialogue,' in which the goal post keeps being moved.

What I know is that wars have two purposes: 1. War as a racket, a business model for profits for the banks, energy cartels, and weapons makers who profit from war. 2. War as a cover for unpopularity, as a form of economic stimulus for a President trapped in recession, and war as a way to rally support for a leader who lacks organic support. My examples are Hitler, Mussolini, and Bush II. I suspect that Trump, being ou most disapproved President ever, will travel down this path. The movie Wag the Dog illustrates the latter purpose of war as coverup: "The President of the United States is caught making advances on an underage "Firefly Girl" less than two weeks before Election Day. Conrad Brean (De Niro), a top-notch spin doctor, is brought in to take the public's attention away from the scandal. He decides to construct a diversionary war with Albania, hoping the media will concentrate on this instead. Brean contacts Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Hoffman) to create the war, complete with a theme song and fake film footage of a photogenic orphan (Kirsten Dunst) in Albania. When the CIA learns of the plot, they send Agent Young (Macy) to confront Brean who convinces him that revealing the deception is against his best interests. The CIA announces that the war has ended, but otherwise maintains the deception and the media begins to turn back to the President's abuse scandal. Motss decides to invent a hero who was left behind enemy lines, and inspired by the idea that he was "discarded like an old shoe" has the Pentagon provide him with a soldier named Schumann (Harrelson) around whom he constructs a further narrative including T-shirts, additional patriotic songs, and faux-grassroots demonstrations of patriotism. At each stage of the plan, Motss continually dismisses setbacks as "nothing" and compares them to past movie-making catastrophes he averted." Wiki War as racket, war as diversion, war to create the illusion of solidarity......all these make sense in terms of Trump's choice of Wall St Billionaires, Exxon CEO as secy of state, and his need to find a basis of consent since most American's disapprove of him. Am I close? I can speculate about what is behind the fog but as for knowing, who knows? When in doubt, I go back and read Orwell's Politics and the English language, about the dangers of confusing language as a mask for the truth. All I know is that the truth is hidden and that the "explanations" are likely either naive or cover ups.

The Ukrainians are the extreme of politically active. They have over 2000 political groups in the US organized by subject, for instance womens rights, civil rights, religious rights, or multiculturalism. Each works independently until needed for a larger project. Trump saying it is, could be, or probably is Russians is a pressure relief. The proofs listed above are just short of a real smoking gun confession by Ukrainians. If that were to show up, could Hillary be indicted for the Russia hacks? Is this part of a coup attempt.

It's almost like people speaking entirely different languages. That talk by Jacob Applebaum, for example, was 99% incomprehensible to me.

Submitted on Friday, Jan 13, 2017 at 3:29:31 PM     (0+)   George King (Member since Aug 11, 2014), 10 fans, 15 articles, 1249 comments, 1 diaries    Alexandra Chalupa One of the lobbyists working for the Democratic National Committee is Alexandra Chalupa, who is the head of the Democratic National Committee's opposition research on Russia and on Trump, and founder and president of the Ukrainian lobby group "US United With Ukraine Coalition". In October 2016, Yahoo named her one of the 16 most important people, who shaped this year's election. It was Chalupa, who blamed Shrillary's defeat on Russian hackers, and that Trump's campaign was aided by the Kremlin. This was because Trump had appointed Paul Manafort as his campaign manager, who had ties to Putin. Chalupa worked with Michael Isikoff, a journalist with Yahoo News, to publicise her views on Russian influence on the election campaign. She has also hysterically accused Trump of treason, even requesting the Department of Justice and other official government departments to investigate Trump for this alleged crime. Ames is very careful, however, to state that he is not arguing that Chalupa is one of those behind PropOrNot. Rather, he is using her to show how PropOrNot is part of a wider, venomously anti-Russian movement within the Democrat party. He states that in his opinion, it is a classic case of blowback. After the Second World War, the US supported Ukrainian Fascists, despite their collaboration with the Holocaust and the massacre of the country's ethnic Polish population, because they were seen as useful agents and allies against the Russians. Now that policy is beginning to blow back into domestic American politics. Timberg's other source for his blacklist was the Foreign Policy Research Institute, citing its 'fellow', Clint Watts, and a report Watts wrote on how Russia was trying to destroy America's democracy. The Institute was founded on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania by Robert Strausz-Hupe, who had fled Austria in the 1920s. It was funded by the Vick's chemical company, which sponsored a large number of initiatives devoted to rolling back the New Deal. It was also clandestinely funded by the CIA. Strausz-Hupe's collaborator was another Austrian e'migre', Stefan Possony. Possony had been a member of the Fascist governments of Dollfuss and Schuschnigg, but fled in 1938 after the Nazi annexation. Possony was the co-author of nearly all of the institute's publications until he moved to the Hoover Institute at Stanford in 1961. He also continued publishing in the FPRI's Orbis magazine, and was one of the contributors to Mankind Quarterly. This was one of the leading proponents of pseudoscientific racism and eugenics. Possony also wrote books advocating the same vile policy with another White supremacist, Nathaniel Weyl. Possony claimed that Black Africans, along with the peoples of the Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia, were mentally inferior to Whites. He stated that giving them independence was high dangerous. Instead, they benefited from White rule, which was gradually improving them. Whites dedicated to overthrowing colonialism were derided as 'fashionable dupes' who would be responsible for a 'White genocide'. Possony defended William Shockley's theories on racial eugenics, which argued that spending money on welfare was wasteful, because non-White races were too inferior to improve their conditions. Possony also supported Reagan's Star Wars programme, as he believed it gave America first strike capability, and thus would allow it to win a nuclear war with Russia. Strausz-Hupe believed that America was losing the propaganda war with the Soviet Union, and demanded a series of reforms to strengthen the American propaganda machine and close the gap between Soviet and American propaganda. And when Kubrick's Cold War black comedy, Doctor Strangelove, came out, he accused the great cineaste of either being a conscious Soviet propaganda agent, or a willing dupe. Ames' article concludes Today, the Foreign Policy Research Institute proudly honors its founder Strausz-Hupe, and honors his legacy with blacklists of allegedly treasonous journalists and allegedly all-powerful Russian propaganda threatening our freedoms. This is the world the Washington Post is bringing back to its front pages. And the timing is incredible--as if Bezos' rag has taken upon itself to soften up the American media before Trump moves in for the kill. And it's all being done in the name of fighting "fake news" "and fascism. Washington Post gave a glowing front-page boost to an anonymous online blacklist of hundreds of American websites, from marginal conspiracy sites to flagship libertarian and progressive publications. As Max Blumenthal reported for AlterNet, the anonymous website argued that all of them should be investigated by the federal government and potentially prosecuted under the Espionage Act as Russian spies, for wittingly or unwittingly spreading Russian propaganda. What the Washington Post did in boosting an anonymous blacklist of American journalists accused of criminal treason is one of the sleaziest, and most disturbing (in a very familiar Kremlin way) things I've seen in this country since I fled for home. The WaPo is essentially an arm of the American deep state; its owner, Jeff Bezos, is one of the three richest Americans, worth $67 billion, and his cash cow, Amazon, is a major contractor with the Central Intelligence Agency. In other words, this is as close to an official US government blacklist of journalists as we've seen--a dark ominous warning before they take the next steps.

I followed this link just to get caught up Clinton paid around $1 million to internet trolls to turn Sanders supporters. How much money went into the Russian hacking story?" The link leads to another which denies the claim. How can I trust a source which uses links which deny it's insinuations? I do not deny Clinton dirty tricks, as a Sanders/Stein supporter but my first loyalty is to the truth. The first claim of the 1 million paid (which the links do not confirm but deny) is used as a premise for the money into the "Russian hacking story" Here is my question: if the evidence for the Russian hack is "false and faked," why did Trump then come out and say "I think it was the Russians?" before tens of millions of viewers? The FBI disclosures first worked to defeat Clinton, and the feud between Trump and the NIA then provided cover. Then Trump, now safely in power, accepts the NIA consensus. I see a web of deceit involving Putin, Assange, Trump, and the intelligence agencies, with the FBI chosen to take down Clinton, for whom they had great hatred. I can find no other explanation to untangle the web of deceit. Trump's admission changes everything....and I have provided at least a plausable explanation which shows all the actors playing their roles in an effort to 1) get Trump elected and 2) provide deniability. This is indeed how the Deep State operates. Cause regime change and then deny under a tangle of complex and confusing counterclaims and even a fake feud to lull the public and media into a false chase. I might be wrong, but all other versions collapse before the fact that Trump has now stated "I think the Russians did it." Why would I believe Trump? That is not the question: the question is why would he say this? Clearly he is part of the conspiracy, since it was he who publically asked Russia to intervene to defeat Clinton. I suggest Russia listened and all the players, from Putin to Assange to Trump to Comey played their roles in a script designed to confuse and deceive the public and the media.

This is the definitive article on this subject to date. Who among us would have thought we'd live to see the day when McCarthyism emanated from the Democrats? Their record of scare tactics and blame shifting is pathetic. Hillary Clinton lost the campaign because she couldn't beat the least popular candidate in recent history - Trump had a disapproval rating in the 60% range most of the campaign. She didn't mention jobs and failed to visit the key states in the midwest. But then again, maybe Putin did a mind control thing with Clinton to make her a bad candidate.

The FBI got it both ways: they defeated their hated adversary Clinton and then got scorched by Trump...wink wink.

It would take only 51,000 voters to change their minds in the swing states......30% of voters is 40 million who said they were less included to vote for Clinton. It would take less than 1% who actually swung to Trump to defeat Clinton. Mission accomplished as the large Clinton margin quickly collapsed after the Comey disclosures. The Russian contribution was essential, working thru intermediaries to allow Assange to deny any contact with the Russian government; from Russia with love to Donald Trump. The fake feud between Trump and the CIA/FBI was designed to cover up the conspiracy to defeat Clinton, hated by Putin, Assange, Trump, the CIA and the FBI. See my article Hacks/Schmacks for documentation. All the rest is indeed distraction, cover up, a puppet show.

As CES 2017 celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, the mega electronics event was also a record-breaker in hosting more than 600 startups and more than 175,000 industry professionals -- including 55,000 from outside the US. "Our industry is helping the world improve through connectivity and innovation, touching literally every facet of our lives. Today's connected world was on full display at CES 2017 -- our largest, boldest show in history," Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, Consumer Technology Association (CTA), told IANS. The event also showcased the connected future of technology with more than 3,800 exhibiting companies and exhibit space of more than 2.6 million net square feet. "This year's show was all about connectivity -- both in the form of the technologies unveiled and in the valuable face-to-face business connections happening throughout the show," added Karen Chupka, Senior Vice President, CES and corporate business strategy, CTA. In the field of connected cars, Intel showcased a system with Microsoft Hololens (augmented reality headset) that sent signals to the Cloud via 5G and received commands from artificial intelligence (AI) servers, taking decisions for automatic driving. "What you see here is all that needs to come together for automated driving to come a reality. At the Intel automated driving experience, the car has the sensors that are collecting information and processing it to recognise everything in its surroundings," an Intel exhibitor at the booth told IANS. In a perfect vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the car could also connect with the traffic lights which, in turn, gives less traffic congestion and safe automated driving experience with very less or no accidents. "CES 2017 was a global showcase that demonstrated that we are in a new era of innovation where technology is valued not just for the devices it produces but for the experiences it makes possible," Bridget Karlin, Managing Director, IoT, at Intel, told IANS. Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Blackberry and QNX Operating Systems, Mitsubishi and Mercedes also showcased their electric and hybrid cars. The US glass manufacturing company Corning introduced a car with Corning Gorilla Glass that provided toughness with a 30 per cent decrease in the vehicle's weight. Chip manufacturer Qualcomm introduced its newest mobile platform Snapdragon 835 processor with X16 LTE modem, which will provide high performance and enhanced power efficiency.

Not just smartphones, convertibles or cameras, it was time for ground-breaking products in 5G technology, self-driving vehicles, digital health, Artificial Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), robotics and machine learning to be showcased at the world's biggest annual electronics event here. As CES 2017 celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, the mega electronics event was also a record-breaker in hosting more than 600 startups and more than 175,000 industry professionals -- including 55,000 from outside the US. "Our industry is helping the world improve through connectivity and innovation, touching literally every facet of our lives. Today's connected world was on full display at CES 2017 -- our largest, boldest show in history," Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, Consumer Technology Association (CTA), told IANS. The event also showcased the connected future of technology with more than 3,800 exhibiting companies and exhibit space of more than 2.6 million net square feet. "This year's show was all about connectivity -- both in the form of the technologies unveiled and in the valuable face-to-face business connections happening throughout the show," added Karen Chupka, Senior Vice President, CES and corporate business strategy, CTA. In the field of connected cars, Intel showcased a system with Microsoft Hololens (augmented reality headset) that sent signals to the Cloud via 5G and received commands from artificial intelligence (AI) servers, taking decisions for automatic driving. "What you see here is all that needs to come together for automated driving to come a reality. At the Intel automated driving experience, the car has the sensors that are collecting information and processing it to recognise everything in its surroundings," an Intel exhibitor at the booth told IANS. In a perfect vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the car could also connect with the traffic lights which, in turn, gives less traffic congestion and safe automated driving experience with very less or no accidents. "CES 2017 was a global showcase that demonstrated that we are in a new era of innovation where technology is valued not just for the devices it produces but for the experiences it makes possible," Bridget Karlin, Managing Director, IoT, at Intel, told IANS. Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Blackberry and QNX Operating Systems, Mitsubishi and Mercedes also showcased their electric and hybrid cars. The US glass manufacturing company Corning introduced a car with Corning Gorilla Glass that provided toughness with a 30 per cent decrease in the vehicle's weight. Chip manufacturer Qualcomm introduced its newest mobile platform Snapdragon 835 processor with X16 LTE modem, which will provide high performance and enhanced power efficiency.

Alle Posts des Autors Email: US-Korrespondent IDG News Service Alle Posts des Autors Intels neue Storage-Technologie Optane ist spätestens seit der CES 2017 in aller Munde und verspricht für Unternehmen wie Consumer zahlreiche Vorteile. Wir sagen Ihnen, was Sie von Optane erwarten dürfen. Empfehlen Diskutieren Drucken PDF URL Xing LinkedIn Twitter Google+ Facebook Der Halbleiter-Riese Intel hat sich über die Jahre den Ruf des Geschwindigkeits-Treibers erarbeitet. Mit der neuen Speichertechnologie Optane will das Unternehmen nun noch einen Gang höher schalten. "Next big storage thing"? Dabei geht man bei Intel fest davon aus, dass Optane die heutigen SSDs im Storage-Umfeld und Hauptspeicher auf DRAM-Basis ersetzen wird. Eine Vorstellung, die in vielerlei Hinsicht verlockend ist: nicht nur was die Boot-Geschwindigkeit und Produktivität ganz allgemein angeht, sondern auch in Sachen Gaming. All diese Bereiche dürften durch Optane einen wesentlichen Performance-Boost erhalten. Ganz konkret soll Optane circa zehn Mal so schnell sein wie eine konventionelle SSD. Der Beweis für diese Behauptung unter realen Bedingungen steht indes noch aus. Auf der CES 2017 wurden bereits erste Optane-Storage-Lösungen angekündigt, allerdings vorerst nur mit geringen Kapazitäten zwischen 16 GB und 32 GB, die sich lediglich als Cache nutzen lassen. Intel will mit Optane den Storage-Turbocharger zuschalten. Wir sagen Ihnen, was Sie über die neue Technologie wissen müssen. Foto: J. Lekavicius - shutterstock.com Das dürfte sich laut Pat Kannar, Marketing Director bei Dell, mit zunehmender Reife der Technologie ändern: "Höhere Kapazitäten werden in den nächsten Jahren folgen, genauso wie neue Formfaktoren". Bis dahin, so der Experte weiter, böten die ersten Optane-Speicher willkommenen Raum für Tests und Experimente. Auch wenn Intel also seine Technologie auf der CES präsentiert hat - Optane bleibt weiterhin ein bisschen mysteriös. Wir haben für Sie alle uns bekannten Fakten zum (potenziellen) "next big storage thing" zusammengetragen, um ein wenig Licht ins Dunkel zu bringen. Was ist Intel Optane? Optane basiert auf einer Speicherttechnologie namens "3D Xpoint". Diese zeichnet sich dadurch aus, dass die Speicherzellen in eine dreidimensionale Netzstruktur eingebettet sind. Entwickelt wurde die Technologie in Kooperation mit Micron. Die ersten Optane-Produkte (16 GB und 32 GB) werden ausschließlich auf PCs laufen, die Intels neue Chipgeneration Kaby Lake an Bord haben. Skylake, Broadwell oder AMD-Chipsätze fallen in Sachen Optane also grundsätzlich aus. Letztlich wird Intel auch Optane-SSDs mit großen Kapazitäten auf den Markt bringen - mit dem Ziel, die konventionellen Solid State Disks überflüssig zu machen. Darüber hinaus wird Optane auch als DRAM-Ersatz verfügbar sein. Im Gegensatz zum dynamischen RAM ist Optane aufgrund seiner höheren Speicherdichte in der Lage, Daten auch nach dem Ausschalten eines Rechners zu behalten. Wann sind Optane-SSDs verfügbar? Laut Intel sollen erste SSDs mit Optane-Technologie zur zweiten Jahreshälfte 2017 verfügbar sein. Einige PC-Hersteller haben bereits durchblicken lassen, dass Optane-SSDs mit großen Kapazitäten noch eine ganze Weile auf sich warten lassen könnten. Es ist zudem sehr wahrscheinlich, dass diese erst einmal bei Servern zum Einsatz kommen, bevor sie ihren Weg in die Personal Computer dieser Welt finden. Derzeit testen unter anderem Facebook und IBM großvolumige Optane-SSDs in ihren Servern. Eines gleich vorweg: Wie jede neue Technologie wird auch Optane zunächst kein billiges Vergnügen darstellen. Die Optane-Storage-Lösungen entstehen derzeit in begrenzten Stückzahlen in China. Wenn die Produktion hochgefahren wird, dürften auch die Herstellungskosten sinken. SSD-Festplatten mit 480 bis 512 GB im Vergleich SSDs der 500-GB-Klasse bieten genug Platz, um ganz alleine das Betriebssystem, alle Programm und den zentralen Datenbestand zu speichern - und sind zu Preisen ab rund 150 Euro inzwischen auch bezahlbar. Wir haben für Sie die beliebtesten Varianten von 480 bis 512 Gigabyte im Vergleichs-Test. PLATZ 10: Corsair Force LX 512GB Zu den Stärken der Corsair Force LX gehören sehr hohe Datenraten und kurze Zugriffszeiten. Auch bei der Praxisleistung kann die 512-GB-SSD überzeugen. Der Lieferumfang ist hingegen dürftig und auch die Leistungsaufnahme ist durchwachsen, hier schmerzt vor allem der vergleichsweise hohe Verbrauch unter Last. Für das Gebotene ist der Preis zu hoch. PLATZ 9: Crucial MX200 500GB Beim Tempo kann die Crucial MX200 überzeugen, insbesondere die Praxisleistung und die sehr kurzen Zugriffzeiten ragen hier heraus. Weitere Pluspunkte sammelt die 500-GB-SSD durch die gute Ausstattung. Abzüge gibt es hingegen für die zu hohe Leistungsaufnahme. Für die gebotene Leistung ist die SSD preiswert, aber kein Schnäppchen. PLATZ 8: Crucial BX100 500GB Mit der BX100 bietet Crucial eine preisgünstige Solid State Drive an, die beim Tempo voll überzeugt. Positiv zu Buche schlägt auch die vergleichsweise hohe Gesamtschreibleistung von 72 Terabyte. Die Ausstattung ist hingegen durchschnittlich und auch beim Service reist das Crucial-Modell mit 36 Monaten Garantie keine Bäume aus. Minuspunkte gibt es auch für die zu hohe Leistungsaufnahme. Dafür stimmt der Preis. PLATZ 7: Transcend SSD370S 512GB Mit sehr kurzen Zugriffszeiten, einer exzellenten Praxisleistung und hohen Datenraten bietet die Transcend SSD370S durch die Bank hohes Tempo. Die Ausstattung ist gut und der Stromverbrauch niedrig. Den einzigen Schnitzer, den sich das Transcend-Modell erlaubt, ist die vergleichsweise kurze Garantiezeit von 3 Jahren - die Sie aber in Relation zur exzellenten Gesamtschreibleistung sehen sollten. Der Preis geht in Ordnung. PLATZ 6: Sandisk Extreme Pro 480GB Die Sandisk Extreme Pro überzeugt mit sehr gutem Tempo in den Praxistests, konstant hohen Transferraten und flotten Zugriffszeiten. Ein fetter Pluspunkt ist die lange Garantiezeit von 10 Jahren. In Ordnung gehen die Leistungsaufnahme und der Funktionsumfang. Negativ zu Buche schlagen der mäßige Schreibbefehlsdurchsatz und der dünne Lieferumfang. Die 480-GB-Festplatte ist aktuell zu einem Straßenpreis ab 170 Euro erhältlich - das ist noch günstig. PLATZ 5: Kingston HyperX Savage SSD 480GB Die Kingston HyperX Savage 480GB ist sehr schnell, insbesondere die ausgezeichnete Praxisleistung überzeugt. Ausstattung und Lieferumfang liegen über dem Durchschnitt. Negativ zu Buche schlagen die zu hohe Leistungsaufnahme der SSD und die vergleichsweise knickrige Herstellergarantie von nur drei Jahren. Insgesamt ist die Kingston HyperX Savage aber ihr Geld wert. Wer eine flotte SSD sucht, darf zugreifen. PLATZ 4: Crucial MX100 512GB Dank 16-nm-NAND holt sich die Crucial MX100 den Titel "Energieeffizienteste SSD ihrer Klasse". Das gilt allerdings nur für die Leistungsaufnahme unter Last, im Bereitschaftszustand verbraucht die Solid State Drive mehr Energie als die Konkurrenz. Dafür besticht das 512-GB-Modell von Crucial durch schnelle Datenraten, kurze Zugriffszeiten und hohem Befehlsdurchsatz. Ausstattung, Service und Garantiezeit sind hingegen nur Durchschnitt. PLATZ 3: Samsung SSD 850 Evo 500GB Hohe Datenraten, kurze Zugriffszeiten, niedrige Leistungsaufnahme, enorme Ausdauer, Drive-Verschlüsselung und sehr gutes Software-Paket - die Samsung 850 Evo 500GB überzeugt in allen Testkategorien. Bei einem Straßenpreis von rund 135 Euro ist die SSD auch preislich ein sehr attraktives Angebot. PLATZ 2: OCZ Vector 180 480GB Die OCZ Vector 180 480GB besticht durch sehr hohe Geschwindigkeit, Gesamtschreibleistung und Zuverlässigkeit. Hinzu kommen die kundenfreundlichen Service-Leistungen, die sehr gute Ausstattung und der innovative Stromausfall-Schutz. Letzteren erkauft sich OCZ allerdings mit einer vergleichsweise hohen Leistungsaufnahme. Bei einem Straßenpreis von aktuell rund 190 Euro für das ist die OCZ Vector 180 bekommen Sie einen beachtlichen Gegenwert fürs Geld. PLATZ 1: Samsung SSD 850 Pro 512GB Hohes Tempo, niedrige Leistungsaufnahme, enorme Ausdauer, toller Funktionsumfang und satte 10 Jahre Garantie - die Samsung 850 Pro 512GB überzeugt auf der ganzer Linie. Kein Modell im Test bietet eine so ausbalancierte Leistung. Wäre da nicht der vergleichsweise hohe Anschaffungspreis von über 200 Euro und der maue Befehlsdurchsatz bei zufälligen Schreiben - die Solid State Drive von Samsung wäre perfekt. Bei einem aktuellen Straßenpreis von 215 Euro zahlen Sie für Samsung 850 Pro 512GB momentan 45 Cent pro Gigabyte. Ob Ihnen die Samsung-SSD den Aufpreis von rund 50 Prozent wert ist - eine gute 500-GB-SSD bekommen Sie mittlerweile schon für 135 Euro - müssen Sie selber entscheiden. Welche Systeme nutzen Optane? Viele Produkte, die auf der CES 2017 vorgestellt wurden, werden die neue Storage-Technologie an Bord haben. Zunächst wird Optane allerdings erst einmal Motherboards bereichern - in Zukunft dürfen Sie dann irgendwann ihr System mit großvolumigen Optane-SSDs "pimpen". Der erste Laptop, der optional auch Intels Optane-Technologie mitbringt, wird Lenovos ThinkPad T570 sein. Der Grundpreis des Geräts (ca. 900 Dollar) dürfte dadurch allerdings um ein deutliches Maß nach oben schnellen. Auch HPs überarbeiteter Envy Curved All-in-One 34 wird im Frühjahr per Software-Update ebenfalls Optane-fähig gemacht, wie Mike Nash, Vice President of Product Management bei HP, auf Nachfrage verriet. Ein konkretes Release-Datum ließ er sich allerdings nicht entlocken. Auch Dell plant mit der Technologie: Verschiedene Laptops und Desktops sollen zur Jahresmitte 2017 mit Optane-Option zur Verfügung stehen. Acer Predator 21 X Acer zeigt den ersten Laptop mit einem Curved Screen. Das ist allerdings nicht das Einzige Highlight an diesem mobilen Gaming-Monster: Im Inneren werkeln gleich zwei Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 Grafikkarten. Dazu gibt's einen übertaktbaren Intel Core i7-Prozessor, 64 GB DDR4 RAM und bis zu vier 512 GB SSDs. Kostenpunkt: 9000 Dollar. Acer Chromebook 11 N7 Das 11,6-Zoll Chromebook 11 N7 von Acer ist in erster Linie für den Einsatz in Bildungsinstitutionen gedacht. Deswegen ist das Teil auch kompromisslos auf Widerstandsfähigkeit getrimmt. Die Technik im Inneren ist hingegen nicht sonderlich erwähnenswert, weil ziemlich überholt. Dafür gibt’s das Teil ab Februar aber auch schon ab rund 300 Euro. Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 370 Lenovos neuestes 2-in-1-Device lässt sich dank seines 360-Grad-Scharniers jederzeit vom Laptop zum Tablet transformieren. Darüber hinaus bietet das Hybrid-Gerät die neuesten Intel-Prozessoren, bis zu 16 GB RAM und ein 13,3-Zoll-Full-HD-Display. Achja: Eine SSD mit maximal 1 TB Kapazität und einen Thunderbolt 3-Port gibt's obendrauf. HP Sprout Pro Bereits vor zwei Jahren präsentierte HP die erste Version des Sprout – damals war der AR- und VR-Hype allerdings weit weniger ausgeprägt – die Menschen brauchten keinen PC, der 3D-Objekte in digitale 2D- oder 3D-Bilder umwandeln kann. Das hat sich inzwischen grundlegend geändert. Genau der richtige Zeitpunkt also, den Sprout mit aktueller Technik „vollzustopfen“ und in Sachen Abmessungen etwas zu optimieren. Im März sollen die ersten Geräte ausgeliefert werden – zum Preis gibt es noch keine Infos. HP Envy Curved All-in-One 34 Bei vielen All-in-One-PCs werden die Hardware-Komponenten hinter dem Screen verbaut. Das ein oder andere Gerät wirkt dadurch allerdings etwas – naja, nennen wir es mal „ungelenk“. Das war bislang auch bei HPs Envy AiO der Fall. Bislang. Denn in Las Vegas zeigt HP die neue, überarbeitete Version. Die Technik (unter anderem auch die neuen Intel Kaby Lake-Prozessoren) wurde nun im Standfuß des Geräts untergebracht. Die Preise sollen bei rund 1700 Dollar starten. Asus ZenBook 3 Mit dem ZenBook 3 zeigt Asus auf der CES einen Laptop, der die neueste Technik unter der Haube hat: zum Beispiel Kaby Lake-Chips, Gorilla Glass 5 und Thunderbolt 3-Ports. Dabei ist das Gerät lediglich 12,9 Millimeter dick und etwas mehr als ein Kilo schwer. Ab Mai ist das ZenBook 3 zu Preisen ab 1700 Dollar erhältlich. Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom Leidenschaftliche Smartphone-Fotografen bekommen mit dem ZenFone 3 Zoom von Asus ein neues Spielzeug. Die sonst recht unspektakuläre Technik im Inneren des Handys wird ergänzt von einem Dual-Kamerasystem, das aus zwei 12-Megapixel-Kameras besteht. An der Front sorgt eine 13-Megapixel-Kamera für hochqualitative Selfies. Das Smartphone unterstützt auch das .raw-Format und bietet vielschichtige Kamera-Einstellungsmöglichkeiten. TCL Blackberry Auch wenn die meisten Menschen die kanadische Kultmarke Blackberry längst abgeschrieben haben: TCL Communications zeigt auf der CES ein neues Smartphone. Mit mechanischer Tastatur. Die Zielsetzung des chinesischen Unternehmens ist ambitioniert: "Wir werden ein komplettes Portfolio auf die Beine stellen, um Apple und Samsung auf dem Enterprise-Markt herauszufordern", so Steve Cistulli, US-Chef von TCL. Olloclip Add-On für iPhone Die neuen Zusatz-Objektive von Olloclip sollen die fotografischen Skills von iPhone 7 und iPhone 7 Plus verbessern. Das Keyboard 5Q Sie sehen: Die weltweit erste Cloud-Tastatur. Was das bringt? Wenn bestimmte Informationen - etwa eine eingehende E-Mail - beim Keyboard ankommen, wechselt es die Farbe. So könnte man sich mehrere ressourcenfressende Browser-Tabs sparen. Neonode AirBar Bereits 2015 wurde die AirBar von Neonode erstmals angekündigt. Sein Debüt feiert das Peripheriegerät fürs MacBook Air nun auf der CES 2017. Die Airbar wird per USB an das Macbook angeschlossen und sorgt für Touchscreen-Funktionalität. Vorbestellbar ist die Airbar bereits, der Preis soll bei circa 100 Dollar liegen. Fehlt nur noch ein offizieller Termin für die Markteinführung. Armani Exchange Smartwatcheses Dass der Smartwatch-Markt rückläufig ist, scheint man beim Uhren-Giganten Fossil gelassen zu sehen: Nachdem man im letzten Jahr bereits zahlreiche schlaue Uhren namhafter Marken auf den Markt gebracht hat, folgen nun Modelle von Armani Exchange. Casio WSD-F20 Smartwatch In Las Vegas zeigt Casio die erste Smartwatch mit Android Wear 2.0. Die schlaue Uhr ist wasserdicht bis zu einer Tiefe von 50 Metern und soll auch bestens gegen Schläge und Stöße gewappnet sein. Neu ist unter anderem ein integriertes GPS. Ende April 2017 kommt die Casio Smartwatch auf den Markt, der Preis soll bei rund 500 Dollar liegen. ODG R8 & R9 Neue Mixed-Reality-Brillen aus dem Hause Osterhout Design Group wollen der Hololens zeigen, wo es lang geht: Die neuen Smartglass-Modelle R8 und R9 sind ebenfalls eigenständige Computing-Devices und unterstützen sowohl AR-, als auch VR-Apps. Dabei wiegen die smarten Brillen aber lediglich zwischen 128 und 194 Gramm und kosten bis zu 1800 Dollar. LeEco Smart Bikes Das Rad neu erfunden hat LeEco mit seinen neuen, smarten Fahrrädern zwar nicht – dafür hält jede Menge Technologie in den Fahrrädern Einzug: Navigation, Fitness-Tracking- und Kommunikations-Funktionalitäten sowie ein tracking-basierter Diebstahlschutz zeichnen die Smart Bikes aus. Ein Betriebssystem besitzen die Räder folglich auch. Nämlich BikeOS, das auf Android 6.0 basiert. Zum Preisgefüge gibt es noch keine Infos, die ersten Modelle sollen (in den USA) im zweiten Quartal 2017 erhältlich sein. Robo 3D-Drucker Die kompakten 3D-Printer von Robo verfügen über selbstjustierende Druckbetten und intuitive Touchscreens. Der Robo C2 (im Bild) ist die kleinere, leichtere Variante – wer mehr Leistung sucht, darf zum Robo R2 greifen. Reach Robotics Mekamon Die Mekamon Kampfroboter von Reach Robotics eignen sich nicht nur für ausgiebige KI-Kriege, sondern kreieren auch mit Hilfe von Augmented Reality und einem Smartphone ein immersives Single-Player-Erlebnis. Airblock Modulares Drohnenkit Aus diesem modularen Bausatz können ganz verschiedene Arten von Drohnen erstehen – etwa ein Hovercraft. In erster Linie richtet sich das Kit an Schulkinder. "Business-Kinder" dürften daran aber ebenfalls Gefallen finden. Flir Duo Wer immer schon mal eine Wärmebildkamera auf seine Drohne montieren wollte, darf ab sofort zur Flir Duo greifen. Chipolo Sticker Der Chipolo Sticker ist ein Miniatur-Bluetooth-Tracker und ideal für Menschen, die gerne Dinge verlieren. Das Device lässt sich an so gut wie allen Oberflächen anheften. Crosley Radio Vinyl Rocket Jukebox Keine Lust auf digitale Musik? Crosley Radio zeigt auf der CES den Traum aller Plattenfreaks. Die Jukebox lässt bis zu 140 Vinylplatten rotieren. Ganz ohne "moderne" Elemente geht es aber doch nicht: Gesteuert wird das Teil über eine Fernbedienung, im Inneren verrichtet ein digitaler Verstärker sein dezibelhaltiges Werk. Darüber hinaus gibt es natürlich zahllose Optionen für die Erstellung individueller Playlists. Dog & Bone Earmade System Die Wireless Earbuds von Dog & Bone lassen sich vorwärmen - für maximalen Sitz und Komfort. Sensoria Smart Socks Diese sensorbestückten Socken können unter anderem Schrittgeschwindigkeit und -Rhytmus messen und bieten GPS. In Kombination mit smarten Schuhen wird dann alles noch viel besser. HiMirror Plus Anscheinend gibt es für einen smarten Spiegel, der seinen Nutzern schonungslos jede neue Hautunreinheit und sonstige körperliche Verfehlungen unter die Nase reibt, tatsächlich einen Markt. Der Bluetooth- und WiFi-fähige HiMirror Plus tut genau das. Bis zu sechs Benutzerprofile lassen sich abspeichern – außerdem können auch die Verpackungen von Beauty-Produkten eingescannt werden, um weiterführende Informationen zu erhalten. Withings Kérastase Hair Coach Wearable-Spezialist Withings kooperiert mit der L’Oreal-Tochter Kérastase. Das Ergebnis: eine smarte Haarbürste. Das kann wahrscheinlich nur Haar-Fetischisten wirklich begeistern. Der Sinn und Zweck dahinter? Die Bürste verfügt über ein integriertes Mikrofon und zahlreiche Sensoren. Die Daten die hierbei zusammenlaufen, werden per Smartphone-App analysiert und geben Aufschluss über Haarqualität und –Beschaffenheit, die Effektivität des Kämmens und vieles mehr. Am Ende bekommt der Nutzer einen „Hair Quality Score“ und gegebenenfalls Tipps, wie sich dieser in die Höhe treiben lässt. Interessant ist dazu insbesondere die Aussage von Withings-CEO Cedric Hutchings: „Das letzte was wir wollten, war, ein simples Device in ein komplexes zu verwandeln“. Genau. FlexR Bei diesem Gadget handelt es sich um ein Stück Open-Source-Hardware, das Muskelkontraktionen maschinenlesbar macht. Das Ziel: Gamification in die Physiotherapie zu tragen. Man könnte damit aber auch Super Mario mit den Bauchmuskeln spielen. Grush Gamification-Zahnbürste Mundhygiene ist bei Kindern ja oft weniger beliebt. Damit soll nun Schluss sein – dank der smarten Zahnbürste von Grush. Denn mit Hilfe einer Smartphone-App und der Augmented-Reality-Technologie wird das Zähneputzen zum Videospiel. Kingston Data Traveler Ultimate GT Kingston zeigt in Las Vegas den bislang größten USB-Stick aller Zeiten. Die 2TB-Monstrosität besitzt nicht nur die Nomenklatur eines Sportwagens, sie bietet auch Platz für rund 70 Stunden 4K-Videomaterial. Der Preis dürfte bei circa 900 Dollar liegen. Und wer es eine Nummer kleiner mag: Ein 1TB-Modell ist ebenfalls geplant. SanDisk Extreme Pro USB-Stick Dieser USB-Stick aus dem Hause SanDisk bietet 256 GB Speicherkapazität und kommt mit USB 3.1. Damit dürfte er in Sachen Speed auf SSD-Niveau liegen. Fasetto Link Dieser unscheinbare kleine Kasten vereint LTE-Hotspot und NAS. Befeuert wird das Device von einem Samsung Exynos Octacore-Prozessor. Dazu stehen bis zu 2TB SSD-Speicher zur Verfügung. Auch Bluetooth- und USB-C-Support sind an Bord. Smarter Kühlschrank-Kamera Gadgets wie diese Smartcam zur Kühlschranküberwachung von Smarter werden oft belächelt. Aber mal ganz ehrlich: Wissen Sie immer aus dem Stegreif, was sie gerade an Lebensmitteln brauchen beziehungsweise nicht brauchen? Eben. In Zukunft genügt ein Blick aufs Smartphone, um sich Klarheit zu verschaffen. Coros Linx Smart Biking Helmet Musik auf dem Bike hören ohne Ohrstöpsel und Gefahren? Dieser smarte Fahrradhelm von Coros soll es möglich machen. Dazu nutzt das Device die Leitfähigkeit menschlicher Knochen. So bleiben die Ohren trotz Charts-Beschallung frei für Umwelteinflüsse. Gesteuert wird das Teil über eine Fernbedienung, die Augen bleiben also auf der Strasse. Das war es aber noch nicht in Sachen Sicherheit: Ein integriertes Notfall-System sorgt dafür, dass ein Alert an einen Notfallkontakt verschickt wird, sobald die Sensoren einen Aufprall wahrnehmen. Abgerundet wird das smarte Paket für Fahrrad-Freaks von einer Smartphone App mit allerlei Tracking-Möglichkeiten. Aluma Personal Safety Device Dieses Gadget tut was für die persönliche Sicherheit. Das Device von Alumi wird (beispielsweise) auf der Rückseite eines Smartphones befestigt und macht bei Aktivierung Panik bei potenziellen Angreifern, in Form eines Alarmtons der rund 135 Dezibel erreichen soll. Helle Lichtblitze und die automatische Notrufbetätigung gehören ebenfalls zum Funktionsumfang. Samsung QLED Smart TVs Bei den Smart TVs sieht es ganz ähnlich aus wie bei den Smartphones: jedes Jahr kommen unzählige neue Modelle auf den Markt - natürlich mit durchweg revolutionären Neuerungen. Genau so soll es sich laut Samsung nun auch mit der Smart-TV-Modellpalette für 2017 verhalten. Dazu hat man auch ein neues Kunstwort kreiert: QLED. Das Q steht dabei für "Quantum Dot" und soll noch schärfere, farbechtere Bilderlebnisse gewährleisten. LG OLED Smart TVs Wenn es um die OLED-Technologie geht, ist LG ohne Frage Pionier. Auf der CES zeigen die Koreaner nun ihre neue Modellfamilie. Die OLED-TVs der W-Serie zeichnen sich dabei insbesondere durch ihre „skinny“ Gehäuse aus: Das 65-Zoll-Modell ist lediglich 2,57 Millimeter dick. Sony Bravia OLED-TVs Nachdem Sony bereits seit längerem OLED-Geräte für den Profi-Einsatz anbietet, wagt man sich auf der CES erstmals auf die Consumer-Bühne. Das dürfte zwar kein günstiger Spaß werden, aber die Präsentation der neuen Highend-Smart TVs war in Sachen Bildqualität schon mal ziemlich beeindruckend. Nox Smart Sleep Light Das smarte Schlaflicht von Nox wiegt Sie mit Licht- und Musikspielen in den Schlaf. Vorher analysiert es dazu ihre "persönliche Body Clock" und kennt anschließend Ihre Schlafgewohnheiten. Die Aussendung von roten Lichtstrahlen soll die Ausschüttung des Schlafhormons Melatonin begünstigen. Petcube Bites Petcube präsentiert Bites: Eine interaktive Kamera mit Snackspender-Funktion. Für Ihr Haustier versteht sich. Vivint Sky Im Bereich Smart Home werden auf der CES wie gewohnt ebenfalls etliche Neuerungen vorgestellt. Zum Beispiel Vivints Komplettsystem namens Sky. Das soll dank Cloud-Anbindung und künstlicher Intelligenz jeglichen Konfigurationsaufwand im automatisierten Zuhause eliminieren, weil es sich automatisch an Umgebung und Bewohner anpasst. Gesteuert wird über ein iPad-eskes Controlpanel. Im zweiten Quartal 2017 soll das Sky-System verfügbar sein. Geplant sind unter anderem eine Video-Türklingel, eine Security Kamera, Sensoren für Fenster und Türen, ein smartes Thermostat und ein Smartlock. GeniCan Scanner Sogar der Mülleimer wird demnächst smart: Am "Müll-Scanner" von GeniCan können Sie die Barcodes auf den Verpackungen verbrauchter Lebensmittel scannen, um eine Instant-Einkaufsliste zu erzeugen. Samsung Family Hub 2 Auch Samsung sattelt im Bereich Hausautomatisierung weiter auf: Auf der letztjährigen CES präsentierten die Koreaner erstmals ihren smarten Kühlschrank Family Hub. Aktuell gibt es nun den Nachfolger zu sehen. Der Family Hub 2 verfügt nun über Innenkameras, die das smarte Food Management weiter verbessern sollen. Außerdem bietet der schlaue Kühlschrank nun auch Sprachausgabe für die integrierte Rezept-App. Künftig kann man sich also ganz aufs "Machen" konzentrieren. Sprachbefehle nimmt der Family Hub 2 natürlich ebenfalls gerne auf. Samsung Flexwash & Flexdry Wenn Sie eine große Familie und eine Menge Geld haben, könnte Samsungs smartes Wäscheduo Flexwash und Flexdry genau das Richtige sein. Der Clou: beide Geräte nehmen gleich zwei Ladungen Wäsche auf und lassen sich aus der Ferne per Smartphone-App steuern. "Umladen" muss man aber trotzdem noch selbst. Samsung Powerbot VR7000 Einen neuen, superflachen Staubsaugerroboter haben die Koreaner ebenfalls im CES-Gepäck. Der Powerbot VR7000 verspricht dank zahlreicher Sensoren besonders gründliche Reinigung. Gesteuert wird wie üblich per App - zudem kann der Saugroboter auch über Amazons Alexa integriert werden. Ossia Cota Bislang hieß "wireless charging" meist "Ladekissen". Das soll sich nun ändern. Diese smarte Deckenkachel von Ossia soll künftig für kabellose Power-Versorgung sämtlicher Devices sorgen. Lenovo Smart Assistant Zuwachs im Bereich der persönlichen, digitalen Assistenten: Auch Lenovo will nun mitmischen und zeigt auf der CES seinen Smart-Home-Lautsprecher. Der kann beispielsweise im Web nach Infos suchen, Musik abspielen, kalenderbasierte Erinnerungen auslösen oder Listen kreieren. Smart-Home-Geräte von Drittherstellern sollen ebenfalls unterstützt werden. LG Hub Robot Das Trendthema Smart Home hat man auch bei LG verinnerlicht: Der Hub Robot – und sein kleinerer Bruder, der Hub Robot Mini – sind Hausautomatisierungs-Hub, Roboter und persönlicher Assistent in einem. Über das Display können die KI-Genossen sowohl „Emotionen“ als auch Videos abspielen. Fortress Unified Threat Management Endlich scheint Bewegung reinzukommen, wenn es um das Thema Smart-Home-Sicherheit geht. Fortress präsentiert auf der CES sein UTM-System. Das bietet nicht nur einen großen Touchscreen für Steuerung und Konfiguration, sondern auch ein Intrusion Detection und -Prevention-System, eine Firewall und Antivirus-Software für alle über WiFi, LAN und das IoT vernetzten Devices. Außerdem steht den Kunden auch ein 24-Stunden-"Instant-Response-Service" zur Verfügung. TouchLock BLE Nie wieder Schlüssel verlieren. Oder suchen. Das verspricht dieses Smartlock von Bio-key, das via Bluetooth Low Energy mit dem Smartphone gekoppelt wird. Entsperren lässt sich das Schloss nicht nur per Passworteingabe, sondern auch über den Fingerabdruckscanner (falls vorhanden). Securifi Almond 3+ Dieser Wireless Acess Point vereint WiFi- und IoT-Funktionalität. Darüber hinaus bietet der Hersteller einen Service an, mit dem Smart-Home-Geräte vor der berüchtigten Mirai-Malware geschützt sein sollen. Bitdefender Box v2 Im April 2015 stellte Bitdefender die erste Version seiner Box vor. Zweck: Vernetzte Devices vor Hackern schützen. Die auf der CES 2017 gezeigte Box v2 kommt nun mit überarbeitetem Design und neuer Technik: ein Dualcore ARM-Prozessor und 1GB RAM sorgen für Performance. Die Box überprüft mit Hilfe von Machine Learning sämtlichen Traffic im Netzwerk und darüber hinaus, ob die Gerätschaften mit ausreichend starken Passwörtern geschützt sind. Werden Unregelmäßigkeiten bemerkt, bekommen die Nutzer einen Alert per Smartphone-App. Ecovacs Unibot Der Unibot von Ecovacs Robotics ist nicht nur Saugroboter, sondern auch Luftreiniger und -befeuchter. Darüber hinaus bemerkt der Bot dank zahlreicher Sensoren auch, wenn sich (unerwünschte) Personen im Haus aufhalten. eBlocker Um die Sicherheit geht es auch bei diesem Gerät namens eBlocker. Das Teil hängt sich in Ihr Heimnetzwerk, blockt unerwünschte Ads und versteckt die IP-Adressen sämtlicher im Netzwerk befindlicher Geräte. D-Link Smart Home Kameras D-Link zeigt in Las Vegas mehrere neue Security-Kameras fürs vernetzte Zuhause. Die zeichnen sich in erster Linie durch ein erschwingliches Preisgefüge aus und sollen laut Hersteller für eine weitere Vebreitung von vernetzten Sicherheitskameras sorgen. Ring Floodlight Cam Mit dieser Smart-Home-Security-Kamera zeigt Ring auf der CES 2017 sein bislang „aggressivstes“ Produkt in diesem Bereich: Die Kombination aus Bewegungsmelder und Kamera ermöglicht die Kommunikation mit (un)gebetenen Gästen, wirft bei Bedarf 100 Dezibel feinster Sirenenklänge in Richtung Trommelfell. Die Full-HD-Kamera deckt einen Blickwinkel von 270 Grad ab und bietet auch eine Nachtsicht-Funktion. Samsung Wisenet Smartcam A1 Samsungs Wisenet-System besteht aus jeweils einer smarten Kamera für den Innen- und Außenbereich. Maximus Security Kamera Wer etwas mehr Sicherheit benötigt, der darf mit dem "Smart Motion Security Light" von Maximus im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes Licht ins Dunkel bringen. Das Device vereint Security-Kamera und Bewegungsmelder und lässt sich per App oder auch über Amazons Alexa steuern. Das integrierte Flutlicht leistet satte 2400 Lumen - genug um einen ganzen Gefängnishof auszuleuchten. TytoHome Telehealth Kit Künftig muss man wegen einer Erkältung nicht mehr zum Arzt rennen - zumindest wenn es nach TytoCare geht. Das Telehealth-Kit ermöglicht die digitale Übermittlung von Gesundheitsinformationen an den Doktor des Vertrauens. Der bekommt alle Infos in komprimierter Form - die Datenanalyse und -Übertragung übernimmt eine Smartphone-App. Zigbee DotDot Als großer Wurf für das Smart Home könnte sich die Entscheidung der ZigBee-Alliance erweisen, künftig eine einheitliche Sprache für IoT-Gerätschaften etablieren zu wollen. Diese hört auf den Namen DotDot und soll endlich dafür sorgen, dass sich Devices verschiedenster Hersteller endlich einwandfrei "verstehen". Intel Kaby Lake Chips Bereits im August 2016 hatte Intel die ersten Dualcore Kaby Lake-Chips für Notebooks enthüllt. Auf der CES kündigte der Hableiter-Riese nun ganze 40 neue Quadcore-Chips an, die für alle möglichen Zwecke (und Devices) eingesetzt werden können. Darüber hinaus unterstützen die neuen Chips auch Intels Storage-Technologie Optane. HDMI 2.1 Haben Sie gerade einen neuen Smart TV gekauft? Dann sollten Sie sich damit anfreunden, dass der schon wieder zum alten Eisen gehört. Also mehr als sonst. Denn die HDMI Licensing Group hat den neuen HDMI 2.1-Standard enthüllt. Dieser bietet nun Support für HDR, sowie 4K- und 8K-Videomaterial. Auch die neuen Audio-Codecs Dolby Atmos und DTS-X werden unterstützt. Faraday Future FF 91 Natürlich ist auch die Automotive-Branche wieder auf der CES in Las Vegas vertreten. Unter anderem Faraday Future, die einen Prototypen ihres kommenden Elektro-SUV FF 91 zeigen. Der schafft den Spurt von 0 auf 100 km/h schneller als beispielsweise ein Ferrari 458 oder das Tesla Model S. Toyota Concept-i Auch der weltgrößte Autobauer Toyota zeigt auf der CES seine Vision vom autonomen Fahren. Dabei verfolgt Toyota eine etwas andere Strategie: der Mensch soll von einem KI-Assistenten unterstützt werden. Dieser Assistent heißt im futuristischen Toyota-Konzept Yui und kommuniziert mit den Insassen zum Beispiel über Licht- und Audiosignale, aber auch über Touch. Darüber hinaus analysiert die KI auch die Aufmerksamkeit und Stimmung des Fahrers, um anschließend wertvolle Tipps zu geben. Das soll vor allem der Fahrsicherheit zu Gute kommen. Hyundai Ioniq Auch die Koreaner von Hyundai können autonom. Das beweisen sie auf der CES mit dem Ioniq. Das Fahrzeug ist in der Lage, vollständig autonom zu fahren, erkennt Lichtsignale, Kurven, andere Autos und Fußgänger über Laser-Sensoren, die die Umgebung des Autos abtasten. Die so gewonnenen Daten werden mit einer detaillierten 3D-Karte abgeglichen. Fiat Chrysler Portal Concept Fiat Chrysler zeigt auf der CES ein Concept Car namens Portal. Das soll nach Willen des Konzerns in erster Linie Millennials begeistern. Dazu bietet das Concept Car umfassende Konnektivitäts-Optionen, jede Menge flache Bildschirme und ausreichend Platz für bis zu sechs Personen. Wie bei Konzeptstudien in der Autowelt so üblich, kommt auch der Portal mit futuristischen Design-Merkmalen ums Eck. Ob diese dann beim Serienmodell umgesetzt werden können (und ob es überhaupt ein Serienmodell gibt), ist eine andere Frage. Volkswagen ID Volkswagen hat anlässlich der 50. CES eine App programmiert. Die soll den Besuchern des Messestandes ermöglichen, zu erleben "wie Mensch, Auto und Umwelt künftig im Volkswagen Ecosystem über die Volkswagen User-ID intelligent miteinander vernetzt werden." Die VW User-ID ist dabei vergleichbar mit der Apple- oder Windows-ID und ermöglicht die fahrzeugübergreifende Mitnahme persönlicher Einstellungen und Präferenzen. Intel Go Intel kündigte auf der CES seinen neuen Supercomputer für das Connected Car an. Der trägt den simplen Namen "Go", berherbergt bis zu 28 Xeon-Chips. Auch Atom- und 5G-Versionen sind geplant. Zum Einsatz kommen wird Intels Go erstmals im Rahmen eines Testlaufs in diesem Jahr. Sorgt Intel Optane für ein HDD-Revival? Klingt komisch, könnte aber tatsächlich der Fall sein - zumindest in der Anfangszeit. Die Kombination aus Optane und konventioneller HDD könnte sich aus Kostengründen lohnen, wie Pat Kannar von Dell sagt: "Ein PC mit Festplatte und Optane-Cache könnte Betriebssystem und Applikationen schneller laden als ein System, das ausschließlich auf SSDs setzt. Dazu müsste ein Image des OS und der Applikationen im Optane-Cache abgelegt werden. Das dürfte in einigen Fällen vor allen Dingen billiger als ein reines SSD-System sein." Die Kombination aus Optane-Cache und SSD-Hauptspeicher ist im Vergleich natürlich noch einmal wesentlich schneller, aber eben auch wesentlich teurer. 1968 - 2000: U-matic Bevor die VHS-Kassetten ihren Siegeszug antreten, entwickelt Sony bereits Ende der 1960er Jahre das erste Videokassetten-System namens U-Matic. In erster Linie für den Business-Markt gedacht, etablieren Sony, Panasonic und JVC U-Matic ab 1971 auch auf dem Consumer-Markt, wo es zunächst mit dem VCR-System von Grundig und Philips konkurriert. Erhältlich sind die U-Matic-Bänder in einem kompakten (und weit verbreiteten) Format mit 20 Minuten Laufzeit und als Standard-Kassetten mit bis zu 75 Minuten Laufzeit. Auch wenn U-Matic sich aufgrund der fehlenden Consumer-Akzeptanz letztlich nicht gegen VHS durchsetzen kann, bleibt das System vor allem in der Kreativ- und Medienbranche im Einsatz, bevor es Ende der 1980er vielerorts von Betacam SP abgelöst wird. 1970 - 1978: Television Electronic Disc Die beiden deutschen Elektronik-Konzerne Telefunken und Teldec schließen sich Anfang der 1970er zusammen, um dem aufkeimenden Video-Markt den Wind aus den Segeln zu nehmen. Gelingen soll das mit der Bildplatte - oder Television Electronic Disc (TED). Die Scheiben mit einem Durchmesser von etwa 20 Zentimetern fassen zur Markteinführung 1975 maximal zehn Minuten Videomaterial pro Seite. Gegen die VHS-Kassette kann sich die Bildplatte ebensowenig durchsetzen wie VCR oder Betamax. Telefunken selbst versetzt der Television Electronic Disc schließlich den Todesstoß, als man Ende 1978 beginnt, VHS-Geräte herzustellen. 1971 - 1979: VCR-Kassette Die europäische Lösung für den boomenden Videomarkt heißt 1971 VCR. Grundig und Philips entwickeln die Bandtechnologie, die sich unter anderem durch zwei Tonkanäle und eine Laufzeit von zunächst 65 Minuten auszeichnet. Auf dem Consumer-Markt ist das VCR-System durchaus erfolgreich - bis JVC mit seinem VHS-System der Durchbruch gelingt. 1979 - 1986: Video 2000 Um der wachsenden VHS-Konkurrenz Herr zu werden, versuchen Grundig und Philips 1979 mit dem VCR-Nachfolger Video 2000 im Rennen um die Video-Vorherrschaft zu punkten. Neue, beidseitig bespielbare Kassetten ermöglichen Laufzeiten von maximal 16 Stunden. Weil JVC Lizenzen zur Herstellung von VHS-Geräten jedoch deutlich günstiger vergibt, ist der "Krieg der Videoformate" Anfang der 1980er Jahre längst entschieden. 1985 beschließen Grundig und Philips, die Produktion von Video 2000-Geräten und -Datenträgern einzustellen. 1976 - 2016: Betamax Auch Sony mischt im Krieg der Videoformate mit. Mit Betamax wollen die Japaner das Rennen machen. Im Gegensatz zum von vorneherein für professionelle Anwender gedachten U-Matic-Format ist Betamax ausschließlich für den Consumer-Markt konzipiert. Betamax-Kassetten sind mit Laufzeiten von 30 bis 215 Minuten erhältlich. Von allen VHS-Konkurrenz-Formaten kann sich Betamax am längsten halten. Bis 2002 werden Abspielgeräte produziert, Betamax-Bänder sind bis heute erhältlich. Allerdings kündigt Sony Ende 2015 an, die Herstellung der Bänder zum März 2016 einzustellen. 1978 - 2001: Laserdisc Das erste optische Speichermedium für Videos kommt 1978 auf den Markt: Discovision. Die beidseitig bespielbaren Scheiben mit einem Durchmesser von circa 30 Zentimetern bieten Laufzeiten von bis zu 120 Minuten. Die Videoqualität bewegt sich bereits in etwa auf dem Level der wesentlich später eingeführten DVD. Die Firma Pioneer vermarktet die Technologie ab 1981 unter der Bezeichnung Laserdisc. Das mit analogem Video- und digitalem Audiomaterial befüllte Medium ist insbesondere in Japan sehr erfolgreich. In den USA und Europa verhindern unter anderem hohe Preise für Abspielgeräte und die Discs selbst eine hohe Verbreitung. Im Jahr 2001 erscheinen in Japan die letzten Filme auf Laserdisc - bei Cineasten und Sammlern ist das Medium bis heute sehr gefragt. 1987 - 2005: Digital Audio Tape Mit dem Digital Audio Tape (DAT) will Sony ab 1987 den Nachfolger der Audiokassette etablieren. Die Audioqualität eines DAT ist in etwa vergleichbar mit der einer Audio-CD. Als maßgebliches Verbreitungshemmnis gilt der implementierte Kopierschutz, der das einfach Kopieren eines DAT verhindert. Zudem sind DAT-Abspielgeräte im Vergleich zu Minidisc- oder CD-Playern deutlich teurer. Im professionellen Bereich kommt das Digital Audio Tape bis heute zum Einsatz - vor allem in Tonstudios und Radiostationen. 1991 - 1998: CD-i Ende 1991 versucht Philips mit dem CD-i auf dem Markt für Spielkonsolen Fuß zu fassen. Dazu kreiert man nicht nur die Konsole CD-i, sondern - in Kooperation mit Sony - auch das dazu passende Medium: die Compact Disc Interactive. Dieses Format erlaubt die Koexistenz von Audio- und Dateninhalten auf einer Compact Disc. Genutzt wird das Format in erster Linie für Lernprogramme und enorm schlechte Games. Den Massenmarkt erreicht Philips mit dem CD-i-Projekt so nicht und Gamer verschmähen das Gerät geradezu. Auch das Engagement zahlreicher Dritthersteller wie Sony, Panasonic, Grundig, Bang & Olufsen oder Kyocera - die allesamt ebenfalls CD-i-Abspielgeräte anbieten - kann das CD-Derivat nicht retten. Lediglich im Bildungssektor können CD-i-Anwendungen kleine Erfolge verbuchen. Gerüchteweise setzen einige Fahrschulen mit extrem verkrusteten Digitalitäts-Strukturen beim theoretischen Unterricht noch heute auf das CD-i. 1992 - 1996: Digital Compact CAssette Nachdem die Compact Disc die bis dahin verbreiteten Musik-Kassetten weitgehend verdrängt hat, bringen Philips und Panasonic die Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) auf den Markt. Gegenüber ihrer analogen Vorgängerin kann die DCC mit einer deutlich besseren Klangqualität punkten. Im Vergleich zu den damals aktuellen Konkurrenz-Formaten (CD, MP3, Minidisc) ist die Handhabung jedoch deutlich komplizierter. Auch im professionellen Bereich bleibt der DCC der Durchbruch versagt. 1992 - 2011: Minidisc Nachdem Sony mit dem DAT-Format auf dem Consumer-Markt scheitert, versuchen die Japaner mit der magneto-optischen Minidisc den nächsten großen Datenträger-Wurf zu landen. Bis zu 80 Minuten Audiomaterial fasst eine Minidisc, die zudem unempfindlich gegenüber Schmutz und Staub ist. In Europa und den USA kann sich der Datenträger dennoch nicht durchsetzen - zu groß ist die Konkurrenz durch CD und später MP3. In Japan ist die Minidisc hingegen ähnlich populär wie die Compact Disc in Deutschland. Bis Ende des Jahres 2011 vertreibt lediglich Sony noch MD-Abspielgeräte, bevor die Produktion schließlich endgültig eingestellt wird. 1994 - 2016: Zip-Diskette Mitte der 1990er versucht Iomega (heute Lenovo EMC) mit der Zip-Diskette den Nachfolger der Floppy Disk zu etablieren. Das Rezept scheint zunächst aufzugehen: CD-Brenner sind zu dieser Zeit unerschwinglich, die Bandbreiten verhindern die Versendung großer Datenmengen über das Internet. Die Zip-Diskette füllt diese Lücke zunächst sehr gut. Mit bis zu 750 MB Speicherkapazität lassen sich (zu dieser Zeit) astronomische Datenmengen speichern. Leider machen die zugehörigen (internen und externen) Laufwerke durch fatale Hardware-Fehler von sich reden. Günstige CD-Brenner, USB-Sticks und Speicherkarten sorgen ab der Jahrtausendwende schließlich dafür, dass die Zip-Diskette auf dem Massenmarkt keine Rolle mehr spielt. Im Einsatz sind die Datenträger allerdings bis heute: Verschiedene Unternehmen der Luftfahrtbranche nutzen die Datenträger immer noch für ihre Navigations-Datenbanken. 1996 - 2002: Smart Media Card Im Jahr 1996 steckt die Flash-Technologie noch in den Kinderschuhen. Bei Toshiba stellt man zu diesem Zeitpunkt ein neues Flash-Speichermedium vor: die Smart Media Card. Bis zu 128 MB beträgt die Kapazität der Karten, die vor allem wegen ihrer Störanfälligkeit nur eine geringe Verbreitung finden. Im Jahr 2002 bekommt der Datenträger auch noch einen - nicht minder erfolglosen - Nachfolger. 1997 - 2003: Superdisk Bevor sich die CD-ROM zum Leitmedium auf dem PC-Markt aufschwingt, konkurrieren mehrere Formate darum, die Nachfolge der guten alten Diskette anzutreten. Das von Imation und Matsushita entwickelte, Medium Superdisk besitzt eine Speicherkapazität von bis zu 240 MB. Leider sind die ersten Laufwerke fehlerbehaftet, zudem ist das Konkurrenzprodukt - die Zip-Diskette von Iomega - bereits länger auf dem Markt. Als CD-Brenner schließlich für die Massen erschwinglich werden, verschwinden beide designierte Disketten-Nachfolger vom Markt. 1999 - 2003: Clik-Diskette Auch das nächste proprietäre Speichersystem von Iomega kann sich nicht durchsetzen. Clik-Disketten fassen 40 MB Daten und zeichnen sich vor allem durch ihre Größe aus: mit einem Durchmesser von 5 Zentimetern und einem Gewicht von 15 Gramm sind die Magnetspeicher durchaus handlich - den gerade aufkommenden USB-Sticks und Speicherkarten haben sie jedoch nichts entgegenzusetzen. 1999 - 2010: Versatile Multilayer Disc Im Jahr 1999 entwickelt New Medium Enterprises die Versatile Multilayer Disc (VMD). Anfang der 2000er-Jahre soll die VMD sich schließlich gegen Blu-ray Disc und HD-DVD durchsetzen und zum DVD-Nachfolger avancieren. Mit einer Speicherkapazität von maximal 20 GB (theoretisch 100 GB) ist die VMD sowohl HD-DVD als auch Blu-ray deutlich unterlegen. Kurz vor der geplanten Markteinführung im Jahr 2007 wird es dann still um die VMD - und das hat sich bis heute nicht geändert. Seit 2010 sind sämtliche Hersteller-Websites nicht mehr erreichbar. 2002 - 2009: xD-Picture Card Die Foto-Riesen Olympus und Fujifilm tun sich im Jahr 2002 zusammen, um einen Nachfolger der glücklosen Smart Media Card zu etablieren: die xD-Picture Card. Hergestellt werden die bis zu 2 GB fassenden NAND-Flash-Karten von Toshiba und Samsung. Die Abkürzung xD steht im Übrigen für "Extreme Digital". Gegenüber einer SD-Karte ist die xD-Picture Card allerdings deutlich teurer, was wohl der Hauptgrund dafür ist, dass die xD-Karten langsam aber sicher in der Bedeutungslosigkeit versinken. 2005 - 2008: HD-DVD Im Jahr 2005 fechten zwei neue Datenträger den Kampf um die HD-Vorherrschaft und die Nachfolge der DVD aus. Zu den Unterstützern der bis zu 51 GB (Blu-ray Disc: 128 GB) fassenden HD-DVD gehören neben Toshiba, NEC, Intel und IBM auch Microsoft und HP. Als Anfang 2008 mehrere Film-Riesen (darunter Time Warner, Senator Film und das US-Pornostudio Digital Playground) ihre Untersützung für die HD-DVD einstellen, ist das Schicksal des Datenträgers besiegelt: Weitere Händler stellen den Verkauf von HD-DVDs ein, woraufhin Toshiba - das die meisten Abspielgeräte auf den Markt gebracht hatte - die Herstellung und den Vertrieb von HD-DVDs und Abspielgeräten offiziell einstellt. Der Kampf gegen die Blu-ray (forciert unter anderem von Sony, Panasonic, Pioneer, LG und Samsung) ist damit verloren. 2005 - 2011: Universal Media Disc Mit der Universal Media Disc (UMD) schafft Sony 2005 für seine gerade neu entwickelte Handheld-Konsole Playstation Portable ein eigenes Speichermedium. Die UMD erinnert optisch an die Minidisc, fasst maximal 1,8 GB Daten und dient als Medium für Spiele, Filme und Musik. Mit der nächsten Generation der tragbaren Sony-Konsole wird die UMD fallen gelassen wie die sprichwörtliche, heiße Kartoffel. Welche Betriebssysteme unterstützen Optane? Um es mit den Worten von Intel zu sagen: "Software muss angepasst werden, um effektiv mit Optane zu laufen". Die PC-Hersteller wiederum halten es für wahrscheinlich, dass Windows 10 für den Einsatz von Optane bereit ist - nicht zuletzt dank Intel Drivern und Technologien wie RST (Rapid Storage Technology), die eine optimale Nutzung der Storage-Technologie versprechen. Ob Linux und macOS Optane in einem ähnlichen "Plug and Play"-Maß unterstützen werden, bleibt hingegen fraglich. Speziell Linux ist bekannt dafür, Support für neue Technologien erst recht spät zur Verfügung zu stellen. Mit Material von IDG News Service. Uwe Müller, Head of Sales & PreSales Datacenter, ; Cisco "Der Einsatz von immer mehr Applikationen führt verstärkt zu einer dezentralen Datenhaltung, die eine dezentrale Verarbeitung erfordert. Das äußert sich beispielsweise in der Zunahme virtueller Desktops oder durch zunehmende Dezentralität von Infrastruktur-Bestandteilen." Lars Göbel, Leiter Vertrieb & IT-Services, DARZ GmbH „Steigende Anforderungen an Speicherumgebungen erfordern von Storage-Systemen auch zukünftig mehr Leistung als bisher. IT-Verantwortliche sollten daher im nächsten Jahr verstärkt auf das Thema All Flash setzen, das auch durch die zunehmende Verbreitung von SSD-Speichermedien weiter an Bedeutung gewinnt." Hans Schramm Field Product Manager Enterprise Dell bei Dell EMC "Die IT hat begonnen sich zu wandeln: von einem klassischen IT-Stack mit Applikation, Betriebssystem, Hypervisor, Server, Network und Storage hin zu konvergenten oder sogar hyperkonvergenten Strukturen. Server lassen sich als Universallösung nutzen und werden vermehrt auch im Bereich Storage eingesetzt." Stefan Roth, Head of Storage, Category Management Datacentre Central Europe, Fujitsu "Flash-Storage ist weiter auf dem Vormarsch, sowohl All-Flash als auch Hybrid-Flash. Darüber hinaus wird Software Defined Storage aufgrund der höheren Anforderungen an die Skalierbarkeit sowie größerer Komplexität und Kosten immer wichtiger werden." Florian Bettges, Category Manager Storage, Hewlett Packard Enterprise "Fortschrittliche Analytics-Anwendungen werden in immer mehr Unternehmen zu einem wichtigen Teil der Geschäftsstrategie und verändern damit grundlegend die Anforderungen, die an Storage-Lösungen gestellt werden." Jürgen A. Krebs, CTO für die Region EMEA von Hitachi Data Systems "Die wichtigsten Themen sind hier Agilität und Flexibilität. Unternehmen gehen dazu verstärkt den Weg in die (Private) Cloud. Gleichzeitig ändert sich das Kaufverhalten der Kunden. Sie wollen zunehmend klassische Investitionen (Capex) durch laufende Betriebsausgaben (Opex) ersetzen, was im Storage-Bereich verbrauchsabhängige Abrechnungsmodelle erfordert.“ Ralf Colbus, Leading Storage Professional, IBM „Wenn in Zukunft ein Service angefordert wird, wird es unwichtig sein, ob dieser on-premise oder off-premise ausgeführt wird. Ein IT-Verantwortlicher muss sich also auf Hybrid-Services ausrichten. Die Cloud wirkt dann als erweitertes Rechenzentrum." Peter Wüst, Senior Director Emerging Solutions & Innovation Group EMEA, NetApp "Flash ist Standard. Daten werden immer mehr und wichtiger und daher wird die Kompetenz im Datenmanagement wichtiger. Die sichere und einfache Verschiebung von Daten für Cloud-Workloads ist eine Anforderung an moderne Speichersysteme. Objektstorage und skalierbarer Cloudstorage (onpremise/offpremise) werden als weitere Storageklassen eingeführt. Flash ersetzt SAS als Storagetier.“ Joachim Berger, Sales Director DACH bei Nimble Storage „Wir haben in diesem Jahr eine stetig wachsende Anzahl an Unternehmen gesehen, die damit beginnen, Flash- und All-Flash-Technologien in ihre Rechenzentren zu integrieren. Diese Technologien benötigen vorausschauende Analyse-Möglichkeiten, um Ausfallzeiten auf ein Minimum zu reduzieren und für eine optimale Verfügbarkeit von Anwendungen und Daten zu sorgen.“ Thomas Muggendobler, Product Manager Storage, Thomas-Krenn AG „All-Flash-Systeme werden auch bei mittleren und größeren Kapazitäten die mechanischen Festplatten weiter verdrängen. Wir stellen vor allem fest, dass bei den Anwendern neben den stark gefallenen Anschaffungspreisen auch die deutlich niedrigeren Betriebskosten in den Fokus rücken.“ Artikel als PDF kaufen Newsletter 'Produkte+Technologien' bestellen!   comments powered by Disqus Digital Leader Award COMPUTERWOCHE und Dimension Data suchen für den Digital Leader Award die besten Digitalisierungsprojekte im Lande.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Connected Cars, 5G Technology, VR Gaming Dominated CES 2017 Posted: Jan 11 2017, 1:52am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | CES   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Not just smartphones, convertibles or cameras, it was time for ground-breaking products in 5G technology, self-driving vehicles, digital health, Artificial Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), robotics and machine learning to be showcased at the world's biggest annual electronics event here. Don't Miss: Top 100 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 Photos As CES 2017 celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, the mega electronics event was also a record-breaker in hosting more than 600 startups and more than 175,000 industry professionals -- including 55,000 from outside the US. "Our industry is helping the world improve through connectivity and innovation, touching literally every facet of our lives. Today's connected world was on full display at CES 2017 -- our largest, boldest show in history," Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, Consumer Technology Association (CTA), told IANS. The event also showcased the connected future of technology with more than 3,800 exhibiting companies and exhibit space of more than 2.6 million net square feet. "This year's show was all about connectivity -- both in the form of the technologies unveiled and in the valuable face-to-face business connections happening throughout the show," added Karen Chupka, Senior Vice President, CES and corporate business strategy, CTA. In the field of connected cars, Intel showcased a system with Microsoft Hololens (augmented reality headset) that sent signals to the Cloud via 5G and received commands from artificial intelligence (AI) servers, taking decisions for automatic driving. "What you see here is all that needs to come together for automated driving to come a reality. At the Intel automated driving experience, the car has the sensors that are collecting information and processing it to recognise everything in its surroundings," an Intel exhibitor at the booth told IANS. In a perfect vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the car could also connect with the traffic lights which, in turn, gives less traffic congestion and safe automated driving experience with very less or no accidents. "CES 2017 was a global showcase that demonstrated that we are in a new era of innovation where technology is valued not just for the devices it produces but for the experiences it makes possible," Bridget Karlin, Managing Director, IoT, at Intel, told IANS. Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Blackberry and QNX Operating Systems, Mitsubishi and Mercedes also showcased their electric and hybrid cars. The US glass manufacturing company Corning introduced a car with Corning Gorilla Glass that provided toughness with a 30 per cent decrease in the vehicle's weight. Chip manufacturer Qualcomm introduced its newest mobile platform Snapdragon 835 processor with X16 LTE modem, which will provide high performance and enhanced power efficiency. Snapdragon 835 is designed to support next-generation entertainment experiences and connected Cloud services for premium consumer and enterprise devices. The mobile platform is 35 per cent smaller in package size and consumes 25 per cent less power compared to the previous generation flagship processor Snapdragon 821. Expected to revolutionise the connected world, 5G was a major focus throughout CES. "CES 2017 was a coming out party for the future of 5G which, we estimate, will generate a net 20 million new jobs," Jim Mault, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Qualcomm Life, told IANS. Companies like Samsung, TCL and Hisense came up with 8K TVs -- with Samsung and TCL building the new platform on Quantum Dot technology that offers true RGB colour mixing, more durability and is energy efficient. Samsung also unveiled its much-awaited Gear S3 Smartwatch. While companies like Lenovo launched machines dedicated to gaming, the onus was on virtual (VR) games. Several companies launched products that support VR gaming. The show also received a huge social media momentum, including nearly 1.4 million mentions using #CES2017 hashtags.  Comments The Author Luigi Lugmayr Luigi Lugmayr (Google+) is the founding chief Editor of I4U News and brings over 15 years experience in the technology field to the ever evolving and exciting world of gadgets.

You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. I saw was not here the day after the election. When Donald Trump pulled the major upset was here that night. The election doing Michelle as the night went on he could start to see things were going a certain way over the next morning with Kirk and Jerry and a my Tuesday guy here at WEEI John to mossy you were in the house. And all her wisdom body but not speak how depressed you were one point the reports were that Lenny Clarke came and there's only three microphones and studio. India says Sherry Mike's an LA just take my Mike you into the corner and laid down in. A busy in the fetal position for twenty minutes soup just in the interest of accuracy I was standing in the fetal position which is kinda hard to do when I was Poland and so I was not there that they deceit that side of the spectrum. I feel like what I'm seeing now is a 180 so. This that this report that's come out tonight folks and I'm gonna get to that at some point the problem having is that we have I won producer. It's 35 pages. There is this ridiculous. 35 page report out tonight courtesy of buzz feed. Of the reported it. Intel that Russia has on our president elect Arnold. And some of the pieces of this some of the bullet points. Are freaking. Ridiculous. They are ball urination in beds and gold intact in all the title that I'd be I'd say when I was gonna statement. Urination and beds women paid to urinate. And I've never seen him I think don't say it wages that is probably more grass problem is itself but again. So this thing is come out. And Tomas he's walking around like he's at the lottery for 66 ran out of nowhere like you weren't free money your pocket and our senior. This happy what's his name is it's on in the south that has it to be viewed that was me him but he dude zip and I like a gifted you are nurse you don't smile a lot when your house building apple does final that's very rare to smile. Here at this building but you are. Beside yourself you read these 35 now agent. Aside this was this was late Christmas present for me because I walked in I'd been listening to you guys are my ride NC obviously unit nobody gets I had heard anything. Patio today the producer like to see the latest from thing and of course without those likely know why. And it just feeds just for that people one paragraph that you very PG rated summarize which was well done by you. And I just I am I because I've probably only half true but who cares in the back half of its true. And troubled the nine and whatever and that's it and it'll just be you know more jealousy and sour grapes and whatever. And they spell the name of some company wrong and it's a clearly none of it is is verifiable. Who cares it's it's an amazing Marie well. It's it's the booster crazy details and here in the dates are sort of awfully it's June and July so I don't know. It was a present it is a report that he's presented just the last week or so CNN was the first half something tonight where he was presented with the report trump was and Brock Obama presented with a report that detailed what the Russians have this Intel the compromise the president elect and now we get this from buzz feed. Are against 35 pages the dates are all different it's I I can't possibly read through this right now well you know what there's I don't know Rangers are the summaries of the gist of it is apparently according their reporting there is a British intelligence officer meant on May be is his name involves. I was Lewis who is alleging through you know various channels whenever. That. There are trumps deep ties to Russia which revolves suspected to some level or another I think. Even the anti trump people like me always thought as I guys probably get some business dealings there whatever nothing this is alleging that. The Russian regime has been cultivating supporting and assisting him for at least five years at the direction of of Vladimir Putin. And that he has declined some real estate deals they Erica they're trying to get their hooks into they've got video of him doing salacious things in there hotels. The one that you mentioned was apparently. In the same suite that the Obama stayed in. And then he paid prostitutes to Europe if you I'll beds as a file the bed accordingly based unbearably my dramas so much. In May yet so he's been compromised Tyrus is the is the upshot of it. And map the Russians call elated and gathered all this compromising material on Hillary Clinton. That was passed along to try. Is lots more but that's edges of the gist of it is is that. Basically trump really is the Manchurian candidate and he is under the control of mother Russia. And USA. USA. And the letter dated in America I'm trying to find out exact paragraph of the urination yup that funny I don't have it in the 35 pages here and had a bout was the one that set out to be I mean it's as if that was basically. I heights from hated hates the obamas so much. That he hired women of the night to defile the bad that the obamas have slept and they and the Russians know this because that was a hotel that they had bought gas and fight and I'll tell you an idea. Or if he did needing care. As you probably didn't just gonna be that's how those things generally. So we were I would try to piece through this at some point and and I'm sure it's going to be a major major topic tonight into the overnight hours this is going to dominate the news cycle. Odd going forward I just. I did this 35 pages here so to get a good summary of you have the one thing in mind if you go here are echo though. One of which says says there are other aspects of Trump's engagement with the Russian and authorities. One which had borne fruit. Was to exploit Trump's personal obsessions and sexual perversion of course I'm sorry if we have any young listeners who might wanna turn out tonight I'll show or not it's a nighttime show and and will will global fix that magic it. In order to obtain suitable compromising material on him include the Russian word for that. Attack according to a source. Trump's perverted conduct in Moscow included. Hiring the presidential sweep of the Ritz Carlton where he knew president and mrs. Obama parentheses whom he hated yankees in any doubts. It stayed up they included that and one of their official trips to Russia be even though whom they've they got the vague they got the the word right there not to whom. I had stayed on one of their official trips to Russia. And up filing the bad they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to purple or say that I'm not gonna say it on lawyer had no trouble yet to perform and act. I in front of him. And the hotel was known to be under FSB that's the Russian version of the KGB now control of microphones and concealed cameras to recordable. So this part of a a still unverified. Reported tonight even buzz feed in their summary is calling it. A full but unverified. Yes Ralph how you would verify it is the yen may even make that point what they're saying is this report has apparently circulated. And an end up in the hands of John McCain who passed it along to. You know government officials or whatever awhile ago and they said that they Harding knew about it minority had it but it had not been publicized. I'm sure there's lots of stuff like this about lots of famous people that members he's polite today. But this witnessing lighted bags though. So expect a lot of this going forward and is you'll keep an eye on the news stations here tonight to see if people start to comment and we'll keep an I'm Donald Trump's Twitter because when Merrill Streep calls out the president elect. He fires back Woolsey if five trump is busy on his social media accounts tonight. Are responding to these unverified reports that have some. Crazy crazy details. In again their unverified. I'm 35 pages courtesy abuzz feet 6177797937. The phone number safe to say John to mossy feeling. Better today than he did it the day after with the boys in the morning god trumps. Election and eventually what are we two weeks away from a week for Friday's inauguration right nets like the toy for a it is coming. Quickly whipped like ten days away from the inauguration so yeah see. All of us let me just say this so yes I am I'm laughing about this because I think we all are but once we get past scare initial laugh it's terrify yes terrified so I'm not. I'm not I don't actually want our president QB. You know under the thumb of Russia. I don't. I don't think anyone yeah I think you stay in the job John well the obvious thing and celebrate analytically I'm not I'm not. There are some you are celebrate easy a barrister president elect yet while there are some people who would want so much dirt on the current president that they would want this to all be true about him I don't actually want this feature. Summit to future. You want the your nation board I was maybe the urination umpire but not the like Russia has been feeding him information and working and had no one nobody wants. Well we will see how what the response is from mobile sides of the the aisle here tonight we'll try to read through some of the stuff during the breaks get a better handle. What is a lengthy lengthy document. Was not or is planning on starting misses a big story here tonight which got to keep an eye on these things I wanted to start. Not only with a year column on O'Dell Beckham junior Rob Gronkowski. But to take even further kind of go in sequential order here won't get all your phone calls or promised. Go back to the treaty to mossy show on Saturday which by now you know. People are buzz a buzzing about the show was a snowstorm yet people or locked and loaded. You guys it all the big topics on Saturday I think we really only hit one topic like for four straight hours treatment but. It's a topic that's obviously game a lot of traction we got a lot of states we got spent a lot of time on the ESPN. Race relations depth debate that's gone on here for almost a week was we go tonight where. Gordon Hayward got a eight slightly above average round of applause that turned into in some circles the red carpet for a white player. And led to Bellotti Jones a particular. And it led to Israel Gutierrez and now Janelle hill. I speaking about the state of race relations in Boston and it. There's been a lot of back and forth about this and my for what our place and stuff that you guys talked about on Saturday. My frustration whiff. Some of the reaction about some from you guys on Saturday which this is sort of you know we you're. In Boston where the bad guys because we are firing back at. Amani Jones in Israel Gutierrez and Janelle hail and I'm forgetting his name now something O'Donnell Jacob Lawrence's name does he shouldn't be repeated but he also wrote a ridiculously dumb thing about the city. And I thought we spent a three days talking about it and rightfully so anger about it to the point where this is the lowest low. We're taking phone calls I'm taking phone calls from sports fans in Boston work calling in to defend themselves and say. I'm not racist I rooted for David Ortiz I reprise a top yeah like yes you should. Have to do that like that but money Jones Israel Gutierrez are so. A ridiculous in their take on this were Boston fans Cilic at that would defend themselves. Because he has PM lobs these bombs all frustrated with that and my reaction listen you guys was. On Saturday. Well Boston is racist and there is some there's some truth. My problem with the response to it in your and I understand your point like. Why are we getting killed for the response we didn't start this they did. Is when you like scream I'm not a racist I'm not a racist I'm not a races and that anger and anger and anger builds. It's not a good look you know how about turning the other cheek how about saying all caught guys there is so they can say that and you can now ought to get angry you about angry but maybe not for like five straight days because what happens is you end up real for you even if you don't mean to. In that anger stuff start and you know I mean we get collars all the time where stuff full seep in in your like this is not. This is not how I answer I guess I I'm not thinking of it from this big cultural awareness I'm thinking of it as your big picture. Your theory your body Jones Israel Gutierrez you guys are paid on ESPN you don't live in this area UConn man you carry carry a game you do a show. And you leave and enact gives you the right. Appointed a fan base because they cheered furry white player in a pre game it was crazy hot Boston is racist and don't you asked a defendant John yup on multiple levels not just this radio station but other radio stations other newspapers reach out to them. They would not respond to wit. I think you're allowed to get angry is a fan when you the ESPN guys to save that. And then never are accountable for I can never. Actions that take a step back ever really say they speak a rounded up and they insinuate. That the area is racist and it did not followed up. Should it bull crap to me is that led to the anger in the listen you guys on Saturday. You know almost makes him like it's it's our fault the sports fans because now were angry. It didn't start he hurt did commit what what what claim could they make in the in the 192017. What claimed that they make having not. Lived here that the higher Celtic families are Boston's four experienced it a racist and here's my thing it was it was completely lazy and misinformed like they left out Kevin Durant stuff they cheer for Kevin Durant. Jae Crowder informed us which I wasn't even aware of that they had cheered for DeMarcus Cousins like the same kind of thing because he's another guy who could be a tree target is that how you're doing it to me and I the the idea that wreck itself at ask about sports fans don't cheer for black players by just said the opposite I said the Celtics fans where are your caring for your bringing it up as assorted defending at a if you live here or you grow up you know the area better than anybody yet you know you know that they traded for our cheered for David Ortiz and Kevin Garnett before an idea this and I'm not even talking about that I'm saying in this specific example they were so obviously lazy and misinformed. If we're having a Sports Radio discussion of this. It's one thing I'm gonna tell you just my honest feeling about it a catcher and I know this doesn't play and radio and I understand why we did at the way we did because it's radio. But my thing is those two guys are a couple of lazy idiots in having that. And having it and don't roll your eyes at him I'm not gonna not so they have they have basically he's 8 AM this lazy take that. Nobody even knows about if we don't scream about it but we scream about it and now everybody knows about it and now it brings so this is why do think it's partly follow we bring. All of this attention on you know where not a racist city where not a racist city like. You know this station has and always have the best history when it comes to that stuff and so when we. Are pounding it pounding upon how dare you say that how dare you say that. You'd end up bringing more and more attention to and you bring people out of the woodwork who are not doing. Us or Boston any favors with their takes on it and just go on Twitter to see like go read the money Jones Twitter interactions aback kinda stuff like. This is all reality like. And so like I said I understand that. For what we do we have to react to an end you know listen I write columns for the website so I reacted things all the time I get that. But in this particular case I don't think we're doing the biggest he's got any favors. The difference is that and I give you credit for the as you write things. That. Yunel are gonna go against the fan base at times whether it is sports related race related. You are not there right things I believe Clinton's bottling also not skit there are people in town in in his Twitter culture right not LC and it's not in sports media in general. Okay that are afraid to go certain way because the reaction they might get on social media you are not one of these people. You'll write something and the next day you're on this station on mornings for middays draft and it would be defending what you wrote the agree with or not or talking about what you wrote you about the balls to do that. But money Jones can laugh and say you know and I know why Gordon Hayward got weird it was daddy won't come on to defend it and so. A lot this year I think you're saying we set on Saturday in this I I very rarely. In 2017. Yelled at my radio so congratulations. You got me to yell at my radio when you said this about Boston sports fans and how we should. Handle these blobs of racism here and is now Boston just asked them live with unfortunately this. There or not this is how we are viewed by a large portion of the country and you can fight it fight it fight it all you want. At the end you're not gonna change people's. See that's why I was at. A we're gonna fight it. Because it these are two guys are three guys are three guys and a girl selling a bad CBS sitcom on Monday night's. They have no experience in this city there a lot of lob at the fan base them and that's when you do at the stand up like I'd have more credit. If they came in and said hero my examples and here is why the city is racist state that the not even do that. So when you say at the turn the other cheek because the city at some point has had in your right about this a million years ago when it happens everywhere a history of racism. In 2017. When those guys take those lazy approaches like you take. It's their job to then I think as a columnist radio host you better be able back that up and when they can't you're pissed about it. That's not a Boston problem that is a radio host Bob that is bull crap by those are. I got a burning I the other issue that I think that was gutless of them not to defend themselves and some greater way than to just like talk about in the state space of their own show. But would you not agree that. By like day three of the feeding frenzy but there was no outside personally provide money Jones to come on what is the upside. He's gonna come on come on and I think he has claimed that. And and why. You know what's going to be more and what do you mean get screen when not at races were not races Euro all right you know you'd I mean you know don't act like you don't know. How exactly how to edit who's gonna go we know how Kirk. Tears people apart and he's very good at and that's what he would while I'm up a lot of Jones said doesn't you don't think of money Jones said over the course of 2448 hours. Didn't deserve some sort of push back from the city of Boston like I did I think absolutely it was gutless but there comes a point. Where the more you say and the more you yell about it the more you just reinforce the stereotype whether you mean to or not it's like. The old thing about protest too much I'm not racist I'm not the more you say you're not races the more you sound like you racist. But that's about how were the action is the fan base without saying anything. The action the fan base give people here in this town. Zero reason in Rodham pound I think it's a racist fan base the court here we're gonna cheer because he's white is some sort of idea that OK this is a racist group or that. David Ortiz in each year as much as he could because of the colorized skin. There's no actions here at the probe that now I mean if you wanna say it's old stereo type crabs in her life and about on Saturday crowds like the crowds have been lawyer Barry White you know if you wanna go down those and roads or they light up another crowds in baseball. We know your I thank them into an old cities I don't know much as you do outlook to see with the numbers are between the African American fans and Baltimore. And or Toronto and the city of Boston what's the difference yeah I would say we know more not less in Toronto more definitely warm Baltimore. The guys are so closely say that I and it now numbers to back that up. Like I and that's something that I would hear and nobody tells us that's not like what you're just saying it because are you get tickets and an old at a job or they wait it's on its iPods he greens. Which is something he had the nerve to say brought up that the Red Sox free agency. We're talking about race and there's thousands of money as you know what I mean when I say we just have to sort own it and Wear it like this is part of the deal that you can. Jobs like this is your bleep about it and you can get all pissed about it but this is history that we have inherited. And weaken pretend don't have a hair everything as a sports fan and Boston needed and Eric. That that the busing in Boston. It's not as we did all of that US sport expanded inherit that that happened how many yards on John out of the cities I'm talking about as a citizen of Boston and a native of Boston. This is all stuff I'm not saying that it's necessarily fair. But it's reality the reality is is this is stuff that happened in our city. That yes we had nothing to do it you know I was two years old when Mel busing crisis happened but. All that stuff is in our history and to act like. How can you even bring this up and to be indignant it's like well you know this is our history and this is what I say when I say we after. We you have to accept it after where yes you get angry about it and in your actions you can prove that it is no longer the case. But at the same time it's still there so and Damien Woody comes on a guy who played college football here in Delhi and NFL football earlier and says why nothing but the best year was balls to say always is opinion OK it's that's gonna pay a history at outlets it and because the history of off now isn't it has not won already part of it that's all part but the brown could come in and say. Well ten years before Damien not even ten years. You know. 1989 or whatever it was right before Damien Woody was a PC. I was get in light thrown on my face by the Wellesley cops you know because as a black driver and a nice car so I mean these things there are examples on both sides. I ate their examples on both sides but. He's come back to the idea that we have to turn the other cheek that's where you and I completely disagree on this I Syria coming you know didn't listen you can say the money Jones that was lazy and uninformed and ridiculous and here's why. And then they Yugo you've said your p.'s. Yeah I think it goes beyond that I think you have to because when you allow the money Jones or Israel Gutierrez to say things and it's not. It could save about you know Philadelphia unit and being a bad sports town they booed Santa Claus and they cheered Michael Irvin. It's just this thing that you say to a nation. And you say and I think there was some in certainly. Like those guys did it on purpose because they know a lot of the country feels this way that they had major headache and a I don't have ever defend myself because I'm never gonna go on I'm gonna block everyone on Twitter. Who dares disagree with me and of people wait if the Boston Globe calls and Errol calls adopt the mosque three EI dot com or Chris Curtis on the morning show. I'm not got that from myself to screw it I'll just say what I wanna say all lobbed this accusation not back it up. And ESPN in which has been so protective of their all and doesn't force those guys ever follow up on that issue that's that's frustrating I know we have to go to break let me put the brakes that don't go out and ask you this screwed up breaks in it. Light of the last week and our reaction of the whole thing in the last week. Do you think the national view of Boston in race and all that do you think it's better or worse. Bennett would have been if Rabbani Jones is set him we said the same. I think it's exactly the same I didn't think. Our reaction which has been pretty strident as that as tiny as it should have it should be. You don't think that that has impacted the national view but that is not. You know reaffirmed a lot of people's beliefs about Boston no not at all now I think as a kid in grade I the cities or what what would they say what what what did the city your boss sell these bills say it's not critical army radio host for saying something stupid he couldn't back up yeah. That reaffirms that Boston's race as you start out you start going through though like the Twitter and all that stuff with the social media I'll. I mean this is a real thing I'm sorry in today's damage I think it's every bit as stupid as you do. But it's reality but god like act it out where would he go to social media thing it's like their and I am forgetting now but the reports and Andy did the NHL players scored. An immediate it was Opel Boston fans Bruins fans called up player the Edward ball turns out. They were more or from Boston where around here and it was pretty clear that it can happen always like I have a hard time taking social media. As really being the barometer Ford. When the money Jones it'd initially on a national radio show Gutierrez stated on a TV she ago. They were able how their platform and when they are asked about it on social media the response is not without a back and forth. It was block block block nor not gonna go. So if you don't respond the way the city responded. Then these guys are allowed to say what they wanna say when in 2017. Fanned it starts with fans cheering Gordon Hayward. That is you would would admit is lazy and does not mean that the fan base here in town. Is racist towards their players react and that was right holdings I think the the anger of the response perpetuates this it's. We'll talk about this as you guys are stacked up at 61777979837. As the phone every can text and as well. 379837. UTW. Week yeah I John is here every Tuesday because unlike a money Jones. Unlike Israel Gutierrez when he writes something or is different opinion he's not afraid to commit and talk about so can you talk about this. With your thoughts as well mutt into mossy here on W media.

By Tas Bindi | January 11, 2017 -- 00:55 GMT (16:55 PST) | Topic: Innovation Seattle-based startup Mighty AI, recently rebranded from Spare5, has raised $14 million in a Series A1 round led by Intel Capital, with participation from new investors Google Ventures (GV) and Accenture Ventures. Existing investors Foundry Group, Madrona Venture Group, and New Enterprise Associates also contributed to the round. Founded in 2014, Mighty AI pays subject matter experts to fine-tune artificial intelligence (AI) engines so they can see, hear, talk, and "think" like humans. Businesses that are looking to use AI technology, but don't have the datasets required to set up effective AI software, are able to acquire the right datasets to train and scale their computer vision and natural language models. What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft rolls out second Windows 10 Creators Update test build in a week House bill aims to block tech giants from building "Muslim registry" With the rise of global instability, can ceramic storage save our digital culture? CES 2017 recap video: Big trends, top products, and wackiest tech "In the future, we will count on AI to make every aspect of our lives better," said Mighty AI founder and CEO Matt Bencke. "But, for AI models to do all this and more, they need to understand what and how we think. Mighty AI is the critical link between computer and human cognition, putting the right humans in the right learning loops." The new funding, which adds to the $13 million previously raised by the startup, will be used to extend its so called "Training Data as a Service" platform and community of "Fives" -- a network of more than 100,000 individuals who conduct microtasks in their spare time, such as identifying and labelling objects in images or doing sentiment analysis of text. Mighty AI will also use the funding to expand its team of data scientists, engineers, and product, sales, and marketing professionals. In addition, Mighty AI has signed agreements with Intel and Accenture that will see the companies recommend and sell the startup's training data services to their customers globally. The agreement outlines that Intel and Accenture's customers will have access to: Infrastructure such as the chips Intel builds; mathematical algorithms that process large amounts of calculations in parallel to "think"; training data that turns these blank slates into simulations of human knowledge; and the application of the resulting AI models in interfaces that make it easy for people to use. "As our CEO, Brian Krzanich, has said, AI is not only the next big wave in computing; it's the next major turning point in human history," said Doug Fisher, Intel Corporation senior vice president. "Intel is investing in AI, with the goal of driving breakthrough performance while making AI solutions more accessible and easier to deploy for all ... To produce high quality data for training models to deploy, it is essential to obtain clean, accurate human annotations at scale." In addition to artificial intelligence, in November 2016, Intel Capital announced that it would be investing more than $250 million over the next two years to help make fully autonomous vehicles a reality. Krzanich said at the time that data is the new oil and pointed to several ways autonomous cars will collect data, such as cameras, radar, sonar, GPS, and LIDAR. It's projected each vehicle will generate around 4TB of data a day. "You could say oil is the key technology that allowed the automotive world we know today," Krzanich wrote in a blog post at the time. "When it comes to the car of the future and automated driving experiences, however, data is literally the new oil. Data has the potential to radically change the way we think about the driving experience." Accenture has also been increasing its focus on artificial intelligence. In May 2016, it formed a new business unit in partnership with IPsoft focused on spurring adoption of AI in the enterprise. Meanwhile, Google created a new research group dedicated to artificial intelligence in mid-2016 in line with its CEO Sundar Pichai's AI-centric strategy. In April that year, Pichai said he foresees a time when devices will completely vanish, to be replaced by omnipresent artificial intelligence, and that the company's investments in AI are preparing it for such a world.

By Nicole Rojas January 11, 2017 00:19 GMT Close Donald Trump rejects unverified reports that Russia has ‘compromising’ information IBTimesUK/Wochit Russian operatives claim they have compromising personal and financial information about President-elect Donald Trump, intel officials revealed in classified documents presented to Trump and President Barack Obama last week. The allegations partly came from memos collected by a former British intelligence operative. According to CNN, the FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of the allegations, which are based on information from Russian sources. The agency has not confirmed essential details about Trump in the memos. Four senior US intelligence chiefs — Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI DirectorJames Comey, CIA Director John Brennan and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers — presented the classified briefings to Obama and Trump. The allegations were included in a two-page synopsis appended to a report commissioned by Obama on Russia's interference in the election. Officials included the synopsis to make Trump aware that the allegations involving him were circulating around intelligence agencies, CNN reported. The synopsis also proved that Russia had information potentially damaging to both Republicans and Democrats, but chose to only release information harmful to Democrats and their nominee Hillary Clinton. Two national security officials told CNN that the synopsis also included allegations that there was a continuous exchange of information between Trump surrogates and operatives for the Russian government during the campaign. Allegations about communications between Trump's campaign and Russia prompted former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid to write to Comey in October. Earlier on Tuesday (10 January), NPR's Moscow correspondent Lucian Kim tweeted that an exiled Russian politician claimed Russia would blackmail Trump by threatening to publish proof they worked to help him win the election. Trump's transition team has not responded to requests for comments from IBTimes UK. The two-page synopsis is drawn from a 35-page compilation of memos, which have not been confirmed or verified. According to CNN, the memos began as opposition research commissioned first by anti-Trump Republicans and then Democrats. The memos, which were published in full by BuzzFeed News, have circulated as far back as last summer. While many of the memos have made the rounds among government officials, intelligence agencies and journalists for months, the US intelligence community has now found the former British intelligence operative and his source network throughout Europe to be credible enough to include in the briefings with the president and president-elect. A summary of the memos regarding Trump were also given to the top four Congressional leaders, chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees. The summary was considered so classified that it was only distributed to Obama, Trump and the eight Congressional leaders. CNN also reported that Arizona Senator John McCain gave a full copy of the memos - dated through December 2016 - to Comey on 9 December. However, national security officials said the FBI already had a set of memos compiled up to August 2016, when the former MI6 agent gave them to an FBI official in Rome.

Intel's ANV Vulkan Driver Now Supports Tessellation Shaders Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 10 January 2017 at 05:44 PM EST. 13 Comments In addition to Mesa's "ANV" Intel Vulkan driver getting Float64 shader support this week, another important addition has made it into the latest Mesa Git code. Tessellation control and evaluation shaders are now supported within Intel's ANV Vulkan driver. Obviously the Intel Mesa OpenGL driver had been supporting tessellation shaders for a while now, but up until now they weren't supported by the company's open-source Vulkan driver. The .tessellationShader bit was flipped on today with this commit after a lot of earlier work landed to the ANV driver as well as NIR and the SPIR-V code within Mesa. Other VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures not yet supported by the Intel ANV Vulkan driver include multiDrawIndirect, depthBounds, pipelineStatisticsQuery, shaderStorageImageMultisample, shaderStorageImageReadWithoutFormat, shaderStorageImageWriteWithoutFormat, shaderInt64, shaderInt16, shaderResourceMinLod, variableMultisampleRate, and inheritedQueries. Some of those remaining features are big ticket items, but will hopefully be scratched off the list in time for more Vulkan Linux games arriving later in the year. 13 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Intel's dying Atom chip takes a last gasp in Chuwi's cheap Surface Book clone Could this be the inexpensive, quality Windows tablet we've been waiting for? Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 11 January, 2017 09:47 0 - - - - print email I’d love to pay less for a lower-end Windows tablet—especially one that has the look and feel of a premium device like Microsoft’s Surface Book. That’s the category Chuwi is targeting, snatching up the remnants of Intel’s Atom lineup and stuffing them inside a line of 2-in-1 devices that bear a resemblance to the Surface Book. In fact, Chuwi’s Hi13 offers exactly the same dimensions and screen size as the Surface Book, which costs at least $1,500. In addition to its 13.5-inch screen with 3000x2000 resolution, the Hi13 includes 4GB of RAM and Windows 10 Home. The Surface Book, though, uses Intel’s pricey Core chip, while Chuwi’s Hi13 features the far cheaper Apollo Lake Atom. Launched last year at IFA, Apollo Lake uses Intel’s new Goldmont architecture, and straddles the desktop and the mobile space, with both the Pentium and Celeron lines.  Why this matters: What makes this announcement particularly intriguing is Chuwi’s build quality, which was evident in the company’s earlier (and otherwise unimpressive) HiBook. The Hi13 looks to be a straightforward detachable Windows tablet, that will likely deliver minimal performance in specialized applications. But I confess to being somewhat obsessed with finding a solid low-end Windows tablet, and this one shows promise.  (The earlier 10-inch 2-in-1 HiBook cost about $250 for both tablet and keyboard. We expect Chuwi to price the Hi13 at slightly more than that, but we don’t know the official price yet.) ’Good enough’ computing Intel’s Atom struggled to find a niche, as it consumed too much power for phones and couldn’t upend the ARM chips found in Android tablets. As a result, Intel killed off its remaining Atom chips for smartphones and even tablets, rendering Apollo Lake the last 6-watt option for 2-in-1 devices. While Apollo Lake is manufactured on the same 14nm process as Cherry Trail, its predecessor, the new chip’s base clock speed actually dropped to just 1.1GHz. (We reviewed Chuwi’s Cherry Trail-based tablet, the Chuwi HiBook, and Intel’s ARK tool provides a comparison between its Z8300 chip and the new Celeron N3450.) The key will be how long the new Celeron Atom can maintain burst mode, as its clock speed can climb to 2.2GHz, far above the 1.8GHz burst of the earlier chip. The new Apollo Lake chip also includes a more powerful HD Graphics 500 Core, though we doubt you’ll be playing Battlefield games on the new tablet. Basically, this device populates the space of “good enough” computing: As performance continues to climb in the high-end, low-end chips will satisfy more and more customers while maintaining a low price. I’m eager to test a Hi13, and to compare it to the upcoming lineup of Windows 10 tablets that use Qualcomm’s processors. Let’s hope for the same level of competition in the low-end PC space as we’re expecting between Intel’s Core and AMD’s Ryzen!

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

The line between Pentiums and Core i3s is blurring with the release of Kaby Lake Pentium chips, though. Eagle-eyed Hardware.info forum user J_C_W spotted the HT-enabled Pentiums in Intel's ARK and tipped off his forum mates to the change. Here's a list of the SMT-enabled Pentiums arriving with Kaby Lake: Pentium G4560 Pentium G4560T Pentium G4600 Pentium G4600T Pentium G4620 Aside from the clock speed boosts common to many Kaby parts and the addition of Hyper-Threading, there's little difference between these chips and their Skylake counterparts. In its endless march to segment its product lineup, however, Intel has decided to cut out ECC RAM support from these CPUs. That could annoy folks who relied on Pentiums to power home servers or NAS boxes. The lower-end G4560 and G4560T models come with Intel's HD Graphics 610 IGP, while the more expensive chips come with the HD Graphics 630 processor. The only difference we can spot based on the information in ARK is a 50-MHz clock speed deficit in the HD Graphics 610 when compared to the 630's 1.10 GHz max frequency, though it's possible that there are also differences in shader count in play. We published a story about rumors of a multiplier-unlocked Core i3 back in November. That story mentioned the possibility that HT-enabled Pentiums and Core i3s with Intel's Turbo Boost could appear. Thus far, no Turbo Boosting Core i3 CPUs have been released, but the unlocked Core i3-7350K is real.  The addition of Hyper-Threading could make the Kaby Lake Pentiums a bit more attractive for usage in an entry-level gaming system, and it's entirely possible they may eventually find their way into some budget builds in our System Guide.   Tags: CPUs User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Intel's Joule 570x and 550x are powerful computer boards that can be built as a PC, or be used to build robots, drones, or smart devices. But Intel is now seeking government certification so the boards can be cleared for shipment in those countries. Joule shipments have currently been blocked in a number of countries, including Taiwan, Japan, and Israel, all of which have active technology markets where hobbyists design hardware. Users that have ordered Joule boards from retailers abroad can't receive shipments in the blocked countries. China is not listed on the page describing the blocked shipments, and Intel can ship and sell the device in Hong Kong. Intel is currently going through the certification process in blocked countries, which may take some time. The Joule boards are on sale in countries like U.S. and Canada, where the certification process was quick. Device makers have to get certifications from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and other regulatory agencies before putting hardware on sale. Some of the certifications depend on the communications technologies and materials used to make the board. Intel couldn't provide a specific date on when Joule shipments will start in other countries. However, as the boards are certified in countries, shipments will start. Intel will keep its website updated to signify where the Joule boards are available, a company spokesman said. Joule is similar to the Raspberry Pi 3 and targeted at hobbyists and device makers, but it is more powerful. It also has features not found on Raspberry Pi 3 like 4K video and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. The boards are based on Atom x86 processors. The first Joule to go on sale was the 570x, back in August. It is priced at US $219 on Mouser. Recently, the 550x went on sale for $179. The boards can also be bought with development kits, but that costs more. HP Elite Slice More from Dicker Data Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto</p> <p>Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include http://fusion.net/story/364420/twitter-abuse-filter/ hashtag] viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. </p> Panelists: Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #mozSS Previous Speakers November 16: Failure: The Hard Part about Innovation, with Ashley Good, Fail Forward Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, November 16 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Failure: The Hard Part about Innovation When you start a new job or project, you envision exciting things you and your team will accomplish together. When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Hashtag: #mozSS September 1: Being Human in a Data-Filled World with Genevieve Bell, Intel Location: Mozilla Portland + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 1 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Being Human in a Data-Filled World In May, Kevin Kelly shared the possibilities that technology will offer us over the next 30 years. Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Hashtag: #mozSS July 20, 2016: The Invention Cycle with Tina Seelig, Stanford University Location: Mozilla MV + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, July 20 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Invention Cycle: Going From Inspiration to Implementation Are you stuck on where to go with your product and need an infusion of creativity? Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books. Her newest books, published by HarperCollins are What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 (2009), inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity (2012), and Insight Out (2015). She’s been honored to receive significant recognition of her work, including the Gordon Prize from the National Academy of Engineering, the National Olympus Innovation Award, the SVForum Visionary Award, and several university teaching awards.

Hashtag: #mozSS Deck materials also in this post May 26, 2016: Twelve Technology Forces Shaping the Next 30 Years with Kevin Kelly, Wired Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, May 26 @ Mozilla SF - 10:30am PT / 1:30pm ET / 6:30pm UTC Topic: Twelve Technology Forces Shaping the Next 30 Years Much of what will happen in the next thirty years is inevitable, driven by technological trends already in motion. Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985.

Hashtag: #mozSS #theinevitable April 27, 2016: When Change is the Only Constant, with Kirsten Wolberg, PayPal Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, April 27 @ Mozilla SF - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: When Change is the Only Constant, Org Structure Doesn’t Matter While it may be true in tech that “change is the only constant,” some changes are bigger than others. Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services. Kirsten holds a BS degree in Finance from USC and an MBA from J.L. Kellogg School of Management. Host: David Slater Questions: Submit questions for Kirsten during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS March 24, 2016: The Role of a Product Manager with Josh Elman, Greylock Partners Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, March 24 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: The Role of a Product Manager - and Everyone Else "The job of a product manager is to help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.” Seems simple - but anyone who has worked on a product knows it’s not. At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Building products with partners, considerably moreso. Varying resources, goals, strategies and cultures pose challenges. But partnering well on products is often worth the effort. This month April Underwood, head of all product & partnerships at Slack, will draw from her experiences at Google, Twitter, Travelocity and more to help us navigate the complexities of marrying products and partnerships. She'll be interviewed by our very own Bertrand Neveux, who has built products with partners for most of his career at and leading up to Mozilla. Speaker: April Underwood is head of Platform at Slack, a messaging platform that has evolved into a diverse ecosystem of partners. There, she drives key growth initiatives and oversees platform products, partnerships, API integrations and developer relations. She previously worked on products for Travelocity, Apple, Google, Climate Corp (Weatherbill). Just before joining Slack, April led teams of Product Managers as Director of Product on Twitter’s fast-growing Advertising (Ads API, ads.twitter.com) and Data (Firehose, Gnip) products. She was also a PM for the Tweet Button and Twitter API, and built Twitter's Business Development team from the ground up to strike strategic partnerships with firms including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, EA, Salesforce and Adobe. And while she used to write code (and sometimes writes term sheets as an angel investor), her first love is building and leading product teams and working with engineers and designers to build and launch great products that people want to use.

Hashtags: #mozSS #brantina January 27, 2016: The Right Way to Build Software with Jocelyn Goldfein, ex-Facebook Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 27 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Right Way to Build Software: Ideals Over Ideology Add-ons. Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups. As Director of Engineering at Facebook she led Facebook’s push on mobile infrastructure and quality, initiating major new investments in architecture and tooling and helped guide Facebook’s transition to “mobile first.” She launched new product initiatives in search, news feed, and photos. She also drove strategic engineering operational initiatives, including overhauling Facebook’s approach to technical recruiting. More on Jocelyn at her website.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mike is also a co-author of the Responsive.org manifesto and a leading contributor to the global self-management and future of work movement. Deck Host: Jim Cook, CFO, Mozilla Recommended pre-watch: Mitchell’s 2nd Portland Keynote on Decisionmaking October 22, 2015: Data as Empathy with Frances Haugen, Yelp Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, October 22 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Data As Empathy To build products people love, you must understand those people. User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News.

He’s worked on large projects of global scale (Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo! Search), and scaled new projects from conception to significance (Yahoo! Answers from 0 to 90 million users). He also co-founded GoogleX, the semi-secret group responsible for cutting edge projects including the autonomous driving vehicles, contact lenses that monitor glucose through tears and balloons in the stratosphere that provide Internet access. Topic: Tom will talk about his approach to rapid prototyping using 'native' materials like paper and foam core to create and test experiences. Using this method, he has led teams to work more effectively and quickly, building state of the art (see above for examples) products as part of an ongoing innovation process. Host: Josh Carpenter Deck Workshop adapted from Tom's talk, from Mozilla Learning Network Questions: Submit your questions for Tom in advance here.

Name: Subject: Message: Here are the top trends we witnessed at CES 2017 Features Newsby John Callaham5 days ago 3 296 4 CES 2017 is now in the history books, but the massive trade show in Las Vegas revealed some of the trends we can expect to see in the gadget world for the next 12 months. So what did we see that will become a “thing” in the new year? Read on to find out. VR is slowly getting cheaper and ditching wired connections Hardcore virtual reality for consumers finally showed up in the real world in 2016, with the launch of the PC-based HTC Vive and Oculus Rift headsets, along with the PlayStation VR hardware for the PS4 console. At CES 2017, we saw that companies were trying to get rid of those pesky wires, with HTC’s third-party solutions and the promise of a WiGig solution, in partnership with Intel, later this year. Intel also showed off its updated wireless Project Alloy mixed reality headset as part of its CES 2017 presentation, with the promise that some OEMs will launch products based on the design by the end of 2017. At the same time, Microsoft also promoted cheaper PC VR headsets with wired connections. Microsoft says that companies like Dell, HP, Lenovo and others will begin selling these headsets for as low as $400 in 2017. That’s much lower than the current price of the Vive or Rift, but we will have to wait and see how they perform, as none of the prototypes shown at CES actually worked. We even got an announcement of AR/VR smartglasses coming from ODG that will be released later in 2017, which will be powered by the upcoming high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. Curved is out and thin is in for TVs The curved TV trend that has been around for the past couple of years seems to be disappearing. CES 2017 was all about getting flat-screen TVs to be as thin as you could get. Indeed, LG showed off TVs at the show that were so thin and light, they have to be placed on walls with magnets. CES also showed that more smart TVs will be using AI to help out. Amazon announced that a number of TVs will be using its Fire TV operating system, which also connects to its Alexa digital assistant. Xiaomi also showed a super-thin TV, the Mi TV 4, that will use AI to help its owners find the best content currently available for their particular tastes. AI assistants like Alexa are trying to come in your home and car We have already written about how Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant seemed to be everywhere at CES 2017. A number of connected devices for the home and for cars will be using the AI. The idea is that you will be able to lock your doors, raise or dim your lights, or start your morning cup of coffee without having to lift a finger. Alexa was not the only AI assistant that was shown at CES. The Google Assistant is being incorporated into the new version of the NVIDIA Shield Android TV set-top box, and Microsoft said it was working to bring its Cortana assistant into cars as well. Electric and self-driving cars are all the rage CES has always been a place for new consumer technology in cars, and this year’s show was no different. This time, however, the focus was on bringing both electric and self-driving cars closer to reality for most consumers. We finally got to see the once mysterious Faraday Future FF91 electric car, and more EV cars from Fiat Chrysler and Nissan were shown off. We even got to see a demo of an upcoming fast charging electric car station at the show. Self-driving car prototypes were shown at CES 2017 by NVIDIA, and BlackBerry also revealed plans to develop technology for making self-driving vehicles as well. Of course, most of these demos are for concepts that are still years away from actually being available, but it shows that the trend toward smart, electronic self-driving cars is not going away anytime soon. The Windows PC platform is still very much alive CES 2017 showed that good old-fashioned Windows PCs can still generate a ton of excitement when they are offered in new ways. At the show, we saw a ton of new and upcoming thin-and-light notebooks that also offer all-day battery life, including one from Samsung. The 2-in-1 trend for touchscreen notebooks and tablets also shows no signs of slowing down, as many of those models are in the works from Dell, Lenovo and others. We even saw one upcoming business notebook from Dell that supports wireless charging. At the other end of the PC spectrum, the hardcore gamers could check out the $9,000 Acer Predator 21 X, a notebook with a huge, and curved, 21-inch screen and desktop PC graphics cards. There were lots of high end 4K and even 8K PC monitors shown at CES. Razer even showed a gaming laptop concept with three displays (yes, three) that folded up into one relatively thin case. Smartphones were not a big focus This has been the case in past CES shows, but the 2017 event only had a few major announcements in the Android smartphone industry. Huawei revealed its unlocked Mate 9 phone’s official US launch date and ASUS showed off two upcoming devices; the ZenFone 3 Zoom, with its 500mAh battery and its dual rear camera, and the ZenFone AR, with its support for both Google’s Daydream VR and its Tango AR technology. There were other smartphones announced at CES, but they were in the mid-to-low budget range. Just like previous years, the smartphone industry is waiting until the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona in late February to make a number of major flagship reveals. Conclusion All in all, CES 2017 was a show that put a spotlight on how technology and devices continue to connect with each other, with the help of digital assistants, and that the arrival of virtual reality is still something that needs to find a focus.

Name: Subject: Message: Check out this 210 square foot smart home with Amazon’s Alexa and Intel tech Newsby John Callaham5 days ago 8 256 6 At CES 2017, we got to see how Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant is getting incorporated into a ton of different current and upcoming smart products. During the show we also got a chance to see a demo of how Alexa, combined with a smart hub from Intel, could be used in a tiny 210 square foot home. See also: Will AI be the next big smartphone feature? 6 days ago Yes, the small home trend that you may have seen on TV shows like Tiny House Nation on HGTV made it to CES last week. In this case, Intel used their version of a tiny home to show how a number of things could be controlled with voice commands. With an Amazon Echo connected speaker and an Intel smart hub, we got to see how a potential owner of this small house could control the lights, locks and even the BMW parked outside with voice commands. The Intel smart home hub will allow the owner of this tiny house to issue more complex commands that will activate multiple devices at once. For example, saying just one command will put the house in a “movie time” mode. The blinds went down, the lights were turned off and a screen also came down. Finally, a TV projector was turned on so you could begin your home theater experience. If you were sleeping and woke up to begin your day in this small home, you could say, “Hey Alexa, turn on Good Morning”. The blinds would then come back up, lights would turn on, the thermostat would raise the temperature and even your morning tea kettle would start heating up water. All of this showed how people with a bunch of connected smart devices could get them to work together in combination with Alexa and Intel’s hub. It’s something that would have been shown in a sci-fi movie just a few years ago but is now a reality, and we suspect more and more homes, in tiny, normal and large sizes, will incorporate this technology in the next few years.

Existing investors Foundry Group, Madrona Venture Group, and New Enterprise Associates (NEA) also participated in the round. Above: Name that object. Founded out of Seattle in 2014, Spare5 has hitherto partnered with big-name companies such as Microsoft, Pinterest, and IBM, among others, who provide the Spare5 community with “tasks” — these generally focus on identifying the meaning of media assets such as photos, videos, and audio. For example, someone may be presented with a picture of a landscape, and they would have to tell the system what the mountain is, and whether the large body of water it identified is a lake. It’s all about improving companies’ in-house AI efforts such as computer vision and natural-language processing. Moving forward, the company will be known as Mighty AI, and in addition to the funding round, it has signed deals with Intel and Accenture. Both companies will work on behalf of Mighty AI to sell and promote its so-called “training data as a service” (TDaaS) offering to their own customers around the world. Prior to now, Spare5 Mighty AI had raised around $13 million in funding, and with its latest cash injection it will push to grow its TDaaS platform and network of individuals who carry out the microtasks, according to a company statement. It will also bolster its in-house team of data scientists, engineers, and sales specialists. AI is increasingly touching on just about every facet of society, from the workplace to customer service and everywhere in between. While AI systems are becoming more intelligent and “aware,” they’re not quite at the stage of being able to teach themselves — there are things that only humans are able to decipher and detect. And this is what Mighty AI is promising companies: human input that’s tailored to suit whatever AI system they’re looking to build. “In the future, we will count on AI to make every aspect of our lives better,” said Mighty AI CEO and founder Matt Bencke. “AI will manage our information, schedules and energy use. It will make our factories, roads and homes safer and more efficient. It will provide us each with a personal shopper and investment advisor. But, for AI models to do all this and more, they need to understand what and how we think. Mighty AI is the critical link between computer and human cognition, putting the right humans in the right learning loops.” Sign up for Funding Daily: Get the latest news in your inbox every weekday.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 10, 2017 at 11:00AM In a recent interview with CNBC, Brian Krzanich, CEO of microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), highlighted the fact that between 60% and 75% of the company's chips are manufactured in the United States and that the company exports 75% of its products. Image source: Intel.  "We're the second largest exporter in the United States, so we consider ourselves kind of the role model manufacturer," Krzanich said. The interviewer then asked Krzanich the following question: "What do you want to see policy-wise that's going to help Intel to do more exporting to the rest of the world?" Krzanich responded with the following: "The real answer is not a trade war, is not restrictions; it's really about making the U.S. more competitive -- lowering the tax rates, making it easier for people to do manufacturing here, all of that discussion. That's what will bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and/or make it stronger in the U.S." With all of that in mind, it's important to recognize that there's not a lot that the new administration can do to help Intel increase the number of manufacturing jobs that it creates because of one simple fact: Intel isn't seeing enough demand to justify new factories in the U.S., or elsewhere. Remember Fab 42? Chip manufacturing companies put in chip manufacturing capacity commensurate with where they believe demand will be over the next couple of years. If the company thinks demand will grow significantly, then it will start putting in capacity to support that growth. If the company expects demand for their chips to be flat to down, then it's not going to invest in building out additional capacity, since it would be expected to sit idle, hurting the company's financial results. Indeed, that's exactly what happened with Intel's Fab 42. In 2011, Intel announced that it would be building "a new $5 billion-plus factory in Arizona." The plant was supposed to be "the most advanced, high-volume semiconductor manufacturing facility in the world," says the company, and that it would create "thousands of construction and permanent manufacturing jobs at Intel's Arizona site." Three years later, Intel announced that it wouldn't be completing the factory. The reasoning behind this decision was obvious: The demand that Intel expected to enjoy when it first started to manufacture the plant back in 2011 simply didn't materialize. What this meant is that although the manufacturing plant itself was "built," Intel did not fit it with the expensive chip manufacturing equipment required to produce chips. The good news is that this means Intel doesn't have to deal with the high depreciation costs associated with a fully equipped-but-idle manufacturing plant, but the bad news is that all of those "permanent manufacturing jobs" simply never happened. So, how can Intel bring more manufacturing jobs to the U.S.? The truth is that if Intel wants to create more manufacturing jobs in the United States, it's going to need to sell a lot more chips than it does now. I don't see Intel needing to equip an all-new factory with its core microprocessor businesses (PC, server, Internet of Things). Significant volume growth for Intel is going to need to come from sales of non-volatile memory products, and to that end, Intel recently converted its logic factory in Dalian, China, into a NAND and 3D XPoint memory factory. Or it will have to come from large orders to build chips for others. Perhaps one day Intel will have good reason to equip Fab 42 with expensive chip manufacturing equipment and create many permanent manufacturing jobs, but the prospects of seeing that happen in the near term aren't good.

Share story By Rachel Lerman Seattle Times business reporter Spare5, a spinout from Madrona Venture Labs, is changing its name on the heels of inking new partnerships with Intel and Accenture. The Seattle startup, which uses humans to fine-tune artificial intelligence engines, will now be known as Mighty AI. The name change comes at the same time as a new $14 million funding round, raised from Intel Capital with participation from Google Ventures, Accenture Ventures, Foundry Group, Madrona Venture Group and New Enterprise Associates. Mighty AI uses machine-learning technology and actual humans to look through data and make sure it is accurate and being collected correctly.

Intel and Accenture will market and sell the startup’s products to their customers. Spare5 launched in 2014, and quickly debuted an app that recruited people to complete short tasks in their spare time. The company also sent a note to people that use its app, assuring them nothing would change. “We are not changing or altering your account, tasking, or earnings history in any way,” the company wrote in an email to app users, called “Fives.” The Spare5 app, which is keeping that name, pays people small amounts of money to complete short tasks, such as identifying objects in pictures. The tasks help Spare5 partners “clean” their data. Rachel Lerman: rlerman@seattletimes.com; on Twitter @rachelerman.

OK, you don't get a Touch Bar, but you do get a couple of things that Apple doesn't offer: - 7th generation "Kaby Lake" Intel Core processors (a generation ahead of what Apple has to offer) - A whole range of ports, from an SD Card slot to USB 3.0 and USB-C ports I think that it's also fair to say that Dell's XPS 13 is affordable -- a 13.3-inch system running an Intel Core i3 with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD costs $800. More information. Published: January 10, 2017 -- 14:30 GMT (06:30 PST) Caption by: Adrian Kingsley-Hughes Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Powering the new XPS 13 2-in-1 is a choice between a 3.2GHz Intel Core i5-7Y54 processor or a 3.6GHz Intel Core i7-7Y75 processor, both 7th-generation Kaby Lake silicon, and both featuring Intel HD Graphics 615. Despite packing the latest silicon, Dell has designed the new XPS 13 2-in-1 to be completely fanless. RAM options span 4GB, 8GB, and 16GB dual-channel LPDDR3, while storage options go from a basic 128GB SATA all the way up to 1TB PCIe SSD with Intel RST. On the battery front, the 46WHr pack is good for up to 15 hours when combined with the full HD display. There is also a webcam, a fingerprint reader that's Windows Hello-compliant, a couple of USB Type-C ports, a Thunderbolt 3 port, microSD card reader, display port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. More information. Published: January 10, 2017 -- 14:30 GMT (06:30 PST) Caption by: Adrian Kingsley-Hughes Dell Latitude 5285 The Latitude 5285 2-in-1 features a 12.3-inch, 3:2 aspect ratio display, comes with a 1TB SSD option, 16GB of RAM, and there's an option of seventh-generation Intel Core processors - just like the Surface Pro 4. There's also a built-in kickstand, a soft keyboard, and stylus support. Again, just like the Surface Pro 4. There is one place where the Latitude 5285 deviates away from the Surface Pro, and that is the display. Microsoft opted for a pricy high-resolution 2736 x 1824 panel, while Dell went gone for a more traditional - and cheaper - 1920 x 1080 option. It's an interesting corner for Dell to cut in order to scrape in some additional revenue. On the connectivity front there are two USB Type-C ports, a single USB 3.0 port, one microSD card reader, a micro-SIM slot (in selected models), and a connector for a keyboard. Coming February. Published: January 10, 2017 -- 14:30 GMT (06:30 PST) Caption by: Adrian Kingsley-Hughes Acer Predator 21 X The Predator 21 X takes what is essentially a gaming desktop and crams it into a folding laptop-type shape. It starts with a 21-inch 2560 x 1080 resolution curved IPS display with a 120Hz refresh rate. Powering this monstrous display is Intel's 3.9GHz seventh-generation Intel Core i7-7820HK silicon powerhouse, dual GeForce GTX 1080 X graphics cards, four DDR4 slots that can hold a maximum of 64GB of RAM, up to four 512GB solid-state drives (two of which can be NVMe PCIe SSDs which are five times faster than SATA SSDs), and a single hard drive bay which is home to a 1TB unit. But that's not all. There's a full-sized mechanical keyboard featuring Cherry MX Brown key switches with customizable backlight options, a numeric keypad that flips over to reveal a precision touchpad, four speakers and two subwoofers, two power supplies, five AeroBlade cooling fans, and nine heat pipes. All this is packed into a black shell that looks like it's been hacked out of granite or marble, which brings the total weight of the package to 19.4 pounds. All you need is a spare $8,999 and this beast can be yours. More information. Published: January 10, 2017 -- 14:30 GMT (06:30 PST) Caption by: Adrian Kingsley-Hughes HP Spectre X360 Here's another Windows 10 laptop that is built around Apple's "thin and light" mantra, yet manages to offer up to 15 hours of battery life (in the real world this translates to something closer to 12 hours, but that's still pretty good) and a system that can easily convert from a laptop to a tablet thanks to its ingenious hinge. A 13.3-inch system kitted out with a 6th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 4GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD starts at $900. More information. Published: January 10, 2017 -- 14:30 GMT (06:30 PST) Caption by: Adrian Kingsley-Hughes Microsoft Surface Book If you've got deep pockets, then Microsoft's recently refreshed Surface Book is a system well worth taking a look at. You get everything that you'd expect from a high-end system -- plenty of ports, a claimed 16 hours of battery life, an SD card slot, and Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics chip powering the graphics. There's as a stylus and touchscreen display for those who are artistic or just like jabbing at things with their fingers. But as I've already said it's not cheap -- a 13.5-inch system equipped with a 6th-generation Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB SSD will set you back a cool $2,400. More information. Published: January 10, 2017 -- 14:30 GMT (06:30 PST) Caption by: Adrian Kingsley-Hughes Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Yoga This is one of those laptops I keep coming back to. Not the best or the cheapest, but a solid laptop that has plenty of power to get the job done, and there's an optional touch-sensitive OLED display that's very easy on the eyes. A 14-inch non-OLED system powered by a 6th-generation Intel Core i5 chip, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD costs $1,549. More information. Published: January 10, 2017 -- 14:30 GMT (06:30 PST) Caption by: Adrian Kingsley-Hughes Microsoft Surface Pro 4 OK, technically this is a hybrid, and it's a bit tricky to use on a lap, but for for portable power, the Surface Pro 4 is hard to beat. Unfortunately, while the Surface Pro 4 comes with a stylus, the Type Cover keyboard is an optional extra, adding an extra $130 to the price. An Intel Core m3 system with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD costs $900 (excluding Type Cover keyboard), but I'd recommend spending an additional $100 and getting the 6th generation Intel Core i5 model. More information. Published: January 10, 2017 -- 14:30 GMT (06:30 PST) Caption by: Adrian Kingsley-Hughes Origin PC Eon17-SLX If power is what you want, then power is what you'll get -- along with an eye-watering price tag! The Origin PC Eon17-SLX is less a laptop and more a high-end, VR-ready desktop gaming PC that happens to fold closed. What you get is incredible. At the cheap end of the spectrum, $2,351 gets you a 17.3-inch 1,920 x 1,080 display, an Intel Core i5 6500, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a single Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 GPU with 8GB of RAM, and a 120GB SSD. A fully kitted-out system, with a 17.3-inch 3840 x 2160 display, Intel Core i7 6700K CPU, 64GB of RAM, Dual NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 with 8GB of RAM, a pair of 512GB Samsung 950 Pro PCIe NVMe m.2 drives along with another pair of 2TB Samsung 850 Pro Series SSDs, breaks the $7,500 barrier.

industries to tools, data and services to build artificial intelligence models News provided by Mighty AI Jan 10, 2017, 09:00 ET Share this article SEATTLE, Jan. 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Spare5 Inc. announced today it relaunched the company as Mighty AI and raised a Series A1 round of $14M. In addition, Mighty AI signed agreements with Intel and Accenture (NYSE: ACN). Intel will be able to promote and sell Mighty AI's training data services to its global customers, and Accenture will recommend and integrate Mighty AI's training data services for its global clients. Intel Capital led the round with participation from new investors GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Accenture Ventures and additional investment from Foundry Group, Madrona Venture Group and New Enterprise Associates (NEA). Continue Reading Mighty AI segmentation mask for autonomous driving Relaunching as Mighty AI reflects the company's core business of delivering the human insights artificial intelligence (AI) engines need to see, hear, talk and "think" like people. Its Training Data as a Service™ (TDaaS™) platform helps businesses obtain the datasets they need to train and scale their computer vision and natural language models. "In the future, we will count on AI to make every aspect of our lives better," said Mighty AI Founder and CEO Matt Bencke. "AI will manage our information, schedules and energy use. It will make our factories, roads and homes safer and more efficient. It will provide us each with a personal shopper and investment advisor. But, for AI models to do all this and more, they need to understand what and how we think. Mighty AI is the critical link between computer and human cognition, putting the right humans in the right learning loops." Mighty AI will use the new funding to extend both its TDaaS platform and community of Fives—a network of tens of thousands of individuals who conduct microtasks in their spare time, such as identifying and labeling objects in images or doing sentiment analysis of text. With the funding, Mighty AI will also grow its team by adding new data scientists, engineers and product, sales and marketing professionals. "As our CEO, Brian Krzanich, has said, AI is not only the next big wave in computing; it's the next major turning point in human history," said Doug Fisher, Intel Corporation Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Software and Services Group. "Intel is investing in AI, with the goal of driving breakthrough performance while making AI solutions more accessible and easier to deploy for all. We see a significant opportunity across applications such as automated driving, robotics, healthcare and the Internet of Things. To produce high quality data for training models to deploy, it is essential to obtain clean, accurate human annotations at scale. With today's announcement, Intel is pleased to team with Mighty AI to power the world's AI engines, operating on Intel® architecture and guided by Mighty AI's training data platform." "As a leader in applying AI to both our own business and our clients' businesses, we know that AI will drive the next wave of business and societal transformation," said Paul Daugherty, Accenture's Chief Technology & Innovation Officer. "Data is the fuel required to power AI solutions, but many clients lack the right tools and solutions to achieve the business value they are looking for from their AI initiatives. By teaming with Mighty AI, we see a great opportunity to break this bottleneck, accelerate the integration of training data, and drive better business outcomes more rapidly." Mighty AI's agreements with Intel and Accenture gives customers better access to tools and services across the AI stack, also known as the four components of any AI model: The infrastructure, such as the chips Intel builds; The large-scale mathematical algorithms that process tremendous amounts of calculations in parallel to "think;" The training data that turns these blank slates into simulations of human knowledge; and The application of the resulting AI models in interfaces that make it easy for people to use. With the new agreement, customers of Accenture and Mighty AI will get a more streamlined experience as they execute across the full AI stack to apply their models. The formation of the relationship with Mighty AI was led by Accenture Ventures, which focuses on teaming with and investing in companies that create innovative enterprise technologies. "We couldn't be more excited to team with Intel and Accenture, both of which are second to none in their respective industries," said Bencke. "Our mission at Mighty AI is to tap the world's potential brainpower so that our customers' AI engines have heroic impact. Words matter, and today we declare that we operate the world's best platform to make our customers' AI models mighty, together with our industry-leading partners."

It won't be easy. A prototype drone at a Qualcomm lab in San Diego [Photo: Sean Captain] More from The Sensor Revolution The Everything Chip: Qualcomm's Plan To Power Drones, VR, Cars, PCs, And More The iPhone 7 Plus Is Easily Outselling Smaller iPhone 7, New Holiday Data Suggests Sean Captain 01.10.17 9:00 AM Remember "Intel Inside"? The ad campaign transformed a maker of components for beige boxes into a top consumer brand two decades ago. San Diego's biggest tech employer, smartphone chip provider Qualcomm, is still a long way from matching Intel's feat, both in name recognition and in revenue. But the company dreams of going much farther by being inside seemingly everything: smart cars, high-end fitness bands, VR headsets, smartwatches, AI systems, consumer and commercial drones, and internet-serving satellites. Qualcomm even thinks it can kick Intel out of PCs and server farms. It's shelling out tens of billions of dollars to achieve its heady ambitions. You might expect a flamboyant, aggressive CEO to be driving Qualcomm's ballsy charge for world domination. That doesn't describe my impression of the man sitting across from me in a spare conference room in early December, wearing jeans and a gray University of Michigan fleece (honoring the school where he got his masters degree in electrical engineering). Forty-seven years old, with bushy gray hair and smart looking, dark-rimmed glasses, Steve Mollenkopf has the quiet voice and cool demeanor of the engineer he is. Over 22 years, Mollenkopf worked his way up the ranks at Qualcomm and took over as CEO in March 2014. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf It wasn't an easy start. Qualcomm's hot new smartphone processor, the Snapdragon 810, was a bit too hot, according to some reports that it overheated in phones such as the LG G Flex2 and HTC One M9. (Qualcomm insists the chip performs fine.) The Chinese government was pushing an antitrust case over what it considered Qualcomm's excessive licensing fees for 3G and 4G cellular tech; and a big shareholder, hedge fund Jana Partners, was pushing to split the company in two—between its chip design and patent royalty divisions. And Taiwan's MediaTek, though smaller than Qualcomm, is rising to challenge it in the smartphone chip market. "I feel like this management team has been through a tremendous amount of major issues in a short period of time, probably faster than anyone I can think of," Mollenkopf says, calmly. He's leaning back in his chair with hands clasped around his knee. "We decided ultimately to do the biggest restructuring in the company's history. Then at the same time, we also repositioned the company and really changed the narrative of the company." That narrative, in essence: Powerful processors and wireless connections are going to be in tens, perhaps even hundreds of billions of new devices, and Qualcomm wants to provide chips for as many of them as possible. That requires remaking the company and starting, sometimes from scratch, in businesses already dominated by rivals. It wouldn't be the first time for Qualcomm to charge into industries it seems to have no business being in. Qualcomm has bought over $50 billion worth of companies since Mollenkopf became CEO. Instead of splitting, Qualcomm is swelling, buying over $50 billion worth of companies since Mollenkopf became CEO, including a pending $47 billion deal for Dutch chipmaker NXP. The tie-up will likely more than double Qualcomm's staff (even after some layoffs that Mollenkopf says will come) and extend its reach to cars, medical devices, home automation, wireless payments, and unsexy-but-important machines like point-of-sale terminals at store checkouts. In China, Qualcomm got back in business by paying a $975 million settlement and adjusting licensing fees. (However, a South Korean investigation recently charged anticompetitive practices that may result in an $865 million fine.) But even as Qualcomm takes on new challenges, Mollenkopf has been jettisoning projects that weren't clearly connected to its core chipmaking business, such as augmented-reality software platform Vuforia, which it sold in 2015. (A mural celebrating Vuforia still covered the side of a Qualcomm warehouse when I visited.) Altogether, the company has cut $1.4 billion in annual expenses, along with about 1,700 jobs. Smartphones And Beyond With the great big exception of Apple (which designs its own chips for iOS devices), Qualcomm dominates the high-end phone universe. Its top Snapdragon chips power flagship Android smartphones like the new Google Pixel, the HTC 10, Moto Z, and even many of Samsung's Galaxy S7 line, as well as the exploding Note 7. (Samsung uses both Qualcomm's and its own Exynos chips). Qualcomm also makes a fortune—likely about two thirds of its profits—from other people's chips through licensing fees on the cellular technologies it has developed. These include the CDMA wireless standard that powered 2G and 3G Verizon and Sprint phones for two decades, much of the 4G technology in phones around the world today, and—Qualcomm hopes—technologies that will get incorporated into the insanely fast 5G standard coming on line in the next four years. Like Apple, Qualcomm designs chips and hires other companies, such as Samsung, to make them. Intel and Samsung have to worry about reconfiguring their factories and having enough demand to keep them busy before they can introduce new chips. Qualcomm and Apple just pick whatever factory provides the best deal. "We don’t care exactly how full Samsung's fab is. We let them worry about it," says Keith Kressin, Qualcomm's senior VP for product management. Jumping between manufacturers has allowed Qualcomm to shrink its chips four years in a row. The upcoming Snapdragon 835 is 35% smaller and uses 25% less power than last year's top chips, the 820 and 821. (In buying NXP, however, Qualcomm will now own some chip factories.) Dominating one industry is no guarantee for the future. Intel owns the PC (and Mac) and server businesses, but its smartphone and tablet plans flopped. "I think Intel's sin was that they didn't listen to what Apple wanted," says Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett. "They said, 'Here's what we have. Want some?'" Intel tried to wedge its processors, based on its design technology called x86, into mobile devices. But the mobile industry was using a chip type created by a British company called ARM. In the mobile market, everyone but Intel, including Qualcomm, builds ARM-based chips—the platform for iOS, Android, and the floundering mobile version of Windows. The phone business is still growing, especially in developing countries, but more slowly than it had been—in single-digit vs. double-digit percentages each year, according to market research firm Gartner. Qualcomm and other chip companies hope that gangbuster growth reminiscent of the go-go smartphone years will come for all those newly connected machines—clumped into a catch-all category called IoT, the internet of things. Mollenkopf believes that Qualcomm's smartphone chips will be perfect for all these new devices and even for the "cloud" of server farms that hold the IoT together. In every new category, it faces competition: Intel, for instance, is challenging Qualcomm on just about every front, such as drones, virtual reality, cars, and 5G wireless. And Qualcomm is way behind other companies on some fronts, like Nvidia for smart and autonomous cars. Not The Same Kind Of Sea Change As it tackles all these new markets, Qualcomm has to avoid the peril Intel met with phones: failing to convince customers that what it's selling, Snapdragon, is perfect for whatever they are looking to buy. But Mollenkopf dismisses the Intel parable: "Almost every other transition that people talk about—PC-to-smartphone, for example—it was a big technology change. What you had to be good at changed dramatically." Mollenkopf claims that's not the case today: The trend toward ever-smaller and more energy-efficient chips that phones engendered dovetails into the needs for other connected gadgets. "It's all really being disrupted by communication and low-power computing and the synthesis of many different technologies together," he says. A big part of this trend is the SoC—system on chip. A phone's CPU, graphics, modem, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other components, now including artificial-intelligence engines, are squeezed into a single chip to save space, money, and power, while boosting speeds (with shorter distances for electrons to travel). Those are benefits for any device. "You can use the [technology] roadmap from cellular to really help out automotive and internet of things," says Mollenkopf. Qualcomm's rivals also build SoCs. Prototype drones packing Snapdragon processors In San Diego, I visit a lab full of consumer drone prototypes. About a half dozen 3D-printed models sit on a workbench; a few steps away, engineers test image-stabilizing algorithms for drone-mounted cameras. The drones run on the Snapdragon 801 SoC, Qualcomm's top smartphone chip from 2014. Qualcomm has to build working models of drones, headsets, and other products to figure out elements like software needed to make its phone chips work in them, says Raj Talluri, who runs Qualcomm's IoT division. Only then can it pitch the chips to companies making the devices. The $599 Hover Camera Passport drone, from Chinese company Zero Zero Robotics, is in a growing category of selfie drones that can hover steadily in front of people, able to recognize and lock onto faces to take photos, and even follow people as they move about. Most drones don't run on Snapdragon, yet they can be quite sophisticated. The Phantom 4 and Mavic Pro drones from Chinese drone maker DJI use the Myriad 2 machine-vision chip from a startup called Movidius (now owned by Intel) to rapidly recognize people it's following or to map a safe flight path over rough terrain. Qualcomm is making some progress: Tencent, Zerotech, Pegatron, Nine Eagles, and Sunly have announced plans to build drones on the Snapdragon Flight chips-and-software platform. Those aren't household names, but the business is wide open. "There aren’t any dominant chipmakers in the drone market, as it’s still very fragmented," says Gartner analyst Mark Hung. Part of Qualcomm's pitch is that the same Snapdragon capabilities can serve many types of products. The Snapdragon VR820, Qualcomm's prototype VR headset, is powered by a built-in 820 chip. That makes it self-contained, in contrast to headsets that rely on a tethered computer, like Facebook's Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, and those that make you snap in a smartphone, including the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream View. Qualcomm's prototype VR headset With a camera on the front of the VR820 headset, the same image recognition that a drone uses to spot and avoid obstacles can also reference nearby objects to figure out where someone wearing the headset is and how far they move. The technology can also recognize and transpose real-world hand movements into the virtual world. Trying it out, I could not only look up and down or side to side; I could also step toward or away from 3D characters, which appear closer or farther as I move, and look above or underneath them. Most other VR systems require external devices like infrared beacons around the room in order to track the wearer, and they require holding controllers to read hand movement. As with drones, Qualcomm wants others to make their own headsets based on the VR820 design. Chinese companies Coocaa, Focalmax, Pico, and Whaley have announced plans to build VR820 headsets, all for the Chinese market. Once again, Intel is right there. In August 2016, it showed off a very similar headset design called Project Alloy, including the same type of movement tracking. But Intel is a bit behind: It won't have the developer kits until the spring, and no one has committed to using the tech in consumer products. No matter how good the technology, both chipmakers will have a challenge breaking into an already crowded market. Intel's Project Alloy headset Qualcomm is jumping into a market that's in its infancy even compared to VR: mixed-reality glasses that superimpose a screen over the wearer's view of the world. San Francisco-based Osterhout Design Group will put the new Snapdragon 835 in its R-8 and R-9 "smartglasses." They promise to actually do what people expected of Google Glass—blend the real and online worlds together in one view. Mollenkopf doesn't get overly exuberant about drones, VR, and other "high-complexity, smartphone-like" consumer gadgets, as he calls them. These are, "things that people believe generally will happen," he says. "They don't know when. They are interested in them. They're wondering whether it's going to be the new smartphone or the new iPod or whatever." ODG's smartglasses incorporate Snapdragon processors. In more mature markets as well as emerging ones, Qualcomm is betting that ever more connected gadgets will require ever-more powerful processors. Take fitness trackers: The iconic Fitbits run on fairly low-end chips, called microcontrollers, typically made by STMicroelectronics. Qualcomm is an investor in Fitbit, though, and many other companies that it's banking will require more powerful chips. "We invest in companies that could be future partners or customers of Qualcomm. They don't have to use our silicon today," says Patrick Eggen, who manages the company's investment arm, Qualcomm Ventures, in the North America. It's invested hundreds of millions of dollars (the company doesn't reveal specific numbers) in startups pushing technologies that Qualcomm wants to get into, including drones, virtual reality, augmented reality, medical devices, and even satellites. Fitness trackers are getting more complex and resembling smartwatches, which have cellphone-like capabilities. (Polar's new fitness tracker, the M600, runs Google's Android Wear smartphone OS, though not on a Snapdragon chip.) "What started out as a simple job of tracking your steps…the expectation is increasing," says Talluri, mentioning features like touch screens. Qualcomm does provide Snapdragons to about a dozen smartwatches, including from Asus, Fossil, Huawei, LG, Michael Kors, and Samsung. All other brands are tiny compared to Apple's share of the market, though, and even the Apple Watch isn't an iPhone-like phenom. "We got strong feedback five years ago to not try this," admits Grob. Maybe Qualcomm's steepest uphill battle is for PCs—hardly machines of the future, but still a giant business. In December, Microsoft and Qualcomm announced a version of Windows that will work on the ARM-based chips that Qualcomm makes, and will be able to run all current Windows applications. (Microsoft's earlier attempt to put Windows on the ARM chips in some of its Surface tablets flopped because it couldn't run older apps.) "If you're [a company] that makes a high-end smartphone, then you have the process and technology to manufacture a thin laptop," says Matt Grob, Qualcomm's CTO. Like Mollenkopf, Grob is a longtime Qualcomm engineer, with 25 years at the company and 59 patents. Stocky, with dark hair, he's very soft-spoken, sometimes nearly whispering. "You can think of it like a smartphone with a laptop-size battery… so the battery life will be tremendous," he says. No one has announced plans to build Qualcomm PCs, but Grob says to expect ultra-thin, low-cost laptops by the end of 2017. Qualcomm is making the same kind of pitch for the server business—that its chips are smaller, cheaper, and more energy-efficient than Intel's. On the surface, Qualcomm's dream to push its incompatible chips into servers looks as fraught as Intel's attempt to get its incompatible chips into phones. "We got strong feedback five years ago to not try this," admits Grob. But a lot has changed, argues Gartner's Mark Hung. Internet giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are custom-building hardware and software for their server farms, and they might be up for trying new technologies, he says. Driving Ambitions Starting from the smallest consumer gadgets, Qualcomm now wants to increase its stake in the biggest: cars. Modern cars are packed with sensors and processors, and NXP makes scores of them: antilock brake controllers, tire pressure sensors, temperature sensors, accelerometers, radio tuners, Ethernet switches, keyless entry systems, and a lot more. Chipmaker CSR, which Qualcomm picked up in 2015 for $2.4 billion, also makes automotive components like Bluetooth and GPS chips. They provide the foundation that Qualcomm can top off with a Snapdragon chip. "We're good at all the non-car pieces that are going into the car and really changing how the car is architected, but we're not good at the car pieces," says Mollenkopf. Already, Qualcomm has sold over 340 million chips to over 20 carmakers, things like modems and other wireless components. It's still getting up to speed with smart cars, which started with "infotainment" systems. They power both navigation and entertainment features like streaming audio apps and Bluetooth connections to cellphones—platforms like Ford Sync, Apple Car Play, and Android Auto. Now smart cars are evolving into autonomous cars. Nvidia, which crashed and burned trying to get into cellphones, has been a lot smarter with cars. Its Tegra chips—which, like Qualcomm's Snapdragons, incorporate ARM technology—power the infotainment systems in cars from Audi, BMW, and Honda. Its autonomous car "supercomputer," the Drive PX 2, was picked by Tesla, which will use it to control its self-driving cars in the future. At this year's CES, Nvidia announced deals to put Drive PX 2 in Audi cars starting in 2020 and to co-develop an AI-powered car with Mercedes-Benz. As almost always, Intel is competing with Qualcomm here. Its Atom processors, which flopped in smartphones, are getting a second chance in car infotainment, already installed in 30 models. Intel also just announced its own autonomous car project, using both Atom and more powerful chips, called Intel GO. BMW is partnering with Intel on developing self-driving car tech, and the automaker strongly hinted that Intel GO will make its way into its iNEXT project for an electric, semi-autonomous car set to hit the road in 2021. In San Diego, I saw some concept cars Qualcomm was getting ready to show off at CES in early January. The star would be a Maserati Quattroporte gutted and rebuilt with Qualcomm chips packed inside. Qualcomm's infotainment chip, the 820A, powers features like safety cameras, GPS, and voice commands. Bluetooth chips embedded throughout the car don't just connect riders' cellphones; together with microphones, they track who is in the car, and where. (Only the person in the driver's seat has full control through voice commands.) The gutted interior of a Maserati being reconfigured as a tech show car. Qualcomm doesn't have a deal with Maserati; it just bought a car and tricked it out, including reverse-engineering Maserati's engine computer system—showing what it could do for companies if it can convince them to pair up. (It did similar with a Cadillac.) That is starting to happen. Audi's 2017 cars will run on Snapdragons, and at CES, Qualcomm announced a similar deal for Volkswagens starting in 2019. Automotive is another example of the hopeful, long-game approach. So far, Qualcomm barely registers in the autonomous-car market, but Qualcomm Ventures has been investing in companies that it hopes will build that market. One of them is Cruise, a San Francisco startup that makes sensors for autonomous cars. GM bought Cruise for about $1 billion in 2016 and is using the tech on the Chevy Bolt autonomous cars it's testing on the streets of San Francisco. Qualcomm is starting a research program in Germany that could develop technologies for autonomous cars, but it's far from having a platform as Intel and Nvidia do. Qualcomm has been building the artificial intelligence it will need for self-driving cars, drones, and other futuristic machines. In 2016, it added to its Snapdragon 820 smartphone chip a neural network capability called Zeroth, a name inspired by Isaac Asimov's robot laws. After the science-fiction legend created his first, second, and third laws about how robots should behave, he added a new law, called the Zeroth, to precede them all—that a robot may not harm humanity. "We found that no one had trademarked it or even knew what it was. It was perfect!" says Grob. Qualcomm later decided the term was a bit esoteric, though, and it settled on the sedate "Qualcomm Machine Learning Platform." The Sky Might Not Be The Limit Wireless is where Qualcomm made its fortune. And no matter which new tech categories matter most in the future, it will remain mission-critical for Qualcomm. The company got lucky with its first invention, called code division multiple access—CDMA. The technology allows cellphone towers to transmit multiple calls at once by assigning each call its own encryption code. The phones on the other end decrypt only the data packets meant for their call. CDMA challenged the prevailing technology, called GSM, which instead divided calls by assigning bits of each one into tiny time slots. Most of the world stayed with GSM, in part because it was a free, open standard. Qualcomm owned CDMA technology and charged licensing fees. But Sprint, Verizon, and a smattering of other companies around the world opted for CDMA, and Qualcomm got rich on the fees. An early prototype CDMA phone Qualcomm then bought up rights to a technology called OFDM that formed the basis of 4G wireless (and will for 5G, too), and the world paid Qualcomm licensing fees. LTE has come very far since it was introduced with a maximum speed of about 12Mbps back in 2010. As speeds grew, so did the name; the latest version, called LTE Advanced Pro, will have a top speed just shy of a gigabit per second and be in Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 835 and its platform for smart cars. Many of the tricks that went into that speed explosion, like combining five or more signals to carry more data, will be the foundation of 5G. "It's still based on OFDM. Patent-wise, Qualcomm…is still a significant player," says Akshay Sharma, who tracks wireless tech for Gartner. OneWeb can potentially bring Qualcomm billions of new customers. 5G's final form will come from collaborations between many companies in an international standards body (called 3GPP). But Qualcomm is trying to assure a big role through facts on the ground. In October, it came out with the first 5G chip, the X50 modem, even though the standard won’t be fully baked till likely some time in 2018. The X50 is designed for trials, so gadget makers and networks can get a sense of which technology ideas work and which ones don't. In the process, they will get used to Qualcomm's 5G technologies—maybe improving the chances that its royalty-earning technologies make it into the 5G standard. Guess who's right behind? Intel, which launched its own chip, simply called "5G Modem," at CES, saying it will be ready for tests in late 2017. Qualcomm's plans go above the atmosphere to OneWeb, a project to blanket the Earth with internet access using a fleet of 648 small, mass-produced satellites. Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm's chairman and Mollenkopf's predecessor as CEO, serves on the OneWeb board along with Richard Branson and tech captains like Airbus CEO Thomas Enders and SoftBank chairman Ronald Fisher. "It's one of our bigger projects," says Grob. Qualcomm's cellular modems will be in the solar-powered ground stations that connect to the satellites and link in devices on the ground through Wi-Fi and small cellular networks. Qualcomm also designed the antenna systems throughout, from base stations to satellites, and its modems will likely be in the second-generation of spacecraft, says OneWeb. The satellites, expected to launch beginning in 2018, will also provide internet connections to planes, cars, and ships. Altogether, OneWeb could potentially bring Qualcomm billions of new customers. A Dash Of Hubris However all its plans turn out, Qualcomm has already succeeded at one thing: being really ambitious. Some schemes, such as getting into mobile gear like VR headsets, seem like a natural expansion from phones. Others, like tangling with Intel on PCs and servers, seem almost cheeky. But being cheeky has served Qualcomm well in the past. In 1993, the company, which at the time made satellite-connected text-messaging machines for truckers, crashed the cellphone party. A novice in the burgeoning field, it had the hubris to say that its new technology, incompatible with everyone else's, was better and that people should pay extra to license it. Enough companies did. Now Qualcomm is a giant in 4G, and its prospects for 5G are strong. Qualcomm's first product, a satellite-based communications system for truckers In 2007, when Snapdragon debuted, Qualcomm was a nobody in the phone processor business. "I can remember sitting back in the mid-2000s timeframe and people said, "Yeah, you're good at the modem but you'll never, ever have a position in the smartphone,' because smartphones are all about—just name your technology—it's about CPU, it's about GPU, it's multimedia," says Mollenkopf. "We're number one in all those things today." Being daring also means making mistakes. One of them was Mirasol, an almost-impossible-to-explain display technology that promised LCD-like color image quality with E Ink-like power savings. (Pixels reflect ambient light and use power only when the image changes, instead of constantly refreshing, as LCDs, OLEDs, and other displays do.) Despite the promise, Mirasol never made it. The late, lamented Toq watch Qualcomm tried to keep Mirasol alive by using it in its own smartwatch brand, called Toq. Introduced in 2013, Toq never caught on, either. "It was so cool we maybe made a mistake and decided to sell it commercially, and it was not a good idea," says Jim Merrick, the director of marketing. "We don't make commercial products." With Mirasol, Qualcomm also broke with tradition by having its own factory, a Taiwan facility it sold in 2014. It didn't sell the technology, though. (Reports say that Apple is now developing display technology at the factory.) In all my conversations with people at Qualcomm, they didn’t shy away from admitting to failures—neither getting defensive nor wallowing in mea culpas. "Qualcomm doesn't get real amped up in the high points. It doesn’t get real low in the low points," Mollenkopf says. Qualcomm's low-key leadership over the years isn't a sign of timidity. As engineers, Mollenkopf, Grob, and their predecessors have the kind of quiet confidence from looking at the problem and doing the math. Sometimes that means admitting that the numbers don't add up. "We have the ability to change ourselves when we need to change ourselves, and a track record of doing it," says Mollenkopf. Never miss a story.

INNOVATE What CES 2017 Says About the Future of the Smart Home Movement From gadgets to thoughtfully created spaces, the smart home movement is taking a page from the wearables book. By Marley Kaplan Marley is passionate about technology and the impact it has on human communication, consumer behaviour and the media landscape. Leading innovation strategy across Fortune 500 brands, Marley shares insights to various publications and panels. In addition to her Inc Innovate column, Marley has contributed to Advertising Week NY, Campaign US, WPP's The Wire and more. In 2014, AlleyWatch named Marley one of the '21 People to Watch in Wearables’ for her consulting work with Intel. Marley earned her MA in Marketing in London, where she spent her early career in digital advertising roles. Keep up with Marley here. @MarleyLive Innovation Specialist@MarleyLive WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The smart home showing at CES 2017 lays out the future of the smart home industry --interior designers and architects will be called upon to join forces with technologists, much in the way that fashion designers and gadget developers have been co-creating wearables in recent years. While many manufacturing and technology companies have announced expanded partnerships at CES, the smart home industry might look to wearable fashion tech as a crystal ball of sorts. During my time as a consultant with Intel, I was witness to one of the first true wearable collaborations of a Silicon Valley technology company, Intel, and a high-end NYC fashion company, Opening Ceremony -- both at the top of their game in respective industries. The combined intelligence of these leaders developed in the co-creation of MICA, an intelligent smart bracelet with style. The luxury bracelet - made from materials including watersnake skin, pearls from China and Madagascan lapis stones - acts as a subtle personal assistant of sorts: alerting of pre-selected incoming calls, recommending restaurants nearby, and even notifying the owner when it's time to leave an event for the next appointment based on travel time. Collaborations in the smart home space have been brewing, such as Lutron's smart shades and lighting switches integrating with music system Sonos and voice technology Alexa by Amazon. The 360-degree integration allows users to leverage custom keypads and voice-activated controls in order to create lighting and music scenes to their liking, such as a wake up call with accompanying lighting and music scenery. Where voice technology and IoT are concerned, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) -- also the producers of CES -- released a new report in anticipation to the conference, stating that smart homes would be the "most popular means of Internet of Things engagement." Ikea's smart charging furniture integration, which launched last year, is an example of what a mass-market IoT design consideration looks like. Designed with form and function in mind, IKEA has developed a smart phone charging pad built into a table lamp. As technological capabilities grow exponentially, it will be the designer's role to incorporate meaningful and user-friendly integrations into our everyday objects. Scandinavia is synonymous with design. Petrus Palmer, CEO of HEM, a design studio based in Stockholm, Sweden, has been considering the role technology plays in the design industry. "In the same way as no one normal wanted to wear the Google Glass, no one will want to sit in a sci-fi sofa. And so, tech in furniture will surely be commonplace, but it has to be seamlessly integrated." Palmer tells Inc. An innovation in line with this sentiment that smart home creators are striving toward is Hyundai's "Mobility Vision," which debuted at CES 2017. The imaginative -- albeit symbolic futuristic illustration -- smart car model is designed to exist as an extension of a home's living space, blurring the lines between utility, form and function. Hyundai is re-imagining not only the automotive model, but also the meaning of personal space. Including a seating area, speaker system and detachable interior furniture, the reimagined automobile seamlessly docks as a living station in your home. Hyundai says their vision is to "blur the line between mobility and living and working space, integrating the car into the daily lives of users." Innovation requires collaboration -- incorporating consideration from experts in a diversity of relevant disciples -- along with a holistic point of view. Just as designers have continued to create designs to suit evolving living spaces, technologists have been developing code to improve the human experience. When the two train of thoughts combine, we will see the smart home market reach its full potential. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

TECHNOLOGY 9 Predictions for AI in 2017 The biggest tech companies in the world are devoting more and more resources to AI. By Babak Hodjat Co-founder and chief scientist, Sentient Technologies WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement 2016 was a banner year for artificial intelligence. Alpha Go's victory over Lee Sedol was perhaps one of the most important, but we saw advancements in self-driving cars, the continued embrace of bots and personal assistants for retail, adoption and competition around in-house assistants like Amazon Echo, along with frequent, sometimes weekly, breakthroughs on the academic side, mainly relating to machine learning. With the biggest tech companies in the world--Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and others--devoting more and more resources to AI, the momentum is going to increase. For those of us who've been in the field for a while, it's an incredibly exciting time. AI and Machine Learning have come to the fore in the recent past, but we believe that the next few years hold even more far reaching successes. So what advances will we be seeing exactly? With a little help from my friends Nello Cristianini and Andreas Gal, here are nine predictions for AI in 2017: We will start to accept that AI can sometimes be wrong In 1994, a man named Thomas Nicely found a bug in one of Intel's processors that could cause incorrect results when dividing a number. And though Intel calculated that the average user would hit this bug once every 27,000 years, press and consumers reacted very negatively. Intel had to eventually recall the processors at a cost of roughly a half billion dollars. As humans, we fundamentally expect machines to be flawless, and Intel's processor violated this basic belief. AI is not only inherently non-deterministic--a well-trained model is mostly right, but sometimes randomly wrong--but being non-deterministic is actually the core strength of AI. AI can often solve problems for which people don't know how to program a precise solution. The more "human-level" problems (voice recognition, image recognition) AI solves, the easier it will get for humans to relate to machines making mistakes since we make similar mistakes. This will help us adapt to this new world where machines make mistakes, just like us! (Not to mention it won't cost $475 million when they're wrong once in a great while). --Andreas Gal Expect false negatives in the Turing Test People ask me a lot about Turing Test. And what I keep saying is this question will simply not feel all that important as we start texting and chatting with bots at call centers or online. At some point, we will not even care who gets the job done, just so long as the job is done well. Meaning, if we're chatting with a customer service agent, it won't matter if it's a person or a bot, so long as our requests are handled. And increasingly, we won't know whether we're talking to a person or a machine. I suspect this means that the errors in Turing Test will not be false positives (labeling a computer as a person) but false negatives (interacting with a person while thinking they are actually a computer). --Nello Cristianini​ Increasingly, AI will author itself Recently, the biggest breakthroughs in AI have come about by virtue of AI experts and PhDs designing elaborate Deep Network architectures for tackling audacious problems. This trend will continue. But a new class of approaches will enlist AI itself to come up with the best architectures for tackling those problems. One approach showing early promise in this area is evolutionary computation (EC) which interestingly can also be used as a catalyst to massively distribute the process. Keep in mind: EC has already been used to automatically generate regular computer programs (Genetic Programming), not AI programs. This approach will also continue gaining more attention since the result of Genetic Programming is human readable, which has helped various AI systems pass regulations recently introduced in Europe. --Babak Hodjat AI will fundamentally alter the technology job market For the last decade, a computer programmer was the highest in-demand and highest paid job profile in the digital economy. Every year, they write billions of lines of code, design and implement algorithms and programs to solve new problems. But AI will fundamentally change this. That's because AI models can be trained to solve arbitrary new problems, without writing a single line of new code. What that means for computer programmers is a changed landscape where some of their work ends up with AI or data scientists. --Andreas Gal AI-designed products will come to market Imagine if you were able to buy a pair of shoes that are best suited for you by simply interacting visually with an existing inventory of shoes. Imagine every action that goes into training a designer to know precisely what you like. And imagine those shoes are one of a kind, unique to your preferences and sensibilities. That's coming. Today, AI has the ability to identify features of products in a brand's inventory. AI can also broker the interactions between consumers and the inventory, helping them discover the products they need. And, by tracking the feature sets most popular among different user groups, AI can come up with designs for new products that have a high likelihood of being popular to the public at large. --Babak Hodjat The interface between AI and the world--including us--will keep on improving In addition to working on the AI itself, 2017 will be the year when we really start tackling the interface between AI and the world. This will include conversational interfaces, speech, vision, question answering, text understanding, and a whole lot more. Take bots for example. The technological underpinnings for bots are still improving, of course, but the interface is where we'll start seeing real differentiation. This means that "content" for bots (skills, capabilities) will become a strategic issue. Alexa has opened up its platform to third parties, meaning they can create skills for Alexa, and Google has hired comedians to improve the interaction with Assistant, which will also be in Google Home and Allo. The race to introduce content into voice conversational assistants will result into more meaningful interfaces, as the meaning ultimately depends on their connectivity. --Nello Cristianini AI will enable devices to have digital "ears and eyes" Humans perceive their environment principally with their eyes and ears. For machines to interact with us, to understand us, and to be easier understood by us, they will start relying more and more on the same senses we use to understand our surroundings. As an example, today, fire detectors use a radioactive isotope to detect smoke particles in the air. In the future, the same fire detector will likely have several cameras that use AI trained on detecting the sight of fire. This will lead to earlier detection and a safer world for humans. --Andreas Gal AI running on devices will actually reduce privacy concerns Imagine if your security system could tell when you walk in and not force you to hurriedly switch the alarm off every time. Currently, to make this work, in-home systems need to send raw data (say from cameras in the home) to the cloud in order to sense what is happening around them. But the transmissions of those images have very legitimate privacy concerns. By processing and making decisions from the raw data at the point of need--instead of sending it to the cloud where the data can be vulnerable--AI can solve for those concerns. And as the processing power and memory available on IoT devices allow us now to run AI on top of our in-home devices, solutions like this will become more and more commonplace, as required response times for such decisions decrease, and applications encapsulate the decision/action loop locally. --Babak Hodjat Regulation of AI will start becoming a topic As 2017 sees more and more applications of AI, expect government to notice. After all, employment will start being affected by AI. Task crowdsourcing will continue to grow, and so will the automation of call centers, logistics, some aspects of retail. The concept shop developed by Amazon could be the wave of the future. Driverless cars will gain further acceptance. And, well, you get the idea. As a result, regulators will start looking a bit closer, and pressure groups might start campaigning for closer regulation of automated technologies, not just for their impact on employment, but for a range of issues. Another issue triggering regulation might be the aftermath of the fake-news story: are we going to hold platforms like Facebook responsible for their content? And if so, what is going to be their technological response? Are we going to like a technology that enables them to remove content considered unsuitable? --Nello Cristianini Published on: Jan 10, 2017 Advertisement

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Intel’s wireless, room-scanning VR is a taste of the future, but still out of reach Brad Bourque Digital TrendsJanuary 10, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share intel project alloy cesMore Dan Baker/Digital Trends A number of innovations come together to power Intel’s Project Alloy, a wireless virtual reality headset. The first generation version has two RealSense cameras for tracking and room localization, an Intel Atom processor for vision processing, and the best available Wi-Fi tech to communicate with the host computer. It’s an ambitious project, maybe too ambitious, even for a silicon giant. To be clear, the first generation Alloy we spent time with is a very early design concept, and not one Intel plans to bring to market. That role will be filled by the Alloy Gen 2, which will cut down to one RealSense camera, and will replace the Atom chip with a dedicated Movidius motion coprocessor. Even that likely won’t be a product Intel itself sells for long. This technology is destined for partner headsets. More: Look ma, no wires! Intel’s Project Alloy gives VR full freedom of movement Its implications in the VR marketplace are much larger. You’ll have trouble finding anyone who argues that untethered and standalone headsets aren’t the future of the industry. Cutting the cord is one of a few major hurdles on our way to perfect immersion, but it still has a ways to go. Where we are today For now, Alloy is what Intel has, and it’s a little rough. The clarity of the headset wasn’t great, but that’s to be expected from a preview version of a headset. The real issue was tracking. Alloy scans the room ahead of time and creates a map, allowing it to replace the furniture and objects in the room with digital game objects. Unfortunately, it didn’t quite line things up correctly, and we found ourselves knocking knees and tripping over invisible objects frequently. The motion controller worked relative to where we held it, but didn’t associate correctly for point-and-click operation, and moving it outside a small area caused it to skip around and jutter. That’s not to say it’s all bad. If anyone is going to solve the problem of heavy cables connecting high-end HMDs, it should be Intel. The chip manufacturer has access to powerful RealSense cameras, infinite control over its own processors, and employees engineers experience with building platforms from the ground up. But Intel is not the only company trying to crack the secret of wireless VR. Oculus Oculus has an early concept, as well, the Santa Cruz protoype, which we saw at Oculus Connect this year. Like Alloy, Santa Cruz packs all of the necessary hardware inside the headset itself, and uses four cameras embedded in the front for tracking. When we spent time with the wireless HMD, it was clearly very early in the design process. It looked like a Rift headset, with a set of batteries and exposed circuit boards attached by tape. That version of the headset worked remarkably well, at least where tracking is concerned. Holographic, and the future Speaking of increasingly specific hardware, Windows Holographic is right around the corner, promising to bring everyone’s favorite OS to the mixed reality world. It’s another huge step towards solidifying the AR/VR community, but like Alloy, the HoloLens itself isn’t necessarily the most important part of that evolution. In the case of Windows Holographic, the partner headsets are likely to be much more common than Microsoft’s likely-expensive option. It’s also the first true full platform for productivity and computing in VR, although there are alternatives for a few programs that bridge the gap. The ultimate goal there is standalone computing, and more headsets means more options. You couldn’t walk two booths at CES this year without seeing a VR headset of some sort. Whether it was an HTC Vive or a Gear VR, last year’s hottest demo has become the norm, but that doesn’t mean work on the format is done. Wireless and untethered headsets, along with mobile phone-powered options that are growing more powerful every day, are going to continue to define most users’ interaction with VR. Oculus is buying startup The Eye Tribe for its advanced eye-tracking technology Oculus opens up pre-orders for third sensor, enabling room-scale VR Spec Comparison: Does the Rift’s Touch update make it a true Vive competitor?

Demecillo (staff@latinpost.com) First Posted: Jan 10, 2017 04:13 AM EST Share This Tweet This Gigabyte's RYZEN Motherboards Detailed!(Photo : YouTube/HardwareCanucks) Share This Tweet This At CES 2017, AMD bumps into Intel's best CPU that utilizes its seventh-generation Core processors, yet AMD has not been sitting still as it introduces of its Ryzen CPU that has high-end performance. AMD made the hardware industry shocked by demonstrating its Ryzen design that could compete with Intel's best. Currently, AMD has now uncovered more details about what executives call its most exciting processor in 20 years that include its brand name, clock speed, and the five basic "SenseMI" technology that make the chip so productive. PCWorld was there when AMD launched Ryzen PC's and its motherboard as they uncovered the deeper technical information of Ryzen and guaranteed to have a long-term support for the AM4 platform. Ryzen represents more threatening change over AMD's previous design with the new Zen chips that offers an entire 40 percent of improvement. It is a huge compelling than Intel's more conservative changes with its most recent generation of CPU's that concentrated on a smaller performance growth and better battery life. According to Digital Trends, AMD has an averaged of three to four years interval of every brand new designs, while Intel's technique will only bring about every two years of the interval in every brand new designs. AMD's primary concern is basically must present an amazing new performance metrics in every cycle since the new models must remain competitive for far longer. There are various leading motherboard producers that announced Ryzen-based components, with a sum of 16 AM4-based solutions that are prepared to connect to the new Ryzen desktop processors. Advertisement However, there are certain AMD Ryzen CPUs new details that are revealed at CES 2017, there is the army of Ryzen hardware which the AMD's new chips have the capabilities to offer various levels of features that the seller can do the adjustment just to provide truly differentiated hardware. A long life for AM4 motherboards, which AMD expects the AM4 platform will last until 2020. The AM4 motherboard's several chipsets are simply supported extra capacity, which gives a flexible approach for AM4 that gives space to develop in the years to come.   SEE ALSO Nokia 6 Release Date and News: Nokia 6 Premium Design with affordable Price, Exclusively release in China early this year 2017 Spyware App: Turned From Safety To Threat; Tips and Guidelines To Protect Your Phone Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe: A World-Class Premium Build With A Powerful Processing Capabilities As MacBook Samsung Latest Update: Samsung Flagship QLED TV Series Revealed on CES 2017 with Three Accessible Models TCL Unleash BlackBerry 'Mercury' at CES 2017, As TCL Shows off a 4-second Video about the Phone Through Twitter TagsAMD Ryzen CPU, CES 2017 News, AMD motherboards, Latest AMD processor Advertisement Advertisement © 2015 Latin Post.

March 2017 now looks most likely, although Tim Cook has been dropping some worrying hints... We round up all the rumours of a new Mac Pro for 2017: the new Mac Pro's release date, price, tech specs, design changes and new features by Karen Haslam | 10 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Launch date Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Tech specs Buying guide for current Mac Pro models When will Apple release a new Mac Pro for 2017? And what tech specs, new features and design changes should we expect when Apple updates the Mac Pro line for 2017? Is there any chance Apple will discontinue the Mac Pro instead of updating it? We've had a long wait for the new Mac Pro. The current Mac Pro model was announced at WWDC in June 2013 and, for a top-of-the range system, the Mac Pro is looking pretty long in the tooth. But when will Apple announce a new Mac Pro? And what hardware improvements, design changes, tech specs and new features will we see in the new Mac Pro for 2017? There's some good news for expectant Mac Pro fans: code in Mac OS X El Capitan hints that a new Mac Pro (one with 10 USB 3 ports) could arrive soon. But nothing is certain at this point, and some pundits believe the Mac Pro should simply be discontinued. Whatever the future holds for the Mac Pro, in this article we will be looking at all the rumours surrounding the next update of the Mac Pro line: the new Mac Pro's UK release date and pricing, its expected design, and the new features and specs we hope to see in the next version of the Mac Pro. Updated, 22 December 2016, to include comments from Apple CEO Tim Cook about the future of the Mac desktop For more discussion of upcoming Apple launches, take a look at our New iMac rumours and our big roundup of Apple predictions for 2017. And if you're considering buying one of the current Mac Pro models, read Where to buy Mac Pro in the UK and our Mac buying guide. See also: New MacBook Pro rumours | New MacBook Air rumours | New MacBook rumours | New iMac rumours | New Mac mini rumours New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Launch date We expect the new Mac Pro to be launched in March 2017. The present Mac Pro was unveiled at WWDC 2013, and it's been more than three years since it went on sale. It's about time, then, for an update to the Mac Pro for 2017. Of course, Apple hasn't announced an official launch date for the next generation of Mac Pro systems - the company is known for its code of silence when it comes to upcoming product launches. We had entertained hopes of a Mac Pro update at Apple's 27 October press event, but no such luck. In the event Apple unveiled a new MacBook Pro instead: a rather lovely new laptop with a customisable touch bar above the keyboard. (You can read more about that device here - New MacBook Pro 2016 review - and here: New MacBook Pro on Apple Store.) Despite the lack of news about the new Mac Pro in October, we remain optimistic that Apple will refresh the line in the near future. A few months back a source at one of Apple's partner companies confidently told us to expect this by the end of November, which was evidently wishful thinking; but it seems likely that March 2017 will see the Mac Pro updated alongside other Apple products. (However, we suspect the update will only involve spec/component bumps rather than a full-blown redesign of the Mac Pro.)

According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop - the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important. What about the Mac Pro? A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell. If so, this would signify the end of the Mac Pro line, a line that was once the pride of Apple, but has now been neglected for three years.  New Mac Pro 2017 release date: El Capitan code hint Code discovered in Mac OS X El Capitan offers a hint that a new Mac Pro may be on its way soon. There's a reference to a new Mac that's codenamed "AAPLJ95,1" within El Capitan, according to Pike's Universum. The current Mac Pro is similarly codenamed AAPLJ90,1 so it's plausible that the code refers to a new version of the professional-level workstation. Another clue that this is the Mac Pro: the code hints that there are 10 USB 3.0 ports on the new machine, and only the Mac Pro has anywhere near that many ports. (Currently there are 4 USB ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports on the Mac Pro, while the iMacs have 4 USB and 2 Thunderbolt.) We think adopting Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro may make more sense as it brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at 40Gbps for the best of both worlds. More on that below. It's been well over a year since El Capitan was launched, and many Apple fans have now moved on to macOS Sierra. We'll update this if any smoking guns are discovered in the Sierra code. New Mac Pro 2017 release date: Delays in 2013/2014 When Apple launches the new Mac Pro there may well be delays in availability, as there were in 2013-2014. Apple first unveiled the Intel Xeon (Ivy Bridge-E) Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, but the unit didn't actually start shipping until December that year. In fact, for most shoppers the supply of Mac Pro was so constrained that they didn't receive their new Mac until 2014 - in some cases not until February, or March, or in a few cases April. Having previewed the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, the company promised availability before the end of 2013, but it wasn't until 19 December that the Mac Pro became available. Then, following the launch, stocks were so limited that only a lucky few, US-based, customers were able to purchase the new professional Mac workstation before the end of 2013. Customers in the UK who ordered their new Mac on 19 December 2014 found that they would have to wait until January 2015 for the new Mac Pro. Some lucky UK customers finally received their Mac Pro around 12 January. This was almost a year after the old version of the Mac Pro was banned in Europe because it didn't comply with EU safety laws. One reason for the delays back in 2013 was thought to be the fact that Apple was building the new-look Mac Pro in the US: Apple had a new design which was being produced at an entirely new factory in the States, so the delays were understandable, although maybe not excusable. New Mac Pro 2017 release date: New delays We had hoped to hear new developments about a new Mac Pro, so we're growing impatient and are hoping for an update soon. Could updates to the current model face the same issues that slowed the production lines back in 2013? We think probably not. If you check Apple's website, you'll see that the wait for the current Mac Pro has come down to 24 hours (although if you want a build-to-order version the wait will be about 5-7 business days). The fact that Apple is no longer struggling to meet demand would suggest that when it launches  the next Mac Pro there will not be the significant delays in getting units out to customers that there were at the end of 2013. Instead, the reason for the long wait for an update to the Mac Pro could be simple lack of interest in this workstation-style Mac. Apple may be focusing attention on other projects such as the Retina iMac, which was updated in October 2015. It's possible that Apple doesn't intend to update the Mac Pro at all. The company has launched several other new Macs since the launch of the Mac Pro, including impressively powerful iMacs that can sometimes perform better than the current entry-level Mac Pro can. Video editor Max Yuryev tested Final Cut and Premiere Pro rendering on both the 5K Retina iMac and 6 Core Mac Pro and found that the iMac performed better in some cases, although did suffer from heating issues that the Mac Pro avoids thanks to its design. Yet we don't think Apple is trying to phase out the Mac Pro in favour of a more powerful iMac line-up. It's more likely that it's just spending a long time getting the new Mac Pro right before it launches, after the issues it experiences with the previous launch. There is still a market for the more powerful Mac Pro, we think. But not everyone agrees with us, as we'll see in the next section. New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Maybe the Mac Pro will never be updated. MacObserver argues that the current Mac Pro is a failure, and compares it to the ill-fated Cube, which was available for less than a year in 2000/2001. (We look at more interesting failures and controversies in our roundup of the worst Apple products.) It's possible, indeed, that Apple will update its iMac line to the point where it satisfies the needs of pro users, rendering the actual Pro line irrelevant. As a thought experiment, TechRadar has imagined the specs of an 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling.  Many professional Mac users are still using old Mac Pros from pre 2012 mainly because they are easily upgradable, with options for larger-capacity drives (2TB, 4TB or even more). You can even get a 12-core 3.46GHz processor in the older model that could give the newer, 2.7GHz 12-core processor in the 2013 Mac Pro a run for its money. As for video card options, the old Mac Pro has many more. Those who did upgrade to the 'new' trashcan-like Mac Pro are also finding that the need for multiple expansion cards and external drives are cluttering up their desks, where previously these extras could be neatly concealed inside the Mac Pro chassis. For all Apple's claims about it being a powerful machine, it appears that the Mac Pro is just not considered a professional workstation by the intended market - which does raise uncomfortable questions about its future as a product line. But with its status as Apple's flagship Mac, and the hoopla surrounding its reinvention in 2013, the US assembly plants and so on, we'd be surprised if Apple threw in the towel just yet. New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Tech specs Currently there are two standard Mac Pro models available along with various build-to-order options: Quad-Core and Dual GPU: 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each; and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. 6-Core and Dual GPU: 3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 16GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each; 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. It seems likely that Apple will update the Mac Pro with the next-generation Intel Xeon E5 processor described above, we may also see more RAM in the entry-level version, now that the 15-inch MacBook Pro range ship with 16GB as standard. We'll go into more detail below. New Mac Pro specs: Ports The current Mac Pro sports six Thunderbolt 2 ports, which means this Mac can be connected to up to three 4K displays. There's also 4 USB 3 ports; Dual Gigabit Ethernet; and an HDMI 1.4 UltraHD, as well as a combined optical digital audio output/analog line out mini-jack; headphone mini-jack with headset support; HDMI port supports multi-channel audio output and a built-in speaker. Code in the El Capitan beta actually suggests that the next generation Mac Pro will offer 10 USB 3.0 ports. Currently there are 4 USB 3 ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports on the Mac Pro. We think that it would make more sense if Apple adopts Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro - this standard of Thunderbolt supports USB Type-C and offers 40Gbps transfer speeds, so Mac Pro users would get the best of both worlds. Thunderbolt 3 offers double the speed of USB 3.1, which is only 10Gbps.   Another thing Apple could add is a Lightning port as seen on the iPhone. Yes really. There are rumours that the lightning port will be used on Macs for plugging in headphones which could allow for high-res audio. However, many traditional Mac Pro users are still calling out for PCI slots, which would allow users to add faster SSDs and better video cards. Some even ask for internal drive bays, with Mac Observer noting that a 3.5in hard drive bay would allow for archival space to be added. New Mac Pro specs: Current processor The 2013 Mac Pro features Intel's Xeon E5 V2 processors (code-named Romley) offering up to 12 cores (as a build-to-order option). Back in September 2014 new Xeon E5 V3 chips (code-named Grantley) started shipping - bringing the Haswell architecture to pro workstations. At the time we thought the processor would soon make their way to the Mac Pro, but no upgrade emerged. Those Intel Xeon E5 V3 chips were being used in Dell's new Xeon Precision Tower (5810, 7810 and 7910) - find out more on Dell's website. These Dell workstations use the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor series featuring either 14 or 18 cores per processor. The processors in the current Mac Pros are configurable up to 3.5GHz for a six-core option, 3.0GHz for an 8-core option, and 2.7GHz for a 12-core option. We may see a slight boost in these numbers, but we could equally see the same clock speeds, with the processors themselves being faster. It is possible that the new Mac Pro will, like the Dell above, offer an option of 14 or 18 cores. New Mac Pro specs: New Xeon E3-1205 v6 or Xeon E3-1585 v5 processor It is likely that we see brand new Xeon processors in the Mac Pro. It's expected that we see a late Skylake (Xeon E3-1585 v5) or the new Kaby Lake ( Xeon E3-1205 v6) processors included. The Intel Skylake processor features a base clock of 3.5GHz, four cores and eight threads - it has 8MB of cache and features the Iris Pro Graphics P580 - a powerful in-built GPU that will help low-profile renders. However, with Kaby Lake already being shipped to OEMs and manufacturers, we are more likely to see these new processors shipped with the new Mac Pro. The rumoured Xeon E3-1205 v6 is a base model - featuring 3GHz of processing power - we expect more powerful and optimised CPUs to be included within the Mac Pro. Read next: i5 or i7? What is turbo boost? Here's how to choose the best processor for your Mac New Mac Pro specs: Graphics The 2013 Mac Pro features dual workstation-class GPUs. The Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the Quad-Core version, and Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the 6-Core model. There’s also a build-to-order option of the Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each (an extra £540).  AMD showcased new its new FirePro W-series at Siggraph in August 2014. The FirePro W7100, W5100 may find their way into the new Mac Pro. Alternatively there are significantly faster graphics based on AMD's Fury platform that may be destined for the new Mac Pro. Update (08/03/2016): After a thread on the Apple Support Communities website amassed a huge response when complaining about faulty graphics cards in the Late 2013 Mac Pro, Apple admitted that a number of Mac Pro's have faulty cards and that affected customers could have the issue fixed free of charge. To be legible for a free repair, you must have encountered "distorted video, no video, system instability, freezing, restarts, shutdowns" or system startup failure.  It's not all Mac Pro's though, only those manufactured between February 8 and April 11 2015, and the issue can be fixed by taking your damaged Mac Pro to an Apple Store. Interestingly, MacRumours notes that the issues are known to exist with the AMD FirePro D500 and D700 GPUs, with the AMD FirePro D300 being completely unaffected. Will these issues force Apple into choosing another graphic card manufacturer for the next Mac Pro? While there are no rumours online that suggest so, we think a change could be on the cards for the Mac Pro GPU.

We'd like to see more storage as standard on the Mac Pro, as the target audience tend to be working with very large files. An option for 2TB flash storage would be nice. New Mac Pro specs: RAM The new Xeon E5 V3 Grantley chips are said to have DDR4 memory controllers, so you can expect even faster memory in this year's new Mac Pro. The current models offer 12GB RAM in the Quad-Core model, and 16GB in the 6-Code model as standard. You can add 32GB RAM at point of purchase for £360, or a massive 64GB RAM for £1,080. As we mention above, the 15-inch MacBook Pro now comes with 16GB RAM as standard, so we would hope that the updated entry-level Mac Pro would match that. 64GB RAM might sound like a lot to you, but some of these Dell workstations can accommodate up to 1TB of DDR4 RAM. We hope that the next generation of Mac Pros will be configurable to more than 64GB (four slots of 16GB). New Mac Pro specs: Internal design Here's one last titbit that may offer clues about the Mac Pro of the future. Apple has been granted a patent for the Mac Pro, specifically for the structure and organisation of internal components and external interfaces for a compact computing system, according to a report on Patently Apple.

Read our Mac Pro reviews: Mac Pro Six-Core/3.5GHz (late 2013) review | Mac Pro Quad-Core/3.7GHz (Late 2013) review | 2013 Mac Pro review, BTO version Where can I buy a Mac Pro? The most obvious place to buy a Mac Pro is from the Apple Store. Other than directly from Apple, you can buy the Mac Pro from Apple Premium Resellers such as Stormfront, Square Group, Solutions Inc, iStore, Western Computer, MR Systems, KRCS, HardSoft, and PC World. You can find an Apple Premium Reseller near you by searching on Apple's site. UK pricing for the Mac Pro Currently the Mac Pro starts at £2,999 in the UK for a quad-core 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor with 10 MB L3 cache and Turbo Boost up to 3.9 GHz, 12GB RAM, Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB of VRAM and 256GB of flash storage.  There is also a 6-core model with 3.5GHz Xeon E5, 16GB RAM, two AMD FirePro D500 cards with 3GB of VRAM, and 256GB flash storage for £3,899. We expect that prices won't change significantly when Apple updates the range, although we could see a drop in the old model and a rise in the base 2016-2017 model - as we've seen through other Apple products. See: Apple price increases UK. Current pricing for Mac Pro build-to-order options  The build-to-order options will push the price higher. The following specifications are available for the 2013 Mac Pro: Build-to-order options on the 3.7GHz Quad-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.5GHz 6-core option (add £450), 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,800), or 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £3,150); 16GB (add £90), 32GB (add £450) or 64GB (add £1,170) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D500 (add £360), or or dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £900); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540) Build-to-order options on the 3.5GHz 6-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,350), 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £2,700); 32GB (add £360) or 64GB (£add £1,080) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £540); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540). A Mac Pro with the maximum 12-core 2.7GHz processors, with 30MB L3 cache, 64GB RAM, 1TB PCIe-based flash storage, Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each currently costs £8,759 including VAT.

(Photo: Gareth van Zyl) RELATED ARTICLES IN PICTURES: CES shows off latest 4K TVs, VR headsets Amazon’s personal assistant ‘Alexa’ coming to Huawei phones IN PICTURES: Tech giants preview new gadgets at CES Johannesburg - Digital assistants, virtual reality headsets and 4K televisions are this year’s hot technology trends as seen by the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. The world’s biggest technology show, which this year turned 50 and saw a record 180 000 visitors, turned the US gambling capital into the centre of the technology world last week. READ: IN PICTURES - 50 years of gadgets at CES Technology giants - ranging from phone makers Samsung and Huawei to chip-maker Intel - teased their product offerings and planned developments for the year ahead. And the tech world, in a big way, is moving on rapidly from smartphones, which have defined and dominated the last decade since the launch of Apple’s iPhone in 2007. Below then are the key major trends that I witnessed while attending this year’s CES. Digital assistants Amazon’s personal assistant technology ‘Alexa’ is being built into every major gadget type possible. The cloud-based artificial intelligence tool - which can handle tasks such setting an alarm, building to-do lists; getting weather and traffic reports, and connecting to an array of smart home devices - was a big talking point at this year’s CES. Chinese PC and phone maker Lenovo announced that it was launching a smart home assistant powered by Amazon's Alexa. Meanwhile, another Chinese company, Huawei, laid out its plans to bolt on Alexa to the Huawei Mate 9 as part of its US debut sometime in early 2017. READ: Amazon's personal assistant 'Alexa' coming to Huawei smartphones Huawei's Consumer Business CEO, Richard Yu, announcing a tie-up with Amazon Alexa. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) Alexa is even making its way into cars as Ford announced a partnership with the Amazon service.   Ford said it plans to let drivers ask Alexa to find destinations from their cars, control smart home devices, and, of course, order products from Amazon itself. Other big technology players such as Google and Apple already play in the personal assistant space with their respective Assistant and Siri tools. What will drive the adoption of this technology is the growing presence of the internet of things. Personal assistants will particularly have an impact in smart homes where switching off a light or activating an alarm can all be done through voice activated prompts on a smartphone. Virtual reality headsets Giant leaps are are being made in virtual reality technology as headsets get lighter and computer processors more powerful. A day before the kick-off of CES, chipmaker Intel held a press conference that mainly occurred in virtual reality. Upon arriving at the press briefing, media were presented with a black comfortable chair, an Oculus Rift headset, a laptop and a bag in case of possible nausea. READ: PICS - Intel teases new VR headset at CES For most of the briefing, Intel showed off how far virtual reality has come with 360 degree videos of a live basketball game, a live crossing to a drone flying over solar panels in Nevada and a video game featuring zombies. Intel showing off its new virtual reality headsets in the run-up to CES 2017. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) It’s clear that the opportunities for virtual reality are going to blow open in coming years, especially with sports content. Intel also teased the first version of its Project Alloy headset. The company said the headset, which is expected to go on sale later this year, will feature a combination of virtual reality and augmented reality. This means that it is capable of featuring immersive video content as well as augmented reality in which it projects computer generated images on real-life settings. Intel plans to tap partners in making and selling the device. Apart from Intel, virtual reality headsets could be seen at a range of other vendors stands at CES from Samsung to Panasonic and more. Google also announced key partnerships with Asian phone makers such as Huawei, ZTE and Asus to take forward its 'Daydream' virtual reality system. At this stage, it looks as if little can stop the virtual reality wave. READ: Asian phone makers flock to Google's VR 'daydream' Samsung with its virtual reality experience at a stand at this year's CES. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) Other vendors also showed off VR headsets at a multitude of stands at this year's CES. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) 4K televisions While VR headsets are providing an immersive viewing experience, television makers - ranging from Samsung to LG and Hisense - have gone all out on making bigger and bolder 4K and QLED TVs - the latest buzzwords for the industry. Samsung launched its new QLED 4K lineup, which offers brightness, colour and other improvements over last year's high-end SUHD lineup. LG also debuted its ‘wallpaper-thin’ high-definition TV that measured 2.57mm thick in a 65-inch screen model. LG this year has gone big on its ultra-think, super high-definition televisions. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) South Africa and China’s biggest TV seller, Hisense, unveiled its plans to sell a 100-inch 4K laser projection TV system later this year. Hisense’s use of a projection system is set to provide a similar experience to that of 100-inch televisions but at lower cost, said the company. Using a short-throw projector, Hisense’s Laser TV projects a 4K HDR picture on an included screen via HDMI or USB. READ: Hisense unveils 100-inch 4K laser-projection TV It will be available later this year for $12 999.99 (R176 000) and Fin24 understands that Hisense is preparing to show off the television in South Africa soon. Hisense grabbed attention with its cheaper 100-inch projection TV system. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) Big companies like Samsung are also tapping 'quantum dot material' technology which lets TVs show off a wider range of color. Apart from the big name companies, a number of smaller vendors also showed off their 4K TV sets - both flat and curved screens - meaning that the technology is set to become the new standard. A range of TV makers look set to flood the market with 4K television sets. (Photo: Gareth van Zyl) Overall, all of these technologies - be it virtual reality or high definition televisions - are set to talk to each more through internet of things technology and personal assistants like Amazon Alexa. Our world, and the things around it, are about to get a lot smarter. Be prepared for everything to be connected.

Companies hit their targets and showcased new and exciting products that are coming within the year. Among those companies is Intel which officially unveiled its newest Kaby Lake processors. In addition to the usual product showcases, Intel held a press conference just as the CES 2017 was winding down. In the said conference, the semiconductor company teased the participants on its upcoming Cannonlake processor. According to Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Intel plans on releasing the Cannonlake processors some time before the end of 2017. He also modelled an Intel-branded 2-in-1 hybrid laptop running on the Cannonlake chip. This is the very first public demonstration of the Cannonlake chip powering an actual device. The demo showed a video feed from the press conference. Although Krzanich did not elaborate much on the feature of the said device, he boasted about the processors actual performance on release. Intel’s current lineup for this year is dubbed as the Kaby Lake. At the moment, high-end versions of the processor are now being mass produced in time for the release some time in March. After that, Intel will then move on to the next stage of development, the 10 nm process technology. Intel-branded hybrid laptop showcased during CES 2017 (via youtube.com) The device in question could be one of Intel’s upcoming products. The demo sparked rumors that Intel could be dipping its hands into product manufacturing. The said hybrid laptop could just be one of the many products that Intel will be unveiling this year. Last year, the company formally announced it own version of open-sourced VR (virtual reality) development platform, the Project Alloy. Also last year, it released its very first commercial drone, the Falcon 8+. As previously announced, the Cannonlake chip will be made under the 10nm process technology. This new technology will introduce increased performance and power efficiency to the processor. In addition to that, overall die area is also reduced by as much as 30 percent. The release of the Cannonlake processor will usher the development of new and improved electronic devices for 2018. There is a chance that Apple might adapt the new processor for some minor updates on its computer products. For now, consumers are anticipating the release of Kaby Lake powered PCs and laptops to be released in the market.

Should Update the MacBook Pro Lineup in the Spring The Mac Maker should consider a mid-cycle update of its MacBook Pro computers to Intel's latest processors so as to avoid appearing to be at a competitive disadvantage to competing notebook computer vendors. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 9, 2017 at 9:51PM In October, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) finally rolled out long-awaited and much-anticipated updates to its MacBook Pro family of notebook computers. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch variants saw significant overhauls, including new track pads, faster processors, brighter and more colorful displays, and even the inclusion of a new touch bar on higher end 13-inch and all 15-inch models. Image source: Apple.  The machines represented nice steps forward for the MacBook Pro lineup, which hadn't seen substantial updates for quite some time. Nevertheless, I believe that Apple would be wise to update the lineup to include new processors as soon as possible, perhaps in a refresh in the March/April time frame. Here's why. An easy update to the current lineup The current MacBook Pro systems use Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) sixth-generation Core processors. Those chips first made their debut in the third quarter of 2015, but it took Apple a full year to adopt them in its systems. The new chips, which you can read more about here, essentially deliver greater speed and improved video playback capabilities. Those chips are also what is known as "pin compatible" with the prior generation sixth-generation Core processors, which means Apple wouldn't need to go and completely redesign its logic boards and systems to accommodate the new chips. How much of an upgrade would these chips be? The chips used in the current 13-inch MacBook Pro computers are the following, based on how much a customer is willing to pay: Core i5-6267U (2.9GHz base/3.3GHz single core turbo/3.1GHz dual core turbo) Core i5-6287U (3.1GHz base/3.5GHz single core turbo/3.3GHz dual core turbo) Core i7-6567U (3.3GHz base/3.6GHz single core turbo/3.4GHz dual core turbo) The direct replacements for these chips from the seventh-generation Core processors are the following: Core i5-7267U (3.1GHz base/3.5GHz single core turbo/3.5GHz dual core turbo) Core i5-7287U (3.3GHz base/3.7GHz single core turbo/3.7GHz dual core turbo) Core i7-7567U (3.5GHz base/4GHz single core turbo/3.9GHz dual core turbo) The performance gains generation-over-generation here are significant, ranging from 12% to 15% in dual-core turbo speeds. That's on top of whatever gains in graphics and media capabilities that come with these chips. Image source: Intel.  Why Apple should update the systems ASAP Although Apple does have the benefit of being the sole vendor of macOS-based computers, meaning that customers who want to buy computers that run macOS have no choice but to buy Apple's computers, there's little reason for the company to put itself at a competitive disadvantage relative to its Windows-based competitors. Apple's Macs are generally competitive, well-built devices, boasting best-in-class components in areas such as track-pads, displays, keyboards, wireless connectivity, and industrial design. However, I believe that Apple's MacBook product lines would be stronger if the company were quicker to adopt Intel's latest processors. Doing so might mean Apple pays a little bit more for processors (though I can't imagine the premium is significant), but a modest bill-of-materials increase is probably worth it, as the latest processors give Apple an additional marketing point and its competitors one less potential advantage.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Sleep. MORE on Wednesday announced his selection of an Obama nominee to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). David Shulkin was nominated by President Obama as under secretary of health for the VA in 2015.  “He’s fantastic,” Trump said of Shulkin. “He will do a truly great job.” Trump made the announcement during his first press conference since his election, and his transition team released a formal announcement shortly afterward. “One of the commitments I made is that we’re going to straighten out the whole situation for our veterans,” Trump said Wednesday. “Our veterans have been treated horribly. They’ve been waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in an have a minor early stage form of cancer and they can’t see a doctor and by the time they get to the doctor they’re terminal. ADVERTISEMENT “Not going to happen. It’s not going to happen.” In a statement released by Trump’s transition team, Shulkin said both he and Trump are “eager” to reform to the VA in a “swift, thoughtful and responsible way.” “It is my honor to serve as President-elect Trump’s Secretary of Veterans Affairs,” Shulkin said. “President-elect Trump’s commitment to caring for our veterans is unquestionable, and he is eager to support the best practices for care and provide our Veterans Affairs’ teams with the resources they need to improve health outcomes." The position was one of two Cabinet openings that Trump had yet to fill with just a little more than a week to go before his inauguration. The delay had worried veterans organizations, which were concerned that Trump wouldn’t keep his commitments to veterans made during the campaign. The VA has been plagued by scandal since 2014, when it was revealed that hospitals were keeping secret waitlists that had veterans waiting for care for inordinate amounts of time. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to reform the VA, at one point even promising that he would set up a special White House hotline to personally field complaints about the military healthcare system. He also released a 10-point plan to “make the VA great again” that includes making it easier to fire VA officials involved in wrongdoing and expanding veterans’ choices to use private healthcare.  Trump met with a slew of candidates to head the VA, but a couple leading candidates withdrew their names from consideration in the last few weeks. Prior to Wednesday’s announcement, Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator and former head of the conservative advocacy group Concerned Veterans for America, was seen as the leading contender to be VA secretary. Leading veterans organizations opposed Hegseth, however, saying he supported a plan that would in effect privatize the VA by shifting resources away from the department to allow all veterans to seek private health care. Dozen of organizations urged Trump to retain current VA Secretary Bob McDonald, saying he has overseen a number of reforms. As under secretary of health, Shulkin is the chief executive of Veterans Health Administration and oversees 1,700 care sites serving 8.76 million veterans annually. Prior to joining the VA, Shulkin served in numerous chief executive roles including serving as president at Morristown Medical Center, Goryeb Children’s Hospital and Atlantic Rehabilitation Institute. He also previously served as president and CEO of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. The choice of Shulkin should assuage worries of veterans organizations worried Trump’s reforms would be radical and lead to privatization. Shulkin is not a veteran, however, something veterans groups had recommended. He would be the first non-veteran to lead the department. Paul Rieckhoff, founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of American (IAVA), said his group is optimistic about Shulkin and looks forward to hearing about to what extent he and Trump plan to expand privatization, which he said "veterans nationwide continue to overwhelmingly oppose.” “He is well known to us, a man of character and has been a trusted partner of IAVA at VA," Rieckhoff said in a statement. "However, his selection is unprecedented. Our membership overwhelmingly supported the selection of a veteran for this critical leadership position. Dr. Shulkin’s service as under secretary is respected by the entire veterans community. He is a committed leader and is our best hope among candidates reported in the media to maintain the momentum created by Secretary McDonald to reform the VA." Got Your 6’s executive director, Bill Rausch, said in a statement that his group looks forward to working with Shulkin. "Although Dr. Shulkin does not have military experience, we have worked with him closely in his current role and have seen first-hand his unwavering commitment to our nation’s veterans," he said. "VA’s success is our veterans’ success, and we look forward to working with Dr. Shulkin, his staff and the entire Trump administration to ensure that veterans continue to be put first.” Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said he was pleased with the choice of Shulkin. “I am pleased President-elect Trump has chosen a physician to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, especially one familiar with the integrating of private practitioners into the VA's network of health care providers," he said in a statement. "I’ve long said I would be happy to work with anyone committed to ensuring our heroes have access to the services they have earned, especially quality health care, and I look forward to working with Dr. Shulkin to bring wholesale reform to the Department.” Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.), who was ranking member of the committee last year, called Shulkin the most qualified of Trump’s VA candidates. “After calling the Department of Veterans Affairs ‘the most corrupt agency in the United States’ on the campaign trail, the President-elect’s decision to retain a current VA leader and Obama-appointee is a notable departure from his inflammatory rhetoric,” Takano said in a statement. “I sincerely hope he will leave his promise to move the VA toward privatization on the campaign trail as well.” Sen. Johnny IsaksonJohnny IsaksonTrump picks Obama nominee for VA secretary Five races to watch in 2017 GOP senators wary of nuking filibuster MORE (R-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, congratulated Shulkin and said he understands how to work with Congress for meaningful reform. “There is a tremendous amount of work to be done – by the VA and by Congress – to change the paradigm at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,” Isakson said in a statement. “Dr. Shulkin understands the critical importance of working hand-in-hand with Congress on enacting meaningful, bipartisan reforms to help right the ship at the VA. I congratulate Dr. Shulkin on his nomination, and I look forward to chairing his confirmation hearing and discussing our shared priorities to ensure the VA is putting veterans first.” --This report was updated at 1:09 p.m. Tags Johnny Isakson, Donald Trump   View the discussion thread.

A new lab at National Instruments, in Austin, Texas, is bringing some competitors together. The NI Industrial IoT Lab opened on Wednesday and will house testbeds for applications like predictive maintenance, time-synchronized industrial networking and “microgrids” for renewable energy. It will also be a place where companies can show off joint solutions to customers. One of the aims of the lab is to show enterprises that IoT works, said Jamie Smith, director of embedded systems at National Instruments. “One of the barriers we face today is [gaining] wide industry confidence that these distributed industrial internet of things solutions are ready,” Smith said. The opening brought together Cisco Systems and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, known more as archrivals than as partners, as well as Intel, PTC, Real-Time Innovations, Analog Devices and the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC). They’re all sponsoring the lab along with several other players. Vendors will use the lab to showcase their products to customers but also will collaborate with others to make sure all technologies developed for industrial IoT can work together. Those include communications protocols, processing elements, software and more. On Thursday and Friday this week, the lab will host a plugfest where vendors will connect their products using TSN (time-sensitive networking). TSN, based on IEEE standards, is designed for synchronizing the clocks in industrial equipment connected over Ethernet. It should allow enterprises to gradually replace specialized industrial networks with Ethernet, integrating IT with so-called OT (operational technology). Network Instruments makes compact, hardened systems that sit at the edge of an IoT network and collect, digitize, process and transmit information from a wide variety of sensors. The systems can also control equipment at the edge in real time using data collected there, Smith said. The initial testbeds in the National Instruments lab came out of IIC, which was formed in 2014 to help bring together IT and OT systems. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The company Advanced Vector Instructions 2 (AVX2) extension set, which is mainly used for database processing and video editing - so Intel is hoping there is still a market for a slice of consumers who will buy a HT-enabled Pentium processor over the slightly cheaper Core i3.   The pricing is also a little cheaper, with the new Kaby Lake-based Core i3 processors having a $50+ premium over the new Pentium chips, but will the performance be much better? Well, the new Core i3-7100 and Pentium G4620 are only 200MHz apart and with AVX2 being the only difference, why would you pay more?

(I personally have some APL motherboards for desktops in for testing sometime during Q1 as well.) One of these platforms was GIGABYTE’s embedded BRIX line, more focused at commercial deployments than consumer, but interesting nonetheless. The main unit we saw was this: the GB-EAPD-4200 BRIX. Using an Apollo Lake SoC, it looks to be in a passive case and sports three WiFi antenna. The chassis is 0.46L, with support for 2x DDR3L-1866 SO-DIMM memory modules, one M.2 (2280) SSD slot and a mini-PCIe slot for a 3G WLAN module. The WLAN accounts for one antenna, and the other two come via an Intel 802.11ac card inside, most likely the 8265 or 8260 depending on how GBT’s design cycle was in play. Using Apollo Lake means getting HD Graphics 505, although given this system it is more than adequate for video playback or casual office use. This unit has plenty of IO to keep the buyer satisfied – dual gigabit network ports, dual HDMI 1.4 display ports, four USB 3.0 ports and support for a microSD card. VESA support for 75mm and 100mm brackets is included.\ This unit is to be sold as a barebones kit, requiring DRAM and storage, most likely for system integrators to add their own hardware solutions depending on how local customers will want them configured (small DRAM counts and low storage, or something more robust). Interested parties will need to contact their local distribution partners for more information.

Reply liu_d - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link Depends on what NICs are being used... Reply dgingeri - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link Considering it is using Intel wireless, probably not optimum, but still looks pretty good. Might work well for a Windows Server Essentials router box. Reply WorldWithoutMadness - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link too bad, it doesn't have d-sub. I usually use old monitor and leave it there for problem solving if somehow there's connection problem. Reply CaedenV - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link Hate to say it, but VGA is dead. You are not going to see any new Intel based boards with analog output any more unless there is a 3rd party graphics solution being used. Reply doggface - Thursday, January 12, 2017 - link VGA should always be an option on embedded products. Always. It is so cheap to implement and almost be default is on every chipset. The only reason I can see for why they didn't add it to this product, is that they didn't have room for the port. Btw, anyone looking for a pfsense box should look up "qotom" (sold through amazon and Ali express) great 4 port x86 routers with intel nics. Arstechnica did a review on one for their DIY router piece. Reply nerd1 - Thursday, January 12, 2017 - link PLEASE retire atom... core M is bare minimum, and we now have ARM chips just as powerful as core M but costs way lower! Reply milkod2001 - Thursday, January 12, 2017 - link Think about Core M as $$$ premium rebranded Atoms Reply MrSpadge - Friday, January 13, 2017 - link It's totally wrong if you do that.

The professionals in the class of the 2017 — profiled below in no particular order — exemplify the innovation and leadership needed to suceed in today’s fast-changing retail environment. They share a record of success that is worthy of emulation by all their peers. Beth McCormick, VP of applications, PetSmart Beth McCormick worked in retail throughout high school and college — an experience that sparked her initial interest in retailing. However, it was her role as an IT consultant that helped her realize she found her niche and “fell in love with retail technology.” “I learned the distinct challenges retail clients faced and how technology could help meet those challenges head on,” she said. Her consulting experience lead her to join American Eagle Outfitters in 1999, where she was responsible for store systems across the brand and applied technology to push for more superior customer experiences. During her tenure, she held various IT leadership positions, including VP of applications. After 14 years at American Eagle, McCormick joined PetSmart in 2014 as VP of applications. While there, she has built a new IT organization responsible for development, delivery and application operations that support key initiatives across the organization. McCormick is also responsible for bringing PetSmart’s digital platform in-house. The architecture took 10 months to complete — just in time for the 2016 holiday season. She said the project, which also included replacing fulfillment and customer care partners, “was a fast-paced, very challenging project and when PetSmart.com went online it was quickly robust and stable.” McCormick has been fortunate to have significant roles with two large retailers. But she said it’s still challenging at times to be the only woman on the team or in the room. “There are still far too few women executives in IT, and we must work hard to change that,” she added. “While I’ve always had tremendously supportive bosses and leaders, I still find myself in situations where I am treated differently.” McCormick’s success is driven by building trusted, respected partner relationships with business leaders, listening to customers’ needs, keeping up with technological trends and, most importantly, aggressively delivering value to the business. “[Retail IT] is incredibly fast-paced, stimulating and challenging,” she added. “IT has to move fast in order to keep pace, and I wouldn’t want it any other way.” Kristen Williams, Senior director e-commerce, Walmart Even as a student at the University of Arkansas in 1999, Kristen Williams was passionate about IT. After taking a position as a network cable installation tech on campus, she learned technology “from the ground up” — a concept so profound that she changed her major from industrial engineering to computer engineering. The change landed Williams a position as a network analyst at Walmart upon graduation in 2001. She worked her way up, holding a variety of roles and leadership positions — and always using her passion for retail technology as a conduit for new opportunities. “I am attracted to both the tinkering side of technology, and the cognitive side,” she said. “Technology is not only a pathway for executives in the field. It can solve problems, make users’ lives easier, and open more doors for businesses.” Williams is eager to learn new tech trends, drawn to new projects and uses technology as a means of reaching new goals. One accomplishment she is proud of is helping Walmart integrate its online and offline experiences; building and expanding its online grocery and pickup business, as well as driving its omnichannel operation both domestically and abroad. “Driving e-commerce integration was a huge accomplishment and a highlight in my career so far,” Williams said. Yet, of all her accomplishments, Williams said she is most proud of the fact that she has become “a well-rounded player who can help the company solve problems.” “I am always looking to satisfy my next goal,” she said. “Staying abreast of technology trends lets me move toward my potential, and keep moving forward. Working toward new accomplishments is not something I am willing to sacrifice.”   Deb Dixson, Senior VP, global chief information security officer, Best Buy Co. As the breadth of digital technology — and data — continues to expand, information security professionals across the retail industry struggle with how to secure their organizations. This challenge is something that Deb Dixson confronts daily. Dixson’s passion for technology evolved through a sales job where she sold grading, scheduling and testing software and hardware to the education industry The first step in her retail technology journey was as an IT contractor tasked with replacing a homegrown gift card system with a vendor-provided system. “It gave me great exposure and the opportunity to interact with many facets of the business, including the need to constantly morph and change to meet the needs of our customers — and I was hooked,” Dixson recalled. That need for reinvention prompted Dixson to explore what was happening in retail related to information security. With an eye on protecting enterprise data, she created the role of chief information security officer at Best Buy, serving in the position from 2000 to 2009, and then at Delhaize America from 2010 to 2014, where she also served as senior VP and U.S CIO. Dixson rejoined the executive team at Best Buy in 2015 as senior VP, global CISO. As employees and customers have access to so many more solutions that collect data and access networks, “it’s transforming how we need to think and act, as well as the conversations we have to have at all levels,” Dixson said. “The pace of proliferation and the power of these devices are moving far faster than standards and regulations, which has historically been a guidepost helping us articulate and manage risk,” she explained. Forging a path that hadn’t previously existed is a testament to Dixson’s passion for retail IT and speaks to her interest in solving new problems as they arise. “Doing the research and putting the proposal together to create one of the first CISO roles and information security teams in retail, taking teams through major transformations to better serve the business, and helping partners create solutions to address gaps in the industry are the things that I look back on,” Dixson added. “I’m grateful to have been in the right place at the right time to have made an impact.”   Ashlee Aldridge, Senior VP and CIO, DSW Inc. Ashlee Aldridge believes that retail success stems from teamwork and strategic relationships. After spending 1999 to 2003 at Deloitte, where Aldridge worked with a number of retailers and consumer packaged goods companies, she got hooked on retail. Her first role came in 2003 when she joined Zale Corp. as VP of strategic development. A year later, the jewelry retailer named her CIO. Aldridge left Zale in 2006, going on to CIO positions at such national chains as West Marine, Restoration Hardware and Golfsmith International. In 2015, Aldridge joined footwear giant DSW as senior VP and CIO, responsible for the chain’s global technology strategy and transformation programs. She leads the enterprise’s transformation as it moves toward adoption of web-enabled touch points, while keeping a keen eye on how to apply technology to serve the ever-changing needs of the omnichannel consumer. While there will always be an unlimited number of technology problems in the field to solve, Aldridge has set her sights on aligning relationships, and managing organizational change, talent acquisition and retention. “I work daily to connect my peers, team and partners to meet the goal of our mission, support change and encourage talent development, retention and attraction to our business,” she said. “This inspires me to do better on behalf of our customers, our company and our team. I believe executing this approach is one of the most critical skills a retailer needs to win on the way to 2020.”   Rachel Mushahwar, General manager, head of Americas sales: Retail, hospitality, and CPG, Intel Corp. Retail is in Rachel Mushahwar’s blood. Four generations of her family, starting with her great grandfather, operated retail stores, the most recent being a supermarket in Colorado that closed when her parents retired in 2004. Her background gave Mushahwar the opportunity to do nearly every job in retail — and witness the industry’s transformation. “Shoppers’ expectations have continued to rise, and retailers continually have to innovate to delight and amaze their customers,” Mushahwar said. “It’s a challenging, but exciting time when you think about all of the advancements we’ve seen to combine traditional brick-and-mortar stores with their supply chains, enabling stores to become living, breathing websites that deliver amazing customer experiences profitably.” Before joining Intel, Mushahwar spent nearly a decade at PetSmart, joining in 2006 as IT director of backoffice applications/shared services. In 2013, she was appointed as VP of global enterprise applications, responsible for retail technology strategy, development and support for all segments of the company, domestic and international. In 2015, she took a leap to the other side, joining Intel. As Intel’s head of Americas sales for retail, hospitality and CPG, Mushahwar works to help executives realize the value of a smart, connected environment and how they can analyze collected data to improve their company’s bottom line — efforts that “create new and differentiated business capabilities that drive amazing customer experiences, create new products or change how the supply chain operates,” she said. “It’s about people, processes and creating that which has not existed before,” she said. This mantra has underlined Mushahwar’s accomplishments. One of her biggest is not being afraid to take risks and accept the possibility of failure. “Executives have always believed in me and coached me to take some risks in my career, try new roles and new companies,” Mushahwar said. “Only through the right kind of risks, experimentations and failures can you — or an organization — move forward.”   Deepika Pandey, Group VP, customer experience, direct and digital marketing, Walgreens Deepika Pandey always wanted “to be involved with something that would truly change the world.” For Pandey, the opportunity arose with the evolution of e-commerce. While doing research for a professor at Northwestern University, she began exploring multiple areas of retail and marketing and became attracted to “the future of digital.” “I knew that I had found something that was going to completely transform the industry,” she said. She joined McKinsey & Co., where she developed her digital expertise and built core business skills — knowledge that prepared her to take on the role as director of online strategy at Walgreens in 2008, where Pandey championed the redesign of the drug store chain’s website, while managing a 150-person customer experience team. She went on to launch the company’s mobile apps for iPhone, iPad and Android, as well as new digital processes, including the brand’s mobile Refill by Scan pharmacy service and Quick Prints photo functionality. “Mobile is critical for us because we truly believe that is the great connector between the digital and physical worlds,” Pandey explained. Her efforts have translated into a 4.5-star rating on both app stores, proving that “technology is not just about creating functionality. It can also transform the way that consumers think about your brand,” Pandey said. Deanna Steele, Group VP, IT-brands, Ascena Retail Group Retail is often described as a dynamic, constantly changing industry. That’s exactly what attracted Deanna Steele. She got her first taste of retail upon joining Island Pacific in 1993, a position that gave her insight into how technology was becoming a business enabler. She experienced this evolution first-hand when she moved on to Deloitte’s retail practice as a senior manager. “(At Deloitte), I was a ‘student of retail,’” she said. “I learned the importance of integrating technology with business strategies and processes, and witnessed it become a catalyst for organizational change.” This insight jump-started her arrival at Hot Topic in 2004, as director of project management. Her first task: Open a distribution center on the East Coast that was completely integrated to the chain’s planning and allocation systems, purchase order management and complex replenishment processes. During her seven-year tenure at the chain, Steele held different IT roles, including VP of IT, which prepared her for her next position: VP of IT at Express. Almost two years later, in November 2013, she joined Ascena Retail Group as VP of IT for its Lane Bryant division. Steele now holds the title of Group VP, IT – Brands, at Ascena Retail. It’s a role that immerses her in the company’s ongoing transformational changes, and supports unified commerce, including the integration of new retail, business intelligence, financial and point-of-sale systems. Steele often reflects on all she’s learned throughout her career, from being on the ground floor of omnichannel’s introduction at Hot Topic to using digitally driven solutions in her current role to drive growth at one of the nation’s largest specialty apparel companies. “The projects are part of something bigger — it is exciting to know that I was part of teams that made meaningful impacts on the business as well as on the lives of our shoppers,” Steele said.   Lisa Emily, Director, IT e-commerce, customer-facing mobile and order management, Tractor Supply Co. Lisa Emily truly believes she didn’t choose retail technology as a career. Rather, it chose her. Her first retail job was as a store manager at Kirkland’s, and later she worked in the wholesale customer service division at Johnston & Murphy shoe company while completing her degree at night. But she got her first taste of technology at DK Publishing, where she worked on many aspects of the JD Edwards OneWorld enterprise resource planning application. In 2001, Emily joined the ranks of Tractor Supply Co. as a business analyst in merchandising, and by 2004, she joined the IT department as a systems analyst for merchandising systems. Emily worked her way up the IT ladder at Tractor Supply rung by rung, holding various senior positions. By 2014, she transitioned to IT director of e-commerce, order management and customer facing mobile, where her passion for technology helped drive the retailer’s digital evolution. Emily is most proud of her accomplishments that “encompass what I was able to achieve since moving to e-commerce. She added: “I was learning a new technology stack, growing the team, including offshore development for capacity and building new processes, while working on re-platforming TractorSupply.com.” Since the re-platform, the e-commerce team has successfully implemented an agile development process for continuous delivery of enhancements, and also delivered a buy online, pick up in store service. “I have always had a passion for technology driving business value, and I have gotten to see the benefits of that value in a significant way in my role in e-commerce,” Emily said.   Sarah Gelbman, Global technology sales manager, Oracle Whether managing new solutions, an influx of data or evolving processes, technology professionals are constantly juggling “information.” This is exactly what makes Sarah Gelbman thrive. “I like the influence we have as technology professionals,” she said. “We are on the pulse of real, tangible, positive change.” Gelbman began her IT journey in 2001, as manager of technical operations at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where she led a team of specialists in technical management of the studio’s physical and digital assets. She spent five years at MGM, and then moved to the media industry, where she gained sales expertise. Gelbman made the move to retail technology in 2012, as an enterprise technology account manager for Oracle. Among her projects: Working with Cole Haan in its divestiture from Nike. “The project got a lot of visibility, and the success led to Oracle management tapping me for my appointment as global technology sales manager for Walmart [in 2013],” she said. She leads a team of over 30 pillar sales leads and technical specialists in Oracle’s engagement across the huge Walmart enterprise. They cover the entire data platform. Gelbman is especially proud of the work her team is doing on modern data hybrid cloud management. “I lead an extremely talented group of sales specialists, technical engineers and architects, and we’ve authored a solution for a seamlessly integrated hybrid cloud data layer comprised of disparate platforms and sources,” she said. These efforts set the tone to serve the digital, mobile customer. “Our work is not simply conceptual,” Gelbman added. “The business conversations I have every day center on modernizing and evolving the customer experience.”   Liza Landsman, Chief customer officer, Jet.com As chief customer officer of the online marketplace Jet.com, which Wal-Mart Stores acquired in September in a $3.3 billion deal, Liza Landsman has an ambitious mandate: Ensure that Jet.com reaches the broadest possible group of consumers, and that shoppers on the site have a world-class experience. Landsman joined the online startup in March 2015, bringing with her an impressive resume that includes financial services, marketing and data science. Prior to Jet.com, she was chief marketing officer for E*Trade, where she led the firm’s marketing initiatives, including customer engagement, analytics and insights, advertising, and direct online and offline marketing programs and branded campaigns. Landsman also held leadership roles at global investment firm BlackRock, where she was global managing director of digital, and at Citi, as managing director of North American consumer internet and mobile. At Jet.com, Landsman is focused on engaging potential members at a broad level, and making sure the retailer provides a seamless end-to-end customer experience. “It is important to understand — impacting what consumers [will] pay is the direct result of how our platform actually removes costs from the system rather than a focus on price, per se,” Landsman said in a Forrester blog post in 2015. “They are loving the great brands, great value and great consumer experience, and returning to build bigger and smarter baskets over and over.” Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Sears sells top brand, closing more stores Top 10 Women in Retail Tech Closing time for The Limited stores Walmart’s Jet.com acquires Zappos competitor Macy’s details store closings, restructuring amid poor holiday sales Rebecca Minkoff puts virtual mirror into shoppers hands Target axes kids’ shopping carts Unusual deal gives Aeropostale new lease on life — and it just got better Flip-Flop Shops on the move Target first out of the gate with holiday hiring plans Solutions Spotlight Taking Stock of Retail’s Analytics Capabilities When it comes to using data and analytics to drive business results, where does the retail industry stand relative to other industries?

The speech marks Trump's first formal press conference since winning the U.S. presidency in November. "We are 9 days away from the 45th president of the United States of America," vice president-elect Mike Pence said as he announced Trump. "I said that I will be the greatest job producer that god ever created, and I mean that," Trump said Wednesday, pushing that he would bring jobs and heighten the economy.  Trump also announced Wednesday that he appointed David Shulkin as head secretary of the Veteran's Administration. RELATED: Trump picks Obama appointee David Shulkin to lead VA As expected, the topic was brought up regarding recent reports that U.S. Intel chiefs informed Trump of claims Russia was attempting to compromise him. CNN reported that top-ranking U.S. Intelligence chiefs presented President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump with classified documents that contained allegations that "Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump."  RELATED: CNN: US Intel chiefs inform Trump of claims Russia attempting to compromise him Trump, when asked about the reports, said the meetings are confidential and classified. "It's all fake news. It didn't happen," Trump said, calling the reporting "a disgrace." "It was a group of opponents that got together, sick people. And they put that crap together," Trump said. "I think it's an absolute disgrace." Trump said America will form a defense by putting great "computer minds" together. "We are some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we've assembled." "Within 90 days we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense," Trump said. "The United States is hacked by everybody. That includes Russia and China and everybody," Trump continued. "We have no defense."  The president-elect said Russia will respect our country more when he is leading it. "You will see that. Russia will respect our country more." Trump promised citizens will be proud of what is being put forth regarding health care, calling Obamacare "a disaster." Deductibles are so high that people go broke just paying their premiums, Trump said. "We are doing the Democrats a great service," Trump said of removing Obamacare.  "The plan is to repeal and replace, essentially simultaneously," Trump said. "We're going to have a health care that is far less expensive, and far better."  The United States Presidential Inauguration will be the morning of Friday, Jan. 20. Copyright 2017 WBTV.

Donald Trump (Getty Images) In fact, McFadden further stated that the brief — published by BuzzFeed on Tuesday — was in fact an example of “what [U.S. intelligence officials] are calling ‘unvetted disinformation,'” designed to help Trump distinguish between “analyzed intelligence” and unverified reports. (RELATED: BuzzFeed Publishes Unverified Claims About Trump And Russian Hookers) WATCH: “A senior U.S. intelligence official who was involved in the preparation for the meeting tells NBC that the president-elect was not briefed on this so-called two-page addendum of these allegations against him,” McFadden state. “It was part of the briefing materials available to the briefers, but it was not included because they believed it to be true. It was included for a different reason.” “It was included should they feel they needed to explain to Mr. Trump the difference between analyzed intelligence and what they are calling ‘unvetted disinformation,'” she continued. “It was available for that purpose, and it never came up. Importantly, documents were never presented to Mr. Trump or his team.” Donald Trump (Getty Images) McFadden further stated that Trump’s intelligence briefing “was an oral briefing.

The addendum was based on a 35-page memo that includes unconfirmed allegations against Trump. BuzzFeed published the 35-page memo Tuesday without confirming whether any of the allegations were true.

"I win an election easily, a great "movement" is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state!," Trump wrote on Twitter.

Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to "leak" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 Trump's tweets came in response to a major development on Tuesday night, when CNN reported that last week, classified documents presented to President Barack Obama and Trump that included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Trump, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings. RELATED: Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him Read More After Russia denied having any such information -- Putin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday called the charges "a clear attempt to harm our bilateral relationship" and a "witch hunt" -- Trump took to social media to insist that Russia had no undue influence over him. Trump wrote on Twitter, "Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is "A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE." Very unfair!" Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is "A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE." Very unfair!— Donald J.

Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 The allegations regarding Trump and Russia were presented in a two-page synopsis that was appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, reported on last Friday. The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible. The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Mr. Trump. The two-page synopsis also included allegations that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government, according to two national security officials. The classified briefings last week were presented by four of the senior-most US intelligence chiefs -- Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers. Trump is holding a pre-scheduled news conference at 11 a.m. ET Wednesday.

And we weren't totally wrong - Amazon's Alexa assistant was baked into gadgets everywhere, even in cars! But looking back at all of our coverage, there was plenty we had no idea about. This is the best stuff we saw at CES 2o17. TVs that seem to disappear  TVs are always a big draw at CES, and this year was no exception. Mercifully, the curved TV gimmick finally looks like it's on its way out. In the biggest trend to emerge, Sony, LG and Samsung all moved the core components of their flagship TV sets to outside hardware. In the case of Samsung, all of the ports and brains of its new models are housed in an outside box. Sony built the guts for its top TV into a subwoofer that doubles as a TV stand. But for my money, the most impressive TV was the new W7 from LG. This OLED TV is just 2.5mm thick — literally thinner than my finger. Everything that actually powers the TV is jammed into a futuristic-looking Dolby Atmos soundbar. I want it. LG also had a prototype OLED TV that is 40 per cent translucent. I'm not sure if I see the use case quite yet, but anything that brings us closer to Minority Report is good with me. Honda's self-balancing motorcycle Honda showed off its new Riding Assistant technology that keeps your bike balanced when it's moving at speeds less than 5km/h (like when you're pulling out of the garage or stopping at a traffic light). The tech will even work when the rider isn't on board, meaning you never have to worry about your bike falling over on its side ever again. This is still a concept, so we might never the tech in actual bikes, but it sure does look cool. Razer's insane three monitor laptop Razer showed off a lot of cool gadgets at CES, but the coolest was definitely its prototype of a gaming laptop with THREE 4K displays. That's right, this beastly laptop has three 17.3-inch displays pushing millions of pixels. It's one of the coolest things we've seen. Dubbed Project Valerie, the laptop is powered by an Intel Kaby Lake processor and Nvidia's 1080 graphics card. We just saw a prototype, but Razer says the final version will have the two side monitors slide out of the main monitor, for easy storage. If this thing does come to market — and that's a big if — prepare for it to be expensive. But price, weight and the fact that it will inevitably be hot enough to cook food doesn't even matter. It's a 12K gaming laptop. Hell yeah. Razer's futuristic Project Ariana Image: Razer Speaking of Razer, the gaming company's conceptual gaming projector promises to deliver VR-like experience without needing a VR headset. When pointed at the screen, Project Ariana's depth-sensing cameras can expand the edges of the TV onto the wall, making your game world more immersive. It can also work with the other lighting products in the room to alter colours across devices, so if a character goes into rage mode, not only does the screen go red, all the lights in your setup go red too. We won't see Project Ariana until at LEAST very late 2017, but if it can hit the market, it could be a cool alternative to VR headsets for gamers that want truly immersive experiences. Unfortunately, my Brooklyn living room isn't big enough for VR, let alone something like this, but I love it anyway. Super Game Boy is back The massive success of the NES Classic Edition proves that all of us ageing millennials are obsessed with classic gaming. And what gets more classic than Nintendo's original Game Boy? The team at Retro-Bit showed off a brand new, souped-up Game Boy that shares the same form-factor as the original, but packs in so much more. It will play original Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance cartridges. It also has a 10-hour battery life and a shatter-resistant display. The best part? This little guy is only $US80 ($109)! We can't wait to get our hands on one and relive playing the original Tetris, Super Mario Land 2 and Link's Awakening. LEGO's new robots LEGO has had robotic kits for years, but the problem is that the builds always involved a lot of work and some mild coding skills. Granted, it's a nice way to learn something new, but sometimes you just want to quickly build a robot buddy. With LEGO Boost, the lazy amongst us can finally build robotic toys. Using a companion app, you just drag and drop different actions to control the robot, rather than having to tediously code in commands. The kit comes with five different projects, including a cat, a robot, a guitar, a bulldozer and a LEGO stacking machine. Intel's Compute Card is so tiny A few years ago at CES, Intel introduced its Compute Stick, its tiny-arse computer that fits into something about the size of a Chromecast. Now Intel has something even tinier — and potentially more useful — its new Compute Card. The size and thickness of a few stacked credit cards, the Compute Card packs in a ton of power into the svelte package. You get a Kaby Lake processor, Wi-Fi, memory and storage. The idea is that you can then insert this card into a dumb monitor or other type of dock, and voila, instant computer system. Intel is hoping it can get a lot of manufacturers on board to support the Compute Card — think everything from kiosks, smart TVs and smart appliances. For TVs especially, this could provide a smart upgrade path for new kinds of apps and processes. Just swap your old Compute Card out with another. It will be a while before this hits the market. Intel's first partnership is with the Foxconn-owned Sharp, for giant displays at shopping centres and hotels. But maybe if we're lucky, one day we'll be able to just carry our computers with us in our wallets. Sony's crazy thin E Ink watch Despite being a pretty blah year for wearables — mostly because no one is buying smartwatches — Sony still showed an amazing concept for an E Ink smartwatch at CES. The concept, which was shown under glass, can change design and colour — meaning you can switch up your fashion statement depending on what you're wearing or your mood. Strikingly, the E Ink display is thinner than a credit card. If this thing ever does come to market, it might be Japanese only — but it's such a cool idea, we can't help but hope the tech makes its way into a proper product eventually.

The federation of seven sheikhdoms, founded in 1971 on the Arabian Peninsula, said it would immediately fly the nation's flag at half-staff for three days in honor of the dead from the attack Tuesday in Kandahar, which killed at least 11 people. Meanwhile, the Taliban denied planting the bomb in the Kandahar attack, which also wounded the UAE ambassador to Afghanistan. Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE prime minister and vice president, said on Twitter that "there is no human, moral or religious justification for the bombing and killing of people trying to help" others.   Abu Dhabi's powerful crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, said the attack wouldn't stop UAE's humanitarian efforts. "We will not be discouraged by despicable terrorist acts carried out by the forces of evil and darkness," he said on Twitter. The Kandahar attack targeted a guesthouse of provincial Gov Homayun Azizi, who was also wounded in the assault, along with UAE Ambassador Juma Mohammed Abdullah al-Kaabi. The attack killed 11 people and wounded 18, said Gen Abdul Razeq, Kandahar's police chief who was praying nearby at the time of the blast. Razeq said investigators believe someone hid the bomb inside a sofa at the guesthouse. He said an ongoing construction project at the guesthouse may have allowed militants to plant the bomb. "Right now we cannot say anything that who is behind this attack," he told The Associated Press, while adding that several suspects had been arrested. The attack inside the heavily guarded compound represents a major breach of security, even in Afghanistan, a country long torn by war. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Wednesday condemned the attack and ordered a probe into the incident.

A total of 64 percent of respondents said that Trump should delete the social network account, while only 32 percent of those polled said he should maintain it. The strongest negative response came from respondents aged 18 to 34, of whom over 70 percent were against the account, the poll released on Tuesday revealed. The survey, in which 899 voters participated, was conducted by telephone on January 5-9 throughout the country. The margin of error is about 3.3 percent. Trump used the social media platform during his campaign to criticize rivals and media coverage and has continued to use it to comment on foreign and economic policy, including issues such as US relations with China and Russia. Trump's inauguration will be held January 20 in Washington, DC, in front of the Capitol, the seat of the US Congress. Once in office, Trump's team will take over the @POTUS and @WhiteHouse Twitter accounts from the Obama administration.

That is about 35% of the registered voters in the US. Sure, some of his followers are not US citizens, but I doubt that many people outside the US care enough to follow him. I doubt even more that people who don't vote, bother to follow Trump and even more that even half of the people who don't follow him care enough to want him to stop.Show new comments (0) Сomment Reply in reply to(Show commentHide comment) | | Edit | Delete Save Thank you!

Citing "multiple" unnamed US officials with direct knowledge of the meeting, CNN said the intelligence chiefs presented a two-page synopsis on the potential embarrassment for the incoming president along with their classified briefing on Friday on alleged Russian interference in the presidential election. President Barack Obama was also briefed on the issue on Thursday. CNN gave no details of what the so-called compromising information is, but said knowledge of its existence in Russian hands originally came from a former British MI-6 intelligence operative hired by other US presidential contenders to do political "opposition research" on Trump in the middle of last year. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had been given the information in August, more than two months before the November 8 election, according to CNN. "What has changed since then is that US intelligence agencies have now checked out the former British intelligence operative and his vast network throughout Europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough to include some of the information in the presentations" to Trump, CNN said. The existence of the information on Trump in Russian hands has been rumored since before the election.  The rumors gained support when the then Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, said in a letter to FBI Director James Comey a week before the vote: "It has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government -– a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information." In the Friday briefing Trump was also told by the intelligence officials -- the heads of the Directorate of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency -- of allegations that supporters of his White House campaign had a "continuing exchange of information" with intermediaries for the Russian government during the election. Asked about this in a Senate hearing Tuesday, Comey refused to confirm or deny that his agency was investigating such links. US intelligence has concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an operation to meddle in the US election to hurt the campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton with embarrassing hacked emails, and then to boost Trump when they thought he had a chance to win. Trump has repeatedly dismissed the conclusion that Moscow influenced the election while expressing the need to smooth over bilateral relations deeply strained during the Obama presidency.   Related russia CNN fbi donald trump Legal Notice: Copyright, trade marks and other intellectual property rights in this website can not be reproduced without the prior permission.

It’s Americans I Hate. “A vote cast for Trump is kind of like … FEMINISM: Madonna: Trump Presidency Is Like A Bad Breakup…. » January 10, 2017 HMM: Yikes: Intel chiefs told Trump Russia claims to have compromising personal and financial information on him; Update: CNN video added; Update: Memos leaked to BuzzFeed. Meanwhile, people on Twitter are claiming the original source is actually a 4Chan prank, which ordinarily would be absurd, but these days, well, who knows? Meanwhile, of course, Trump has survived so many scandals that it’s hard to imagine what would count as “compromising.” But stay tuned. This may well be “Fake News,” but it’s not as if Trump and Putin haven’t been friendly. However, every time we’ve had word of the big pending scandal that will definitely kill off Trump’s presidency this time, it’s been a bust. And if it by some chance does work out that way? Enjoy President Pence, Dems! UPDATE: 4Chan Claims To Have Fabricated Anti-Trump Report As A Hoax. Related: Fake News: BuzzFeed Runs ‘Unverifiable’ Trump-Russia Claims. “BuzzFeed acknowledges that it has not verified the accusations and even notes that the document contains a number of basic factual errors. Yet it published the full document.” Question: Did they run the question of publishing claims that they admit are “unverifiable” by libel counsel? Because while Trump is probably the world’s ultimate “public figure,” well . . . . Most damning: “Even Mother Jones declined to publish the full details and dossier.” If this collapses, as it likely will, it will have the effect of making Trump pretty much scandal-proof. Related: Maybe the whole thing is a Trump “False Flag” operation! The truth is out there! ANOTHER UPDATE: The Lawfare Blog: Take A Deep Breath. “First, we have no idea if any of these allegations are true. Yes, they are explosive; they are also entirely unsubstantiated, at least to our knowledge, at this stage. For this reason, even now, we are not going to discuss the specific allegations within the document. Second, while unproven, the allegations are being taken quite seriously.” MORE: From the comments: “A friend pointed this out: In this ‘report,’ British intelligence describes events surrounding the ‘World Cup Soccer tournament.’ Soccer. Let’s repeat that… Soccer!! What self-respecting Brit would call the biggest sporting event in the world a ‘soccer tournament?'” A rational one that recognizes that Third World Kickball is barely even a sport?

It adds the first touchscreen that any Mac has had, updates to new(er) Intel processors and AMD graphics, and makes a swathe of behind-the-scenes usability changes. It's the sum total of those small changes, though — not the new processing power or the not-exactly-amazing battery life — that make the new MacBook Pro a worthwhile purchase if you're considering one. What Is It? The late-2016-into-2017 Apple MacBook Pro is the first design refresh in four years for the most powerful portable notebook that Apple currently produces. It's thinner and lighter than the now very outdated MacBook Air, aggressively abandons old connection standards in favour of USB Type-C across the board, and upgrades to a brighter and more colourful display and a much, much larger Force Touch trackpad. And, of course, it runs macOS. You're able to buy a MacBook Pro from a starting price of $2199 in Australia for an entry-level 13-inch model, which you can spec up to $2999 for the top 13-inch or as much as $4249 for the best possible 15-inch variant. That $2199 won't get you the new MacBook Pro's most talked-about feature, though; the cheapest Touch Bar-enabled MBP is $2699 in Oz. 13-inch models get a Core i5 CPU and 256GB or 512GB SSD as default, while the 15-inchers have Core i7s; you can spec any machine up to an i7 and larger SSD, though, although the best processors and 2TB SSDs are restricted to 15-inch only. The Touch Bar is an interesting compromise between a touchscreen laptop display — as seen on Apple's direct competitor from Microsoft, the Surface Book — and good ol' fashioned keyboard buttons. It replaces the old row of 12 function keys on the previous MacBook Pro with a fully customisable, touch-sensitive OLED panel with TouchID. It's still an interesting move by Apple not to make the Pro laptop touch-enabled across its entire screen, but that's a move that would require significant work on its macOS operating system as well as on the hardware level. Those USB-C ports are all multipurpose, too — you can use them all for charging, for data, or video, or any other transfer standard that USB-C supports, as long as you have the right cable or a dongle. Apple claims up to 10 hours of battery life from all of the different MacBook Pro 13- and 15-inch models in its regular wireless web browsing tests, but it's worth noting that the new 87-Watt power adapter that connects over USB-C will charge the laptop much faster than its predecessor. I'll go into detail on my varied experiences of the MacBook Pro's off-charger battery life performance later on, but I will say now that when you visit a charger to top up you'll get plenty of battery reserve back very quickly. What's It Good At? The biggest and most important updates to the new MacBook Pro, I think, aren't under the hood: they're on the outside. Most obvious is the noticeable improvement in usability that the new MacBook Pro's keyboard and trackpad bring. It's absolutely true that there's a not-exactly-shallow learning curve to using the Pro's incredibly short-travel keyboard, which it has inherited from the 12-inch retina MacBook, but once you're used to the key positioning, it's a joy to use. I can blast through emails and longer articles — like this review — at a greater speed and with greater accuracy on the MacBook Pro's keyboard than on the Logitech mechanical keyboard that I use on my desktop PC daily. The Touch Bar is an interesting development, and while it definitely feels like a first-generation device — it's not incredibly high resolution, it doesn't have bespoke controls in every app — it's also a very very smart idea. Having a fully customisable panel in front of your fingerprints means keyboard autocomplete and autocorrect is instantly as easy as it is on an iPhone, choosing an emoji from the list that pops up is simple, and apps like Photoshop that have integrated Touch Bar support do it very well. Being able to choose a colour by swiping your finger across the panel is a quantum leap over a keyboard. And the larger trackpad is equally as important. It's massive, and that helps a lot for general navigation around MacOS as well as gestures like pinching and zooming around apps like Maps. The new screen, too, is much brighter, and that's a godsend whenever you're working anywhere that you can't control the lighting within. It's two thirds brighter than the last generation at 500 nits, and that level also means it's one of the brighter easily-portable laptops out there. If you need a notebook that you can work on while you're out in a cafe, while you're sitting outside, while you're travelling on a train or a bus on the way to work in the morning, the MacBook Pro kicks ass. It supports DCI-P3 wide colour and has two thirds more contrast than the last generation, but what you need to know is that it just looks good. Being smaller and thinner and lighter means that the MacBook Pro — and remember this is a Pro, with a full-fat Intel processor and fast storage and discrete graphics on the 15-inch model, not the lightweight Core M of the 12-inch MacBook — is actually portable. It's the first iteration of the MacBook Pro that I'd actually carry to work and back with me every day, in the same way that I've been doing currently with the Surface Pro 4. You don't make the usual sacrifices of thin and light laptops, either — for example, the MacBook Pro has speakers that don't sound terrible. What's It Not Good At? Over the past couple of weeks of road-testing, the battery life of the MacBook Pro has been... mediocre. Not abysmal, but just not particularly impressive. It's understandable, though: the new MacBook Pro has more going on than the old one ever did. A lot of that comes from the extra power required by that massively bright 500-nit screen and the Touch Bar and the better backlighting of the redesigned keyboard, as well as the more powerful processor and new discrete graphics. With the screen at high brightness and wireless working away actively, I've seen battery life in the region of five hours, half of Apple's testing. For what it's worth, recharging that battery with the fast USB-C charger happens quickly. Apple's timing for the update of the MacBook Pro means that it uses Intel's sixth-generation Skylake mobile processors, rather than the seventh-generation Kaby Lake chips that are starting to appear in competitor notebooks post-CES. That's a pity, because the new chips are both more powerful and more energy-efficient. That doesn't make the MacBook Pro any less good, but it does mean that there will be competing machines from the likes of Razer and Dell and Lenovo that may have superior battery life or more outright grunt. The switch to Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C is a Good Thing, and I won't hear anyone else say otherwise. I'm not blinkered enough to think that it's not going to be a difficult thing, though, for anyone considering an upgrade that still has a legacy device that they need to plug in regularly. Anything with a standard USB connector will need an adapter, any non Thunderbolt 3-compatible monitor will need a converter on its cable. It's possible to upgrade other components of your setup when you buy a new MacBook, but that's just an extra cost to consider. And it's one small price to pay for the relentless march of technology, but have you noticed that the new MacBook Pro doesn't have that beautiful glowing Apple logo on the top of its lid any more? I miss it. Should You Buy It? The new MacBook Pro is, in so many ways, a huge and quantum improvement over its predecessor. It's smaller and thinner and lighter and has a brighter screen and a better keyboard and a bigger trackpad and more powerful processor and you can unlock it with your fingerprint. If you've used a MacBook Pro from the last generation or two generations ago, every one of these improvements should be useful to you in some way. But the road to the future is paved with difficulties and failures along the way. You have the potential to use the new MacBook Pro's batter faster than you could on the older models. The Touch Bar still feels like a work in progress, and you'll probably have to wait for your favourite Mac app to make the best possible use of it in the months and years to come. You'll need new cables or bulky dongles, for now at least, to use those Thunderbolt 3 ports. It's worth it, but it's not an entirely painless upgrade.

When new versions of laptops are released they will have better hardware so I'm confused how you can say this will make it better when every company that design a laptop does the same, HP, Dell, Microsoft and so many other companies. Reply 0 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson AUTHOR Jan 11, 2017, 2:09pm "thinner with a brighter screen" -- how is that not better? Reply 3 barry @barry Jan 11, 2017, 2:28pm Thinner? don't see it. Brighter....use the button that brightens up the screen. I don't see how these two are major improvements? Less Weight (not always thinner) is something I can understand but to me, if it becomes too thin, it seems more brakable or more fragile Reply 2 ted @ted Jan 11, 2017, 2:47pm Use realise that brightness buttons have a limit, right?

Reply 1 jaded @jaded Jan 12, 2017, 10:00am You've obviously never had a job where you have to cart laptops around with you everywhere you go. Reply 0 barry @barry Jan 12, 2017, 10:04am Yes, hence why I purchased a Surface Tablet/Laptop. It's compact design and the weight was one of the reasons why I purchased it. Instead of carrying a 3kg laptop plus cables, plugs, tools etc...the bag I used would be over 5kgs. The Surface made that well below 3kgs now. Reply 0 jaded @jaded Jan 12, 2017, 10:08am Er... okay... so you don't see the value of lighter, thinner form factors, but they influence your purchasing choices... curious. Reply 0 barry @barry Jan 12, 2017, 11:46am Not 100% true but apple and oranges there. Surface is more of a tablet to me than a laptop Reply 0 jaded @jaded Jan 13, 2017, 11:32am And you're saying that its weight and form factor didn't influence your decision to use a Surface as your work computer... lol Reply 0 MotorMouth @motormouth Jan 11, 2017, 2:54pm It's not better when it shortens battery life and every review I've read, including this one, says that it has done exactly that. Your defence of it doesn't exactly make sense, either, as newer CPUs and GPUs are far more power-efficient than older models and the OLED used in the Touch Bar should be very power-efficient, too. When Microsoft can release a new Surface Book with 14 hour battery life, Apple should be able to at least come close with this if they hope to remain relevant. And, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Samsung have a Series 9 laptop with a 500 nit screen four or five years ago? Last edited January 11, 2017 2:55 pm Reply 2 MotorMouth @motormouth Jan 11, 2017, 2:48pm "... once you're used to the key positioning, it's a joy to use. I can blast through emails and longer articles — like this review — at a greater speed and with greater accuracy on the MacBook Pro's keyboard than on the Logitech mechanical keyboard that I use on my desktop PC daily." Would you care to elaborate on exactly how this works, Campbell? If this is true, then Apple's marketing is missing a big trick because there must be something truly magical in keys that feel like buttons, that nobody but you has discovered. Seriously, the best keyboard in the universe is not going to magically make me type faster or more accurately than the keyboard I use every day, assuming that keyboard doesn't have some fatal flaw. I just can't see how it's possible without some level of revolutionary design or some incredible innovation. One of my colleagues, who is a touch typist and complete Mac fanboi, told me the problem he has with the new keyboard is that it is too sensitive, so his touch-typing method results in too many unintended key presses. This is from a guy who has never previously said anything even midly critical of anything Apple have ever done and has drunk th eKool-Aid like it is going out of fashion - iPhone, iPad Air, iPad Pro, MacBook Pro and iMac. "The switch to Thunderbolt 34 and USB Type-C is a Good Thing, and I won't hear anyone else say otherwise." Then you are simply refusing to listen to reason and commn sense. What makes infinitely more sense is to do what Dell have done with their XPS machines - offer both the new Thunderbolt/Type C port and standard USB 3 ports to allow users transition to the new standard in their own time. e.g. I am not ditching my Samsung T1 drive just because a laptop manufacturer can't be arsed to put in USB 3 and adding a dongle to it would make it unreasonably awkward for zero benefit. Last edited January 11, 2017 2:49 pm Reply 0 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson AUTHOR Jan 11, 2017, 4:14pm For the kind of typing that I do -- bottoming out, full power, blast away at the keys touch typing -- keys with shorter travel work really well, as long as they have a strongly tactile feel. And because the MBP's keyboard is both really tactile and has short travel, I can type quickly on it. I don't have to lift my fingers so much when I'm moving between keys, for example, which I have to when I'm typing on a traditional keyboard to avoid accidentally striking the wrong keys. Reply 1 MotorMouth @motormouth Jan 12, 2017, 10:18am I also tend to hit the keys very hard, as I learned to type on a mechanical typewriter, and what would worry me about using the new keyboard is that my fingertips would get very sore from the lack of travel. It is little different to banging on a plank of wood. I found that I could feel it even after just typing a paragraph in a shop. I can't imagine how my fingers would feel after a full day of using it.

Does it even come with at least one free normal USB to usbc adaptor? Even cheap graphics cards come with adaptors... You can have the progress with tech, while not needlessly obsoleting everything. Apart from the money its bad for the environment. Also I assume you were using a full spect 15" model. Is battery life better with one of the more basic 13" models? Reply 0 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson AUTHOR Jan 11, 2017, 4:11pm I was on a mid-spec 13in. By my estimation the 15-inch would be worse due to the larger (relative) screen to battery ratio and the discrete graphics. Reply 0 klaw @klaw Jan 11, 2017, 5:18pm Not to mention the 15" models are the only ones with a quad-core CPU, which would alsouse more battery power. And if I recall correctly, the GPU in the 15" model is not switchable, so it runs full-time rather than using integrated GPU for low-power tasks. Reply 0 mitemoii @mitemoii Jan 11, 2017, 3:40pm Compared to the last MacBook Pro and even competitors such as the XPS, I really do not see this as an improvement at all (coming from a current Mac user). "Thinner and brighter" are not sufficient replacements for such a major decrease in battery life compared to the last model, I don't know many people who use their MacBooks at max brightness so an increased brightness does not mean much. The Touch Bar seems like a waste of space for anyone who actually knows what they're doing with programs such as photoshop or illustrator as the keyboard shortcuts for actions will already be much faster to use for them than reaching to the top of the screen to swipe or scroll on a touch bar. The keyboard is horrible and while it is an improvement over the "MacBook" keyboard, it is nothing compared to their last generation Pro keyboard. Lack of ports is also horrible, I understand and agree with moving forward with ports but to completely just cut out support is bad. Most current windows laptops include at least a usb 3.0 port with usb-c or a free dongle, this laptop has neither of these and would rather charge a premium. A horrible product and a seemingly bias review. Reply 2 dazzler @dazzler3622 Jan 12, 2017, 8:11am A horrible product and a seemingly bias review. Recently I've noticed pretty much every Gizmodo review of apple products barely mentions competitors, it only compares it to the previous model. Agree on the ports, USB-C is nowhere near mainstream in our market, the laptop might be thinner and look nice on its own but once you add all the cables, adapters, dongles etc to make it a functional piece of equipment it looks awful and is a nightmare to transport. Each to their own I guess! Reply 1 ionchef @ionchef Jan 12, 2017, 9:39am It's hard to compare when you don't have a 5 year old laptop lying around to compare it too. Reply 0 mitemoii @mitemoii Jan 12, 2017, 12:40pm Seeing that I'm reading a Technology focused blog that have continuously published comparisons between 13-inch laptops for the past few months, I would expect that it is well within their ability to compare it to similar laptops such as the XPS or Razer Blade Stealth (Even though the use of last generation's processor in the MacBook makes it a bit harder). When the last paragraph of the review is "Should you buy it?", if they are trying to help customers make an informed opinion of a product, they should be informing customers about superior products that exist at a lower price. Reply 0 ionchef @ionchef Jan 12, 2017, 2:08pm I agree completely, but honestly unless you are desperate to use OSX or hang with the cool kids why would you even bother with reading a Mac review. They are always slightly better/worse than the last one and not as functionally or economically good as the competition so best not mention them. Reply 0 mitemoii @mitemoii Jan 12, 2017, 3:27pm I can see your point and agree, I'm just someone who currently owns two MacBooks, one for personal use and one required by my workplace. It was interesting to read about what Gizmodo thought about the new models. I love my 2015 pro which was only $1500 when I bought it new compared to the $2200 for the non-touch bar model and $2700 for the touch bar model. That's $1200 more to get the full improvements of the new models, it just doesn't look like there is anything in it worthy of upgrading to compared to the current windows ultrabooks. Reply 1 jaded @jaded Jan 12, 2017, 10:06am The Touch Bar seems like a waste of space for anyone who actually knows what they're doing with programs such as photoshop or illustrator as the keyboard shortcuts for actions will already be much faster to use for them than reaching to the top of the screen to swipe or scroll on a touch bar. Lol. Man making adjustments in PS / Lightroom is a treat with the touch bar. Much nicer to slide a slider than clicking and dragging with a mouse... and without having to cover the screen with your hand... awesom! Reply 0 MotorMouth @motormouth Jan 12, 2017, 10:25am Why? It seems like two very similar ways of achieving the exact same thing, except that using your mouse doesn't require you to look away from your screen, where locating a slider on the Touch Bar definitely does. It's an interruption to your workflow, not an enhancement. Reply 1 jaded @jaded Jan 12, 2017, 10:36am Okay. Thanks for telling me how much worse my workflow is now that I have a new MacBook. And clicking and dragging with a mouse is a completely different action than sliding a finger...

You MUST buy this because Apple is "courageous". No other marketing spin required... Reply 1 felicitous_blue @felicitous_blue Jan 12, 2017, 10:20am Issues of OS and brand loyalty aside, why would you buy this over something like the Razer Blade? Similar price and form factor, much better performance in the competitor. Wasn't there an article to that effect recently here on Gizmondo? Seriously curious, when I was looking myself (back in late 2015) my initial impulse and reason for looking was I wanted a MacBook but ended up going with a Blade as it gave so much more bang-for-buck. Reply 1 tjv82c @tjv82c Jan 12, 2017, 1:03pm For me it is because of OSX. The Blade with it's external GPU enclosure would be perfect for me, fixing a lot of shortcomings the Apple lineup has... but I enjoy using OSX for my personal tasks. I have plenty of Win 10 machines available to me, but my MacBook is the machine I use the most, it just works the best for what I need it for. I haven't really had a chance to use the keyboard on the new MBP's just yet, but I love the keyboard on the 12" MBP... I can type a lot faster than I can on most other keyboards I have previously owned. Reply 0 thefong @thefong Jan 12, 2017, 1:48pm I'm curious why anyone wanting to spend idiotic amounts on a skinny metal laptop would buy this over a Razer Blade. If you really need Apple software, dual boot it, or bootcamp it, would take 20min max to do. Better price, better specs by a mile. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Linux Kernel 4.9.2 Improves Support for AMD Radeon HD 8000 Series, Dell XPS 17 GO Adds force_native quirk for Dell XPS 17 L702X laptop Jan 11, 2017 00:08 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  The Linux kernel is seeing a lot of improvements lately, yes again, and the newest stable Linux 4.9 series has already received its second point release, two days after Greg Kroah-Hartman's announcement for Linux kernel 4.9.1. With the availability of Linux kernel 4.9.1, users are now finally able to migrate from other kernel series to Linux 4.9, which is the most advanced version available on the market. But do not bother to attempt a compilation of Linux kernel 4.9.1 because Linux kernel 4.9.2 is already here, bringing lots of improvements. From the appended shortlog, we can't help but notice that there's now better support for AMD Radeon HD 8000 series of graphics cards, and it just happens that we have a laptop with hybrid AMD/Intel GPUs running an AMD Radeon HD 8750 discrete card. So, like many of you out there, this comes as good news to us. There are a total of 141 files changed in the Linux 4.9.2 kernel, with 1031 insertions and 438 deletions, so you can imagine that there are quite a few improvements, in particular to the AMDGPU, Nouveau, Intel i915, InfiniBand, DVB, MMC, wireless (many Atheros and Realtek fixes), SCSI (s390 too), thermal, staging, and TTY drivers. "I'm announcing the release of the 4.9.2 kernel. All users of the 4.9 kernel series must upgrade. The updated 4.9.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-4.9.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=summary," said Greg Kroah-Hartman. It's already in Arch Linux Testing, and it's coming soon to other rolling distros Some ACPI improvements are there as well in Linux kernel 4.9.2, bringing better support for the Dell XPS 17 L702X and HP Pavilion dv6 notebooks, and there's also improved support for the NFS file system, and the ARC, ARM64/AArch64, PowerPC (PPC), s390, and x86 hardware architectures. Other than that, it looks like the networking stack was updated with small mac80211, Ceph, SunRPC, vmw_vsock, and wireless enhancements. Linux kernel 4.9.2 is available for download right now, either via our web portal or directly from kernel.org, if you fancy compiling your own kernel from sources. If not, it should soon be available in the stable repositories of various rolling distributions, including Arch Linux (now in testing) and Solus (also in testing). And considering the fact that the Linux 4.8 series reached end of life, we recommend switching to Linux 4.9 as soon as possible. #Linux kernel 4.9.2#AMD Radeon HD 8000#Linux 4.9.2#Dell XPS 17#AMDGPU subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news GitHub Unveils Atom 1.13 Hackable Text Editor, Makes It Easy to Reopen Projects Wine-Staging 2.0 RC4 Improves FlipToGDISurface DirectDraw Handling, Adds Fixes Security OS Kodachi Linux 3.7 Released with Anonymous Wallpapers, Improvements User Asks Canonical to Backport Mesa 13.0.2 Stable for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS HWE It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Debian GNU/Linux 8.7 "Jessie" Live & Installable ISOs Now Available for Download - Exclusive Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs    Linux kernel 4.9.2 released New Linux Apps Q4OS: A Linux desktop operating system that features a minimal desktop environment and package selection Debian GNU/Linux: The Debian GNU Linux operating system, one of the oldest and influential Linux OSes Debian Live: Create your own Debian GNU/Linux system with this standard Live edition of the operating system Debian Live Xfce: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution with the Xfce desktop environment Debian Live MATE: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution built around the MATE desktop environment Debian Live LXDE: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux operating system, using the LXDE desktop environment Debian Live KDE: A Live flavor of Debian GNU/Linux, featuring the popular KDE desktop environment Reader comments KDE Kicks Off 2017 in Style with KDE Plasma 5.9 Beta, Brings Back Global Menus more on: KDE Plasma 5.9 Beta i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

According to CNN, the synopsis was partially based on memos assembled by an ex-British intelligence operative. The media, however, noted, that the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) is still examining the accuracy of these allegations. Last week, US Intelligence Community released a public version of a comprehensive intelligence report assessing Russian activities and intentions related to the 2016 US presidential election. The report accused Russia of trying to influence the election. After being briefed on the report, Trump said the DNC hack did not have an impact on the election outcome. Russia has repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues. ...

That conclusion may put Gen. John Kelly at odds with his future boss who has refused, thus far, to endorse the intelligence community conclusion. Trump insisted for several months after the November election that intelligence agencies’ focus on the breaches was politically motivated. The president-elect has declined to say whether he’s changed that position following a classified briefing Friday, which included intelligence gathered since the election. » Get the best federal technology news and ideas delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here. Trump may address the question during his first press conference since the election Wednesday. Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and ranking member Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., expressed confidence after the hearing that Kelly will be rapidly confirmed. McCaskill praised Kelly’s statement on the Russian cyber attribution, calling him a “straight shooter.” “If you spend time with that report and if you have the ability to get a brief on the information that’s not been declassified, I haven’t met very many people that want to argue about it,” she said, adding she hopes Kelly will be a “moderating influence” on the Trump administration.  Trump’s attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., gave a more shaded answer when questioned about the report’s conclusions during his confirmation hearing Tuesday, saying, “I have no reason to doubt that and no information that would indicate otherwise.” Kelly hedged similarly in a questionnaire submitted in advance of the hearing, describing “numerous (and sometimes conflicting or speculative) news stories about Russian efforts to reportedly influence” the election. “I do not have access to data that would allow me to validate those claims, or to provide an informed response to the questions posed here,” Kelly wrote. DHS is the nation’s top civilian cybersecurity agency and  is responsible for helping the private sector secure critical infrastructure, a category that, as of Friday, includes computer servers that manage voter databases and election tallies. If confirmed, Kelly’s agency could also be responsible for distributing federal money to state election officials to improve the cybersecurity of their networks. Kelly expressed some skepticism about that new role in his questionnaire, stating, “the notion that DHS can or should exercise some degree of influence over state voting systems is highly controversial and appears to be a political question beyond the scope of DHS’ current legislative cyber mandates.” DHS’ decision to label election systems as critical infrastructure was unpopular among some state officials wary of a federal power grab. Asked about his broader cybersecurity priorities during the hearing, Kelly acknowledged as a retired Marine Corps general, he’s more familiar with international cyber conflict than DHS’ role protecting civilian government networks. “If confirmed, I’ll get deep into it,” he said. One priority, he said, will be to gather input and advice from the private sector in Silicon Valley and elsewhere similar to initiatives outgoing Defense Secretary Ash Carter launched at the Pentagon. “There’s unbelievable talent out there in the civilian sector,” he said. “Working together makes an awful lot of sense.” Kelly endorsed Trump’s call for a 3-month review of cyber vulnerabilities across the U.S., including in critical infrastructure in his written questionnaire. “We must be faster and more agile across everything we do to safeguard and secure cyberspace—hiring, technology deployment and response,” he wrote. Kelly will also urge DHS departments to rapidly hire cyber professionals, he said in the questionnaire.  Kelly also said he’s interested in proposals to change the name of DHS’ National Protection and Programs Directorate to better reflect its role as the department’s main cyber division. He declined to fully endorse a name change before consulting with officials at DHS. Kelly did not say if he supports legislation that would elevate NPPD to a full cyber operational unit. House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, championed such legislation last year, but it failed to wend its way through all committees with jurisdiction before the close of the Congress.  recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT Remove Cloud IT “Blind Spots” with Application Visibility Data Analytics Bring Transportation Infrastructure into the Future Agile, OSS and Cloud Strengthen Government’s Mission This Database Can Help Government Transition FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

Jeff Sessions emphasized a need for cyber rules of engagement during the first day of his confirmation hearings. “Partnerships will also be vital to achieving more effective enforcement against cyber threats.

Sign up here. Cybersecurity was only a small slice of the Tuesday confirmation hearing interrupted frequently by protests and dominated by questions about whether Sessions would uphold laws he opposed as a legislator. Here are some notable moments: Russian Election Interference Sessions broke from President-elect Donald Trump on the issue of whether the Russian government directed cyberattacks during the presidential election, accepting the conclusions of the FBI and the intelligence community when pressed by senators. Sessions said he had “no reason to doubt intelligence findings” and though he hadn’t been briefed by the FBI, that its conclusions were “honorably reached.” The government, specifically the State and Defense departments, need to create protocols so “a price is paid” if U.S. systems are breached, he said. Sessions reiterated retaliation when Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., asked whether he would allow the department and the FBI to continue to investigate Russian interference even if it led to the investigation or prosecution of the president. Sessions said if laws were broken, “the appropriate actions should be taken.” He also stated multiple times an appropriate response to foreign governments that hack the U.S. is a foreign policy determined by Congress and chief executive, and having “the world know that if you do X to us, you can expect we’re going to do Y to you.” Lock Her Up? On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to investigate Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server or the Clinton Foundation. Though the president-elect later told The New York Times he wouldn’t pursue such an investigation, Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, asked the nominee what his role would be. “The proper thing to do would be to recuse myself,” Sessions testified, stating it would look like a conflict of interest after comments he also made during the campaign. “This country does not punish its political enemies,” he said. Whitehouse asked whether Sessions chanted “lock her up” during Clinton’s presidential campaign, to which Sessions replied, “No, I did not—I don’t think.” Muslim Registry Sessions said he does not support a registry of Muslims living in the U.S. or surveillance of mosques. Encryption Sessions didn’t expand on his opinions on encryption, but he agreed to continue to work with Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, to ensure law enforcement has access to data on encrypted phones like the iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter. Last Congress, Cornyn proposed an amendment to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act that would require service providers to metadata to the FBI without a warrant. International Data Privacy Sen. Orrin Hatch asked Sessions whether he would support the International Communications Privacy Act, a bill that would allow law enforcement agencies with a warrant to get U.S. citizen’s electronic communications regardless of where the information is housed. Current law prohibits the law enforcement agencies from accessing data held outside of the U.S. Sessions said individuals have a right to privacy, but he doesn’t have “firm and fast opinions” about the subject. Online Poker Responding to a question from Graham, Sessions said he may revisit the 2011 Justice Department memo on the Wire Act that reversed the department’s long-held stance that it banned online poker and the selling lottery tickets online. Sessions, however, said he couldn’t give an opinion today. recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT Remove Cloud IT “Blind Spots” with Application Visibility Data Analytics Bring Transportation Infrastructure into the Future Agile, OSS and Cloud Strengthen Government’s Mission This Database Can Help Government Transition FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts    5415065 The intelligence community believes Russia hacked both the Republican and Democratic parties in an effort to influence U.S. policy, according to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. “We are confident Russian intelligence carried out operations targeting both major political parties,” Clapper told the Senate Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during his testimony Tuesday. Comey’s testimony confirms an intelligence community assessment which determined that the Russian intelligence apparatus likely hacked into the servers of both the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee. “There’s no doubt they hit an RNC domain,” said FBI Director James Comey, who joined Clapper in the Tuesday afternoon hearing. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report assessing evidence of Russian hacking Friday based on an investigation conducted by the FBI, CIA and NSA. It noted that “Russia collected on some Republican-affiliated targets, but did not conduct a comparable disclosure campaign.” In an exchange with Sen. Tom Cotton, Clapper noted that the Russians initially had little faith in Trump’s chances to win the election over Clinton. “Initially no,” said Clapper after Cotton asked if Russia thought Trump was going to win the election. “They thought he was a fringe candidate.” The report noted that in June, Putin began avoided publicly praising Trump, “probably because Kremlin officials thought that any praise from Putin personally would backfire in the United States.” Clapper explained that Russians began to develop a preference for Trump after the summer time frame. The report also found that Russia engaged in hacking against U.S. government, think tank and non-governmental organization personnel in an attempt to gather future intelligence on the incoming Trump administration.

Russia has repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues.

"We can’t discuss the full range of all information that supports our conclusions because of the extreme sensitivity of these sources, but the key judgments in the public and classified versions are the same." After receiving an intelligence briefing on the US Intelligence Community's report, Trump said the election outcome had not been affected.

In a letter to President Barack Obama, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., said his committee had received a "troubling new report" from the U.S. intelligence community about detainees recently transferred to foreign countries. He said the report also showed that detainees were recently transferred to a country poorly equipped to stop them from returning to battle. "In light of this dangerous revelation, I again ask that you immediately halt all transfers from Guantanamo Bay and take steps to secure former detainees who pose a threat to U.S. national security," Royce said. Despite the long-running protestations of Republicans, Obama is expected to continue whittling down the prison's population in his final days in office. A senior Obama administration official declined to provide details on the intelligence assessment that Royce cited, but said the administration takes any signs of recidivism "very seriously" and works to stop it through military, law enforcement, intelligence and diplomatic means. The official wasn't authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity. The U.S. opened the prison at a U.S. naval base in Cuba to hold militants suspected of ties to al-Qaida and Taliban after the 9/11 attacks. Most were never charged with a crime. But their indefinite detention and mistreatment in early days of the prison triggered a global outcry that Obama has argued undermines U.S. national security. Although Royce argued the recently released detainees were part of a broader pattern of former Guantanamo detainees pursuing a return to terrorism and posing a continuing threat to the U.S., the Obama administration had disputed that charge. Royce didn't name the country to which the detainees were transferred, and his office declined to provide more details, citing the classified nature of the intelligence report. In recent months detainees have been sent to Saudi Arabia, Camp Verde, Mauritania and the United Arab Emirates. Royce sent a copy of his letter to President-elect Donald Trump, who has called for a halt of releases from Guantanamo Bay. Most of the 693 detainees formerly held at Guantanamo were transferred under President George W. Bush. Of Bush's transfers, 21 percent are confirmed by the U.S. as having re-engaged in the fight. Only 9 of the 161 detainees transferred by Obama — or 6 percent — are confirmed as having re-engaged, although more are suspected of having done so. Closing the prison was a key Obama campaign promise that he was never able to fulfill, stymied by opposition by Congress, which refused to allow Obama to transfer detainees to prisons in the U.S. In a bid to empty the prison out, Obama tried to transfer as many as possible to third countries willing to accept them. The current population stands at 55, including 19 cleared for release. ___ Associated Press writer Ben Fox in Miami contributed to this report. ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

The ASUS PRO B9440 is powered by Intel’s new Core i5/i7 Kaby Lake-U CPUs, weighs only around one kilogram and can work for 10 hours on one charge. Since various people have different requirements and workloads, there are many types of business notebooks: from 12” ultra-thin and compact machines to 15” laptops with workstation-like performance and features. The ASUS PRO B9440 is located somewhere between in terms of design and performance: it comes in 13”-class chassis made of magnesium alloy and has so thin display bezels that it actually features a 14” display with FHD resolution and anti-glare coating. To make the PC more comfortable to use, ASUS installed a spill-resistant keyboard with large keycaps, backlighting, and 1.5 mm key travel. Meanwhile, the weight of the PC is around a kilogram (2.31 lbs), but it is MIL-STD 810G-rated for durability so it can survive shocks, vibration, exposure to low/high temperatures and so on. From hardware standpoint, the ASUS PRO B9440 is a mainstream PC running Intel’s Core i5/i7 Kaby Lake-U processor, equipped with 8 or 16 GB of LPDDR3 memory, up to 512 GB SSD, a 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi with BT module, two USB 3.0 Type-C connectors, stereo speakers, a fingerprint reader, and a 48 Wh battery. ASUS customers can order PRO B9440 machines with enabled Intel’s vPro for remote management as well as Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for hardware-based data encryption. The ASUS PRO B9440 Laptops Preliminary Specifications   Mainstream Premium Screen Resolution 1920×1080 CPU Family Core i5 Core i7 Core Kaby Lake-U Options vPro Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 or Iris Plus Graphics 640 RAM 8 GB LPDDR3 onboard 16 GB LPDDR3 onboard Storage Up to 512 GB M.2 SSD (SATA or PCIe) Wi-Fi 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi with BT USB 2 × USB 3.0 Type-C (one port supports docking, power delivery) Fingerprint Sensor Yes Other I/O Microphone, Harman Kardon stereo speakers, TRRS audio jack Battery 4-cell 48 Wh Li-polymer Thickness 8.9 - 14.85 mm Weight 1.04 kilograms 2.31 lbs Price Starts at $999   ASUS SimPro Dock USB-C Docking Station Display Outputs 2 × DisplayPort 1 × HDMI 1 × D-Sub USB Type-A 2 × USB 3.0 Type-A Type-C 1 × USB 3.0 Type-C Card Reader SD card reader Gigabit Ethernet Yes To make the PRO B9440 compact, thin and durable, ASUS had to make certain design decisions. First, the company eliminated the webcam, which helped to shrink the display bezel (and will also please corporate IT security personnel). Second, ASUS removed all I/O ports except two USB 3.0 Type-C and a TRRS audio jack from the PC, which helped to shrink the chassis. While an ultra-thin form-factor is generally an advantage, it also means that to connect an external display, mouse and a keyboard, the ASUS PRO B9440 will require the ASUS SimPro Dock USB-C docking station that is sold separately, which effectively makes the system more expensive. Engineers from ASUS are not the only to make the aforementioned design decisions, so it looks like for many laptops docking stations will be required in the future. ASUS will ship the PRO B9440 notebook in May for the price that starts at $999. The cost of the ASUS SimPro Dock is unknown, yet its MSRP will be an important factor for those who plan to use the ASUS PRO B9440 in office environments. Ian says: Ultimately it's a clear shot across the bow of Dell's XPS 13, and seeing one at the show I was mightily impressed by form factor and weight. The trackpad had a good feel, and for writing it came across well. Other editors had reservations with the hinge mechanism, as it props up the keyboard and angles any hot air across the screen, but having used the Zenbook Infinity for 3 years, that doesn't bother me personally so much. Personally I guess I would have liked to see 32GB DDR4 and a touch screen model, and a key proponent here will be battery life. My current ZBI barely holds an hour of 'active' use (up to 5 hrs 'airplane word editing' use), and the B9440 looks pretty enticing right now if the battery life can hold up.

POST A COMMENT 29 Comments View All Comments BrokenCrayons - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link I like the specs and design with the exception of USB port placement. It strikes me as a bit strange to see the USB ports will move as the screen is opened, closed, or adjusted. It'd take a little adjustment time. Barring any problems that'd only come out in benchmark testing such as thermal throttling or whatnot, this looks like a decent laptop for the price. Reply ToTTenTranz - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link Asus hates video outputs now? Lots of people use external monitors nowadays. Reply xthetenth - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link Docking station. Docking stations are really cool and no less portable than the external monitors. Reply solipsism - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link USB-C can output video just fine. The days of having a separate serial, patella, VGA, etc. are long gone and I'm very thankful for that. USB-C is the future and that's a beautiful thing. Reply Jon Tseng - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link Is it just me or does that hinge design give nasty flashbacks to the Dell Adamo? Reply mooninite - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link Finally! A feasible upgrade for the UX301-LAA!! Looks good except for the downgrade from 1440p to 1080p. Reply Ian Cutress - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link There's also the loss of touch-screen. I'm not sure if I can go back to a non-TS enabled laptop. Reply woggs - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link Touch screens don't belong on a work laptop and 1080p is not adequate for work. I started buying my own laptop for work several years ago when my employer decided we should all use toys. (I know I'm an old curmudgeon. No need to point out that opinions and usage may vary.) Reply rocky12345 - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link This is a nice unit but without the proper ports it is pretty much useless to most people. I could see it if they included the docking station with the laptops but to pay extra for something that should have been included is a no go for sure. It was stated that this is the way most companies are gonna do thing in the future. Here is a thought don't buy these products and vote with your wallet yes going thin is all cool and all but if it means giving up all of your connection options then it is not worth it. Reply BrokenCrayons - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link Microsoft excluded the keyboard cover from the Surface and the New Nintendo 3DS didn't come with a battery charger. It's tough to quantify what impact those omissions had on overall sales numbers, but excluding things in the initial purchase package is pretty common.

Additionally, he recruited several other UK nationals to Daesh, the State Department noted.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 10, 2017 at 8:29AM In 2015, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) hosted what it called its Data Center Day. During this event, the heads of the various divisions within the company's data center group (DCG) went over their respective strategies along with progress updates for their portions of the business. Intel DCG chief Diane Bryant holding a silicon photonics module. Image source: Intel.  During the presentation, Intel executive Alexis Bjoerlin talked about the company's strategy with respect to silicon photonics connectivity products. Indeed, at the time Bjoerlin's title was vice president and general manager of Intel's silicon photonics solutions group. However, Intel recently formed a new organization that encompasses the silicon photonics solutions group called the connectivity technology group. Bjoerlin, per her LinkedIn profile, is now the general manager of this new group. And, per Intel's job board, the company is now searching for a new general manager for Intel's silicon photonics solutions group. Let's take a closer look at what the formation of the broader connectivity technology group means for DCG. Intel expecting significant growth in this business Intel has made no secret of the fact that it expects the non-processor portion of DCG to grow substantially over the next several years, serving as a key enabler of the long-term growth that it expects from DCG. These non-processor products, per Intel, include Intel's Silicon Photonics connectivity technology, its Omni-Path connectivity technology (for high-performance computing), as well as its 3D XPoint memory modules. Two of those three technologies/product lines are data-center connectivity products.  Intel's current public long-term DCG revenue growth forecast is a 15% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2019, though this figure may be revised when the company hosts its annual investor meeting next month. Indeed, the company has said that it expects its data center processor business to grow at a 12% compounded annual growth rate through that time, which implies that it expects the non-processor portion of this business to grow at a 42.6% compounded annual growth rate through 2019. So, if these products are going to become serious contributors to Intel's revenue in the coming years (by 2020, Intel expects the total addressable markets for Omni-Path and Silicon Photonics products to total $6.6 billion), then it likely makes sense to have an overarching organization dedicated to connectivity technologies. The organization is in place, but let's see how it does Intel only recently began shipping Omni-Path and Silicon Photonics products last year, so it's unlikely that the revenue contributions from either of those product lines was significant in 2016. Nevertheless, with the products now in the market, it would be helpful for the company to provide insight into the initial revenue that the company is seeing from sales of these products, what kind of market share it expects to have in these segments over the next couple of years, and what sort of margin/profitability profile investors should expect from these products. Intel is unlikely to break down sales of these products in each of its quarterly reports (though the company does report consolidated revenue from non-processor products in DCG, which is helpful), but annual updates at its investor meetings going forward would be appreciated.

By: Steven Bassiri | SFF PCs in Computer Systems | Posted: 5 days, 13 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 90%Manufacturer: BIOSTAR Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Packaging and System] Page 3 [Teardown of the RACING P1] Page 4 [BIOS and Software] Page 5 [Test Setup and Benchmarks] Page 6 [Temperature and Power Consumption] Page 7 [What's Hot, What's Not & Final Thoughts] Introduction     Mini PCs, otherwise known as Small Form Factor PCs (SFF PC), have been increasing steadily in number and range of power. Some of them are capable of replacing your desktop at home, while others are used as media/streaming devices. On that spectrum, BIOSTAR's Racing P1 is positioned on the much more integrated side of things, meaning that it's not a full desktop replacement.     It uses an Intel Atom x5-Z8350 SoC, based on Cherry Trail; it is one of Intel's more recent Atom options. It's not a full-blown Core series product, and as such, it is capable, but not as powerful. Even so, the RACING P1 is a versatile device that can serve many purposes around the home or office, as it can run Windows 10.   To spice up the little computer, BIOSTAR has added RGB LEDs in the lid and even provides a 5050 RGB header for an external RGB cable.   Let's take a look at what this tiny PC has to offer.     Specifications     The RACING P1's Atom x5-Z8350 features a 64-bit quad-core CPU, includes Intel's HD graphics (max resolution 1080p), and has a TDP of only 2W with a base frequency of 1.44GHz and burst of 1.92GHz. Oddly enough, Intel lists the SoC as supporting up to 2GB of DDR3L, but BIOSTAR has actually engineered it to support 4GB DDR3L, which is preferable for 64-bit Windows 10 installations.   There is 64GB of built-in eMMC flash storage. BIOSTAR went ahead and added in both wireless AC and a 1Gbit NIC. The device has one USB 3.0 port and five USB 2.0 ports. Its only video output is through HDMI.     Pricing   The price of the Racing P1 is only $159. Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find products similar to this one for sale below.

Google, Inc., Apple, Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon, Intel Corp, and Cisco Systems. As seen, a lot of the key players in the global internet of things market are predominantly from consumer electronics or ICT fields, and a majority of the market leaders are headquartered in the U.S. As one of the highly trending markets in the world today, the global internet of things market is expected to be crowded by a large number of players of all sizes, according to a research report released by Transparency Market Research. Key players in the market are already ahead in terms of development rates and the acquisition of proprietary technologies. Wi-Fi is expected to continue being the leading technology in the global internet of things market, despite the grand entrance of alternative device communication methods such as ZigBee and NFC, which are also gaining an intense amount of demand and popularity. The global internet of things market is expected to reach US$334.22 bn at the end of 2016.

The global internet of things market is currently finding a massive scope of growth through the growing demand for cloud computing across the world, because IoT communication can help resolve the constraints faced by cloud computing. IoT technologies can help supplement cloud platforms with additional storage options, processing power, and even help out with the energy constraints of hosting large-scale cloud computing solutions," states a TMR analyst. The global internet of things market is also being augmented by the increasing rates of globalization and urbanization in all regions. A staggering number of users across the world today have access to multiple branches of information technology, data sharing and storage methods, cloud computing solutions, and communication portals. The global internet of things market adds a beneficial layer to all this unlike any other concept and is therefore in extremely high demand. Real-time Analytics for IoT Lagging Behind  The phenomenal rate at which the global internet of things market currently can unfortunately not yet be matched by data safety and integrity analytics solutions. As the scope and usage of IoT concepts increases by the day, there is a very high need for real-time assessment of failures and data integrity across all networks. The real-time vehicle diagnostics, for instance, are critical in allowing a vehicle's sensors of dangerous road conditions, collision threats, and internal system failures. This is difficult to achieve as in reality, these scenarios require a very fast rate of analysis backed by a constant monitoring status.

Home Radio Google+ Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Rss Login If Buhari Does Not Kill Corruption It Will Kill Buhari News Sports Africa World Opinions Politics Business Diaspora Entertainment LifeStyle Real Estate Classifieds Media Members Press Release | 10 January 2017 11:10 CET  0  Comment ​Dell’s Innovative PCs Actively Engage the Senses with Stunning Sights and Sounds By Damilare Ogunmowo Previous | Next  Lagos, Nigeria: 10.01.17 Dell has unveiled a series of world-first innovations that are redefining personal computing at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The entire Dell PC portfolio features Windows 10 and new 7th Gen Intel® Core™ processors, helping people maximize productivity and creativity while enjoying lifelike viewing experiences. Dell Canvas – Work at the speed of thought What began as the Dell smart desk concept in 2014 evolved into Dell Canvas —a new category of smart workspace technology that expands creative productivity for content developers and designers. The 27-inch QHD smart workspace can be used at an angle or flat on a desk so professionals can create, communicate and express their thoughts and ideas as naturally as they do with pen on paper. For example, through the use of touch, digital pen and totems, the Dell Canvas turns drawings into part of the digital workflow and enhances collaboration. The best just got better – XPS 13 adds convertible model; XPS 15 more powerful Dell XPS has won more product awards than any other brand in Dell’s history. Building on that success, Dell is adding the XPS 13 2-in-1, the world’s smallest 13-inch 2-in-1¹, to the beloved XPS family. It offers a 360-degree hinge for multiple productivity and viewing options using Continuum, up to 15 hours of battery life² and eye-popping clarity with a gorgeous QHD+ (5.7M pixels) InfinityEdge touch display—another first for a 2-in-1. XPS & Precision AIOs – The best sound quality of any all-in-one PC Some All-in-One (AIO) PCs on the market today treat the audio experience as an afterthought. Co-created with Jack Joseph Puig, Grammy™ award winning producer and director of creative innovation at Waves Audio, the new XPS 27 AIO, and its Precision business sibling, crank sound to a whole new level with built-in audio quality that previously required an external sound bar. With full frequency range high-fidelity audio built in, they deliverthe best sound available in an AIO with 10 speakers pumping out sound at 50W per channel. Dell’s first VR-ready mobile workstation cements Dell’s leadership as virtual reality PC authority Dell is a world leader in virtual reality (VR) with the most PC options in the market including XPS, Alienware and Precision workstations supporting Oculus and HTC headsets. As more headsets fly off the shelves, there is a huge opportunity—and demand—for VR content creators. Enter the Dell Precision 7720 mobile workstation—Dell’s first VR-ready mobile workstation designed specifically for VR content creation. I 5K is so yesterday… Dell expands displays leadership with UltraSharp 32 Ultra HD 8K Monitor The Dell UltraSharp 32 Ultra HD 8K Monitor is the world's first 32-inch 8K resolution display. It has more than 1 billion colours, 33.2M pixels of resolution, 100 percent Adobe RGB and sRGB colour gamut and an unprecedented 280 ppi—which is four times more content than Ultra HD 4K resolution and 16 times more content than Full HD. Products built for business also feature 7th Gen Intel® Core™ vPro™ and Xeon® processors and new ultrathin notebook and 2-in-1 designs—reflecting customer demands for thin and light professional products that don’t compromise on productivity, security and manageability. For example, Dell expands its leadership in workstations with the Precision 5520, the world’s lightest 15-inch mobile workstation and a darling among creative professionals . The Latitude 7000 Series Ultrabooks™ and an award-winning 12-inch Latitude 5000 Series 2-in-1 are also added to the line-up . This detachable 2-in-1 weighs less than 2lbs, features a unique auto-deploy kickstand that extends up to 150 degrees for multiple viewing angles and has multiple connectivity options. Dell has also redefined the desktop experience with the new OptiPlex 5250 AIO and an updated line of OptiPlex small and micro form factor desktops. These sleek productsprovide full desktop performance and productivity in compact chassis that can be mounted behind corresponding displays with our innovative AIO stands or under a table to free up desk space. Perfect for pairing with a desktop or laptop, new monitors also include the Dell 24 Monitor for Video Conferencing, which features a two megapixel Full HD IR camera with privacy shutter, noise-cancelling microphone and dual 5W speakers built in, and the Dell 24 Touch Monitor.

And we weren't totally wrong-Amazon's Alexa assistant was baked into gadgets everywhere, even in cars! But looking back at all of our coverage, there was plenty we had no idea about. This is the best stuff we saw at CES 2o17. TVs that seem to disappear TVs are always a big draw at CES, and this year was no exception. Mercifully, the curved TV gimmick finally looks like it's on its way out. In the bigget trend to emerge, Sony, LG, and Samsung all moved the core components of their flagship TV sets to outside hardware. In the case of Samsung, all of the ports and brains of its new models are housed in an outside box. Sony built the guts for its top TV into a subwoofer that doubles as a TV stand. But for my money, the most impressive TV was the new W7 from LG. This OLED TV is just 2.5mm thick-literally thinner than my finger. Everything that actually powers the TV is jammed into a futuristic-looking Dolby Atmos soundbar. I want it. LG also had a prototype OLED TV that is 40 percent translucent. I'm not sure if I see the use case quite yet, but anything that brings us closer to Minority Report is good with me. Honda's self-balancing motorcycle Honda showed off its new Riding Assistant technology that keeps your bike balanced when it's moving at speeds less than three miles per hour (like when you're pulling out of the garage or stopping at a traffic light). The tech will even work when the rider isn't onboard, meaning you never have to worry about your bike falling over on its side ever again. This is still a concept, so we might never the tech in actual bikes, but it sure does look cool. Razer's insane three monitor laptop Razer showed off a lot of cool gadgets at CES, but the coolest was definitely its prototype of a gaming laptop with THREE 4K displays. That's right, this beastly laptop has three 17.3-inch displays pushing millions of pixels. It's one of the coolest things we've seen. Dubbed Project Valerie, the laptop is powered by an Intel Kaby Lake processor and Nvidia's 1080 graphics card. We just saw a prototype, but Razer says the final version will have the two side monitors slide out of the main monitor, for easy storage. If this thing does come to market-and that's a big if-prepare for it to be expensive. But price, weight, and the fact that it will inevitably be hot enough to cook food doesn't even matter. It's a 12K gaming laptop. Hell yeah. Razer's futuristic Project Ariana Speaking of Razer, the gaming company's conceptual gaming projector promises to deliver VR-like experience without needing a VR headset. When pointed at the screen, Project Ariana's depth-sensing cameras can expand the edges of the TV onto the wall, making your game world more immersive. It can also work with the other lighting products in the room to alter colors across devices, so if a character goes into rage mode, not only does the screen go red, all the lights in your setup go red too. We won't see Project Ariana until at LEAST very late 2017, but if it can hit the market, it could be a cool alternative to VR headsets for gamers that want truly immersive experiences. Unfortunately, my Brooklyn living room isn't big enough for VR, let alone something like this, but I love it anyway. Super Game Boy is back The massive success of the NES Classic Edition proves that all of us aging millennials are obsessed with classic gaming. And what gets more classic than Nintendo's original Game Boy? The team at Retro-Bit showed off a brand new, souped-up Game Boy that shares the same form-factor as the original, but packs in so much more. It will play original Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance cartridges. It also has a 10-hour battery life and a shatter-resistant display. The best part? This little guy is only $80! We can't wait to get our hands on one and relive playing the original Tetris, Super Mario Land 2, and Link's Awakening. Lego's new robots Lego has had robotic kits for years, but the problem is that the builds always involved a lot of work and some mild coding skills. Granted, it's a nice way to learn something new, but sometimes you just want to quickly build a robot buddy. With Lego Boost, the lazy amongst us can finally build robotic toys. Using a companion app, you just drag and drop different actions to control the robot, rather than having to tediously code in commands. The kit comes with five different projects, including a cat, a robot, a guitar, a bulldozer, and a Lego stacking machine. Intel's Compute Card is so tiny A few years ago at CES, Intel introduced its Compute Stick, its tiny-ass computer that fits into something about the size of a Chromecast. Now Intel has something even tinier-and potentially more useful-its new Compute Card. The size and thickness of a few stacked credit cards, the Compute Card packs in a ton of power into the svelte package. You get a Kaby Lake processor, wi-fi, memory, and storage. The idea is that you can then insert this card into a dumb monitor or other type of dock, and voila, instant computer system. Intel is hoping it can get a lot of manufacturers on board to support the Compute Card-think everything from kiosks, smart TVs, and smart appliances. For TVs especially, this could provide a smart upgrade path for new kinds of apps and processes. Just swap your old Compute Card out with another. It will be a while before this hits the market. Intel's first partnership is with the Foxconn-owned Sharp, for giant displays at malls and hotels. But maybe if we're lucky, one day we'll be able to just carry our computers with us in our wallets. Hulu's new live TV service It wasn't just about the gadgets at CES-we also got a sneak preview of Hulu's upcoming live TV service. There are still a lot of open questions about the service-including specific channel lineups-but from what we can see right now, it has the potential to be the cordcutting skinny bundle service we've all been waiting for, Hulu is basically going to combine its existing service with Live TV channels, all in a brand new interface. In a world where current services such as PlayStation Vue, Sling TV, and DirecTV Now make you switch between live and on-demand, having everything in one interface is super smart. Plus, Hulu includes a built-in cloud DVR and for certain programs, you'll be able to start watching from the beginning, even if you started recording after a program started. Hulu's live product will be out in the next few months-if we had to guess, we'd say May or June-and will cost under $40 a month. We've been burned by live online TV services before, but Hulu has a track record that makes us very excited about the potential. Sony's crazy thin e-ink watch Despite being a pretty blah year for wearables-mostly because no one is buying smartwatches-Sony still showed an amazing concept for an e-ink smartwatch at CES. The concept, which was shown under glass, can change design and color-meaning you can switch up your fashion statement depending on what you're wearing or your mood. Strikingly, the e-ink display is thinner than a credit card, If this thing ever does come to market, it might be Japanese only-but it's such a cool idea, we can't help but hope the tech makes its way into a proper product eventually.it FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedinReddit Tags: ces 2017TVSretro bitRazerLGIntelHuluHondabest of ces 2017 Follow Gizmodo on facebookLiketwitterFollowgplusFollow Contribute to Gizmodo Write for Us Next StoryYou Can Buy 'Vintage Milk' on Amazon Comments () Characters Remaining: 3000 SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmail OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION X Sort By:NewestOldestDiscussedUp VotedDown Voted More from this author How to Watch Nintendo's Big Switch Launch Event Ebay Is Finally Doing Something About Counterfeit Goods The Nintendo Switch Rumors We Hope Are True Related stories Dell XPS 13 Convertible tipped for CES 2017 Huawei Unveils Mate 9 running Amazon Alexa at CES 2017 Dear God: Please Save This Poor Soul From the Saddest Booth at CES 2017 Asus enters CES 2017 with the Zenfone AR and the Zenfone 3 Zoom Lenovo shows off a prototype of a Microsoft Holographic VR headset at CES 2017 Samsung announces boring Galaxy A series smartphones before CES 2017 Personalized Recommendations Editor's Pick From EDM to Funk Pop, Our top 7 picks on what should go in your playlist this 2017 10 years of the iPhone: How Apple changed the way we communicate Lenovo Yoga 510 Review: Inconsistent Performer The Magic of George Michael: Bringing the “Faith” over a Glorious 30-Year Music Career OnePlus 3T review: Still the best damn phone for less than Rs 30,000 Nucleya Adds His Signature Bass To Papon’s Bihu in The Dewarists’ Latest Music Collaboration Hot Right Now The Genius Who Lived in a Storage Locker for $200 a Month Was Evicted ...

I'm not sure if I see the use case quite yet, but anything that brings us closer to Minority Report is good with me. Honda's self-balancing motorcycle Honda showed off its new Riding Assistant technology that keeps your bike balanced when it's moving at speeds less than 5km/h (like when you're pulling out of the garage or stopping at a traffic light). The tech will even work when the rider isn't on board, meaning you never have to worry about your bike falling over on its side ever again. This is still a concept, so we might never the tech in actual bikes, but it sure does look cool. Razer's insane three monitor laptop Razer showed off a lot of cool gadgets at CES, but the coolest was definitely its prototype of a gaming laptop with THREE 4K displays. That's right, this beastly laptop has three 17.3-inch displays pushing millions of pixels. It's one of the coolest things we've seen. Dubbed Project Valerie, the laptop is powered by an Intel Kaby Lake processor and Nvidia's 1080 graphics card. We just saw a prototype, but Razer says the final version will have the two side monitors slide out of the main monitor, for easy storage. If this thing does come to market — and that's a big if — prepare for it to be expensive. But price, weight and the fact that it will inevitably be hot enough to cook food doesn't even matter. It's a 12K gaming laptop. Hell yeah. Razer's futuristic Project Ariana Speaking of Razer, the gaming company's conceptual gaming projector promises to deliver VR-like experience without needing a VR headset. When pointed at the screen, Project Ariana's depth-sensing cameras can expand the edges of the TV onto the wall, making your game world more immersive. It can also work with the other lighting products in the room to alter colours across devices, so if a character goes into rage mode, not only does the screen go red, all the lights in your setup go red too. We won't see Project Ariana until at LEAST very late 2017, but if it can hit the market, it could be a cool alternative to VR headsets for gamers that want truly immersive experiences. Unfortunately, my Brooklyn living room isn't big enough for VR, let alone something like this, but I love it anyway. Super Game Boy is back The massive success of the NES Classic Edition proves that all of us ageing millennials are obsessed with classic gaming. And what gets more classic than Nintendo's original Game Boy? The team at Retro-Bit showed off a brand new, souped-up Game Boy that shares the same form-factor as the original, but packs in so much more. It will play original Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance cartridges. It also has a 10-hour battery life and a shatter-resistant display. The best part? This little guy is only $US80 ($109)! We can't wait to get our hands on one and relive playing the original Tetris, Super Mario Land 2 and Link's Awakening. LEGO's new robots LEGO has had robotic kits for years, but the problem is that the builds always involved a lot of work and some mild coding skills. Granted, it's a nice way to learn something new, but sometimes you just want to quickly build a robot buddy. With LEGO Boost, the lazy amongst us can finally build robotic toys. Using a companion app, you just drag and drop different actions to control the robot, rather than having to tediously code in commands. The kit comes with five different projects, including a cat, a robot, a guitar, a bulldozer and a LEGO stacking machine. Intel's Compute Card is so tiny A few years ago at CES, Intel introduced its Compute Stick, its tiny-arse computer that fits into something about the size of a Chromecast. Now Intel has something even tinier — and potentially more useful — its new Compute Card. The size and thickness of a few stacked credit cards, the Compute Card packs in a ton of power into the svelte package. You get a Kaby Lake processor, Wi-Fi, memory and storage. The idea is that you can then insert this card into a dumb monitor or other type of dock, and voila, instant computer system. Intel is hoping it can get a lot of manufacturers on board to support the Compute Card — think everything from kiosks, smart TVs and smart appliances. For TVs especially, this could provide a smart upgrade path for new kinds of apps and processes. Just swap your old Compute Card out with another. It will be a while before this hits the market. Intel's first partnership is with the Foxconn-owned Sharp, for giant displays at shopping centres and hotels. But maybe if we're lucky, one day we'll be able to just carry our computers with us in our wallets. Sony's crazy thin E Ink watch Despite being a pretty blah year for wearables — mostly because no one is buying smartwatches — Sony still showed an amazing concept for an E Ink smartwatch at CES. The concept, which was shown under glass, can change design and colour — meaning you can switch up your fashion statement depending on what you're wearing or your mood. Strikingly, the E Ink display is thinner than a credit card. If this thing ever does come to market, it might be Japanese only — but it's such a cool idea, we can't help but hope the tech makes its way into a proper product eventually.

The world has changed substantially over that time - the Web, Wi-Fi and smartphones top the list - but, as was true back then as well, most of the blinking trinkets at CES are destined for a quick trip from factory to landfill. Who really needs a 4K-per-eye VR headset that a) can’t be driven by any released graphics card, and b) can’t be worn over your face because the engineers (and I use that term loosely) simply glued two six-inch smartphone panels together? Sure, it’s a prototype, a promise for the future, but if that’s the future you’re promising, perhaps you could rethink your life choices. I mention VR because this year CES featured an entire exhibition hall filled with nothing but drones, VR and AR - all of the most-hyped and currently least-useful of consumer electronics. Sure, drones will be amazing in a few years, when we’ve figured out how to keep them away from aircraft above and out of the hands of paparazzi down below, but for now they’re simply noisy, annoying, and, at the consumer grade, not much more interesting than radio controlled aircraft from 25 years ago. VR and AR? So much hype and so much hoping that after the failures of the 90s this time will be different, because Google and Facebook and Sony and Microsoft want it to be. Many Shenzhen hardware manufacturers had their wares on display, from all-in-one Android headsets that had none of the features or functionality of the high-end headset Qualcomm showed off in its football-field sized booth, down to humble plastic cases for your smartphone that - if you’re really lucky - might work with a Google Cardboard-compatible app. I went to CES expecting to see a lot of VR consumer froth, but in addition I got a bellyful of augmented and mixed reality: the thick, see-through projection lenses familiar to Hololens users have been turned into commodities, so almost anyone can create a system that mixes the real-world with computer-generated imagery. None of these systems have the sophisticated ‘inside-out’ tracking of Hololens, nor Windows 10 Holographic Edition, so they basically delivered all of the worst features of the Google Glass experience - at several times the price. It’s as if now that we finally have VR, no one knows what to do with it. Case in point: the Intel VR ‘special press event’, hosted by CEO Brian Krzanich, featuring comfortable overstuffed chairs and a complete VR system for each of the 300 media who made it into the event. Krzanich took us through a tour of some state-of-the-art VR applications - including a livestream from a drone overflying a solar electric array somewhere out in the Nevada desert - but it all seemed a bit disparate and/or desperate. We don’t really know what VR will be good for, he seemed to be suggesting, but please play with it. The unbranded air sickness bag conveniently placed next to each Oculus CV1 headset perfectly framed Intel’s ambivalence about this so-exciting-it-makes-you-sick future. nVidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang barely mentioned VR at all in his Jobs-esque keynote, despite the fact that a big part of nVidia’s recent uptick in revenues comes from PC-based VR systems. Instead, Huang seemed more interested in anything but gaming, including a new ‘Spot’ gadget that functions like an Amazon Echo, connecting to Google Assistant, and - with a few scattered through the household - uses ‘beam forming’ to track your location all the time. Ideal for turning on the lights just before you enter a room -- and perfect for a stalker who wants to know your exact whereabouts. Such largely-unnoticed but increasingly pervasive ‘surveillance capitalism’ has become a persistent topic of conversation among the folks I ran into at CES, many of whom have spent their entire careers in tech and now wonder if the whole thing hasn’t become a bit too comprehensive. Sure, the machines just want to help us, but what about the opaque powers behind those machines, gathering data for their own ends? Should we be concerned - or should we just lie back and think of Zuck? I came away from CES feeling like we need a proper spring cleaning in technology, taking all the shiny, blinking, connected tchotkes off our shelves, considering whether they serve us well. If not, we need to bin them, filling the landfill with bad products, bad business, and bad actors. Clearing away the trash and distractions will help us focus on the world we really want to create. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 49 Comments More from The Register Wi-Fi for audiophiles: Alliance preps TimeSync certification program Nice market you have there, Bluetooth.

Linux 4.11 To Enable Frame-Buffer Compression By Default For Skylake+ Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 9 January 2017 at 07:28 PM EST. 7 Comments Skylake and newer hardware is set to have frame-buffer compression (FBC) enabled by default when the Linux 4.11 kernel rolls around in a few months. This feature can reduce power consumption while reducing memory bandwidth needed for screen refreshes. To date only Broadwell hardware has enabled frame-buffer compression by default. Earlier generations of Intel graphics hardware have had FBC support but it remains disabled by default due to various bugs and hardware issues. There have been several attempts over time at enabling FBC going back to around Haswell, but it's never panned out for keeping it on by default. But now Broadwell has been riding FBC by default and for Skylake+ it appears to be in good enough shape to flip the default switch. Back in December I wrote that Intel May Finally Enable Framebuffer Compression By Default For Skylake+ while today that drm-intel-next work officially landed in DRM-Next. So unless any big regressions come up in the weeks ahead, that DRM-Next code will be merged into mainline Git and hopefully remain on for Linux 4.11. The code landed in DRM-Next today via this pull request. Aside from flipping on FBC by default for Gen9 graphics and newer, there were also some fixes, documentation improvements, and other clean-ups. There was also a drm-misc-next update that landed. 7 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

He added that there was "not one source of information" in Friday's US intelligence report. On Friday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released a report saying it and other US intelligence agencies had a high degree of confidence that Russia meddled in the US election. Russia has repeatedly denied US allegations it was behind the breach or that it had any desire to interfere with the US election. ...

Credit: Apple More like this Apple Mac shipments take a beating in Q3 as PC shipments decline PC shipments predicted to return to growth in 2018 after six-year skid Pricey gaming desktops and laptops thrive in slumping PC market Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Apple's new MacBook Pros have put the brakes on a free-fall of Mac shipments globally, though they haven't provided the significant boost the company was looking for. The company's Mac shipments totaled 5.3 million units during the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline of just 0.9 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015. That compares favorably to overall Mac shipments in 2016, which totaled 18.4 million units, a decline of 9.8 percent compared to 2015, according to IDC.  Apple launched the new MacBook Pros in late October, and it was considered a significant upgrade. Had the new MacBook Pros shipped for all three months, the quarterly growth may have jumped up to flat or positive territory. But that's still not an encouraging sign for MacBook Pros, which haven't provided an overwhelming boost to worldwide Mac shipments. Apple will share its Mac shipment numbers during an earnings call on Jan. 31. Apple's shipment numbers haven't always agreed with figures from research firms like IDC and Gartner. The MacBook Pros were met with mixed reviews. They had new features like the Touch Bar, which received a lukewarm reaction. The Macs were also criticized for including Intel's older Skylake chips and not the newer Kaby Lake chips. Windows PCs and Chromebooks are performing better. Apple was the fourth-largest PC maker in the world behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell, all of which recorded positive shipment growth during the fourth quarter of 2016. Nevertheless, Apple's Mac shipments are recovering, and it comes at a time when PC shipments are also stabilizing. PC shipments in the fourth quarter totaled 70.2 million, declining by just 1.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015, according to IDC. The numbers include traditional PCs and not devices with detachable keyboards, which are considered tablets. Competing analyst firm Gartner has predicted PC shipments will go through minor quarterly declines until returning to positive growth in 2017. One reason for the recovery was a clear delineation of product categories. Tablets aren't considered competition anymore, and many customers are returning to laptops and desktops for their primary computing needs. Gaming PCs have thrived in the last year as interest in virtual reality and eSports grows. Holiday deals boosted PC sales in the U.S. and Europe, and the consumer PC market is recovering, IDC said. Shipments also were robust in China as buyers moved to thin and light devices. Lenovo's PC shipments totaled 15.7 million, growing by 1.7 percent, maintaining a 22.4 percent market share. HP's shipments totaled 15.27 million, growing by 6.6 percent, a 21.7 percent market share. Dell recorded the biggest quarterly gain with its shipments growing by 8.6 percent to 11 million units. Asus was the fifth largest PC maker behind Apple, and its shipments declined by 11.3 percent to 5.1 million units. In 2016, shipments of PCs totaled 260 million units, declining by 5.7 percent compared to 2015.

Lee, the current head of the Samsung Group, will be questioned by a special prosecutor Thursday as part of an investigation into a wide-ranging corruption scandal in South Korea that has reached all the way to the country’s president. The case centers on allegations that Samsung, among other businesses, paid millions of dollars to a mysterious associate of President Park Geun-hye in exchange for favorable government decisions. That associate, Choi Soon-sil, is accused of accepting payments for her daughter’s competitive equestrian career as bribes. +ALSO ON NETWORK WORLD: US Intel report: Russia allegedly obtained 'compromising' info on Trump + Amazon Alexa ‘wins’ CES, but how well does the virtual assistant really perform? In exchange, according to the Korea Times, Choi is said to have used her influence with President Park to win government support for a merger between two of Samsung’s business units, a move which helped Lee consolidate his power base and become the effective leader of the company after his father, Lee Kun-hee, was unable to continue in his day-to-day role as chairman due to health concerns. Lee is also accused of perjury, the Times reports, after denying to a parliamentary hearing last month that he had had discussions with the president in which he was asked to pay the alleged bribes to Choi’s foundations. Notes from the meeting subsequently made public suggest otherwise. Under South Korean law, President Park cannot be indicted while in office, but the National Assembly is pushing to impeach her. Other large South Korean companies, including Hyundai and LG, have also been implicated in the investigation. Despite the news, Samsung stocks are still trading at nearly $1,598 a share, having also weathered the Galaxy Note 7 battery issue without a substantial dip.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Gadgets Six ways to play Android games on Windows PC January 12, 2017January 12, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 Ozioma Ubabukoh It is not always possible to go with the installation and un-installation processes for checking each and every app on your smartphone or tablet. Playing Android Games on a Windows PC is not so hard as Intel has decided to launch “Dual OS” personal computer with Windows 8 and Android platform. This enables you to boot your computer directly into the Android system, hence installing the apps or games on your PC. But, you won’t have to buy a new PC only for the purpose of playing a game. Plenty of Android app emulators are available to run Android games and apps in almost all Windows environment. In this article, we have brought six various ways to play Android games on Windows 7, Windows 8 and even on Windows XP. Not only the games, but you can also run any Android app at the Windows system. Install BlueStacks to play Android games on PC BlueStacks is an Android emulator, which does not actually replace your operating system. Rather, it acts just like another software, which is easy to install. Once you install it, you can run BlueStacks into a separate window at your Windows desktop. The BlueStacks environment is very similar to that of Android. It allows you to connect with Google Play Store and install the apps and games at you emulator. If you grab the APK file from your friend’s device or download it from somewhere else, you can still install that game/app at your computer using BlueStacks. Thus, you can install and play any Android game on your Windows computer. This way, you can also run WhatsApp on a PC. Install Android SDK to run Android games on PC Another alternative is the Android SDK, the official emulator for the Android app developers by Google. This tool is not a suitable choice for daily use as it is slower and difficult to configure. This is actually useful for the developers to test the apps. If you are willing to go with it, download the Google’s Android SDK and open the SDK manager programme. Now, select Tools > Manage AVDs. Here, you can create the Android Virtual Device with your own configuration. Once created, click the ‘Start’ button to launch it. Play Android games on Genymotion, an alternative to BlueStacks Another Android emulator is Genymotion, which is quite impressive with its speed and features. It can be considered as the best alternative toBlueStacks. It allows drag-and-drop installation of apps and games. You can test any app or game in a big screen. It also supports the sensor system and open GL. Run Android apps and games from your browser Unlike the above desktop-based Android emulators, Manymo, which is a browser-based emulator, does not require any installation or complex configuration to run the Android apps. Just browse the link and upload your app to test. The interesting thing about Manymo is that you can embed any Android app or game at any webpage by using this browser-based emulator. Use Android X-86 This is the desktop version of the Android OS, which can be run natively in AMD and Intel processors. You can install this version just like you install the Windows or Linux operating systems in your X-86 based computers. As Android X-86 is a community project, it currently supports a few number of devices like Del Inspiron Mini Duo, Samsung Q1U, ASUS Eee PCs, Viliv S5, Lenovo ThinkPad x61 Tablet and ViewsonicViewpad 10. Another interesting thing about Android X-86 is that you can install it on a virtual machine using VMware or Virtual box. Use live Android to run Android games on PC Live Android is another complete OS for Android games and apps, which can boot separately in a laptop or desktop computer. As it is an OS, you can also install it in VMware or Virtual Box to test the Android apps and games. Conclusion Lots of Android emulators have been available for the past few years but to be frank, they did not have any purpose. The touch screens with Windows 8 and tablets gave a reason for using them to test various Android games and apps out of almost 750,000 in count.

One-on-one interview with Infineon CEO Junko Yoshida 1/11/2017 05:55 PM EST Post a comment NO RATINGS 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet LAS VEGAS – Name the top five semiconductor companies in the automotive electronics market today. If you answered NXP Semiconductors, Infineon, Renesas, ST Microelectronics and Texas Instruments, you know too much about semiconductors.  However, ironically, most of the attendees at a chip-dependent trade show like the Consumer Electronics Show likely have little clue. When talk about the future of automobiles tends to revolve around artificial intelligence and autonomous cars, the companies stealing the show at CES are chip vendors armed with massive processing power – namely, Nvidia, Mobileye and Intel. But honestly, you can’t blame the masses for getting excited about the idea of a car that has a built-in supercomputer with trillions of floating point per second (TFLOPS). Infineon Technologies, however, is not in that TFLOPS race. “We don’t intend to get into that business,” Reinhard Ploss, Infineon CEO, told us last week. In a one-on-one interview with EE Times, Ploss discussed why autonomous cars are “much more than high-performance computing platform.” He talked about how to achieve “100 percent reliability – aircraft-level – at the price of a car” and how “sensor fusion can’t afford to have confusion.” Infineon CEO Reinhard Ploss, in front of 3D image sensor REAL 3D designed for driver monitoring, at the company's booth at CES No more immediate M&A plan Meanwhile, despite the seemingly never-ending M&A activities among global chip vendors, the Infineon CEO said he’s not looking for another big target any time soon. Having completed acquisitions of International Rectifier (IR) and Wolfspeed in recent years, Ploss believes Infineon today is big enough, and well-positioned for organic growth. Infineon last summer picked up the Power and RF division (“Wolfspeed”) of Cree in all-cash transaction of $850 million. The deal included a related SiC wafer substrate business for power and RF power. The deal gave Infineon “an in-market technology,” as Ploss described it. Infineon also closed the acquisition of IR two years ago in a $3 billion cash deal. Ploss called the move an important step for Infineon to establish its position as a global leader in power semiconductors. “That was a play for scale,” he said. Finally, Infineon acquired Innoluce, a fabless chip vendor based in Nijmegen, last October. Based on the know-how of Innoluce, Infineon plans to develop chip components for high-performance lidar systems. Ploss termed the move “a basic pre-market technology” acquisition. Infineon projects to grow about 6 percent this year – a rate well above the industry average. The company has targeted its operational profit at 15-17 percent.   (Source: Infineon) Two trends Infineon foresees two big changes in today’s automotive market: electrification of vehicles, and assisted, automated driving. When it comes to electric drive trains, “Infineon offers the most complete solutions,” Ploss boasted. The Wolfspeed acquisition enables the broadest offering in compound semiconductors, and positions Infineon as a leading power and RF power supplier in such markets as electric vehicles and renewables, he explained.  Next page: Race for zero defect Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 3 Next > More Related Links Biggest Robo-Car Roadblock Is Human ARM Exec Dizzy for Open-Source Twizy Continental AI Effort Stresses Responsibility MediaTek Auto Gambit: Radar, Vision SoC Toyota Exec on Robo-Cars: Not Even Close Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] Be the first to post a comment regarding this story.

Mesa 13.1.0 Branch Is No More, Mesa 17.0.0 to Land in the First Week of February GO Feature freeze & first Release Candidate set for January 13 Jan 11, 2017 22:27 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Collabora's Emil Velikov is officially announcing today, January 11, 2017, that the upcoming Mesa 13.1.0 branch of the widely-used 3D graphics stack will change its versioning scheme to Mesa 17.0.0. Those of you bleeding-edgers who are using the Mesa 3D Graphics Library from Git, a.k.a. the development (unstable) branch of the graphics stack used in numerous GNU/Linux distributions to provide various open-source drivers for Intel, AMD, and Nvidia graphics cards, should have already noticed the major change. Mesa 13.1.0 is now known as Mesa 17.0.0 if you pull the latest code from Git, which the Padoka and Oibaf PPA do for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) and Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) platforms. It appears that the Mesa people decided to change the versioning scheme at the beginning of a new year, so now being 2017, here comes Mesa 17.0.0. "Mesa versioning scheme will be going a small update. Namely, the major number will be bumped at the beginning of each year and shall reflect the last two digits of the respective year. I would like to thank Marek for the suggestion and everyone who took part in the related discussion," said Emil Velikov, Software Release Engineer at Collabora. First Release Candidate of Mesa 17 slated for January 13 release The release plan is already in place, and it looks like Mesa 17.0.0 will enter Feature Freeze in only two days from the moment of writing this article, on January 13, 2017, when you should also be able to get your hands on the first Release Candidate (RC) development build. After that, there will be three more RC versions released. The second one is coming a week later, on January 20, and the third Release Candidate should be ready for public testing another week later, on January 27. The last Release Candidate and final release of Mesa 17.0.0 are currently slated for a February 3, 2017, release. Mesa 17.0.0 promises major new features, such as OpenGL 4.2 support for Intel Haswell by implementing 64-bit vertex attributes, as well as SDMA ClearBuffer support and other related improvements to the RadeonSI driver for AMD Radeon graphics cards, improving the performance of the Deus Ex: Mankind Divided video game by up to 70 percent. #Mesa 17.0.0#Mesa 13.1.0#Mesa 3D Graphics Library#AMD Radeon#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Canonical Patches 4 Linux Kernel Vulnerabilities in All Supported Ubuntu OSes ExLight Lets You Create Your Own Ubuntu with Enlightenment 0.20 and Linux 4.9 Linux Kernel 4.4.41 LTS Introduces Nouveau, Radeon, and PowerPC Improvements NetBSD 7.1 Enters Development, First Release Candidate Is Now Ready for Testing It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Debian GNU/Linux 8.7 "Jessie" Live & Installable ISOs Now Available for Download - Exclusive Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs    Mesa 17.0.0 in Ubuntu 16.10 New Linux Apps Q4OS: A Linux desktop operating system that features a minimal desktop environment and package selection Debian GNU/Linux: The Debian GNU Linux operating system, one of the oldest and influential Linux OSes Debian Live: Create your own Debian GNU/Linux system with this standard Live edition of the operating system Debian Live Xfce: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution with the Xfce desktop environment Debian Live MATE: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution built around the MATE desktop environment Debian Live LXDE: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux operating system, using the LXDE desktop environment Debian Live KDE: A Live flavor of Debian GNU/Linux, featuring the popular KDE desktop environment Reader comments It's Official: Sid Meier’s Civilization VI Is Coming to Linux and SteamOS, Soon more on: Sid Meier’s Civilization VI i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

He called for a suite of innovations in processors, memories, interconnects, and packaging. “The slowdown in Moore’s law and the growth of cloud services has brought us to an inflection point,” said Prasad Sabada, a senior director of operations who oversees sourcing for Google’s data center hardware. “The game is changing again and we need the industry to respond in a meaningful way.” Specifically, he called for processors optimized to reduce latency in context switching and other operations key to Google’s actual workloads. “We’ve seen many processors optimized for Spec [a synthetic benchmark], but at Google, our workloads differ significantly from Spec.” Google also wants memory chips with lower latency. “We can get as much bang for the buck improving memory latency as processor performance,” said Sabada, pointing to promising work on new memory architectures. Nearly a year ago, rival Facebook came out in support of Intel’s 3D XPoint memories, which promise improvements over today’s NAND flash. Intel started limited sampling of the chips late last year. In interconnects, today’s typical “processor bus has a lot of overhead accessing I/O and accelerator devices” and is not suited to emerging memory architectures, he said. In addition, optical interfaces such as silicon photonics are needed to link servers in the data center. Sabada called out IBM’s OpenCAPI interface as one effort it supports. He did not mention two separate efforts launched last year, CCIX and GenZ, for open interfaces for accelerators and storage-class memories, respectively.

The company's Mac shipments totaled 5.3 million units during the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline of just 0.9 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015. That compares favorably to overall Mac shipments in 2016, which totaled 18.4 million units, a decline of 9.8 percent compared to 2015, according to IDC.  Apple launched the new MacBook Pros in late October, and it was considered a significant upgrade. Had the new MacBook Pros shipped for all three months, the quarterly growth may have jumped up to flat or positive territory. But that's still not an encouraging sign for MacBook Pros, which haven't provided an overwhelming boost to worldwide Mac shipments. Apple will share its Mac shipment numbers during an earnings call on Jan. 31. Apple's shipment numbers haven't always agreed with figures from research firms like IDC and Gartner. The MacBook Pros were met with mixed reviews. They had new features like the Touch Bar, which received a lukewarm reaction. The Macs were also criticized for including Intel's older Skylake chips and not the newer Kaby Lake chips. Windows PCs and Chromebooks are performing better. Apple was the fourth-largest PC maker in the world behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell, all of which recorded positive shipment growth during the fourth quarter of 2016. Nevertheless, Apple's Mac shipments are recovering, and it comes at a time when PC shipments are also stabilizing. PC shipments in the fourth quarter totaled 70.2 million, declining by just 1.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015, according to IDC. The numbers include traditional PCs and not devices with detachable keyboards, which are considered tablets. Competing analyst firm Gartner has predicted PC shipments will go through minor quarterly declines until returning to positive growth in 2017.

The company's Mac shipments totaled 5.3 million units during the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline of just 0.9 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015. That compares favorably to overall Mac shipments in 2016, which totaled 18.4 million units, a decline of 9.8 percent compared to 2015, according to IDC.  Apple launched the new MacBook Pros in late October, and it was considered a significant upgrade. Had the new MacBook Pros shipped for all three months, the quarterly growth may have jumped up to flat or positive territory. But that's still not an encouraging sign for MacBook Pros, which haven't provided an overwhelming boost to worldwide Mac shipments. Apple will share its Mac shipment numbers during an earnings call on Jan. 31. Apple's shipment numbers haven't always agreed with figures from research firms like IDC and Gartner. The MacBook Pros were met with mixed reviews. They had new features like the Touch Bar, which received a lukewarm reaction. The Macs were also criticized for including Intel's older Skylake chips and not the newer Kaby Lake chips. Windows PCs and Chromebooks are performing better. Apple was the fourth-largest PC maker in the world behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell, all of which recorded positive shipment growth during the fourth quarter of 2016. Nevertheless, Apple's Mac shipments are recovering, and it comes at a time when PC shipments are also stabilizing. PC shipments in the fourth quarter totaled 70.2 million, declining by just 1.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015, according to IDC. The numbers include traditional PCs and not devices with detachable keyboards, which are considered tablets. Competing analyst firm Gartner has predicted PC shipments will go through minor quarterly declines until returning to positive growth in 2017. One reason for the recovery was a clear delineation of product categories. Tablets aren't considered competition anymore, and many customers are returning to laptops and desktops for their primary computing needs. Gaming PCs have thrived in the last year as interest in virtual reality and eSports grows. Holiday deals boosted PC sales in the U.S. and Europe, and the consumer PC market is recovering, IDC said.

USA TODAY NETWORK President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 11, 2017. It was his first press conference in nearly six months. (Photo: Justin Lane, EPA) President-elect Donald Trump brought his campaign against what he considers fake news to his first major press conference since winning the election. What played out could suggest contentious times ahead for mainstream media outlets while covering the incoming administration. At one point, the president-elect shouted down CNN reporter Jim Acosta, labeling the cable news network as "fake news" for its report that U.S. intelligence agencies had briefed the incoming president and President Obama with allegations that Russian operatives claim to have potentially compromising personal and financial information about Trump. Getting worse criticism was BuzzFeed, which published the 35-page classified document on its site as part of its coverage. Trump described the classified report as "false and fake and never happened" and called BuzzFeed a "failing pile of garbage. Writing it, I think they are going to suffer the consequences." USA TODAY Intel chiefs briefed Trump, Obama on unverified, salacious allegations concerning Russia and president-elect In getting publicly called out by Trump, Acosta and CNN "was somewhat suffering for the sins of BuzzFeed in this case," said Kyle Pope, editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review. The faceoff, in what was Trump's first press conference in more than five months, portends things to come. "The bigger picture here is that this is going to be a deeply combative relationship between this president and the press," Pope said. " Ed Wasserman, dean of the graduate school of journalism at the University of California-Berkeley, found the televised event "fairly demoralizing and disappointing," he said. "I had hoped for a more substantive and spirited exchange where he would actually submit to questioning by answering the questions." Instead, Trump's engagements with the press will be "kind of a ritualized interaction in which Trump reiterates his contempt for the press and the press once again re-earns its reputation for being hypercritical and adversarial." USA TODAY New Facebook project aims to strengthen ties with media When the stories broke Tuesday night, Trump took to Twitter calling the reports "fake news" and a "witch hunt." He followed that up Wednesday morning with another tweet: "Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!" During the press conference, the president-elect complimented many news outlets about their handling of the report, including The New York Times, which did not reference or link to BuzzFeed in its initial story. "I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that, but I will tell you there were some news organizations … that were so professional, so incredibly professional, that I’ve just gone up a notch on what I think of you," he said. Regardless, coverage of the classified briefing is real news, not fake news, and Trump should have expected this story to come out between the briefing and the earlier circulation of the classified document, said Nsenga Burton, digital editor for Grady Newsource and an instructor at the University of Georgia's Cox Media Institute for Journalism, Innovation & Management.  "CNN could not not have a story about that briefing that was circulating and call itself a news organization," she said. About BuzzFeed's publication of the document, "we can argue if that is news or journalism. At least they provided some context and said they were in the process of vetting it. ... But that is news. Not (what is in) the document, but the fact the document exists." As a business person, Trump should know that it would be more helpful to have "a working relationship" with outlets such as CNN, she said. "You can't call someone from CNN a liar and think that is going to end well for your administration," Burton said. USA TODAY Trump and the Russia report: What you need to know Pope wondered whether other reporters should have come to Acosta's aid and asked a question for him or ceded their time to CNN. "The challenge for the press is the media basically has to come to grips with the fact they have a president who is going to do absolutely nothing to help them and is going to put as many roadblocks in front of them as he possibly can and also is going to do all he can to discredit them and undercut any trust they have between them and their readers." Some came to CNN's defense later in the day. During his afternoon broadcast Fox News’ Shep Smith said, “CNN’s exclusive reporting on the Russian matter was separate and distinctly different from the document dump executed by an online news property. Though we at Fox News cannot confirm CNN’s report, it is our observation that its correspondents follow journalistic standards and that neither they nor any other journalists should be subjected to belittling or delegitimizing by the President-elect of the United States.” National Press Club President Thomas Burr called it "dangerous and unhealthy to declare a news item as 'fake news' to distract from facts that you may not like or don't favor your perspective," in a statement issued about the president-elect's press conference. "Our incoming president must treat the news media as the vital cornerstone of our democracy that it is," he said. "To label something as 'fake' in an effort to undermine news outlets endangers the trust granted journalists by the public and is antithetical to our country's values." The @PressClubDC raises concerns about Trump's use of "fake news" phrase to discredit news he doesn't like https://t.co/UNEnF5QU7A— Thomas Burr (@thomaswburr) January 11, 2017 In another oddity from the press conference, Trump was asked about his Wednesday morning tweet questioning "Are we living in Nazi Germany?" His response was that it was a "disgrace" that the intelligence agencies leaked it. "That's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do," Trump said. "I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public." Ironically, that tweet came very close to invoking an iconic Internet meme known as Godwin’s Law. First coined in 1990 by attorney and author Mike Godwin, it says “As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Hitler approaches 1.” The theory is that once someone in a discussion begins comparing anything to Hitler, the discussion is over and whoever had invoked the Nazi comparison has lost the debate.

For starters, there is a bona fide gold rush going on with VR, and nearly every company we saw had some take on VR or its sibling, augmented reality. But then electronics companies as a group never fail to reverse that great maxim of business — under-promise and over-deliver — and instead tend to deliver nuclear levels of hype that reliably makes any product a disappointment. After nearly a week’s worth of talking tech with peers and industry reps and luminaries, we think that unlike recent high profile flops such as 3D TV or Google Glass, VR is going to be a major influence in all of our lives, but likely not in the ways we think about it now. Already there are extremely powerful virtual reality experiences available, as anyone who has tested out Oculus Rift or similarly top-shelf goggles will attest. While they may not feel exactly like real life, they do feel sufficiently immersive that it’s easy to suspend disbelief. (And we will never get sick of watching videos of people falling over while wearing goggles.) This immersive feeling is the killer app: It’s transportive, making one truly feel as if they are existing in another realm, even if it isn’t exactly like real life. RELATED: CES 2017: 4 Start-Up Gadgets That Put Big Brands to Shame As a concept this is extremely attractive both to consumers and electronics companies but also content creators, from video game makers to traditional film and television producers. Already there are a half dozen or more goggles available for viewing VR content, such as from Sony, HTC, and Oculus/Facebook, among others, as well as loads of more basic goggles for viewing 360-degree video, which is sort of VR light. And VR was a topic addressed in some way at every press conference we attended — in fact the entirety of Intel’s press event was about the coming VR revolution, and the company distributed some 350 goggles for attendees to wear during its presentation. And that’s kind of the problem. We have no doubt that in the short term, there will be a market, maybe even a substantial one, for goggle- and earphone-based entertainment. For games it’s only a matter of time that VR headsets will be standard in the way headphones were with the advent of the Xbox. And the idea that some completely new form of entertainment might evolve in the coming decade the way film, radio, and then TV did in the last century is exciting stuff. It might be a group thing where visitors from across the globe attend concerts or clubs or simply meet-ups where we interact with each other in cyberspace. You might be able to run on the field in the middle of your favorite NFL or soccer game and see Messi’s footwork, or stand on the baseline of Wimbledon and see what it’s like to face the barrel end of a serve by Andy Murray. Maybe. RELATED: CES 2017: The Age of Alexa Is Upon Us What’s more likely though is that the downsides of the current goggle-based paradigm for experiencing VR will condemn it to a niche product, somewhat in the way 3D has limped along in theaters but utterly failed on the home front. Many have complained that the goggles are relatively expensive and require heavy-duty machines to run them, but really that’s small potatoes — prices always drop and, nowadays, pretty quickly.  The bigger issues aren’t so easy, though. For one, an unknown but anecdotally large number of people get nauseous or feel disorientated, even ill, from experiencing even a few minutes of VR, and those effects may last hours or even days after extended VR use. This has led one VR expert to suggest such devices be banned altogether, presumably due to the danger of having all these spaced-out, effectively drunk, people heading out in cars or in public. (And, indeed, during Intel’s press event, the company had barf bags at the ready in case of an incident, though none were reported.) RELATED: CES 2017: The Most Over-the-Top, Weird, and Downright Useless Gadgets There are ways to mitigate these physical effects, and it may be they will be solved somehow in the future by a technical breakthrough, but for us the bigger issue is the notion of wearing goggles at all. Three-D is a failure not because the technology isn’t amazing, or it’s too expensive to produce, it’s because people hate having to procure, and maintain, and have on hand and physically wear glasses to view it, period. No matter how light or even stylish, it’s a non-starter.  That makes goggle-based VR, no matter how enticing, terminally doomed as a mass pursuit. We might one day have a set on the shelf as we do binoculars for special occasions, we might break them out for the Super Bowl, even, but we won’t be sitting around as a family wearing them every day. So where will VR succeed? Our conversations with one VR engineer from a major company, who shared our skepticism of the goggle hype, said that there will still be all kinds of ways that VR will be put to use. It may enable new ways of experiencing design and architecture, or for solving engineering problems anywhere on the planet or in far space, for creating new industrial purposes, or simply for training (an ongoing practice for decades in the military). But his focus was on the incredible firehose of video and data we are already able to produce that’s only skyrocketing, along with powerful processors that will some day soon come together and allow for a version of Star Trek’s holodeck — an infinite, imagined world you inhabit without having to don specialized equipment. Now that sounds worthy of hype.  Add a Comment Sign Up for the Men's Journal Newsletter! Please enable javascript to sign up for the newsletter.

The reports by several major news outlets, including BuzzFeed and CNN, were based on a 35-page document compiled from information obtained by a former British spy. But BuzzFeed, which published the entire dossier, and CNN admitted that the allegations contained in the report had not been verified by the intelligence agencies. FBI and CIA officials also reportedly said that they had investigated the report but found “no link” between Trump and the Kremlin as the document alleged. “Intel and law enforcement officials agree that none of the investigations have found any conclusive or direct link between Trump and the Russian government period.” President Putin allegedly has compromising information that could be used to blackmail Trump. [Image by Alexei Druzhinin/RIA NOVOSTI/AP images] After expressing outrage on Tuesday that media outlets would publish the unverified document and take any of the largely unsubstantiated allegations in the report seriously, Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to direct his sense of outrage against the intelligence agencies. He blamed the intelligence agencies for allowing a dossier containing unsubstantiated allegations to be leaked, asking, “Are we living in Nazi Germany?” He insisted on his innocence, saying that he has “nothing to do with Russia” and that the allegations were politically-motivated attacks against him. Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to "leak" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? — Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is "A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE." Very unfair! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 “Fake News – A Total Political Witch Hunt!” Trump had raged on Twitter on Tuesday in reference to media reports about the allegation that Russia has damaging information about him. He went to declare on Wednesday that he has “no deals, no loans, no nothing” with Russia. He insisted that the reports were “unfair” and claimed that “Russia has never tried to use leverage over me.” But some news reports noted that despite Trump’s loud claims that he has “no deals, no loans, no nothing” with Russia, the facts about his financial and business ties with Russia, if any, are difficult to verify because he has refused to release his tax returns. Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns contrasts sharply with the decision by U.S. presidents since Jimmy Carter to release their task returns. His political opponents and detractors point to a statement attributed to his son Donald Trump Jr. that implied, contrary to Trump’s Twitter assertions, that his businesses have benefited greatly from Russian funds. “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,” Trump Jr. said during a real estate conference in 2008, according to the Washington Post. However, this is not the first time that Trump has cast doubt on reports and findings by U.S. intelligence agencies. He denied previous intelligence reports that the Russians interfered in the 2016 general election with the purpose of helping him defeat Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. The president-elect’s denial of U.S. intelligence reports on alleged Russian interference in the country’s democratic process has caused an increasing gulf between him and intelligence officials. The gulf was revealed in recent media reports that Trump had stopped receiving daily intelligence briefings. The 35-page dossier containing damaging allegations against Trump, published by BuzzFeed on Tuesday, contained largely unsubstantiated allegations that the Russian government has been cultivating close ties with Trump for about five years by providing assistance, including financial and business assistance. The document also claimed that Russian intelligence agencies obtained compromising information about Trump that could be used to blackmail him.

[Image by Evan Vucci/AP images] It claimed specifically that during a trip to Moscow in 2013, Trump was filmed watching prostitutes perform lewd acts in a hotel room that President Barack Obama and previously occupied. The dossier also contained allegations that Trump and his aides had cooperated with Russian hackers who hacked the Democratic Party systems. The dossier, reportedly compiled from information obtained from a former British spy who was hired by Trump’s political opponents, was circulated widely to officials and media outlets before the 2016 election. The Arizona Republican Senator John McCain also obtained a copy of the report from a foreign source and forwarded it personally to FBI Director James Comey, according to the Guardian. The damaging allegations contained in the document were raised during a recent classified intelligence briefing to President Obama and President-elect Trump. According to NBC News, two U.S. officials confirmed that materials used during an intelligence briefing for Trump included a two-page document giving a overview of the allegations. But a senior U.S. intelligence official appeared to contradict the claim when he told NBC News that Trump was not briefed on the two-page addendum to the 35-page dossier. However, the apparent contradiction was later resolved by other officials who told NBC News that although the written summary was included in the material prepared for the briefing, the document was not handed to Trump. Officials in charge only gave him an oral briefing. Meanwhile, the Russian government has denied the unverified allegations, describing them as a “total hoax.” “The Kremlin does not have compromising information about Trump,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, according to the Washington Post. “It’s a total hoax, absolute fabrication and utter nonsense. The Kremlin does not collect compromising information.” [Featured Image by Evan Vucci/Shutterstock] Now Watch This: Nicole Kidman Urges America To Give Donald Trump A Chance Now Read This: Martin Luther King Jr Would Not Have Approved of Obama’s Legacy Share 6 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author JohnThomas Didymus Tags: buzzfeed, CIA, cnn, Donald Trump January 14, 2017 ‘The Bold And The Beautiful’ Spoilers: Ridge And Quinn Kiss, Liam Gives Steffy An Ultimatum, And Eric Cheats With Katie?

It is most commonly uttered in reference to public policy debates or investigative revelations, when arguments have been presented and facts are well established. On Tuesday, BuzzFeed plopped the term into a very different context. In a story with three bylines — Ken Bensinger, Mark Schoofs and Miriam Elder — the news division of the popular website published a dossier of allegations pertaining to Donald Trump and Russia. It describes attempts by Russian officials to cultivate Trump and gather compromising material on him. The existence of the document isn’t a scoop: Mother Jones’ David Corn before the election discussed some of the material, and CNN on Tuesday scooped a story under the plain-language headline, “Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him.” To its credit, BuzzFeed notes prominently that the “allegations are unverified, and the report contains errors.” In fact, that qualification comes in the sub-headline. To its discredit, the BuzzFeed story offers this motive for publishing the allegations: “Now BuzzFeed News is publishing the full document so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the US government.” Americans can only “make up their own minds” if they build their own intelligence agencies, with a heavy concentration of operatives in Russia and Eastern Europe. CNN pointedly declined to drop the document’s details on the public: “At this point, CNN is not reporting on details of the memos, as it has not independently corroborated the specific allegations.” In an email to colleagues, top BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith put forth this explanation: “As you have probably seen, this evening we published a secret dossier making explosive and unverified allegations about Donald Trump and Russia. I wanted to briefly explain to you how we made the decision to publish it. “We published the dossier, which Ken Bensinger obtained through his characteristically ferocious reporting, so that, as we wrote, ‘Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the US government.’ “Our presumption is to be transparent in our journalism and to share what we have with our readers. We have always erred on the side of publishing. In this case, the document was in wide circulation at the highest levels of American government and media. It seems to lie behind a set of vague allegations from the Senate Majority Leader to the director of the FBI and a report that intelligence agencies have delivered to the president and president-elect. “As we noted in our story, there is serious reason to doubt the allegations. We have been chasing specific claims in this document for weeks, and will continue to. “Publishing this document was not an easy or simple call, and people of good will may disagree with our choice. But publishing this dossier reflects how we see the job of reporters in 2017.” The more detailed discussion put forth by Smith lands closer to the mark. Though the dossier started out as opposition research, funded first by groups connected to Trump’s GOP primary opponents and later by those on the Democratic side, as reported by CNN — and it is the work of a former British intelligence operative. It has evolved into essentially a government document — something that reporters might seek via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). A synopsis of the dossier has been presented both to President Barack Obama and to President-elect Trump. Then again, it is unverified — meaning that it requires further investigation. BuzzFeed has started that process and pledges to continue pursuing it. So why post the documents now?

As automakers and technology companies continue to stake their respective claims within the rapidly shifting world of transportation, more and more models of how our transportation system will look are beginning to take shape. Here’s a quick overview of the big announcements. John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, debuts a customized Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid at the Detroit Auto Show Bill Pugliano/Getty Images Minivans rarely make big ripples at the Detroit Auto show. But a new driverless model designed by Waymo, the Google/Alphabet self-driving spin-off, generated a lot of attention from attendees. Built by Fiat Chrysler, the converted Pacifica offers a tangible example of the technology company’s new market strategy, focusing on developing driverless technology and licensing it to automakers. Waymo also has plans to develop a radar-and-sensor kit that could be integrated into conventional vehicles. This repositioning of Waymo as a supplier and turnkey solution for automakers has enticed Honda to begin discussions about licensing technology. The company plans to start testing the vans on public roads near Mountain View, California, and Phoenix, Arizona, later this month. Can cars teach themselves to drive? Mobileye, an Israeli technology company, will begin testing a new take on driverless cars in the United States later this year that will focus on reinforcement learning. Announced at CES, the tests, in partnership with BMW and Intel, will feature a learning system that allows vehicles to constantly improve their navigation and decision-making, to interact better with human drivers and alter their behavior. The company also plans on starting an AV bus pilot program in San Ramon, California. Trendy autonomous vehicles designs were incredibly popular at CES, from the sensor-laden FF91 concept car by Tesla-competitor Faraday Future, and Chrysler’s Portal concept, a ride designed “by millennials, for millennials” that includes a selfie cam and facial recognition tech to automatically update entertainment preferences inside the vehicle. Honda’s snug NeuV concept car crammed three trends—driverless technology, ride-sharing, and electric vehicles—onto its tiny frame. According to company spokespeople, in the future, the vehicle will operate as part of a ride-sharing service while the owner is at home or at work. An autonomous self-driving concept vehicle called Portal is displayed at the Chrysler booth at CES 2017 at the Las Vegas Convention Center. David Becker/Getty BMW’s concept model, the BMW Inside Future, offered a more comfortable look at a driverless future, with a fold-away steering wheel, backseat screen for entertainment, touch-free HoloActive control system (a small step towards Minority Report), and even a bookshelf, for those retro riders who don’t want to stare at screens throughout their commute. It all points towards the possibility of autonomous vehicles becoming a new kind of third place. In less speculative news, General Motors announced that its developing fully autonomous versions of the Chevy Bolt, the brand’s all-electric subcompact model. Toyota’s Concept-i concept car Toyota The Concept-i car from Toyota offered a sleek, sci-fi look at the driverless future, though it still clings to the concept of a steering wheel. The car also features the company’s artificial intelligence assistant, Yui, which can help drivers perform routine tasks such as turning on and off the radio. Yui, as well as the lack of touch screens on the interior, point to a gradualist approach from the Japanese automaker: with true autonomy still a long ways away, using digital assistants and more deliberate design to improve safety offers a more practical road towards integrating technology into automobiles. Ford, which showed off its Fusion hybrid autonomous vehicle, is taking a similar approach, integrating Alexa with the new test model, while Nissan and BMW plan to integrate Microsoft’s Cortana assistant. Looking beyond all the high-tech gadgets on display on the CES convention center floor, the city of Las Vegas announced that it’s testing a new autonomous, fully electric shuttle, the first such test in the nation. The ARMA Shuttle, developed by NAVYA and Keolis, debuted during CES. The shuttle, which can hit a top speed of 28-miles-per-hour, is meant to run fixed routes or function as an on-demand ride service, and offers more proof that autonomy may help make buses more relevant to contemporary commuters. Flashy cities seem to have a thing for driverless cars; earlier this week, Beverly Hills, California, petitioned to become a testing ground for driverless technology. Ford followed up on its big announcement about investing in electric vehicle technology by presenting a vision of future mobility, focused on how driverless cars and smart city technology will change urban transportation. While we’re still a ways off, and many would argue, have more immediate infrastructure challenges to tackle, the video points to where the technological race may lead us in the near future.

Lee, the current head of the Samsung Group, will be questioned by a special prosecutor Thursday as part of an investigation into a wide-ranging corruption scandal in South Korea that has reached all the way to the country’s president. The case centers on allegations that Samsung, among other businesses, paid millions of dollars to a mysterious associate of President Park Geun-hye in exchange for favorable government decisions.

In exchange, according to the Korea Times, Choi is said to have used her influence with President Park to win government support for a merger between two of Samsung’s business units, a move which helped Lee consolidate his power base and become the effective leader of the company after his father, Lee Kun-hee, was unable to continue in his day-to-day role as chairman due to health concerns. Lee is also accused of perjury, the Times reports, after denying to a parliamentary hearing last month that he had had discussions with the president in which he was asked to pay the alleged bribes to Choi’s foundations. Notes from the meeting subsequently made public suggest otherwise. Under South Korean law, President Park cannot be indicted while in office, but the National Assembly is pushing to impeach her. Other large South Korean companies, including Hyundai and LG, have also been implicated in the investigation.

The Trump team knows this. They are using Buzzfeed’s decision to deflect from CNN’s reporting, which has been matched by the other major news organizations. Related: 4 Top U.S. Intel Chiefs Presented Trump With Claims That Russian Operatives Have Compromising Info on Him We are fully confident in our reporting. It represents the core of what the First Amendment protects, informing the people of the inner workings of their government; in this case, briefing materials prepared for President Obama and President-elect Trump last week. We made it clear that we were not publishing any of the details of the 35-page document because we have not corroborated the report’s allegations. Given that members of the Trump transition team have so vocally criticized our reporting, we encourage them to identify, specifically, what they believe to be inaccurate.

Skip to content To Inform is to Influence IO, SC, PD, what's in a name? Menu About Information Operations Holistic Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community Calendar Information Warfare · Russia Blame Russia, Not Intel January 11, 2017January 11, 2017 Joel Harding Yesterday, when I first saw the accusations against Trump, it did not feel right. My instincts are seldom wrong, so I began thinking about everything in the past six months. I wrote: “CNN reporting that Russia “allegedly” has compromising information on Trump.” Timing is everything.  Releasing the information about ten days before the Presidential inauguration seemed right if the information was supposed to have forced Donald Trump to resign.  Leaking the information to the Intelligence Community a wee bit more than two weeks prior makes sense.  How someone leaked that information into the Intel Community and having it accepted as actionable intelligence is something I want to explore.  It has to be from a credible source because we all know there is a ton of disinformation out there.  What Trump did not disclose was when the IC warned him about this report, how was the information obtained and when. BuzzFeed released this article with the alleged dossier. These Reports Allege Trump Has Deep Ties To Russia.  The entire 35 page report is on that page.  Here is another source: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html It didn’t start there, however, but late last year.  It was me: Sworn Trump enemy John McCain admits HE handed smear dossier to FBI – as details surface of document’s bizarre journey from British former spy and diplomat. US Senator John McCain received the information from a former British ambassador to Russia, the information seemed credible enough to pass on to the FBI.   Current analysis says the information is shoddy, incomplete, and does not hold up to even a cursory examination. CNN reporting that Russia “allegedly” has compromising information on Trump. – Russia has three goals when it comes to Information Warfare: Sow divisiveness, foster chaos, and foment hysteria and questioning in the US and the West. Promote Russian national interests Undermine US and Western democracy – by using any and all means. The only time Russia, actually the Soviet Union, could have compromised Trump was when he visited there in 1986 with his then wife Ivana. Notice CNN, who is virulently and openly anti-Trump, is pushing this story the most. Buzzfeed, another viciously anti-Trump outlet, pushed the story. If mass hysteria builds and Trump is forced to resign, Russia wins. Not the Democrats, but Russia. In this case, CNN and BuzzFeed are aiding and promoting the Russian agenda in favor of Putin. In response, Trump treated CNN like a petulant child. https://twitter.com/ElizLanders/status/819235642769113092/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw The net result is that CNN and Buzzfeed have destroyed whatever residual confidence the public might have had in the media. And they have done so with just days to go before the start of a presidency that looks set to continue in the “strong executive” tradition of its two predecessors. http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2017/01/11/cnn-buzzfeed-dossier-media-trump-accoutable/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social President-elect Trump blamed the Intelligence Community, but all they did was warn him and President Obama that a shitstorm was about to hit, smearing Trump.  They were just doing their job. Russia has historically tried to undermine the US, US presidents, and US credibility.  The activity allegedly occured in Russia.  Buzzfeed, CNN, and the former British Ambassador to Russia are all unwitting tools of Russia. Of course, Russia denies everything.  Russia denies having compromising material on Donald Trump The media does not seem to connect these dots, instead blaming CNN and Buzzfeed.  Granted, they are guilty of not corroborating the source, not verifying the information, and disclosing a shoddy report chock full of holes. The problem is that nobody in the press is thinking of Russia’s involvement.  Russia stands the most to gain.  Russia has a deep history of this type operation. Russia is behind this latest smear attempt. Share this: Pinterest Tumblr LinkedIn Google Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Print Like this: Like Loading...

That’s so 2016 Reply Mike H says: January 11, 2017 at 2:49 pm Did you see that Trump had dismissed this all with some sort of anti-Fascist cast off? Arjen de Landgraaf says: January 11, 2017 at 1:40 pm If Russian hackers really have hacked the US systems, you would never see any sign that they did. Any indication that points to a certain direction will have been planted by the hackers deliberately to misdirect forensic investigations. Come on, they are not stupid!!!! Reply Mike H says: January 11, 2017 at 1:44 pm Joel, great post. I agree. 4Chan claimed it was them, but Daily Beast discredited them. The concept of a Golden Shower however is so comical that I was immediately skeptical of the whole report. In my opinion it was leaked to the PI because they probably knew he didn’t have an agency infrastructure backing him up — it was just another way to embarrass Hillary in all likelihood — had her camp released the report. Now Russia is getting a second wind from the same investment by again undermining Mr. Trump as he is about to take office. Had the report referenced pedophilia, etc, I might have given it a closer and more serious look; but as I thought about the golden showers thing and how it actually plays psychologically more like a joke than a kompromat story. So that is where I choose to put my head and gut together on this. Some sort of conscious counterintelligence disinformation that fits the whole disruptive strategy — while had it been aired during the campaign — may not have been fatal to Mr. Trump from a publicity perspective due to that laughability. That also being said, the evidence of some disinformation in there does not discredit all of the conclusions or findings of the report but it does undermine I think how much faith we can put in it.

Tech Culture by Bonnie Burton January 11, 2017 8:38 AM PST @bonniegrrl Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Enlarge Image Help save the humble bumblebee, now officially listed as an endangered species. Photo by Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET The rusty patched bumblebee is finally getting the attention it deserves. It's the first bumblebee in the United States to be listed as endangered. The bee is one of the pollinators experiencing serious declines across the country, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. More buzz Bees make US endangered-species list for first time Intel's Edison joins the quest to save the bees CSIRO puts backpacks on bees to study colony collapse "Why is this important? Pollinators are small but mighty parts of the natural mechanism that sustains us and our world," Midwest Regional Director Tom Melius said in a statement Tuesday. "Without them, our forests, parks, meadows and shrub lands, and the abundant, vibrant life they support, cannot survive, and our crops require laborious, costly pollination by hand." Since the late '90s, the rusty patched bumblebee population has fallen by 87 percent, leaving tiny, scattered populations in 13 states and one province, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Some possible causes for the bee's decline include disease, parasites, pesticides and climate change. People who want to do their part to help aid the bumblebee's survival are encouraged to plant native flowers (even in cities) using any variety that will bloom from spring through fall. The US Fish and Wildlife Service also suggests people limit or avoid use of pesticides entirely. People should also allow grass and garden plants to grow after summer to provide a habitat for overwintering bees. The rusty patched bumblebee joins seven species of yellow-faced bees native to Hawaii that were given endangered status by the US Fish and Wildlife Service last year.

"This would bolster research in different fields like the humanities, arts, business, finance, natural sciences and technology," the official said.

It will allow Iran to import about 20 cubic meters of gas from Turkmenistan. Apart from natural gas, there is also a far-reaching Iran-Turkmenistan energy communication project, in which Armenia too, may be a participant,” he told Tert.am, commenting on Prime Minister Karen Karapetyan’s recent meeting with the two countries’ ambassadors. “Our advantage here is that we have a very serious experience of energy cooperation with both Iran and Turkmenistan. For many years, Turkmenistan was Armenia’s main supplier of natural gas; yet it now turns out to be facing shortage of electric power. So the project, if implemented, will allow Armenia to export electric power to Turkmenistan via Iran.” Armenia needs to be informed of such regional projects to have its own contribution, the expert added.   He cited the previously implemented successful projects with the countries as good precedents promising a fruitful cooperation in future.     “We are a little bit making haste when speaking about the export of Turkmenistan’s gas, but it is virtually possible to bring it to Armenia via a transit route from Iran,” he said, highlighting the essentially cheaper prices as compared to the Iranian gas.   The project would also offer alternatives to Armenia, allowing it to reduce the natural gas prices and boost the domestic industries’ development, Manvelyan added. “Also, it will be an opportunity for Armenia – as an EEU member state - to become a center of chemical industries. Armenia would thus be a center of thermal power stations. What offers us advantage, however, is the export [rather than the import] of energy,” Manvelyan explained.   He added that they cooperation with Turkmenistan would succeed in case the earlier energy and natural gas agreements with Iran are implemented. “If we build the second high-voltage electric power station, we can fourfold increase the natural gas import. In that case, we will be able to import gas from not only Iran but also Turkmenistan for much cheaper prices, receiving energy power in return,” he noted.

Image: Connor McKenna Cork teen coder Harry Moran has released a new app in the App Store and on Google Play called ‘Reheated’, the latest in the PizzaBot saga. Moran gained fame in 2011 when as a 12-year-old, he became the then youngest software developer to release an app on the Mac App Store, called PizzaBot. He learned how to code as one of the earliest members of CoderDojo in Cork. ‘The game is customisable and allows players to add new capabilities using different toppings’ – HARRY MORAN He followed this up with a mobile sequel called PizzaBot Seasonings and at 14, he launched a new title called Robot Run. Now 18 years old, Moran, a 5th year student at Coláiste an Spioraid Naoimh in Cork, has his sights set on a career in software. He spent the last summer in London as an intern with Unit9, working on a project with record producer Deadmau5 and Absolut Vodka. During his transition year, he also crammed in work experience at Intel in Leixlip, and started a robotics club in his school that has gone on to compete in the Vex Robotics competition, where the team came third in Ireland. Harry ups his game 18-year-old Cork coder Harry Moran. Image: Connor McKenna The new game PizzaBot: Reheated was released today on iOS in the App Store and on Android on the Google Play store. It also features as his entry this year in the BT Young Science and Technology Exhibition, where he is showcasing the game as an example of randomly generated algorithms. “The game is customisable and allows players to add new capabilities using different toppings,” Moran said. “Also, the randomly generated algorithms throw infinite possibilities as new waves attack.” The game is certainly a more polished affair than earlier versions, representing Moran’s growing prowess at coding, with brasher graphics and sound effects. He started development of the latest game when he was 16. “There is definitely a lot more mathematical science in this one,” Moran said. Looking ahead to his Leaving Cert year, Moran said he plans to study computing at third level, but said the jury is out on whether he plans to study in Ireland or overseas. “The hardest decision will be whether I will study computer science or computer engineering,” Moran added.

The reason they brought the memo, the official told them, was to provide examples for Trump of the difference between “analyzed intelligence and unvetted ‘disinformation.'” According to the official, they never had to use it. The NBC report appears to contradict the Tuesday CNN report, which broke news of the memo’s existence. CNN reported that the memo was “presented” to Trump, and the reason for its inclusion was to “was to make the President-elect aware that such allegations involving him are circulating among intelligence agencies.” The NBC report would appear to jibe however with assertions from Trump and Kellyanne Conway that Tuesday night was the first time they heard about the document. According to NBC, intelligence chiefs also brought along examples of “disinformation” about Hilllary Clinton to present if they had to, but never did.

Image: Evan Vucci AP/Press Association Images 15:25 11 Jan 2017 Michael Staines 4 days ago More than 600 major companies and investors have penned an open letter to US President-elect Donald Trump calling on the new administration to commit to continued moves toward a low-carbon economy. The group, describing themselves as “members in the business and investor community of the United States” have used the document to confirm their “deep commitment” to addressing climate change through the Paris Climate Accord. During the divisive US elections, Mr Trump suggested that he believed climate change was “a hoax” and warned that he may pull the US out of the Paris agreement. Since his election to office, he has appointed a string of climate change deniers to key positions within his transitional cabinet and warned that he may strip NASA’s Earth Science Division of funding as part of a crackdown on “politicised science.” Ice storm rolls from Texas to Tennessee - I'm in Los Angeles and it's freezing. Global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2013 Greenpeace spokesperson Perry Wheeler told Newstalk that, “unchecked, President Trump could eliminate the clean power plan, abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, and pull us out of the landmark Paris Climate Agreement.” He called Mr Trump’s election victory an “urgent wake-up call for people power.” Image: NASA Climate 365 project Major firms and investors In the joint statement, a range of major companies - including Unilever, IKEA, General Mills, Hewlett Packard, Johnson & Johnson, Adidas, Intel, Levis, Nike, Tesla, Virgin and Mars inc. - have appealed to Mr Trump to reconsider his apparent stance. The more than 530 companies included on the list have collective revenues amounting to nearly €1.1 trillion and employ approximately 1.8 million people. The 100 investors collectively manage assets worth over €1.9 trillion. The statement calls on “our elected US leaders” to throw their support behind three major actions: Continuation of low-carbon policies to allow the US to meet or exceed its promised national commitment - and to increase the nation’s future ambition. Investment in the low-carbon economy at home and abroad in order to give financial decision-makers clarity and boost the confidence of investors worldwide. Continued US participation in the Paris Agreement, in order to provide the long-term direction needed to keep the global temperature rise below 2°C. The low-carbon economy “We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,” reads the statement. “Cost-effective and innovative solutions can help us achieve these objectives.” “Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk, but the right action now will create jobs and boost US competitiveness. “We pledge to do our part, in our own operations and beyond, to realize the Paris Agreement’s commitment of a global economy that limits global temperature rise to well below 2°C.” The group said that US implementation of the Paris Agreement will “enable and encourage businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in existing low-carbon investments into the trillions of dollars the world needs to bring clean energy and prosperity to all.” “We support leaders around the world as they seek to implement the Paris Agreement and leverage this historic opportunity to tackle climate change,” they said. Major international companies The letter provides comment from the company executives driving the commitment to addressing climate change. Lars Petersson, president of IKEA USA said: “All parts of society have a role to play in tackling climate change, but policy and business leadership is crucial.” “The Paris Agreement was a bold step towards a cleaner, brighter future, and must be protected,” he said. “IKEA will continue to work together with other businesses and policymakers to build a low-carbon economy because we know that together, we can build a better future.” Johnson & Johnson VP of Environment, Health, Safety & Sustainability, Paulette Frank said that as a healthcare company, “we understand that healthy people need a healthy planet.” She said the company has committed to taking on responsibility to, “reduce our carbon emissions and increase our use of renewable energy until we reach our ultimate aspiration of 100% renewable electricity.” “The Paris Agreement was a vital step forward, but its power is in our collective action,” said Lara Birkes, chief sustainability officer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. “Business and government leaders must urgently work together to drive a thriving, low-carbon economy.”   15:25 11 Jan 2017 Michael Staines 4 days ago 4 Related articles "We may as well have Trump as Taoiseach" - Government slammed over climate change statement Trump's nomination of climate change sceptic to lead EPA criticised as a 'dangerous choice' Teenagers targeting big oil and the US Government in landmark climate lawsuit Trump to switch NASA's focus from climate change to space exploration most popular latest sport The most expensive street in Ireland has been named "I was pissed off": Dublin club footballer fuming that GAA player-coach contract was leaked onto social media Senegal beat Tunisia 2-0 in the African Nations Cup Brendan Rodgers aiming to keep Celtic progressing in 2017 site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

USA TODAY NETWORK The president-elect is blasting the intelligence community for letting unsubstantiated allegations leak into the press about his campaign’s purported ties to Russia. In a morning tweetstorm, Trump began by highlighting Russian denials of the allegations and then turned his ire elsewhere. Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is "A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE." Very unfair!— Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 Intelligence officials included a synopsis in a special briefing of Trump last Friday that included unsubstantiated and salacious allegations that Russian operatives had obtained potentially compromising personal and financial information about the president-elect, a U.S. official confirmed to USA TODAY. Trump's tweet about Germany immediately sent social media into a frenzy. "Are we living in Nazi Germany” swiftly became a trending phrase on Twitter, and the sentiment was, well, just what you'd expect. You can't make this stuff up.

Bennett @John T. Bennett Obama Doubts Trump Can Govern Via Twitter, Admits Some Missteps White House Sees McAuliffe Playing Big Role for Dems in Post-Obama Era Combative Trump Won't Divest Holdings, Vows Obamacare Replacement Soon Save for later President-elect Donald Trump talks after a meeting with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office on Nov. 10. Obama's Tuesday evening farewell address showed their widely contrasting styles. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) John T. Bennett @John T. Bennett Posted Jan 11, 2017 10:19 AM Save for later The friendly crowd in Chicago booed when President Barack Obama mentioned his fast-approaching return to private life when he will hand power to his successor, Donald Trump. “No, no, no, no, no,” Obama stopped them, saying next Friday’s “peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected president to the next” a “hallmark of our democracy.” It was reminiscent of the times he was campaigning for Hillary Clinton when he would mention Trump and hear even louder jeers from Democratic audiences. Rather than play into the crowd’s animosity toward the then-GOP nominee, Obama responded each time this way: “Don’t boo. Vote.” And it provides contrast to the incoming president, who encouraged chants of “lock her up” at his rallies in reference to Clinton and her use of a private email server while secretary of State. The difference in the two men also was on display Wednesday when Trump held his first press conference since late July. The president-elect jabbed at former and current foes, and clashed with a CNN reporter in a remarkable exchange. As he and CNN reporter Jim Acosta raised their voices, Trump repeatedly refused to take Acosta's question. “Not you. Not you. Your organization is terrible. Quiet. Quiet. Don't be rude. You are fake news," Trump said, taking umbrage with the network's Tuesday story about a document appearing to feature an intelligence community finding about Russian intelligence "cultivating" Trump for five years. In a scene not scene during the modern era, the CNN journalist told a president-elect his behavior was “not appropriate.” To be sure, Obama expressed plenty of criticisms of his Republican foes over his eight years in office. But, by all accounts, the man who will follow Obama plans to use emotional, bombastic, off-the-cuff 140-character Twitter rants where his predecessor often opted for Ivy League eloquence and speeches he spent days writing, and as his aides often say with a slight grimace, re-writing. Obama used much of his farewell address Tuesday night not to assess the state of the union but to dissect the “state of our democracy.” “Understand, democracy does not require uniformity. Our founders argued, they quarreled, and eventually they compromised,” Obama said. “They expected us to do the same. But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity. The idea that, for all our outward differences, we're all in this together, that we rise or fall as one.” [Trump Facing Questions on Whether Russian Intel ‘Cultivated’ Him] The speech was vintage Obama, a blend of eloquence, historical reflections, honest criticism of both political parties and a plea for all Americans to “help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.” From his pledge to publicly support any plan to replace his signature health care law that would be “demonstrably better” to his words about minorities to his call for all elected officials to “pay attention and listen” to the “middle-aged white guy who from the outside may seem like he's got all the advantages, but has seen his world upended by economic, and cultural, and technological change,” even his critics said the farewell address was a final graceful act for the 44th president. “America will forever be indebted to him … for the character that he showed, and for the class that he showed, and for the dignity that he showed,” Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman-turned MSNBC host, said Wednesday morning. “As a man, as a husband, as a father, as a person, in his eight years in the White House, his character was beyond reproach.” Saturday offered an example of how the 44th and 45th presidents communicate and view the office so differently. As U.S. intelligence officials, the Obama administration and lawmakers from both parties were warning about an escalating threat from Russia, Trump — much like a ratings-minded sports radio host — played the contrarian role. He doubled down on his call for warmer U.S.-Russia relations. But where Obama, the former constitutional law professor, would have started a lengthy lecture aimed at changing his critics’ thinking about what would amount to a 180-degree shift in U.S. policy, Trump resorted to name-calling, writing that only “stupid” people would oppose cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only "stupid" people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 After reports surfaced Tuesday that intelligence officials felt Trump had been “compromised” by Russian agents enough to be blackmailed, Trump took the Kremlin’s side and accused the intel community of leaking "fake news” to reporters. Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to "leak" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 In November 2015, Trump used a campaign rally to copy the body movements of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a joint condition. &#160; In July of that year, after Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., warned Trump that his immigration rhetoric was emboldening “crazies” within the Republican Party, Trump said the Vietnam conflict prisoner of war is “not a war hero” because he preferred heroes who didn’t get captured. Later, he singled out a female NBC News journalist at rallies, causing angry crowds to shout threats at her. Rather than focusing on policy differences with his primary and general election foes, he attacked their character with nicknames like “Lyin’ Ted” and “Crooked Hillary.” Though it proved effective in an age of social media, as well as cable news and sports shows that feature loud, lowest-common-denominator programming, few Republicans and Democrats found it presidential. [Trump Blames DNC for Getting Hacked by Russia] On the campaign trail, outgoing first lady Michelle Obama shared advice with Democratic voters that she generally only gives to her daughters. “When they go low, we go high,” she said at multiple rallies when discussing Trump’s brusque and sometimes-petulant campaigning style. After eight years of the polished Professor Obama, 62.9 million Americans seemed to prefer four years of the go-low candidate over the scandal-plagued Hillary Clinton. Trump figured that out and rode it all the way to the White House. And there’s no evidence he intends to stop now. When actress Meryl Streep, a Clinton supporter, criticized him Sunday night at the Golden Globe Awards, Trump could have done what most presidents have done: ignore her. He didn’t. He woke up Monday morning and unleashed a Twitter barrage that included calling Streep “one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood,” adding in his next post that the actress is a “Hillary flunky who lost big.” The two posts about Streep got a combined 59,000 re-tweets. Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a..... — Donald J.

We round up all of the rumours about a proper update for the MacBook Air in 2017, including its likely UK release date and tech specs, as well as rumoured new features. Here's everything you need to know about the new MacBook Air in 2017 by Ashleigh Macro | 11 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents UK release date Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? When was the MacBook Air last updated? Price Dimensions  Specs & new features When will the new MacBook Air 2017 be released in the UK? What tech specs and new features will the new MacBook Air get? Is the 'Air' brand being killed off? Will the new MacBook Air get a Retina display at last? The MacBook Air had an update in 2016, but it was such a minor and frankly disappointing update - merely including an optional RAM upgrade in the standard package for the 13in model - that we're looking ahead to the next MacBook Air update. Will 2017 see a proper update to the MacBook Air lineup? Or will the MacBook Air lineup be killed off for good? In this article we round up all the rumours, hints and clues about the new MacBook Air for 2017, including the new MacBook Air's UK release date, tech specs, new features, design, along with speculation that Apple may be phasing out the 'Air' lineup completely. Read next: Best MacBook buying guide | Best Mac buying guide | Best cheap MacBook deals New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: UK release date Apple hosted a special event on 21 March 2016, and ahead of the event we (quite naturally) expected new MacBook Air and MacBook models. After all, the spring event represented one year since both were last updated (or one year since it was first launched in the MacBook's case) and before that new Air models arrived in April of 2014. But instead, Apple used the event to show off the iPhone SE and the iPad Pro with 9.7in screen. Instead, we had to wait until 19 April for Apple to release new MacBooks and the updated MacBook Air. But the MacBook Air update was underwhelming, to say the least. While the MacBook got a power boost and a new Rose Gold colour option, the MacBook Air simply got a new 8GB onboard memory standard, and that's only for the 13in model. So when will we get a proper update to the MacBook Air line-up? If the lineup isn't getting the chop, we assume that Apple will stick to its yearly upgrade cycle and should release the new MacBook Air at some point in early 2017, possibly between March and May as has been the case in previous years. See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook release | New iMac release | New Mac Pro release | New Mac mini release New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? After the March event and its derisory MacBook Air update, and the subsequent Apple event that took place on 27 October 2016, it's unclear if the MacBook Air line will ever be updated again. No new MacBook Air was announced in October and the new MacBook Pro 2016 was compared in size, performance and weight to the MacBook Air. The new MacBook Pro is smaller in dimensions, and is also thinner than the existing MacBook Air, which was launched with portability in mind. It should also be noted that the 11in MacBook Air has now been discontinued, with the 13in variant receiving a £100 price bump - taking the basic model from £849 up to £949 and the 256GB model up from £999 to £1,099. (This price increase is most likely due to Brexit.) Some have taken this as gentle way of bringing the Air product line to a close, as not many people will want a costly Air with more powerful, and thinner, Mac laptops available. Following the October 2016 Mac event, there are strong suggestions that the MacBook Air line will be completely discontinued. This does mean that the entry level MacBooks are now a little more appealing, but does mean that a 11in MacBook Air will now be missed by some who were hoping for it to be replaced by a similar variant - we presume Apple didn't see a huge market for 11in laptops and thus decided to axe the product line. However, the 11in may not be the only MacBook Air to be discontinued. We think that Apple is about to discontinue the MacBook Air line altogether. Tech Blogger Jack March claims to have spoken with a source close to the situation who says that Apple is about to ditch the Air brand completely, including the MacBook Air and iPad Air products in its lineup. Right now, we think that Jack could be absolutely right. There are rumours that Apple won't release an iPad Air 3 now that the iPad Pro has a 9.7in option, and the MacBook Air doesn't seem to fit naturally in Apple's line-up now that the new MacBook is here and is thinner and lighter than ever. With the advent of the 12in MacBook and the 12.9in iPad Pro, it's no surprise that rumourmongers are starting to predict that at least the 11in MacBook Air, with a smaller screen than either of those devices, will be discontinued. The iPad Pro may indeed be viewed by Apple as a replacement for the 11in MacBook Air if Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments to the Telegraph are taken into account (published on 1 December 2015). Following the launch of the iPad Pro, Cook told the Telegraph: "I think if you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC any more? No really, why would you buy one? "Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones." However, should Apple discontinue the 11in MacBook Air, it does remove the lower price of entry from the line-up. But as mentioned, it may not just be the 11in MacBook Air that is discontinued. When the new MacBook launched on 9 March 2015, analysts began to suspect that the MacBook Air might not be around for much longer. "This wasn't the MacBook Air, but instead leaped past the Air," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "They kept the MacBook Air around just as they do with older iPhones, but the MacBook is now in the same position as the newest iPhone. That makes me wonder if the Air will go away over time." Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of US business for Kantar WorldPanel Comtech, also predicted a contraction of Apple's line-up. "All [notebooks] need to be more mobile, so something like the Air doesn't need to be branched out any more," she said of the differentiation Apple made for the line since its introduction more than eight years ago. "And it's to Apple's benefit not to have so many 'families' of Macs." More recently, KGI Securities analyst and Apple guru Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple is planning on launching a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in MacBook, which would serve as a replacement to the MacBook Air going forward. In a note obtained by AppleInsider, the analyst forsees an end to the meaningful development of the MacBook Air. Apple won't remove the line from its stores just yet, though - it'll serve as an entry-level device for Apple adopters, much like it did with the original MacBook before it was discontinued in 2011.  Over time, it seems likely that the MacBook Air range could be discontinued and eventually replaced by a Retina MacBook range at a lower price. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: When was the MacBook Air last updated? We originally expected the MacBook Air to be updated with a Retina display back on 9 March 2015 at Apple's Spring Forward event. And were quite surprised when we got something else: a Retina MacBook, yes, but one with a 12in display and a USB-C port (and very few other ports), a new strand of products for Apple's MacBook laptop line-up. Less glamorously, Apple's MacBook Air did get an update at the same time, with new, faster processors, faster flash storage and better graphics, and was updated more recently in April 2016 with increased RAM, but the screen and overall design remained the same, with no Retina display for the Air line. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Price The last time that there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (aluminium, then white and black, and then eventually aluminium again). These older MacBook models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air was reduced to make it the new entry level (when the MacBook Air initially launched it was quite overpriced for the specs, just like the current Retina MacBook). It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models eventually replacing the MacBook Airs, at a lower price, but for now that seems a long way off. The 11in MacBook Air started at £749, while the entry level 13in model was £849 - this has now changed with the 11in axed - making the new 13in model, with a £100 price hike start at £949. If the 11in MacBook Air is removed from the line up perhaps the cost of entry of the 13in model will reduce to the level that the 11in model is currently, with a rumoured 15in model coming in at a higher price at some point in the future. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Dimensions  If Apple does update the MacBook Air range, what dimensions should we expect? As mentioned above, rumours suggest that the 11in MacBook Air will be discontinued, after all, the 11in MacBook Air is both smaller than the MacBook and the new iPad Pro, and didn’t receive an update when the 13in model did. However, 9to5Mac points out that the new 13in and 15in MacBook Air models could be additional sizes to the MacBook range. That site predicts that some time in 2017 we will have just two ranges of Mac laptops: the MacBook at the ultraportable level, and the more advanced MacBook Pro. Maybe the 17in MacBook Pro will make a comeback too, with a 4K display. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Specs & new features These new MacBook Air models are said to be thinner and lighter, with internal spec enhancements. Apparently, the new MacBook Air will feature new batteries, cooling modules, and chassis, according to the Economic Daily News. We also expect to see USB Type-C across the range, especially now that Intel has integrated Thunderbolt 3 into USB-C - more on that below. Processors The next-generation MacBook Air is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors - that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But here's a leftfield alternative. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has posted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE", a chip family that is now supported. This isn't a chip that anyone has heard of, but it would make sense for this to be an Apple custom ARM chip, fitting in as it does with the company's previous naming conventions: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Those are iPad/iPhone chips, of course, so does this mean Apple is going to let iDevices run macOS Sierra? Certainly not - but it might be about to put ARM chips in the MacBook Air. Image courtesy of Techtastic New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: E-ink keyboard Rumours are rife concerning Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro and, more specifically, its OLED touch bar. The OLED touch bar is rumoured to provide contextual shortcuts to the user based on the application that they're using at the time - but the most recent report suggests Apple isn't happy enough with the feature. 9to5Mac and TrustedReviews report that Apple has been in talks to use a laptop variant of Sonder Design's dynamic keyboard technology. Sonder Design is famous for developing an E-ink keyboard, using E-ink to change the key labels on the fly. This means that the entire keyboard is customisable, providing multiple languages as well as contextual shortcuts from a single keyboard. It allows users that are, for example, editing in Final Cut Pro to look down at the keyboard and see exactly which tool they need to use without having to memorise them before hand. What isn't clear is how Apple is planning on implimenting the software, or which laptop it could be featured on, leading us to believe that it could possibly make an appearance on the 2017 MacBook Air. Sonder has confirmed that talks between Apple and the company has taken place, although it won't comment on whether or not it's a deal - it has only confirmed that it's "closing B2B procurement contracts" with three laptop makers. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Retina display When Apple updated its MacBook Air in March of 2015, we had been convinced that the company was about to give the laptop a Retina display. Instead, it launched a brand-new MacBook line that's super-thin, super-light and does offer that high-resolution display, but does that mean Apple won't enhance the MacBook Air with a Retina display in the future? With the 2016 update only adding more RAM to the basic 13in model, it may be the case. The suggestion that the MacBook Air will feature a Retina display has been long running but those rumours were prior to the launch of the 12in Retina MacBook and the iPad Pro - suggesting the sightings of the Retina display some thought was destined for the MacBook Air was instead for these models. Does this mean that there will be no Retina display on the new MacBook Air when (or if) it launches? If Apple wants to keep the price down maybe not. Or perhaps the newly rumoured 15in Macbook Air will feature a Retina display, while the 13in model will lack the high-res display, but come in at a lower price, one similar to the current price of the 11in MacBook Air. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: MacBook Air to feature USB-C port While we assumed the next MacBook Air would feature USB-C ports, a recent report from Taiwanese website DigiTimes seems to confirm our theory - if believed, anyway. The publication claims that Apple is planning to release a MacBook Air with USB-C ports in future, but doesn't provide a launch timeframe for the upgraded laptop.  "Currently, Apple has decided to adopt the USB Type-C interface for its MacBook Air, while Asustek Computer and Hewlett-Packard (HP) are upgrading one of their notebooks' regular USB port to the Type-C. Lenovo, Acer and Dell are still evaluating the option." The issue with DigiTimes is that it isn't always accurate - the site has previously claimed that Apple would start shipping ultra-thin 13in and 15in MacBooks by the end of Q2 2016, which ended in June with no appearance, although the site's sources have proven reliable at times in the past. So, how accurate is this report? We're not 100 percent sure, but we imagine that if Apple wants to keep the MacBook Air alive, this is the road it'll be headed down.  However, Bloomberg reported in August 2016, one week before the reported iPhone 7 launch, that Apple is preparing a MacBook Air update "as soon as October". This might mean that the MacBooks are announced at the 7 September event, but won't ship until the following month. This seems a logical step; the MacBook has just one USB-C port and the rumoured new MacBook Pro will also feature this connection type. It would still represent a bold move overall for Apple however - it'd mean all of its laptops would no longer support standard USB-A connections, a move sure to annoy a few people, but ultimately shape the future of mobile computing.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpad While this isn't a new patent (it was originally filed back in 2014), a patent application has recently been granted that allows the Apple Pencil to work with Mac trackpads. What is most interesting about the patent is that it depicts a more sophisticated Apple Pencil than the one currently available, suggesting that the accessory is due to get an overhaul at some point in the future. It even goes as far to describe the Pencil being used as a general input device like a joystick or an 'air mouse'. "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." What isn't clear is if the upgraded Apple Pencil will only work with certain trackpads - if this is the case, we imagine that the technology would make its way to the next-gen MacBook Air. Although with this being said, Apple has a habit of applying for a patent and then doing nothing with it, so it isn't set in stone that we'll be seeing this featured on the next MacBook Air - but we can sure hope.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Touch ID and Force Touch We expect this feature to come on the Air model - if it isn't already discontinued!  There are also reports to suggest that it'll boast Touch ID within its Trackpad, which may also get the Force Touch upgrade that was given to the 13in MacBook Pro back in March 2015, and comes with the new MacBook. Touch ID is the fingerprint sensor that's built into the Home button of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It's also used to make Apple Pay more secure and with the recent announcement of Apple Pay coming to Mac as part of macOS Sierra, this rumour makes a lot of sense. According to an Independent report, Touch ID for the Mac line would require a dedicated chip to be built into the device. The rumour started with Taiwanese blog AppleCorner, which cited sources in the supply chain. Apparently the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad may get a biometric update too, enabling users to make Apple Pay payments on the web, but both those accessories were updated alongside the launch of a new 4K iMac so that seems unlikely to happen any time soon.  We'll be updating this article as more information about the rumoured Retina MacBook Air emerges so check back from time to time for the latest news.

Thanks to its lackluster and outdated hardware, the Wii U is only capable of rendering games at a max 1080p resolution, however most of its games are simply rendered in native 720p and upscaled to 1080p.   Cemu can break that barrier thanks to the flexibility of Windows and the raw might of dedicated desktop-grade video cards. In fact, Cemu itself is quite intensive and requires dedicated GPUs and barely runs on integrated Intel graphics. Enabling 4K graphics on Wii U games was quite a complicated endeavor, and required the Cemu dev team to actually patch the game code itself.     "Increasing the resolution can only be done by patching the game code, or by implementing game-specific hacks into the emulator.   "For comparison, other emulators like Dolphin can just scale up everything by 2x and it will work (with some exceptions). If I do the same in Cemu it will break almost every 3D game since quite a large number of shaders rely on pixel-perfect precision and accurate filtering.   "tl;dr; It can be done but it's really low priority. Also note that MSAA is not supported yet, that's why some games look terrible in fullscreen mode.   "In other emulators Ogl is unaffected with new AMD drivers. Strange. Maybe Exzap will find out something about it.   "Other emulators also don't try to emulate a current-gen platform (not talking about specs & performance here, just pure hardware functionality) and in order to do that, Cemu needs to do a lot of unconventional stuff.   "Fun fact: Cemu has workarounds for bugs on both, NVIDIA and AMD hardware. NVIDIA recently fixed a number of those bugs while AMD seems 100% busy with Vulkan support. Guess in a year or so we can remove all the workarounds when the drivers have matured.   "Oh and before another smartass comes along and says "Why don't you use DX12 then? It has less bugs", the bugs are low level shader issues, they occur on all APIs."   The graphics packs for this emulator are now available for Cemu's Patreon backers and will be rolled out to the public on January 16.

Back To CNNMoney Transition of Power The wait is over: Trump finally holding a press conference by Tom Kludt   @tomkludt January 11, 2017: 9:04 AM ET Trump sets a date for a press conference President-elect Donald Trump is finally holding a press conference -- 169 days after his last one and more than two months after he was elected. But for as much as has transpired since Trump's last formal meeting with reporters on July 27, a flurry of reports about Russia are expected to dominate when reporters gather at Trump Tower on Wednesday morning. CNN, citing U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the briefings, reported Tuesday evening that classified documents presented last week to President Obama and Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Trump. A short time later, BuzzFeed published full memos that served as the basis for the allegations. CNN has not reported the content of those memos. On Wednesday morning, Trump said on Twitter that Russia had never tried to use leverage against him: "NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!" Related: Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him The series of events had some journalists concerned that the scheduled press conference might also be delayed following the latest reports on Trump and Russia. "If I were Trump, not sure why I'd take questions at a press conference tomorrow," tweeted Ian Bremmer, the author and president of the Eurasia Group, a political consulting firm. Related: Trump news conference takes on new significance Before Trump, every modern president-elect had held a press conference within days of his victory. Trump originally scheduled what he described as a "major news conference" last month, where he was supposed to discuss plans to avoid conflicts of interest related to his business, but his transition team postponed it only days before. Any further delay would represent another blow to an already reeling press corps. Trump's attacks on the news media, a hallmark of his campaign, have not slowed since his election. And besides the delay of the press conference, Trump's team has signaled a willingness to change other traditions. Related: 10 questions for Trump's news conference Reince Priebus, Trump's choice for chief of staff, said last month that the incoming administration could make tweaks to the daily White House press briefings, which date back to the presidency of William McKinley. For reporters, Wednesday's press conference will be a rare opportunity to question Trump, who has largely kept journalists at a distance since his stunning victory in November. There has been tension between the news media and his incoming administration, prompted in part by Trump aides promising changes to the way the White House interacts with the press. Trump may be questioned on the issue. Related: Will Trump's plan on business conflicts be enough? Trump has not completely ignored the press since Election Day. He sat down for an interview with "60 Minutes" that week, and later that month met with journalists from the New York Times. (He also held off-the-record sessions with executives from media companies including CNN.) Trump has also briefly taken questions from reporters at Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. This week, Trump spoke to the Times on two separate occasions. But a lengthy press conference will allow reporters from multiple outlets to ask detailed, probing questions; it will also give Trump an opportunity to reach millions of Americans watching on television. "This news conference is important," said Anita Kumar, the White House correspondent for McClatchy, who will be in attendance on Wednesday. "He has spoken to us briefly here and there but not in-depth." "I think it's important for an independent media to ask him questions and hold him accountable for his actions," she added. Trump relished press conferences during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. He held them regularly, sometimes even after a primary victory, and consistently made news with brash statements aimed at his GOP rivals and media outlets. Trump and his team even used to mock Hillary Clinton for avoiding a press conference. "She is so protected. They are so protecting her," Trump said in August. "She hasn't had a news conference in, like, 250 days." Clinton eventually held one in September.

The purchase price wasn’t disclosed, so it’s hard to tell how good an outcome this is for Apperian and its investors. The Boston-based firm had raised just shy of $40 million from investors, including FirstFloor Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, North Bridge Venture Partners, Intel Capital, and Converge Venture Partners. Mark Lorion Apperian will operate as a subsidiary of San Francisco-based Arxan and will keep its brand name and its Boston office, says Mark Lorion. He has been serving as Apperian’s chief marketing and products officer, but will now lead Apperian as its president and general manager. Much of Apperian’s team is staying on post-acquisition, although there will be some consolidation of back-office jobs, Lorion says. Apperian’s CEO, Brian Day, “moved on as part of the acquisition,” Lorion says. Day joined Fuze as its CFO in December. Lorion declined to say exactly how many employees Apperian currently has—it’s “several dozens”—but he says the headcount is lower than the 67 employees the company had when it raised a $12 million Series C round in September 2015. That’s partly because over the summer Apperian sold off a part of its business that was focused on government security products, Lorion says. (He says he can’t share more details about that deal.) Apperian was founded in 2009 by Chuck Goldman, who previously spent eight years as Apple’s senior director of enterprise professional services. He launched Apperian two years after the debut of the iPhone. Initially, the startup was an iPhone-focused software consultancy that primarily built consumer-facing mobile apps for big brands such as Timberland. But a few years in, Apperian shifted gears and became a mobile-app platform for enterprises to develop, deploy, and manage their own internal apps—a sort of enterprise app store that could provide the level of security that big companies and government agencies require. Apperian has been taking advantage of the shift toward employees and contract workers using their own smartphones and tablets for work purposes—the so-called “Bring Your Own Device” movement. Lorion declined to share Apperian’s sales figures or whether the company is profitable. But Apperian says it has enabled more than 2.5 million enterprise app installations to date, and its number of end users has increased by more than 180 percent in the past two years. Its customers include Ace Hardware, Amtrak, Land O’Lakes, Nvidia, and Nationwide, according to a press release. Before the sale to Arxan, Apperian had been looking for ways to bolster the security capabilities of its products and services, Lorion says. “One of the things we’ve realized over time is in the enterprise mobility space, more and more of the buying decision has been focused on security,” Lorion says. That led to conversations with Arxan, which Lorion says specializes in helping businesses secure their consumer-facing mobile and connected device apps, such as mobile payment apps and connected car software. “They had been getting questions about what they can do on the enterprise side,” Lorion says. “What began with interesting partnership discussions ended up becoming a walk to the altar.” Joining forces with Arxan should help Apperian accelerate its sales, Lorion says, thanks to Arxan’s deeper pockets and larger sales staff. Arxan has more than 100 employees, Lorion says, and is owned by the private equity firm TA Associates, which acquired a majority stake in 2013. “It’s great to see [Apperian] land in a good place,” Lorion says. “The future is bright.” Chuck Goldman Xconomy also reached out to Goldman, Apperian’s founder and former CEO, to get his thoughts on the deal. “I don’t know the deal specifics so I cannot comment on the financial aspects of the acquisition, but I am happy that we were able to create over 75 jobs in Boston and attract some of the very top local talent and from my ecosystem at Apple,” Goldman wrote in an e-mail. “It is also great to see market demand for Apperian’s platform and know that the team will be able to continue working together. … I poured my heart into the company, and I am proud of my work and the people who I worked with.” Jeff Engel is a senior editor at Xconomy.

It’s also a cause for some celebration that there was a record total number of patents issued in 2016 (304,126). IBM led the field in patents in the US for the 24th year in a row but, between them, the top ten companies, all technology companies (including the likes of Samsung, Google, Intel and Microsoft), accounted for more than 35,000 patents (11% of all patents issued). Apple was in 11th place with 2,102 patents. Which demonstrates all too clearly that innovation is alive and well in the IT industry. Or does it? If you look at it another way, it all depends what those patents have been issued for. Are they for real innovations or are they merely a means of forcing people to pay a tax for incorporating technology that they all would have thought of anyway into their products? Not forgetting their importance as a mean of making lawyers rich when the inevitable court cases arise. In other words, might we be better advised to be more circumspect about celebrating the sheer number of patents issued as an indicator of innovation? Given the number of law suits that patents can generate and the fear of being sued for potential breach of some very wide-ranging and vaguely defined patents that can act as a drag on innovation, should it be more a case of “patents shmatents”? Might the industry be better served by a reduction in the number of total patents being issued if it meant they were actually granted for recognisable technology innovations rather than as defensive measures intended to protect companies against their rivals or constrain competing organisations in their own product development? What if, out of the hundreds of thousands of patents issued every year, only a few hundred turned out to be of any real use? What would that say about the effectiveness of the patent regime? Right now, nobody seems to care. But, in many instances, the most wide-ranging innovation from the ever rising number of patents being issued is in providing more ways for the lawyers to make money. And that’s one thing you can’t patent against. This was last published in January 2017 MicroScope+ Content Find more MicroScope+ content and other member only offers, here.

Speaking to Tert.am, the expert denied the Turkish media’s recent reports that the country may embark on additional efforts towards strengthening state borders with other neighbors. “It is normally the government-run media that disseminate such reports; experience shows, however, that [such plans] are never realized. I don’t think Ankara now faces the need to further reinforce its borders with either Georgia or Armenia. Yet, the situation is absolutely different when it comes to the interstate borders with Turkey’s southern neighbors,” he noted. Armenia is a more proactive in control of the Armenian-Turkish border than Turkey. “And if we consider places ordinary citizens can visit along the Armenian-Turkish border, Armenia is obviously making greater efforts to control the border. Anyway, elaborating on the topic requires official endorsement,” the expert said.  Mr Petrosyan points out a need for practical steps, which are not among top border security priorities for Turkey, especially in the context of Armenia and Georgia.    Liana Arakelyan Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 15:48 • 15/01 Vote buying not to influence results of Armenia parliamentary elections – sociologist 15:21 • 15/01 Icredible pictures of city-dweller-turned shepherd 14:42 • 15/01 Armenia parliamentary elections: serious political stake expected 14:27 • 15/01 Lufthansa says no evidence of bomb on board Eurowings plane landed in Kuwait 13:30 • 15/01 Ringling Bros circus to close 'Greatest Show on Earth' after 146 years 13:11 • 15/01 Import substitution is impossible in Armenia-like country – economist 12:50 • 15/01 Bahrain executes three Shia men over 2014 police killing 12:25 • 15/01 9 ISIL militants 'neutralized' in northern Syria 11:27 • 15/01 Azerbaijan continues ceasefire violations 10:50 • 15/01 Brazil prisoners beheaded in riot at Natal prison 10:33 • 15/01 Israel-Palestinian conflict: France holds world summit 17:51 • 14/01 Fifty Shades of Grey may be turned into a musical (video) 17:31 • 14/01 SpaceX rocket set to return to flight 17:15 • 14/01 Fruitless talks necessitate ‘divorce’ – Armenian politician on Nagorno-Karabakh 16:33 • 14/01 Criminal mindset responsible for genocide, not Turkish people 16:20 • 14/01 Johnny Depp and Amber Heard finalise divorce 16:03 • 14/01 Nagorno-Karabakh never seriously discussed in expert circles – analyst   15:42 • 14/01 Serena Williams reveals her excitement to plan wedding to fiancé Alexis Ohanian 15:26 • 14/01 OSCE/ODIHR hails electoral reforms in Armenia 15:04 • 14/01 We need to make Gyumri more business-friendly city – prime minister   14:35 • 14/01 Air raid targeting IS militant kills up to 30 in Iraqi city 14:27 • 14/01 Mkhitaryan offers insight into Liverpool clash 14:13 • 14/01 Jackson daughter 'incredibly offended' by new TV movie's portrayal of her father 14:02 • 14/01 Turkey remands foreigners over Istanbul attack 13:53 • 14/01 Armenian politician considers cooperation plans ahead of election 13:33 • 14/01 Fire erupts at Germany embassy in Yerevan 13:22 • 14/01 Garo Paylan speaks of Armenian Genocide in Turkish Parliament 13:08 • 14/01 Zhamanak: Armenia’s defense minister most favored candidate for future PM   12:36 • 14/01 Trump open to lifting Russian sanctions if 'we get along' 12:17 • 14/01 Azerbaijan shoots grenade fire on Karabakh frontline 19:32 • 13/01 Cyprus talks: Erdogan dismisses full Turkish troop withdrawal 19:02 • 13/01 Germany invites Russian minister on EU sanctions list to G20 meeting 18:25 • 13/01 Extraordinary images show 'light pillars' dancing above houses after sunshine and snow combine to create rare effect 18:00 • 13/01 ‘Any violence simply postpones NK conflict settlement’ - Richard Hoagland 17:15 • 13/01 Atheist man shocked to discover Jesus in Ikea bathroom door 17:04 • 13/01 Numerous reasons for poor 2016 budget performance – premier 16:40 • 13/01 Turkey offers citizenship to foreign property buyers 16:26 • 13/01 Mkhitaryan comes first, second and third in Man Utd Goal of the Month competition 16:05 • 13/01 IOC disqualifies Armenian weightlifter 15:56 • 13/01 Human Rights Watch criticizes Turkish authorities in new report 15:35 • 13/01 Turkish Parliament’s microphone worth €15,000 goes missing after brawl 15:20 • 13/01 No unacceptable decision on Nagorno-Karabakh can be made – Armenia’s premier 15:04 • 13/01 Our economy in 'grave yet manageable situation’ – premier 14:35 • 13/01 No alternative political agenda in Armenia – Styopa Safaryan 14:25 • 13/01 Government needs to ensure effective management of resources – premier 14:06 • 13/01 Lexus unveils Sports Yacht packing in 885 horsepower and oozing style 13:51 • 13/01 Civil servants’ salaries remain problem - premier 13:14 • 13/01 Armenia’s human rights record uneven in 2016 – report 13:02 • 13/01 Numerous problems in public administration system - Armenia’s premier 12:31 • 13/01 27 years after Baku pogroms many problems still unresolved – ex ombudsman 12:19 • 13/01 Fiat accused over emissions software 11:09 • 13/01 Moon is much older than thought, scientists find 10:46 • 13/01 Armenia needs developed infrastructures to boost tourism – economist 10:05 • 13/01 Omen star who played devil-child Damien faces jail for punching two cyclists in a road rage attack 09:53 • 13/01 Azerbaijan keeps Karabakh frontline under fire 09:28 • 13/01 Haykakan Zhamanak: Ex police chief aspires for emergency minister’s post 09:08 • 13/01 Turkey, Russia agree to coordinate strikes in Syria 08:48 • 13/01 US Vice President Joe Biden awarded trust medal 08:15 • 13/01 Syria army says Israel fires rockets at air base near Damascus 20:03 • 12/01 2017 economic growth more important, Armenian MP 19:30 • 12/01 Smile, you're on camera!

A divided three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a lower court’s reasoning, but upheld its finding against a city law requiring the plant to pretreat its wastewater. The appeals court said the law could not be enforced because it breached a contract between the city and plant. In a partial dissent, Judge N.R. Smith agreed that lower court’s reasoning was flawed but said the circuit court was wrong to rule that the contract was breached, saying that should be a decision for the lower court to make. An attorney for the city of Prescott declined comment, saying he had not been able to discuss the ruling with city officials. A request for comment from Pure Wafer’s attorneys was not immediately returned Tuesday. The case centers on the amount of fluoride that Pure Wafer sends to the city’s wastewater treatment plant as a result of its process of cleaning silicon wafers for reuse by companies like IBM, Intel and Motorola, according to the court opinion. The plant “does a large volume of business,” said Judge Diarmuid O’Scannlain in the majority opinion, running 24 hours a day, seven days a week “at around 95 percent capacity.” The plant was owned by a company called Exsil when it opened in Prescott in 1997, after the two sides reached agreement on a deal for the city to treat up to 195,000 gallons of the plant’s wastewater a day. Under the agreement, the plant’s waste could not exceed 100 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water. The plant, owned since 2007 by Pure Wafer, has never exceeded the limits for amount of wastewater or concentrations of fluoride set in the agreement. But in 1999, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality changed the way the city measured fluoride levels as part of an Aquifer Protection Permit. It made the city take fluoride measurements at the point of discharge from the wastewater treatment plant instead of from recharge basins in the aquifer, and capped those levels at 4 milligrams per liter. “That was a big change,” O’Scannlain wrote, noting that the effluent was much more concentrated at the discharge pipe. The state reprimanded the city in 2007 and again in 2012 for high fluoride levels and ordered it to fix the problem. But the city said it would cost it $2.7 million in upgrades and $8.5 million a year to pretreat Pure Wafer’s wastewater to bring it within the new fluoride guidelines. The city passed an ordinance requiring industrial users to pretreat their water – or it would refuse to accept the water. Pure Wafer sued, saying that the city was in violation of both the federal and state constitutions on contract obligations, and threatened to close the plant if it was forced to comply. The ordinance has been on hold while the suit is pending. A federal district court agreed with Pure Wafer that the ordinance violated the Contract Clause of the Arizona Constitution by making the contract unenforceable. It issued a permanent injunction in favor of the plant. The circuit court disagreed, saying that the ordinance did not make the contract unenforceable, it merely meant the city would not meet one its obligations under the deal. The city never claimed that the ordinance would “relieve the city of its obligation … to pay damages or some other remedy as a consequence of its nonperformance.” But the appeals court went on to say that the district court had established enough of a record to determine that the city had, in fact, breached the contract with the plant. It sent the case back to the lower court “to decide on the appropriate remedy.” Web links: Pure Wafer v.

It's Getting Close Whether The OpenGL On-Disk Shader Cache Will Happen For Mesa 17.0 Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 11 January 2017 at 08:42 AM EST. 45 Comments While a lot of OpenGL improvements, Vulkan driver advancements, and performance optimizations can be found in Mesa Git for the forthcoming release as Mesa 17.0, one big feature that's still missing as of today is the OpenGL on-disk shader cache. It's getting down to the wire whether this shader cache will land for Mesa 17.0. The OpenGL on-disk shader cache is needed for better load times and more consistent performance in some newer Linux games that are heavy on GLSL shaders, such as Shadow of Mordor. This initial shader cache implementation though is just for Intel's i965 Mesa driver. While this shader cache for Mesa has gone through many revisions and been available in patch form for months, it's not yet in Mesa Git for 17.0. It's not clear yet if it will make the deadline: the Mesa 17.0 feature freeze is this weekend, around 13 January. The Mesa shader cache hasn't merged yet since not all of the patches have been fully-reviewed by upstream developers. While this is an important feature and puts Mesa one step closer to the features offered by the proprietary drivers, it just hasn't got enough reviews yet. Mesa release manager Emil Velikov mentioned this morning it would be noticeable to include it in Mesa 17.0, but first needs to get in the final reviews. We'll see in the next day or two if the on-disk shader cache gets merged for Mesa 17.0. Mesa 17.0 is supposed to be officially released in February, but if the shader cache doesn't make it, the next opportunity to get it in a stable release would be Mesa 17.1 in May. Also likely to still be merged for Mesa 17.0 is the Etnaviv Gallium3D driver, which has received reviews, and should hit Git within the next two days. 45 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Durkin | 8:37 am, January 11th, 2017 video   Please enable Javascript to watch. MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Wednesday has been wrestling with how to handle unverified reports that surfaced in the media yesterday evening, and cohost Mika Brzezinski called out two key media outlets for taking part in what she calls the same sort of behavior that many wrongly engaged with before the election. Before President Barack Obama gave his farewell address in Chicago Tuesday night, there was a dizzying array of reports regarding President-elect Donald Trump and his connections to Russia. First, it a four-byline story from CNN: “Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him,” from Evan Perez, Jim Sciutto, Jake Tapper, and Carl Bernstein. In it, CNN reports that both President-elect Trump and President Obama were presented with classified documents last week that suggested Russian intelligence had “compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.” While the report admitted that the FBI was working to verify the credibility of the allegations contained in the two-page synopsis, the CNN quartet reported that the classified briefings were presented by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers. The CNN story broke shortly after 5 p.m. EST. Then, at 6:20 p.m. EST, Buzzfeed’s Ken Bensinger, Mark Schoofs, and Miriam Elder published a dossier that has long been making the rounds within media newsrooms that others haven’t published due to their inability to corroborate the details contained in it. While it matches many of the details in the CNN report, Buzzfeed decided to publish the full 35 page document which makes “explosive — but unverified — allegations,” of the Kremlin’s support for Trump, in addition to sexual acts of a graphic nature. The Trump team has been vehemently denying the contents of the Buzzfeed report; even Russia itself has said it has no such compromising information about the soon-to-be Commander in Chief. And Brzezinski even admitted that Morning Joe‘s conversation, however circuitous it was, could be contributing to part of the problem. Brzezinski said Wednesday: “When you can triple-source it, and you have evidence, then you have story. Right now there’s no story here. And I think the people who are going with it at this point — and even if we continue this conversation, we’re a part of it — but the two outlets that are actually going with it and releasing it are continuing to make the same mistakes they made in the run up to this election: which is to let their bias get in the way of actually finding out what the facts are and putting them out there.” She continued in her assessment, “This whole thing has felt wrong from the beginning of this show.” Buzzfeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith defended the site’s decision to publish the dossier, writing in a memo to his staff, “Publishing this document was not an easy or simple call, and people of good will may disagree with our choice. But publishing this dossier reflects how we see the job of reporters in 2017.” Watch above via MSNBC. — [image via screengrab] Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com Follow Mediaite Follow @mediaite Like us on Facebook filed under Buzzfeed, CNN, Donald Trump, Mika Brzezinski, morning joe, t Around the Web Sign up for the Mediaite newsletter What's Popular The Blaze’s Tomi Lahren Addresses Old Tweets To ‘Give ‘Em a Little Bit Of Context’ Anderson Cooper: If a Republican Said About Clinton What John Lewis Said About Trump… House Democrats Walk Out of Classified Russia Briefing Absolutely Furious at James Comey Trump’s All-Caps OANN Tweet May Be His Most Telling Yet, and No One Seems to Care Trump Was Confronted About Sex With Russian Women in 2001 Howard Stern Interview Tips Have a tip or story idea?

ISLAND, British Virgin Islands, Jan. 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- XTC Finals - Necker Island - The field is set for the final round of Extreme Tech Challenge, hitting its last stop at Sir Richard Branson's Necker Island this February 2, 2017. Traversing a sinuous path to reach this final milestone including a highly-contested Semi-Finals round at CES® 2017, the Top 3 Finalists for XTC 2017 push the boundaries of technology into new frontiers of modern science. Having edged past twenty five progressive and worthy competitors from across the globe, the 2017 Extreme Tech Challenge Finalists represent an expansive breadth of industries: hemostatic solution innovators Cresilon (New York, NY), filament recycling startup ReDeTec(Toronto, CAN) and hi-tech aerial camera specialists VantageRobotics (San Francisco, CA). The Semi-Final round proved to be a photo-finish race for the finalists, who pitched their fledgling ventures live onstage alongside their Top 10 contemporaries under the glittering Las Vegas skyline. Impossibly close to call, the Top 3 were ultimately chosen by a collective of tech's most brilliant trailblazers. President and CEO of Consumer Technology Association Gary Shapiro presided at the helm of the judges' table, accompanied by Founder and Managing Partner of SoftTech VC Jeff Clavier, Director of Intel Capital Christine Herron, Founding Partner of Pacific Investments and Innova Capital Fund Veronica Serra, Founder and Managing Partner of Binary Capital Jonathan Teo and Founder and CEO of Dianrong, Soul Htite.  Congratulations to the 2017 Extreme Tech Challenge Top 3! Redefining the way military, first responders, and doctors handle medical emergencies, finalist Cresilon is a plant-based hemostatic gel that accelerates the natural blood-clotting process. Founders Joe Landolina and Isaac Miller are connected by one shared mission: to improve wound care and advance the standard of medical treatment. Producer of a desktop filament extruder and recycling unit for 3D printers, finalist ReDeTec creates novel plastic processing technology with significantly reduced energy and space requirements, freeing plastic recycling from the factory floor and making it a much more accessible technology for everyone. ReDeTec is the brainchild of Dennon Oosterman and Alex Kay, who deliver a free, safe way to recycle virtually anything plastic. Third finalist Vantage Robotics has created the best flying camera in the world, making it easy for anyone to capture stunning aerial video and stills. Their team includes DARPA Grand Challenge winners, IDEO alumni, and experienced entrepreneurs spearheaded by founders Joe van Niekerk and Tobin Fisher. Vantage's first product, Snap, is a fully portable, safe, and incredibly easy-to-use 4K flying camera. The Finalists will now face the most stringent and final round on Necker Island, pitching their venture to Sir Richard Branson alongside 2017 Finals judges including venture capitalist, founder and CEO of Breyer Capital, Jim Breyer, Veteran software entrepreneur and founder of C3 loT, Tom Siebel, Managing Partner of Aspect Ventures, Theresia Gouw, CTO for the Hillary for America campaign, Steph Hannon and COO of the iTutor Group Jerry Huang. Looking ahead to what awaits Necker Island, Finals Judge Steph Hannon remarks: "The discipline, focus and passion of extreme athletes is mirrored in exceptional entrepreneurs.

Dutch electricity company Eneco won a tender offered by NS two years ago and the two companies signed a 10-year deal setting January 2018 as the date by which all NS trains should run on wind energy. “So we in fact reached our goal a year earlier than planned,” said Boon, adding that an increase in the number of wind farms across the country and off the coast of the Netherlands had helped NS achieve its aim. Eneco and NS said on a joint website that around 600,000 passengers daily are “the first in the world” to travel thanks to wind energy. NS operates about 5,500 train trips a day.   One windmill running for an hour can power a train for 120 miles, the companies said. They hope to reduce the energy used per passenger by a further 35% by 2020 compared with 2005.

Its fourth-quarter 2016 consolidated revenues came to NT$639 million, hitting a quarterly record. The growth was mainly driven by shipments of USB 3.1 host controller ICs supporting Intel's Kaby Lake platform and its chipset orders from AMD for its Ryzen platform, which will be launched at the end of February, according to market watchers. Since Intel's CPU platforms still do not natively support the USB 3.1 technology, most motherboard players still need to procure third-party chips to add the support and ASMedia's solutions have been popular choices among the players. AMD's Ryzen series processors for the desktop are expected to be released in the near future, while the notebook version is scheduled for the second half and orders for the processors' corresponding chipsets are expected to gradually rise. ASMedia currently has several chips available including ASM2142 USB 3.1 host chip, ASM235CM USB 3.1 device chip. The ASM235CM also features support for USB Type-C ports.

The Cyber Investing Summit is an all-day conference focused on the investment opportunities and strategies in the cyber security industry. Separate panels will be offered throughout the day highlighting publicly traded firms and privately owned entities. Speakers include some of the most prominent cyber security professionals, venture capitalists, private equity managers, chief information security officers, technology analysts, and government experts. John McAfee founded McAfee Associates, the first commercial computer anti-virus company, in 1987. McAfee went public in October of 1992, raising $42 million in an initial public stock offering. By 1993, the company had licensed its antivirus software to more than 15,000 corporations. On August 19, 2010, Intel announced the acquisition of McAfee for $48 a share in a deal valued at $7.68 billion. Mr. McAfee was named CEO and Executive Chairman of MGT Capital Investments in 2016. MGT is in the process of acquiring a diverse portfolio of cyber security technologies. The company’s objective is to address cyber threats aimed towards mobile and personal tech devices. "We are excited to have one of the leading players in the cyber security sector deliver the keynote address at the 2017 Cyber Investing Summit. Few people understand the opportunities and challenges of building a successful cyber company from the ground up better than John McAfee,” said Specialty Investing Series CEO Lindsey Lachman. “Mr. McAfee’s experience founding McAfee Associates and taking the company public combined with his current role as CEO of MGT Capital Investments lends itself perfectly to discussing the future economic and security issues facing industry providers and investors." Mr. McAfee has an extensive and varied background. In 2016, he ran for United States President as a member of the Libertarian Party. He is founder of Tribal Voice, which developed one of the first instant messaging programs “Pow Wow.” Mr. McAfee was employed as a programmer by NASA’s Institute for Space Studies in New York City from 1968 to 1970. From there he went to Univac as a software designer and later to Xerox as an operating system architect. In 1978 he joined Computer Sciences Corporation as a software consultant. In the 1980’s, prior to founding McAfee Associates, Mr. McAfee worked for the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton as well as Lockheed. While employed by Lockheed, McAfee received a copy of the Pakistani Brain computer virus and began developing software to combat viruses. About the Cyber Investing Summit The Cyber Investing Summit is an all-day conference focusing on the financial opportunities and trends in the rapidly growing cyber security industry, which is predicted to exceed $1 trillion in cumulative spending on products and services over the next five years, according to Cybersecurity Ventures’s quarterly Cybersecurity Market Report. Panels will explore investment strategies, market forecasts, merger and acquisition potential, fallout from high profile security breaches, expectations for new presidential cyber security policies, seeding for startups, and more. Immediately following the panels, a cocktail reception will be held on the floor of the iconic New York Stock Exchange.

Peskov said the kompromat-related claims are "a total hoax, absolute fabrication and utter nonsense." Read alsoCNN: Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him"The Kremlin does not collect compromising information," he added. Peskov believes the claims are aimed at damaging relations between the United States and Russia. In his words, "the fabrication of such spoof stories" should be treated with humor. As was reported earlier, a dossier published by BuzzFeed includes claims that the Russian government has been cultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for five years — even obtaining compromising information in an effort to blackmail him.

My reaction then: As if that has ever ruffled Trump? The sex tape didn’t bother him, the foundation scandal didn’t bother him, the kerfluffle about $915 million loss in the 1990s and the effort to claim he’d cheated (which he apparently hadn’t, see here, the underlying article is back behind a paywall). Or more accurately, he gets all bent out of shape on Twitter for a few days and then carries on. Trump even casually creates “compromising information” like defending Roger Ailes, not distancing himself from David Duke, attacking the parents of the slain solider…the list is really long. BuzzFeed Posts Unverified Claims on Trump, Stirring Debate New York Times (furzy) These Reports Allege Trump Has Deep Ties To Russia BuzzFeed (UserFriendly). So this leak of an unverified report is kosher when Wikileaks publishing documents whose authenticity has not been denied isn’t? So Trump used hookers and the FSB knows about it? As if this would bother Trump? And prostitution apparently isn’t even criminal in Russia, it’s a mere “administrative” offensive. And this unverified report doesn’t pass a sanity test, which means someone should have sought more in the way of supporting evidence. It’s one thing to allege that Trump got a golden shower. But a golden shower party to destroy a bed? By a hotelier who (unlike a rock star) knows he’d pay for the damage and never be allowed to stay in that hotel chain again? When Trump has never demonstrated anything more than a belief that Obama was not a very good president?

The CIA is claiming ‘ownership’ of the statements. 4chan is claiming ‘ownership’ of the statements. I remember when 4chan was making these claims…. the counter argument (of 4chan at the same time) was that someone from the Trump camp was familiar with the story and going on 4chan to discuss. (If they wanted to discredit a distantly related story, exaggerating it and parking it in 4chan is one way to do it). If someone from 4chan created the paper (which look like they were typed at home) the originator could get them to wikileaks for publication (I don’t believe it would ever be possible to verify them). The people who are accused of crimes can easily verify they were not in Prague so they’ll still have a lawsuit and won’t have to rely on 4chan rumors. I have to admit, the story was incredibly juvenile (vandalizing a bed with pee pee) so that’s one point for 4chan whether they want it or not. Reply ↓ craazyboy January 11, 2017 at 12:41 pm The way I understand it so far, is some 4chan commenter posted a pee story he made up. Then someone copied it and it found it’s way to the “real” CIA intelligence report that we’ve been hearing about in our “real world”. (Putin double agents???? We’ll probably never know….) This was the classified report shown to Trump on Friday. Trump was reading about himself peeing on Obamas bed. Somehow. Then the report was leaked to Buzzfeed, I guess. What Buzzfeed did I don’t even know yet. Reply ↓ hahahaheeheeheeandacoupleoftralalas January 11, 2017 at 7:38 am RE: Buzzfeed: The IC just signed their death warrant by leaking that crap. Some of that information regarding the golden showers, and hentai pajama party may have been made up and pushed by 4chan- this makes the IC look like a bunch of incompetent morons. The establishment, and the Democrats, have lost their collective minds. One thing I admire about Trump is that he is willing to take on the IC. Now that their smear campaign has blown up in their faces, it has given Trump all the ammo he needs to paint the IC as incompetent and dangerous. Trump is going to take the gloves off. Look for a major purge in the IC in the first 100 days. Oh yeah, BuzzFeed is finished. Reply ↓ craazyboy January 11, 2017 at 10:37 am A million snowflakes cry out in anguish….

Reply ↓ different clue January 12, 2017 at 12:33 am Trump’s authorising Sessions to put Bush/Cheney/et al on trial for War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity would be the start of reversing the Cloak Of Impunity. If such prosecutions resulted in convictions, Trump Justice could then put Obama on trial for refusing to permit the prosecution of these same no-statute-of-limitations crimes. If that worked, then Trump Justice could start working down the various food chains and backwards in time to prosecute more and more feasibly prosecutable perpetrators. If Trump gave this order to Sessions, it would keep Sessions too busy to initiate his beloved War On Marijuana 2.0. Reply ↓ ChiGal in Carolina January 11, 2017 at 11:48 am Indeed, but When Trump has never demonstrated anything more than a belief that Obama was not a very good president? Trump demonstrated an obsession with Obama for years with his repulsive and unseemly birtherism, which along with other contributing factors has now rewarded him with the highest office in the land. Losing sight of this in our disappointment with the last eight years (couldn’t watch the farewell speech, I had such high hopes and am so disappointed and angry at where we are 8 years later) puts us at risk for failing to accurately assess Trump and therefore achieve a clear-eyed view of what lies ahead. NC has always been the definition of clear-(dare I say eagle-)eyed. Statements like the above hurt its credibility. Reply ↓ Unconvinced January 11, 2017 at 1:40 pm Second this. There is deep animus against Obama stemming perhaps from the mockery of Trump at the Correspondents Dinner event. Also, if everyone could get past the golden showers, there are less shiny (but much more meaningful) allegations of quid pro quo policy-for-money agreements between Trump campaign and Putin cronies. See pgs 7-8 & pg 30 for example. True, the one on pg 7-8 could have been written into this ex post facto since it actually already happened, but the Trump admin groundwork for the plan on pg 30 has been on-going… Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorJanuary 11, 2017 at 1:52 pm Huh? Do some basic homework. The alleged incident was in 2013. The Correspondents Dinner was 2015. And this oppo was shopped to the RNC and DNC before it was passed to the FBI. Both passed on it. Reply ↓ Unconvinced January 11, 2017 at 2:38 pm The 2011 Correspondents Dinner was the Obama roast of Trump: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8TwRmX6zs4 This oppo project was allegedly started by a Republican primary candidate…sure…and nothing was made of it…but the damning stuff doesn’t happen until after the convention in July. I could be convinced that the DNC would ignore these things since they were so confident of winning on the merits already. Why add this dirty stuff & have it possibly blow up in their face? Reply ↓ hunkerdown January 11, 2017 at 6:22 pm In other words, the whole “Russian propaganda” thing was really about the DNC emails and their conceits of liberal self-superiority and freedom from accountability. Thank you for confirming what everyone outside of the Democrat g(r)ift economy already knew.

Thank you for your work that I’ve followed for years. However, nothing to say about that? This is the relevant part of the post. I think it speaks to a clear and present danger to that website. Is is just going to be dismiss? Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorJanuary 11, 2017 at 5:15 pm “Clear and present danger”? Come on. And Trump has been ridiculed by New York Magazine since the 1980s. They’ve made him a pet project. They’ve humiliated Trump in his home turf. Graydon Carter came up with the “short fingered vulgarian” epithet. http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/10/graydon-carter-donald-trump They laughed at his gold and mirrors. They laughed at him being from Queens. They laughed at him for putting his name on his properties. They laughed at him marrying Ivanka (as in she was depicted as Not Classy At All). I could go on. Trump served NY Magazine by allowing the rising billionaires like Henry Kravis, who did all the right things in social climbing (marrying women who were plugging into the right NY social circles, giving ginormous donations to NYC cultural institutions like the Met and Moma, collecting good art, buying apartments in exclusive buildings like 720 and 740 Park) to look good by comparison. They celebrated them while making fun of Trump. Yet despite stinging Trump in a way that really hurt, Carter can’t point to Trump doing anything more than sulking and pouting and wanting the record corrected for years and years and years. And that’s been his pattern when attacked personally: ineffective verbal/written/Twitter responses directed at the person who insulted him. So explain to me: how the hell does have whores pee on a bed Obama slept in once get back at Obama? Obama never knew and would not have known, and it’s always been of prime importance to Trump to have the person who got to him know of his response. And that’s before you get to the fact that Trump knows enough about hotels to know the mattress was probably replaced since Obama was there! You guys seem desperate to buy any bad story about Trump. Go watch the many episodes of Trump talking to Howard Stern. He already said tons of stuff about his sexual escapades and lust on tape that the Dems were too lazy to use. It was a gold mine. Reply ↓ ChiGal in Carolina January 11, 2017 at 6:38 pm I think feox is referring to MY comment, to which you have still not responded. I said nothing about Golden Showers or Trump’s sex life, about which I could care less. I appreciate you not wanting to buy into the Trump hysteria but in presenting the BuzzFeed link you made a statement that errs in the opposite direction. Reply ↓ integer January 11, 2017 at 8:48 pm Trump demonstrated an obsession with Obama for years with his repulsive and unseemly birtherism Apparently the “birther” thing began with an anonymous group of Clinton supporters sending an email about it during Clinton’s 2008 primary against 0bama. Perhaps it was David Brock, as he was active on that campaign. Trump (who, it should be remembered, was not formally involved in politics at the time) picked up the ball in 2011 and ran with it, precipitating a significant ratings boost for The Apprentice. As noted by hunkerdown below, he eventually conceded that it was not true. There is a lot of “fake news” on this topic, but here is an article from 2011 that imo seems legit: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/8478044/Birther-row-began-with-Hillary-Clinton-supporters.html Reply ↓ different clue January 12, 2017 at 12:36 am Are you saying it was a false-flag beartrap set by Clintonites for Trump to step into? Reply ↓ integer January 12, 2017 at 2:20 am No. Three years passed between the anonymous Clinton supporter group sending the email out in 2008, which was almost certainly simply an effort to smear 0bama (as at the time he was Clinton’s rival in the D-party primary), and Trump getting involved in “birtherism” in March of 2011. Note this paragraph from the article I linked to above: Mr Trump outed himself as a “birther” in an interview on his private jet on March 17 [2011]. “The reason I have a little doubt — just a little — is because he grew up and nobody knew him,” he told ABC News. I would speculate that it is likely that once Trump started getting media attention after making the above comment, he embraced “birtherism” more fully as a way of getting free publicity (sound familiar?) for The Apprentice, which had low ratings at the time. While it was evidently seen as “repulsive and unseemly” by those on the D-party side of the fence, the flipside is that it likely improved his standing with, and visibilty to, R-party supporters, and played a role in the above mentioned ratings increase for his TV show. integer January 12, 2017 at 3:00 am visibilty visibility Of course, the battle between Trump and 0bama’s vast egos was clearly a significant factor, especially after 0bama roasted Trump at the 2011 Correspondent’s Dinner. dcrane January 11, 2017 at 11:09 pm Agree with ChiGal on the repeated point, which keeps falling by the wayside, that Trump did more than just complain that Obama wasn’t a very good president. His birtherism crusade was more toxic than that. Reply ↓ hunkerdown January 11, 2017 at 7:14 pm The “unseemly” birtherism that he put to bed quite finally during the campaign?

Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner January 11, 2017 at 9:41 am Clothing has always been an outward sign of class. Periods of egalitarianism move towards function over showmanship, and periods of growing wealth inequality move towards greater fashion variety as people strive to be noticed or want to announce their status. In Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, Sallah’s clothing indicated he was anti-English but pro Western and anti-Ottoman era which is why the Nazis hired him and he was friends with Indy. His choice of clothing was an outward statement of his politics. Iranians don’t wear ties for similar reasons.

I think the way fashion works is, the A-listers dress up and are the show, who’s function is to attract a paying crowd of B-listers, while C-listers are excluded to make everyone else feel special.

Reply ↓ Robert Hahl January 11, 2017 at 1:45 pm The Disco Sucks movement (and the Funk taboo, to a lesser degree) was triggered by a disk-burning event that took place on television at a baseball game in 1979. That was white backlash against the commercial power of black music. By 1980 the only black musicians who could get a major record contract were those who most white people liked anyway, e.g., Diana Ross. BBC Nile Rodgers The Hitmaker If you don’t believe the BBC, watch these two white Americans saying how relived they are it is legal to play funk guitar again. When the master allows, “funky man I am,” that is a race joke not a music joke. They are celebrating the funk embargo being lifted like it was a Cuban cigar.

The writer in Haygood’s comment below swears Obama’s speeches going forward over the next Friedman Unit will deliver for reasons left to mystery.

The fact that municipal bus services haven’t been massively expanded in recent decades is an embarrassing failure of public policy. Building roads or subway/light rail systems takes massive $$$ and long lead times as well. Buses can be put on the streets very quickly, dramatically improving the transportation landscape. Since they benefit not just the riders, but the whole community, free bus systems make enormous sense. And there are places that have free systems and they are very popular. Also, municipalities should investigate smaller buses that travel more frequently: in addition to fares, one of the main costs of buses are the time spent waiting. If you could go to a stop in day light hours and expect to wait 5 minutes at most, the systems would be massively more popular. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner January 11, 2017 at 8:27 am Bus ridership is often heavily African American. Could you imagine the Hillary primary crowd on a bus?

Here in Dublin the main bus company experimented with a route which goes primarily through very prosperous neighbourhoods – they invested heavily in nicer seats, free wifi, etc. But it was only a partial success. The irony is that it doesn’t just lose out to private cars – lots of well heeled commuters along its route go to work using the very overcrowded train service, seemingly unaware that the bus route is quicker and more comfortable (i.e., there are usually seats available even at peak periods, unlike the train). You can see the same thing in London where better off commuters stick rigidly to the Tube and train, when the London Bus service is often significantly better. Reply ↓ Synoia January 11, 2017 at 9:01 am Nonsense. London Buses are slow because they are stuck in traffic. The London tube is much quicker. If you wan to see London, take a bus. If you want fast travel take the Tube, Overground or DLR.

Reply ↓ Ivy January 11, 2017 at 11:00 am If you have to take the Jubilee Line tube, along with what seems like half of London, good luck finding a seat even in so-called off hours. Buses are useful and are one part of a transit system. Reply ↓ PlutoniumKun January 11, 2017 at 12:14 pm Yes, the problem is that people just make the ‘I’ll take the Tube’ decision without really looking at all the options. Some years ago I had to do a lot of survey work across parts of central, north and east London. Initially I was doing it by Tube and taxi, as most of my colleagues were, but when I started examining the bus network I found that in many cases it was significantly quicker to go around that way. On two occasions I had to sit with a Manager and HR, with maps, computer and bus/tube timetable to prove I was doing my surveys the most time and cost efficient way. It was remarkably difficult to persuade them, despite having worked everything out – perception is everything. Reply ↓ Portia January 11, 2017 at 12:11 pm I don’t know–when I was on the tube in London in 2004, I freaked out a couple of times when I was stuck underground for a couple of hours during a “terrorist scare”. I walked a lot after that, and took the bus Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner January 11, 2017 at 9:08 am Part of the American obsession with high speed rail is the best or only experience many had was in relatively lily white Europe between tourist spots in Paris and Berlin. They know public transit would be better, but they don’t want to slum or think about a problem. Congestion and most people moving is intra-city not inter city, so it’s not sexy. Reply ↓ cyclist January 11, 2017 at 11:57 am I used mass transit to get around Munich last summer and, although the U-Bahn was superb, the busses were great too. It seems like all the stops were stainless and glass with seats and an electronic board showing the time of the next busses. You validate your pass after you get on and the bus is underway (no line of people paying the driver) and there appeared to be a lot of express lanes for the busses. And when a street fair closed the major boulevard near where I was staying, every closed stop had a map showing where to catch the diverted bus plus schedule. I can’t think of such a well run operation in the US. BTW, where I work in the upscale suburbs of NJ, there are occasional busses to the nearest major city (a slow ride of about 15-20 miles) with an almost entirely black ridership. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef January 11, 2017 at 11:50 am How do we explain the snob issue? I am curious. Is it because third world cities have buses, but never subway trains???

Reply ↓ cocomaan January 11, 2017 at 12:23 pm The buses I’ve ridden in, say, Philadelphia have been filthy, the drivers overworked and underpaid, consistently off schedule, and the patrons sometimes on the dangerous side.

At the very least, the conductors will be nice to you if questioned. Everything people are saying here about buses being cheaper is true, though only if you want cheap buses.

Reply ↓ PlutoniumKun January 11, 2017 at 8:28 am High frequently bus corridors are vastly cheaper than any other form of mass transit, and as you say can be implemented very quickly if the political will is there. They are actually ideal for most US cities due to the generous existing roadspace and grid layouts. There are plenty of excellent models in South American in particular for how to create express high capacity corridors quickly and cheaply with enormous benefits for everyone. Its a terrible indictment of public policy that so much time, effort and money is expended on arguments over rail, light rail, self driving cars, big urban motorways, etc., when such a simple and affordable and proven mass transit option is available and staring everyone in the face. It really comes down to image. Buses are not sexy enough for liberals, not expensive enough for big business, and far too egalitarian for conservatives. Reply ↓ Carla January 11, 2017 at 9:44 am In my rust-belt city, bus ridership is now limited to only those who have absolutely no other transportation option. With each reduction of service and every route elimination, the number of riders has dropped and now bus patrons are exclusively the poorest of the poor. When it took me 2-1/2 hours to get home from downtown (a distance of about 6 or 7 miles – 20 to 25 minutes by car, depending on traffic) and I was warned by other riders to avoid a bus seat that had been peed upon–well, that was the last time I took the bus. It was at least 5 years ago. But I was grateful for the kindness of those other riders who looked out for me and my raincoat.

I’d also add that one key to bus ridership is access to the stops, and the land-use planning that provides enough riders within that walk. Without that key component (i.e. with sprawl rather than pedestrian-friendly mixed-use, mixed-income neighborhoods) buses, and any public transportation is condemned to red-headed stepchild status, and will fail miserably, and must always be subsidized. One example near my (sprawl) neighborhood: The bus stop consists of a sign inserted into a hillside so steep no one could stand on it. Pedestrian access? There are no sidewalks, only the gravel shoulder of the road right next to freeway-speed traffic. The buses are on three-hour intervals, so are extremely inconvenient. About a half block away is a medical office/health club that might provide riders. If the stop were there, potential riders could use sidewalks and would have a slightly wider road for the buses to pull out of fast-moving traffic. No stop there, though. Any wonder that Regional Transit rolls around a bunch of empty buses that always require subsidy? This is a system designed to fail….and working as designed. Meanwhile, in Brazil, Jaime Lerner, the mayor of Curitiba discovered that light rail was 1/10th the cost of heavy rail, and buses were 1/10th the cost of light rail, so he used money slated to provide that city with a subway (heavy rail) to implement a bus rapid transit system that tallies an estimated two million passenger miles daily. The buses are privately owned, but the City owns the stops and sets the fares. Rather than needing subsidy, this system makes money. Needless to say, the tall buildings are closest to the “Speedybus” stops. Smaller, feeder buses branch out from there. That’s the third world, people. If they can make it work, the fact that we can’t make it work means the non-working is by design. What would the auto dealers do if everyone didn’t have to own a car (the most regressive “tax” known to man)? Reply ↓ Tigerlily January 11, 2017 at 12:44 pm The efficiency of public transport is directly tied to urban density, which is a deal breaker in America, where respectable people live in low density suburbs and exburbs while inner cities have been abandoned to the untouchables. As you point out it’s not enough to provide bus service, the service has to run frequently enough to make it an attractive alternative to private vehicles, but that’s prohibitively expensive when user density is low. There’s also a double standard in financing. Infrastructure for private motorists is almost entirely funded from general revenue because “everyone uses it”, but mass transit is considered a niche that needs to be at least partially self funding. The temptation for politicians to cut public transport funding in the name of sparing taxpayers is ever present, which leads to cuts in service and reduced ridership, which is then used to justify further cuts in a public transport death spiral. As PlutoniumKun points out there are also strong prejudices against public transport, which I can attest to personally as someone who doesn’t own a car. Many suburbanites would rather cut off their right hand than endure the indignity of being caught dead on a bus. I also want to point out that buses are not a substitute for light rail or subways. Of course the latter are a lot more expensive, but they have a dedicated right of way which permits them to deliver very regular and reliable service, whiles buses are subject to frequent stops (every few blocks), road closures, and the vagarities of traffic and road conditions. Ideally light rail or a subway should provide the “backbone” of public transport infrastructure with buses covering the “first and last mile” to and from the backbone. Reply ↓ Erika January 11, 2017 at 10:40 pm Rail can also be relied on when people are thinking about giving up their cars. The flexibility of buses is also their downfall because a route can be severely cut back, rerouted, or be completely done away with while rail, generally, can not/will not. And it’s for this reason that a new rail line often facilitates new housing and retail development along its route while a new bus line does not. When my boyfriend moved in with me, he gave up his parking spot at work because there was a great bus route that picked him up a block from my apartment and dropped him off right outside of work. Within two months, our county bus service eliminated that route and the two buses he had to take instead doubled his commute time. This sort of thing is why I still own a car even though I hardly use it. Reply ↓ jrs January 12, 2017 at 12:18 am yes the vagaries of traffic and road conditions are precisely why someone would choose not to drive in the first place in many cases! But dedicated bus lanes aren’t subject to that.

From his recent statements, it seems that Obama and the mainstream Dems have finally, belatedly realised that perhaps giving the Saudi’s everything they asked for wasn’t such a great idea.

What I find interesting in that Counterpunch article is that it provides increasing evidence not so much of Saudi and Quatari malignancy, but their strategic incompetence. Historically, the Gulf States have previously been smart at getting the US to fight their wars for them and generally keeping pretty much the entire western establishment on their side through the judicious throwing around of petrodollars. But it seems this new generation are much more arrogant and significantly less capable than their predecessors. A combination of ongoing military disasters in Yemen and Syria, increasing Russian influence, a seemingly demented Israeli leadership and a very inexperienced Trump trying to reset policy in an anti Iranian direction (which of course may be opposed by Putin), all along with a deteriorating financial situation for Saudi Arabia – it all makes up for a potentially very combustible mix.

As long as the Middle East remains a place where freedom does not flourish, it will remain a place of stagnation, resentment and violence ready for export. And with the spread of weapons that can bring catastrophic harm to our country and to our friends, it would be reckless to accept the status quo.

For busy people who don’t have time to read the whole article, here are some pertinent paragraphs: ZEKE HAUSFATHER: Sure, so taking the temperature of the Earth is a bit of a challenge. It’s not as simple as just sticking a thermometer everywhere and reading what the thermometer says. The big issue that, sort of, NOAA ran afoul from the last few decades, was changing the way… or the way that we’ve measured ocean temperatures has changed a lot. So, back in 1990 we got about 95% of our ocean measurements from ships, particularly from ship engine intake valves. So, ships pull in water through the hold to cool the engine, and they stick a thermometer in that water before it reaches the engine. Today, however, almost all of our ocean temperature measurements, or at least the vast majority, come from buoys. And these are little floating instruments that drift around in the ocean. They take temperature of the top of the water. They sit directly in the water and they send their data up to satellites in real time. Now, the problem is, ship engine rooms are warmer, unsurprisingly, than the ocean around them. And so, if you measure temperatures in the engine room of a ship, you’re going to get a temperature that’s slightly warmer than say, a buoy sitting outside that ship will find, because it’s sitting directly in the water. And so, what was happening is, NOAA sort of smooshed together all of the ship data, and all of the buoy data, without any sort of correction for the offset between the two. So, you take a bunch of warmer data, you stick a bunch of colder data to the end of that, you end up with a sort of, spurious cooling trend, or at least a reduction in warming trend in the data. Whereas, if you just look at the ship data, or if you just look at the buoy data, each of them is warming apace. It’s when you combine them without accounting for the fact that each instrument reads temperature a little bit differently, that you get a cooling bias. In other words, they used to get ocean temperature measurements from ship valves that were warmed by the ship engines. When they started getting measurements from ocean buoys, the temperatures were a little lower, because they weren’t being warmed by engines. This caused a mistaken impression that there was a pause in the warming. The climate change deniers jumped all over this. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood January 11, 2017 at 10:27 am Heat transfer from air to a water pipe is extremely inefficient. A gallon container at room temp in your fridge takes several hours to cool, and that’s without any flow. With a substantial volume of intake water getting only seconds of exposure to ship hold ambient air temperature, its temperature change between the open ocean and the intake valve would be very minimal … probably a second-order effect at best. Verbal heat transfer engineering … that don’t impress me much. Reply ↓ Vatch January 11, 2017 at 11:01 am Nobody is claiming that the engines had a large temperature effect on the measurements, and he explicitly used the phrase “slightly warmer”, not “much warmer”. When they switched to using buoys for temperature measurements, there wasn’t a drastic change in what they measured, but there was enough of a change to give a mistaken impression of a pause in warming. Aside from that, it’s not just ambient air in the engine area that’s warm. Everything is warmer, including the pipes. Reply ↓ ambrit January 11, 2017 at 11:02 am Heat transfer from air to… Yes, the dynamics of passive solar water heating panels show this. The best ones extend the heat absorbing surface connected to the water column. I’ve helped make these through soldering flattened out beer cans to 3/8″ copper tubing. “Verbal heat transfer engineering” sounds like the credentialed description of political speechifying. No wonder you are not impressed. Reply ↓ PlutoniumKun January 11, 2017 at 11:58 am The new correction between ship intake and buoy data was of just under 0.1 degree which was sufficient to create the false ‘hiatus’. The problem was not heat transfer to the pipes – the key problem is that ship intakes have variable depths (usually 1 metre or more) while buoys sample from 0.5 meters under the surface – water tends to be a little warmer at depth. This was always known about, the question was always how to adjust the models to account for it. The ongoing issue facing oceanographers is that seawater measurements techniques have changed several times since the 19th Century – from using buckets thrown in off ships, to then using insulated and sealed buckets, to (post WWII) using thermometers in ship intakes, to now using buoys sending real time information. It takes time to refine the models to iron out bias from different measuring processes – this is a constant process and has been so since long term weather forecasting started in the early 19th Century. The recent adjustment was relatively minor, and would have been entirely uncontroversial if it wasn’t for the politicisation of climate science Reply ↓ craazyboy January 11, 2017 at 12:11 pm That I’ll believe. Reply ↓ gepay January 11, 2017 at 2:01 pm what exactly is Plutonium saying “water tends to be a little warmer at depth” My perception is that the water temperature gets cooler at depths. Are you saying the temerature gets warmer when deeper. The Sun’s rays are more so absorbed the sooner it enters the water but the water is mixed so in the surface meters the temperatures are not so different. So the report says the buoys measuring closer to the surface closer to the surface added a cooler bias. Since the buoys were more accurate, why weren’t the temperatures of the ship data lowered rather than the buoy temperatures added to unless somehow the sunlight makes the temperature lower the deeper one goes = The buoys were taking temperatures nearer the surface while ships intakes were variable and meters deeper – big ships little ships – loaded ships – lighter ships – varying from design. Shipping routes not spaced but skewed – much more time in the Northern hemisphere than the South – I would think the earlier ship data to be almost useless in its skewing and variability. So the data was mixed together in such a way that the pause went away. Makes me skeptical as to what any of the conclusions mean. The Earth has been warming since the Little Ice Age – my idea of worrisome climate change – not the less than 1oC, .85oC warming since 1880 – 2012 UCAR or .90oC NOAA to 2015 with their newly revised figures basically >.065 oC per decade over the last 13 decades. but but the computer models say man made Co2 is going to cause a catastrophe so the governments of the world should create carbon footprints for all of us to abide by – except of course, the military industrial complex – the biggest single user of fossil fuels or I’m sure Bill Gates and people like him will do their part – this is not to say we shouldn’t become more efficient energy users and move away from fossil fuels as our main source. even if there is no looming climate catastrophe – there may be one but man made CO2 is not going to cause it. Reply ↓ ambrit January 11, 2017 at 2:26 pm The concept of “tipping point” should be familiar to you. Reply ↓ different clue January 12, 2017 at 1:09 am As water cools down it shrinks and gets denser . . . unTIL it reaches 39 degrees. Then as it gets even cooler, it begins to re-expand again, just a little. Then when it freezes into ice, it expands quite a bit. I remember reading that somewhere. So water right around that 39 degrees level should sink down below water which is colder OR warmer. I found a chart giving density and viscosity of water from 104 degrees Farenheit down to 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

Reply ↓ PlutoniumKun January 12, 2017 at 3:45 am Sorry, I can’t quite find the link at the moment – from memory, the theory that the major source of temperature variation was from sampling depth was explored in a paper I read some years ago – this fed into earlier models at the time when buoy monitoring was becoming the gold standard for oceanographers. It may well be that the most recent corrections focus on engine warmth as a ‘new’ confounding factor as the main reason for the current correction. Its not my area of expertise, so I can’t be sure of that. Reply ↓ Vatch January 12, 2017 at 9:51 am Reality is complex! Each explanation for the temperature discrepancies may be part of the truth.

If all companies are made to clean up their own waste, then there is no competitive advantage to asking the public to do it for them.

How is that “diffuse? Reply ↓ gepay January 12, 2017 at 6:01 am No, the thermal energy of the Earth is not going up unless the Sun is putting out more energy. The climate scientists that believe CO2 is a pollutant say that the Sun’s output doesn’t vary enough to cause the warming. The lower troposphere is warmed because the some of the long wave infrared radiation emitted by the surface (the energy absorbed from the short wave infrared of the sunlight which passes through the atmosphere without being absorbed) is absorbed at certain wavelengths by the extra CO2 that people are putting in the atmosphere. This means it stays in the lower troposphere a little longer and so warms it bit more than if there was less CO2. However the stratosphere is cooled by the increase of CO2. so yes there will be a small amount of more energy in the lower troposphere. Plus the warming effect of CO2 is a logarithmic function so the amount of CO2 has to double (which hasn’t happened yet) to increase the temperature 1oC and be doubled again to warm it another degree. Plus there is the fact that water vapor is so much more efficient and so much more abundant – CO2 being measured parts per MILLION (a trace gas) and CH4 being measured in PARTS per BILLION (even more of a trace gas) – that in the tropics it doesn’t matter how much more CO2 there is. All of the alarm does not come from empirical observation but from global models of the Earth climate There is the fact that the computer modelers can’t accurately model clouds or evaporation or aerosols. ” Most global models have resolution too coarse to even recognize the existence of the Great Lakes, and some completely ignore the Florida peninsula.” Iowa State University However the regulation of everyday people’s use of energy will be an excellent control mechanism for The Powers That Be.

Another is to have your new Finance Minister, Luís Caputo, say: “Our financing needs are around USD $20 billion for this year… but sometimes there is a bit of confusion thinking that whenever we take out debt it is to finance the deficit, but it’s usually to pay off our debt payments.” So they need a payday loan to make their credit card minimums. Last year the Macri regime set a new record for getting a developing country into hawk by borrowing USD $43bn. This would seem like a conundrum to the uninitiated: if they are taking out massive debt in dollars (always a cardinal sin to take out debt in a foreign currency!), shouldn’t there be some sort of investment boom or positive economic indicators to show for it? Instead, GDP recorded its first year of negative growth (-2%) since 2000; industry and construction are down by 7.3% and 12.8% respectively; and unemployment has practically doubled, hitting the double figures we last saw in the neoliberal 90s. So one would ask why these blokes are so keen to take out debt in dollars, then one recalls that Macri’s team is made up of Caputo (ex-JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank), Nicolás Dujovne (ex-Banco Galicia), Luis María Blaquier (ex-Goldman), Mariano Federici (ex-HSBC)… and one gets an idea of why the government would rather have a self-licking ice cream cone of debt than improve the real economy of the country.

If it’s dollar debt at higher rates, or if they are extending the maturity of existing dollar debt, then it might be okay.

He walked them through Clayton-built homes on the lot, then into the sales center, passing a banner and posters promoting one subprime lender: Vanderbilt Mortgage, a Clayton subsidiary. Inside, he handed them a Vanderbilt sales pamphlet. “Vanderbilt is the only one that finances on the reservation,” he told the women. His claim, which the women caught on tape, was a lie. And it was illegal.

And, in fact, Obama ended up having a meeting in March of 2009 where he called in the top 13 financial executives of the United States, right from Blankfein and Jamie Dimon and the rest, all the way down. And they all came in terrified and, as one of them reported, “We would have been ready to roll over and do anything that the President had demanded of us,” and it turned out he said, “I’m here to help you. You guys have a public relations problem. We don’t want to see you nationalized, or taken over, or broken up. Let’s see how we can work together.” PAUL JAY: Yeah, in your recent article I think you quote Ron Suskind’s book where he says Obama apparently said to the bankers, “I’m between you and the pitchforks.” PAUL STREET: Right. PAUL JAY: “The unruly mob that might come and get you. But I’ll…” PAUL STREET: “And I’m here to help you.” And one of the bankers left and said, “We were all so relieved that he wanted to help us.” This is the quote, “He wanted to help us quell the mob.” And, of course, what followed in the wake of that was the continuation, and indeed the expansion into the many trillions of dollars, of the Federal bailout of the very parasites who had driven the economy into the ground, right? …… PAUL JAY…..And so, by at least managing the global capitalist crisis in a way that it didn’t become the Great Depression, he (Obama) did as much as could be done, given the circumstances. …. …… PAUL STREET: (laughs) Well, you know that may be the case and there’s all kinds of evidence for it, you know. And I remember in ’09, Obama’s former colleague in the US Senate from Illinois, Richard Durbin, throwing up his hands and saying basically that the bankers owned the whole government. They own the whole place. They own Congress. I remember Sanders, during the last Presidential campaign, the Primaries, pointing out that the Federal government doesn’t regulate the bankers. Congress doesn’t regulate the bankers — the bankers regulate Congress in numerous kinds of ways, including the offer of job opportunities for people who do a couple years in the Federal government and then go out and make eight times more money than they could ever make in so-called public service while they’re in Congress or in the Securities and Exchange Commission. ===================================================== So…..to have health care reform, you couldn’t because of the bankers…..

Reply ↓ John B January 11, 2017 at 11:33 am Re “Pity the Sad Legacy of Barack Obama” by Cornell West — A great article, but I wonder if it captures the full tragedy of Barack Obama. The country needed a leader willing to confront the establishment, but could the first black male elected president of the United States have been the kind of person who would attack the entire power structure? Remember, at the time, the Democratic party establishment thought (and still does) that Bill Clinton had been a very successful president. I doubt that a black man with the character of Jesse Jackson, let alone Angela Davis, could have gotten nominated in 2008. Even in 2016, Bernie Sanders got squashed. Obama, like Colin Powell, obtained the highest office and remained too loyal to the institutions of power. But they were shaped by American racial history; I’m not sure they could have been other than the men they were. I expect the next generation will have more fire in the belly. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner January 11, 2017 at 11:54 am If Obama demanded Congress sent him a bill with a public option in 2009, what Democrats would have brought out crowds bigger than Obama? Do you think Mark Warner would have stood up to him if every black voter called Warner’s office? Warner won by the largest margin. He would have sat in the corner with his tail between his legs if Obama told him to. Don’t cover for him. He was a popularly elected President with control over giant mobs who would wait for hours to hear a crummy speech. If race was an issue, he wouldn’t be President. He already won. Obama is still just a guy who saw Joe Lieberman as someone to seek out for mentorship. Spare he’s black and faced difficulty. Presidents have been assassinated and shot at. The Presidency is the modern Caesar. If his minded aloofness wasn’t ready for those Republicans to be gosh darn meanies, he should have resigned. Screw this attitude. Obama claim per the mantle of Lincoln. When Abe was President, the Congress was too cowardly to even stay in Washington. He should have tried to mimic an Era of good feelings President or something.

Thirdly, the Russian have been investing in right-wing groups in Europe(France, Austria, Hungary, Czech Rep.). They’re supporting the existing momentum not creating these issues, and not being able to confirm some interference is a destabilizing vector itself. The less related events in Ukraine, Georgia could also be considered as indirect evidence of Russia’s goals. Lastly, while it is indeed difficult to make sure we aren’t actually swamped with Western propaganda pointing against Russia, Putin himself made enough remarks over the years either actually confirming some actions or making it obvious enough that very likely there is intention and activity just as suspected.

The Panama papers, a huge cache of tax files leaked last April, showed that he (and his father and siblings) owned several offshore companies. He is bluntly applying the counter-Keynesian plan of opening the economy, reducing the role of the state, increasing foreign debt and creating unemployment to reduce the cost of wages. And — despite his campaign promises to invest — the latest national budget bill pushed by Macri and approved by the Congress for 2017 cut funds for science and technology by 30%. … Scientists in Argentina fear a repeat of the brain drains that the country experienced during times of military rule and economic crisis. … To complete the landscape of nonsense, the chief of the cabinet of ministers, Marcos Peña, attacked one of the fundamentals of science by saying that “critical thinking has done too much damage to our country”. He continued: “Some people in Argentina think that being critical is being smart. Our government believes that being smart is being enthusiastic and optimistic.” … Who needs the Chicago Boys when you have Goldman, JPMC and HSBC alums? Reply ↓ Oregoncharles January 12, 2017 at 1:45 am “Powerful storms head for U.S. West after thousands flee floods” This is weird. Portland is buried in snow; people are making igloos. Southern Oregon is getting the same heavy rains and flooding as California. But here in the upper Willamette Valley, it was pretty nice today; a few showers. The forecast is for freezing at night and sunny days. Apparently we’re in between two major storm systems. Not that I’m complaining.

The company had earlier raised Rs 251 crore from oil marketing company Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) for increasing domestic investment. With this, FINO Paytech mentions that reduced its foreign shareholding to below 50% to comply with the Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines for a payments bank. The company now awaits a final approval for payments bank from the RBI. According to the RBI’s guidelines, the foreign shareholding in the payments bank would be as per the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy for private sector banks. The aggregate foreign investment in a private sector bank from all sources will be allowed upto a maximum of 74% of the paid-up capital of the bank. Other major shareholders in FINO include Intel Capital, The Blackstone Group, ICICI Bank, the IFC and HAV3 Holdings. The transaction is expected to be completed by December 2016. The Blackstone Group holds about 20% while Intel Capital and IFC hold 15% each in FINO Paytech, as indicated by this Economic Times report. Other payments bank players: RBI had permitted 11 entities to start a payments bank and the list is down to eight. Tech Mahindra, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance company and Sun Pharma promoter Dilip Shanghvi surrendered their payments bank licence last year. Paytm got its payments bank license from the RBI earlier this month, while the department of posts will launch India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) in September 2017. Meanwhile, Airtel has launched its payments bank operations in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka.

The agreement was reached on January 10 as Gazprom Export CEO Elena Burmistrova met with the Georgian energy minister to coordinate the terms of gas supply across the country’s territory. Georgia has not purchased Russian gas since 2007, and Azerbaijani gas has met Georgia’s demand 88% percent in recent years, with the rest 12% being Russian gas for Georgia’s transit services.  According to earlier reports, Georgia’s Minister of Energy Kakha Kaladze was to hold meetings with Gazprom managers during his working visit to Minsk. Georgia was reportedly ready for concessions.
