They’re significantly faster, quieter, and more power-efficient. SSD’s aren’t without their limitations, however. Intel’s 600p series was a case in point. While 600p SSDs were fairly well-received as entry-level drives with good performance for the price, they were introduced with one major disadvantage, as Tom’s Hardware reports. Simply put, 600p drives suffered from stunningly low write endurance compared to the competition, a situation that has fortunately been resolved. In general, SSDs have theoretically shorter lifespans than HDDs, particularly in terms of writing data. Measured as Terabytes Written (TBW), an SSD’s endurance can be a limiting factor for users who run applications that write a lot of data such as in corporate data centers. When the 600p series was first introduced, Intel listed their write endurance at 72TBW compared to the usual 500TBW or more offered by competing drives at 1TB capacities. Now, it seems that Intel has made some changes to the series’ specifications, as the line’s documentation has been updated with much-improved endurance levels that are far more competitive. It’s entirely possible that Intel had initially listed lower endurance ratings for the 600p series to avoid creating overpromising to customers and potentially inviting warranty issues as drives aged. Whatever the reason, the 600p documentation now lists 72TBW for the 128GB version and up to 576TBW for the 1TB version, which is more in line with expectations for this class of SSD. As David Lundell, Intel’s Director, Client SSD Strategic Planning and Product Marketing, indicated: “Based on continued evaluation and review of the 600p, Intel has updated the write endurance specification to better reflect the endurance of the product at each of the capacity points. The initial specification was a conservative figure and with further testing we were able to prove we can increase the endurance limit on higher capacities.” If you’re in the market for a low-cost SSD that nevertheless offers decent performance for the price, you can now feel more confident selecting from the 600p series. You no longer need to be so concerned that your shiny new SSD will fail before you’re ready to retire the machine in which it’s installed.

What’s the best MacBook for your money? By Matt Smith — November 1, 2016 9:02 AM Subscribe to this topic Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here Dell XPS 13 (Skylake) MSRP $1,399.00 DT Editors' Choice Learn More Also mentioned Dell XPS 13 (Skylake) Apple MacBook (2015) Acer Swift 7 SF713-51-M90J Apple’s October 27 “Hello Again” event introduced us to the long-awaited MacBook Pro updates with the OLED Touch Bar and improved hardware under the hood. It wasn’t the gigantic update a lot of users were looking for, but it did bring the CPUs up to a more modern 6th-generation offering. We’ve only had a few minutes with the Touch Bar that replaces the function keys, and if you’d like to read up on that check out our hands-on. We’ll make sure to update this guide once we have a full review on the new MacBook Pro, which is forthcoming. For now, just know that the hardware update makes the MacBook Pros more recommendable. There’s now a huge number of configurations across five different laptop models, although all of the changes only affect the MacBook Pro, so the MacBook and MacBook Air are still jockeying for a spot in Apple’s modern computing line. The MacBook is thinner than the Air, but the Air is more powerful, so choosing the right system isn’t an easy call. Related: Looking to buy a new laptop? The answer is Dell’s XPS 13 Instant elimination Here are the five models of MacBook currently available, counting different display sizes as distinct models. MacBook MacBook Air MacBook Pro 13-inch MacBook Pro 13-inch (with Touch Bar) MacBook Pro 15-inch (with Touch Bar) While that may not look like a vast selection compared to prolific brands like Dell or HP, it’s fairly swollen as far as the MacOS world is concerned. Blake Patterson/Flickr Right away, we can remove the MacBook Air from our list of eligible systems. It’s not bad, but it hasn’t aged particularly well. It has a lackluster resolution of 1440 x 900, and is still stuck on the 5th Generation Intel platform. While it holds up the bottom end of the lineup as a budget option, it’s hard to justify at the price. You can simply get a lot more mileage about of $1,000 elsewhere. If you absolutely need a MacBook Air though, you can always buy a refurbished model at a discounted price. Related: Four generations of Intel HD graphics tested But if what you want is the thinnest 13-inch laptop available? Look no further than the Acer Swift 7. It’s currently the thinnest laptop in the world — about half as thick as a MacBook Air — and it’s got a black-and-gold style that’s sure to turn heads. Oh, and it’s actually on par in terms of performance, with a Core i5 and a 1080p display. Why not the 12-inch MacBook? With the MacBook Air out of the running, the real battle begins. Let’s start with the slim and shiny MacBook. You might expect the MacBook to easily walk over its older siblings. It’s slimmer, lighter, and more portable. Fanless and wafer-thin, the MacBook looks like a laptop from the future. But it has some glaring flaws. The first problem is the processor. Intel’s Core M is pretty advanced for a mobile processor, but it’s also meant for extremely slim systems that are often passively cooled. That means it can’t be as quick as its siblings, or it’ll melt itself into a puddle of goo. In our initial review of the MacBook, we found it offers roughly three-quarters the performance of a standard fifth-generation Core, which is two generations behind the most recent processors from Intel. Related: Intel’s Core M is efficient, but doesn’t ace benchmarks Then there’s the port problem. The MacBook offers two: a single USB-C for all peripherals and for charging, and a headphone jack. Because of this, using a MacBook with any third-party peripherals will prove far more difficult than with its siblings. There is one argument in favor of the MacBook, and that’s portability. It’s the lightest and smallest laptop Apple has ever produced. But even here there’s a tradeoff, because the MacBook is quoted at 10 hours of battery life, while the Air can last up to 12 hours and the 13-inch Pro can also hit 10. It’s easier to pack the MacBook, but it won’t last as long as other models on a single charge. Alternatively, you could pick up a similarly priced Dell XPS 13. It’s solid, professional, and comes with a slick display and impressive aluminum-and-carbon-fiber construction. It offers a similar form factor, high build quality, and much better performance. You’d even save about $150. Related: Apple’s new MacBook asks if you can handle a one-port future? What if you’re thinking of going Pro? Now that the two less powerful options have been dispatched, only the freshly redesigned MacBook Pro remains. The high-end machine packs in 6th Generation Intel processors, PCIe SSDs standard, and a Retina display in all models. In that sense, the MacBook Pro sets itself apart from the low-power options further down the ladder. Whether it competes with other systems in its price range is another story. The 13-inch version competes most directly with the Dell XPS 13. The slim PC is one of our favorite laptops, and unfortunately undercuts the MacBook Pro 13’s price fairly seriously in terms of base model, starting at $799 to the MacBook Pro 13’s $1,500, which is the model without a Touch Bar and only two Thunderbolt 3 ports. To top it off, the Dell sports a higher screen resolution, newer processor, and touch screen capabilities once the price reaches the same level as the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro 15 is in a better position, despite the higher price. Its most obvious competitor is the Surface Book Pro with Performance Base, which starts at the same $2,300 price point. The Surface Book with Performance Base once again beats out the MacBook Pro 15 in terms of graphical and processor performance, screen resolution, and of course is a 2-in-1 with a touch screen and stylus. However, the MacBook Pro models fight back with large touchpads, an optional unique Touch Bar, excellent hard drive performance, and forward-looking ports. It’s a very expensive system, and arguably not a great value. But then again, Macs have never been the budget option. If you want a Mac, the MacBook Pro is the one to get, and the 15-incher is particularly attractive. And the winner is… There was just an update to the MacBook Pro line, so if you really want something that runs MacOS, that’s the only system to consider. If you need a Mac and you’ve got the cash, the 15-inch Pro is the way to go. Its size improvements maintain its status as one of the slimmest high-end notebooks around, if you don’t mind a bit of touchscreen envy. Please enable Javascript to watch this video There’s serious hardware under the hood, too. The Retina display offers roughly twice the number the pixels as the Air, the processor’s base clock is 1.1GHz quicker, and RAM is doubled from four to eight gigabytes. The latest Pro also comes with the same Force-click touchpad found in the MacBook, two or four USB Type-C instead of just one, and the OLED Touch Bar, if you pay a little more for the privelige. Related: The new MacBook vs. the Dell XPS 13 — which is the king of portable laptops With a full suite of connectivity, high-end computing options, and a more competitive value than the smaller notebook, the MacBook Pro 15 is the best choice for anyone looking to pick up a MacOS laptop, who doesn’t mind trading value, and a touchscreen, for the Apple logo. If you don’t have that much to spend, you’re probably better off reaching for a Windows PC, or purchasing a refurbished Mac.

Where it goes from here will depend on how well the company's two largest businesses fare as 2017 progresses. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 9, 2016 at 1:00PM Murthy Renduchintala is responsible for Intel's PC and Internet of Things businesses. Image source: Intel.  During the Oct. 5 trading session, shares of microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) hit $38.31 per share -- a high it hasn't seen since the dot-com bubble burst. At this point, current and potential Intel shareholders are probably asking themselves the following critical questions: What is driving the stock to these heights? Is the current price justified? Is there additional upside to be had? In this column, I'd like to offer up some answers from the perspective of somebody who has held Intel stock for years now. What's driving the stock? Intel's business can largely be separated into three main categories: personal computer platform sales, data center platform sales, and everything else (Internet of Things, programmable logic, and non-volatile memory). The bulk of Intel's revenue has historically come, and still comes, from the first group. In 2015, for example, Intel's client computing group (which consists primarily of personal computer chip sales) took in $32.22 billion in revenue -- approximately 58% of the company's top line for the year.  Even though Intel has made it clear that it's building its business to be able to deliver some level of growth even if the personal computer market continues to decline, the better this segment does, the better it is for Intel, its financial performance, and ultimately, its stock price. I believe the momentum the stock is enjoying is driven in no small part by the company's positive earnings pre-announcement due to better-than-expected personal computer chip sales. Is the current price justified? As of this writing, Intel stock most recently closed at $38.07 -- just off of the new highs made earlier in the week. At that price, shares trade at about 18 times trailing 12-month earnings -- certainly at the high end of where it has traded over the last five years: Data by YCharts. However, it's not hard to argue that the company's prospects today are probably brighter than they've been in a long time. To start, the personal computer market looks to be stabilizing after several years of steep unit declines. Moreover, the rest of Intel's businesses have grown significantly over that same period, particularly its data center group, which means Intel is less sensitive (though still quite exposed) to potential volatility in the personal computer market. Image source: Intel 10-K filing. Intel has also ramped up its research and development spending quite substantially over the last five years in order to allow the company to better capitalize on new growth opportunities (though not all of them, such as smartphone/tablet platforms, have worked out) and to defend market share in its core operating segments. Data by YCharts. All told, I wouldn't hesitate to argue that Intel shares deserve the richer earnings multiple they command today. What does the future hold? At this point, current investors as well as potential investors are likely interested in the answer to our final question: How much, if any, upside is there left in the stock? I suspect that how the shares perform over the next year or so will be largely governed by the following factors: Can the company deliver on double-digit growth in its lucrative data center business, as well as its other (albeit smaller) growth segments? Will personal computer sales continue to be "not terrible" throughout 2017? I suspect the answer to the first point will be "yes". Intel's product portfolio in the data center market is currently strong, and I expect the company's 2017 product line will only strengthen that position -- helping to support both the unit growth and average selling price growth story that has driven this business segment for quite some time. Perhaps the bigger unknown is how personal computer sales will hold up in 2017. Predicting this market has been tough in the past, and we've seen situations in which PC sales will do quite well in one year (Intel's PC business actually grew modestly in 2014) only to crater in the following year (it then contracted significantly in 2015). If PC sales continue to hold up nicely, a share price of $43-plus (16 times the analyst consensus for Intel's earnings per share in 2017) wouldn't be out of the question. However, if PC sales start to reverse course, I'd expect the stock to stagnate, or perhaps even follow personal computer sales downward. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 8, 2016 at 9:35AM   Image source: Intel.  Back in 2013, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and then-standalone programmable logic chip specialist Altera announced that the latter would build its next high-end field programmable gate array, or FPGA, known as the Stratix 10 in the former's 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. This was something of a big deal, because Altera had a long history of using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) for chip manufacturing services. More importantly, it arguably represented Intel's first high-profile contract chip manufacturing win. The Stratix 10 ultimately saw delays and for a while it wasn't even clear that Altera would continue to work with Intel to build future high-end FPGAs. That is, until Intel bought the company last year. At long last, on Oct. 4, Intel announced that the Stratix 10 chip had begun sampling to potential customers. Better late than never In the world of high-performance FPGAs, there are really two major players: Intel and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX). Intel is mainly using its own manufacturing technology to build future FPGA products, while Xilinx is likely to continue to tap TSMC. According to Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, "history tells us that the FPGA vendor who is first to a manufacturing process node enjoys a market segment share advantage over the life of that node." Unfortunately for Intel, Xilinx began sampling FPGAs built on TSMC's 16-nanometer manufacturing technology back in the first quarter of this year. This puts Xilinx about a couple of quarters ahead of Intel when it comes to sampling an FPGA manufactured in a 14/16-nanometer technology. Based on "history," Xilinx looks poised to capture greater market share at the 14/16-nanometer manufacturing nodes than Intel.  A potential silver lining Although Xilinx was first to a 14/16-nanometer FPGA, it's worth pointing out that Intel claims that its 14-nanometer manufacturing technology is significantly ahead of TSMC's 16-nanometer technology, at least in terms of the density of its technology -- in other words, the number of transistors that can be packed into a given area. Image source: Intel. If Intel's 14-nanometer technology really delivers a significant benefit over TSMC's 16-nanometer technology, then perhaps the conventional thinking with respect to timing and ultimate market share might not hold in this case. Intel is sampling, but it's still a way off from mass shipments Generally speaking, there's a significant lead time between when a product begins sampling to customers and when final product is shipping in significant quantities to those customers. The delta between sampling and commercial, high-volume shipments can often be a year or even longer. I expect that based on the sampling timelines for both Intel and Xilinx, Xilinx will wind up shipping final 14/16-nanometer chips to customers first. However, if Stratix 10 winds up being a better solution, in terms of performance, power, and/or features, then Intel could very well be positioned to edge past Xilinx in terms of 14/16-nanometer FPGA share out in time.  Need to see better execution from Intel going forward A while back, now former Intel CFO Stacy Smith explained at an investor conference that the execution problems on Stratix 10 were due in no small part to Altera's "having some issues with current-generation products," requiring the chipmaker to divert resources from Stratix 10 to those other products. However, Smith made it clear that because Altera is now folded into Intel, the company will be better positioned to achieve improved time-to-market on future FPGA products manufactured on Intel technology. Investors will just have to wait and see how it all plays out over the next couple of years. But, at least for now, the first FPGA manufactured in Intel's 14-nanometer technology is finally alive and making its way into the hands of potential customers -- a reasonable start.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

It was thinner and lighter than most ultraportables on the market, and its refined design brought over some cues from Apple's mobile hardware. So it was only a matter of time before a PC maker took a swing at a similar design. Enter the ASUS ZenBook 3, a minuscule machine that promises to be just as portable as the MacBook while packing in much faster hardware. But while ASUS has proved it can sell powerful machines for far less than the competition, it's less experienced when it comes to delivering truly premium hardware. The ZenBook 3, while attractive on the surface, is a reminder that ASUS still has a lot to learn.

But the combination of a hard-to-use keyboard and trackpad, along with build quality concerns, make it difficult to recommend. Hardware At first glance, the Zenbook 3 screams luxury. Its aluminum alloy case is smooth and sleek, and it measures an impressive 11.9mm at its thickest point. I particularly liked the deep shade of blue and the gold accents, which are classy in a subtle way. ASUS's ZenBook line is unquestionably "Apple-inspired," with an emphasis on thin profiles and all-metal cases. But the ZenBook 3's design in particular looks like a mixture of the MacBook and the 11-inch MacBook Air, right down to the small notch below the trackpad and the look of the speakers above the keyboard. That's one way to evoke a premium feel, I guess. But it would have been nice to see some actual innovation, as with HP's sexy new Spectre. With a 12.5-inch display, ASUS managed to outdo the MacBook by half an inch. But Apple's laptop boasts a higher-resolution 2,304 x 1,440 display, as compared with 1080p on the ZenBook. At least it's a good-looking display, though; it's bright enough for outdoor use, while colors appear vibrant and mostly accurate. Though it's not a touchscreen display (that's to be expected with such a thin laptop), ASUS covered it in Gorilla Glass 4 for extra protection. After testing out plenty of touchscreen Windows laptops over the past few years, though, I'm surprised by how much I missed that feature here. While the two-pound ZenBook 3 feels light and sturdy at first, it wasn't long before I started noticing flaws. Applying a bit of pressure around the laptop's keyboard leads to some seriously disturbing creaking noises, as if the seams around the bottom of the case are rubbing against each other. It's not something you might ever do to your laptop, but this also doesn't bode well for long-term durability. If a bit of force from my hands can disturb the case's integrity, how can I ever trust it in a book bag with other heavy items? Then there's the keyboard and trackpad, which present a different set of issues. The ZenBook 3's buttons have more travel than those on the relatively flat MacBook, but the feedback you get when pressing them is mushy and insubstantial. Perhaps it's just because I'm a heavy typer, but I was never able to get into a decent typing flow. While I eventually got used to the wonky feedback, I still get more typos with this machine compared with every other laptop keyboard I've tested recently. Honestly, even though the MacBook's keyboard isn't ideal either, I still prefer it to the ZenBook 3's. The trackpad, while large and relatively smooth, is a chore to use. It requires a lot of pressure to register clicks, which isn't great when you're trying to balance an ultralight notebook on your lap. It would often get confused with left and right clicks, and on several occasions I had to press down multiple times for it to register anything. Tapping the trackpad to select things isn't great either, as it often moves the pointer off your target. And for some reason, ASUS thought it was a good idea to put its fingerprint sensor right on the trackpad. That effectively renders the top-right portion of the trackpad a dead zone most of the time. At least the fingerprint sensor works well; it usually gets me to the desktop in less than a second. On several occasions, I received warnings about Windows Hello being disabled because of too many fingerprint login attempts, even after I was just waking it up from sleep mode. I'm not sure why those errors occurred, but it makes me think that Windows Hello is somehow trying to identify fingerprints even when the ZenBook's lid is shut. (And that could be tied to the flexing issue as well.) You might have noticed one other nod to the MacBook: The ZenBook 3's only ports are a single USB-C socket and a 3.5mm headphone jack. At least ASUS was kind enough to bundle in a USB-C mini-dock, which includes an HDMI port, a traditional USB connection and another USB-C socket. Unfortunately, you can use the dock's USB-C port only for charging, which will make life difficult if you want to connect a USB-C device and an external monitor at the same time.

Our review unit came with a Core i7-7500U, which offers speeds between 2.7GHz and 2.9GHz, and 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM clocked at 2,133MHz. ASUS says it worked with Intel to achieve that memory speed, which is faster than any other ultraportable on the market. It even exceeds the maximum 1,866MHz RAM speeds Intel officially supports for its latest chips. The MacBook, on the other hand, is still stuck with slow Core m3 and m5 CPUs and a maximum of 8GB of RAM. Apple might refresh it soon, now that the seventh-gen Intel CPUs are available, but for the time being, ASUS wins the spec battle. The ZenBook 3 felt just as zippy as other high-end ultraportables. It didn't skip a beat during my typical workflow, which involves having several browsers open with dozens of tabs each, plus Slack, Spotify and Photoshop. And thanks to the video-decoding capabilities in Intel's new processors, the CPU usage managed to stay below 20 percent when I streamed 4K video from YouTube. Basically, you're not sacrificing any performance here. Battery life ASUS ZenBook 3 9:45 Surface Book (Core i5, integrated graphics) 13:54 / 3:20 (tablet only) HP Spectre x360 (13-inch, 2015) 11:34 Surface Book (Core i7, discrete graphics) 11:31 / 3:02 (tablet only) Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, 2015) 11:23 iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 2015) 10:47 HP Spectre x360 15t 10:17 Chromebook Pixel (2015) 10:01 Lenovo Yoga 900 9:36 Apple MacBook (2016) 8:45 Samsung Notebook 9 8:16 Dell XPS 13 (2015) 7:36 Microsoft Surface Pro 4 7:15 HP Spectre 13 7:07 Huawei MateBook 6:35 Razer Blade Stealth 5:48 Dell XPS 15 (2016) 5:25 (7:40 with the mobile charger) When it comes to real-world battery life, the ZenBook 3 also outshines some recent ultraportables I've seen, like the Huawei MateBook and the Lenovo X1 Yoga with OLED. It typically lasted an entire workday, and sometimes it even had juice left over by the time I got home. In our typical battery test, which involves looping an HD video until the power dies, it lasted around nine hours and 45 minutes. Given that Intel is stressing video decoding with its new chips, though, that figure might not be directly comparable to other ultraportables. I'll be testing the ZenBook 3 with other battery benchmarks soon and will report back with the results. Configuration options and the competition You have two choices with the ZenBook: the $1,099 model with a Core i5-7200U processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage; or the more powerful $1,599 version with a Core i7-7500U chip, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. The latter model was the one I tested, so keep that in mind if you're hoping to achieve the kind of performance reflected in our benchmarks. Apple's MacBook, which is really the only direct competitor, starts at $1,299, with a significantly slower Core M3 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Bumping up to $1,599 gets you a Core M5 and more storage, but you'll still be stuck with 8GB of RAM. If you can live with something slightly heavier, then you've got a wealth of ultraportable options to choose from, including HP's revamped Spectre 13 (2.45 pounds), the fantastic Dell XPS 13 (2.6 pounds), and even Microsoft's Surface Pro 4. All of those machines will likely get upgraded soon with Intel's seventh-gen CPUs, so it might be worth waiting a bit (or snap up one of last year's models if they're on sale). Wrap-up Ultimately, with the ZenBook 3, ASUS did what it does best: pack in plenty of powerful hardware for a cheaper price than the competition. But the company's inexperience at crafting truly high-end machines shows, with some truly worrying durability and usability issues. I give ASUS credit for building such a thin and powerful device, but what does that matter if the keyboard and trackpad are a pain to use?

Linux Kernel 4.7.7 Has NFS Improvements, Updated Wireless and InfiniBand Drivers GO All users of the Linux 4.7 kernel branch are urged to update Oct 9, 2016 21:50 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  After announcing the imminent release of Linux kernel 4.8.1, as well as the availability of Linux kernel 4.4.24 LTS, Greg Kroah-Hartman has informed the community about the launch of the seventh maintenance update to the Linux 4.7 kernel series. That's right, Linux kernel 4.7.7 is now here for those of you who are still using the Linux 4.7 kernel branch in your GNU/Linux distributions, and according to the appended shortlog and the diff from the previous maintenance update, namely Linux kernel 4.7.6, the new version changes a total of 142 files, with 852 insertions and 490 deletions, which means that it's a pretty hefty release. "I'm announcing the release of the 4.7.7 kernel. All users of the 4.7 kernel series must upgrade," says Greg Kroah-Hartman. "The updated 4.7.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-4.7.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=summary." Here's what's new in Linux kernel 4.7.7 As mentioned before, Linux kernel 4.7.7 comes with many improvements, including a large number of updated wireless drivers (Broadcom, Intel, Marvell), as well as enhancements for Ethernet (Intel), InfiniBand, MMC, MTD, MD, GPU (Radeon, Nouveau), DMA, I2C, GPIO, hwmon, IRQ Chip, NFC, PCMCIA, PINCTRL, SCSI, USB, and Watchdog. It also adds minor enhancements to the NFS and Ceph filesystems. Moreover, the Linux 4.7.7 kernel brings an updated networking stack with B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced, Bluetooth, mac80211, and SunRPC changes, an updated sound stack with Intel Skylake, HDA, and OMAP improvements, various fixes to the ARM, ARM64 (AArch64), AVR32, MIPS, PowerPC (PPC), x86, and Tile hardware architectures, as well as the usual core kernel and mm bugfixes. If you're using a GNU/Linux distribution powered by a kernel from the Linux 4.7 series, you are urged to update to Linux kernel 4.7.7 as soon as possible. OS vendors and kernel maintainers can download the sources of the Linux 4.7.7 kernel right now via our website or directly from kernel.org.

Lasta Oct 9, 2016 | 7:46 AM Many Apple fans expected that the MacBook Pro 2016 will be unveiled at the same time as the iPhone 7 was launched last September. That didn't happen apparently, much to the dismay of fans waiting for the latest edition of the laptop. In fact, the company hasn't even mentioned anything about a new version of the MacBook Pro. That's not to keep people from writing about MacBook Pro 2016 rumors regarding the specs, dimensions and features of the device. Here are some of them. New Features TechRadar says the MacBook Pro 2016 will run on SkyLake processors. These processors were developed by Intel back in 2015; a microarchitecture redesign over the previous Broadwell architecture. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit A new feature that is said to debut in the 2016 MacBook Pro is the OLED panel which will replace the physical function buttons at the top of the keyboard. The panel is also rumored to be fully customizable, which means that instead of function keys, the panel can show shortcut symbols to your favorite apps, for example. The Macbook Pro 2016 is also rumored to feature TouchID, which means fingerprint security may be available for this latest MacBook, much like the latest iPhone. MacBook Pro 2016 will also have a slimmer and sleeker design. This is according to Ming-Chi Kuo, KGI Securities analyst. He said Apple will use specialized hinges for this to happen. The sleeker design will come from "shallower curves around the edges," according to Tech Times. Specs The MacBook Pro 2016 will have a 15-inch 5K Apple display (equivalent to 5120 x 2880 screen resolution) and will come in various colors. It will also have the Lightning port for audio and four USB-C ports. It will also have AMD Polaris GPUs. The MacBook Pro 2016 is also rumored to have a 13-inch variation. Rescheduled Apple Event The rumored launch date of the MacBook Pro 2016 was set at an October event. However, Apple announced that this event will be moved at a later date because they re-scheduled their 4th quarter earnings call. Along with the announcement of the MacBook Pro 2016, it was also rumored that Apple was supposed to announce other products and product upgrades. The launching date could be moved next month, November, and rumors have already surfaced that the MacBook Pro will be launched by then. Price The MacBook Pro 2016 is rumored to be worth at least $1099 for the 13-inch variation, and $2,099 for the 15-inch; pretty hefty prices but with all its rumored features on hand, that may be justified.

View Latest Posts >>> American Un-exceptionalism Laid Bare By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on October 9, 2016 Syria: American Un-exceptionalism Laid Bare “Never think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how justified, is not a crime.” ― Ernest Hemingway by  Jim W. Dean, VT Editor     … with  New Eastern Outlook, Moscow – First published  …  October 9, 2016 – Damascus is not risking their soldiers lives to kill civilians who are no threat, but these guys Like the terrorist that sends an anonymous threat, the US current psyop against the Syrian anti-terrorism campaign has utilized anonymous sources to report that Washington is considering “limited” attacks on Syrian and Russian forces to encourage them to break off their driving the Western backed terrorists out of Aleppo. You just can’t make this stuff up. Because such attacks would be illegal without a UN resolution, something impossible with Russian and Chinese vetoes, that speed bump would be overcome by using “covert” airstrikes. A quick Veterans Today survey of retired Intel pros showed a consensus that this was one of the dumbest ideas by a US government since the Bush(43) gangsters went into Iraq to get Saddam’s nukes and chemical weapons, which he did not have. The Pentagon-CIA pitch was that such strikes would drive Assad to the negotiation table. We call this the language of lunatics, who want to start a war because they feel impervious to being labeled the wanton aggressor. They are lunatic supremacists, a term I just invented. We have been watching the war of words built up to these overt threats over the past two weeks. The US ended all pretense of seeking a Syrian war resolution by announcing it would discontinue joint efforts with Russia in Geneva. To embarrass the country even more, US officials once again attempted to blame the failure on Russia by claiming it was violating the ceasefire with its bombing missions to support ending the terror siege in East Aleppo. This ten year old girl was shot by a sniper in the Damascus suburbs, compliments of US regime change terror that continually blames Assad for it all These officials ignored the simple fact that the ceasefire expired after the first week, so the Syrian coalition could not have broken it by acts taken afterwards. I would not have used the harsh term un-exceptionalism if the ceasefire had simply failed. It did not. It was strangled by those that wanted to kill it – by the Jihadis, their Gulf State supporters, the Pentagon, and how much by Obama and Kerry we can’t be sure at this point because they clearly have factions inside the government opposed to any non-US dominated outcome. When Obama did not ask for someone’s head from the Pentagon for the Deir Ezzor bombing of the Syrian troops there, he effectively put his seal of approval on the act, adding another unexceptional stain to his record. He allowed his administration to instantly blame the Syrian coalition for the nighttime attack on the aid convoy on the testimony only of the pro-insurgent White Hat relief group, when his own Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff told Congress that he had no evidence of Russian involvement. General Dunford lied by omission because he knew that the Syrian Airforce was not equipped for night strikes, and that, with the US total battlefield surveillance, he knew exactly where every Russian plane flew, and would have shared the radar plot of alleged Russian involvement, which he did not. That again was very unexceptional. John Kerry did not miss getting on this bandwagon either. He made the mistake of having a frank talk with an insurgent group on the sidelines of the UN conference in New York, where it was taped. “We don’t have a basis (to intervene), our lawyers tell us, unless we have a UN Security Council Resolution which the Russians can veto or unless we are under attack from folks or unless we are invited in. Russia is invited in by the legitimate regime,” said Kerry. Oops! That was followed my screams from Western media that Assad was guilty of war crimes for doing the same kind of decapitation precision strikes inside the city to “degrade” the jihadi command structure that the US has claimed it was doing. Obama’s own spokespeople joined in the invective language piled onto Syria and Russia, including the UN’s Samantha Power. That was very unexceptional. General Dunford is riding the wind on US keeping the military involved with regime change without too much blowback State Department scamsters had invented their own legal cover, that the reported attacks by Syria on the civilians in East Aleppo invalidated Assad’s legitimacy under international law doctrine known as the “right to protect”. The problem with that is the accused Syrian regime is a member in good standing with the UN, and no move has been made to change that. What has happened is the US has attacked and killed countless Syrians via its proxy terror war, thus making it guilty of breaking its own standards, or lack thereof. When the subject of reparations comes up when the Syrian War is over, we will not need Mr. Kerry as a witness, because we already have the Nuremberg precedent for “waging an offensive war”. And we have the statutes world over for “aiding and abetting” terrorism that are the golden keys to making a case for rebuilding Syria paid for by those who are guilty of destroying it. The governments will hide behind their sovereign immunity. Their outside contractors that do the dirty work will close their front corporations down, leaving them empty for anyone looking for money later on. But NGOs, many of them up to their eyeballs in supporting terrorism, do not have that golden parachute to protect them, or enough money worth going after, so they are safe in that regard. Where pocketbooks cannot be made to suffer for endless crimes committed in Syria, then reputations certainly can. The US has been wrecking its own. The CIA could not carry the total logistics support load for the Syrian jihadis, so the military was the only place to turn to for training. The Blackwater-type companies have been very busy throughout Obama’s term, handling the War “of” Terror. The Pentagon’s reputation took another big hit this week when the Bureau of Investigative Journalism presented its well-documented investigative report on a massive disinformation campaign upon the world public, especially here in the US. It is against US law for the government to propagandize its own people, a law that has been routinely ignored using thinly veiled legal ruses, like hiring a foreign contractor to do the work. The Bureau found the UK firm, Bell Pottinger, got $660 million in contracts from 2006 to 2011. That huge amount has a strong whiff of a CIA front operation, where much of that money went to fund all kinds of other operations, easily done when they are classified at the time. While our children were being taught the fairy tale of the American democratic model of “government by the people and for the people”, we had their parents’ taxes going to fund just the opposite, a total control and manipulation system that one would expect from an occupying army after having lost a war. This unexceptional behavior may have started under Bush (43), but it was carried on in its shape-shifting forms with Obama, as Ash Carter and John Brennan were carry overs from Bush. Where the Syria war will go from here is anyone’s guess. We have seen the all too familiar demonization campaigns against both Syria and Russia being rolled out — the kind historically used to justify military interventions. I can’t see Obama doing something like this on the eve of a presidential election. But I can see him setting Hillary up, hoping that not only will she win, but that the current hawks in the Pentagon will be more than willing to head up more aggressive US involvement. There is not much to save in Aleppo. The city is basically destroyed, Erdogan’s hoodlums having looted all the factories early on, moving them lock, stock and barrel to the new Turkish proprietors, supporters of his own party. Terror shelling of civilians has been a Kiev practice accepted by its Western backers As the US failure in Ukraine becomes more evident, Washington could become desperate for a “save the world“ diversion. We are getting intel reports of a wave of terror being planned for Europe, a Gladio tool useful to those who see the devolution of the EU on the horizon. Hungary is already talking about an East European sub-union within the EU. No one will say it, but the Jim Dean concept of “Redo the EU” is slowly easing itself unto the table. As Britain and the EU hammer out their divorce settlement, I predict the demands to reform the EU will keep growing. The talk of its just going away is just silly. The EU will go through some kind of a transformation. That could be a destructive process, but certainly not its intent. Europe does not want to go through a three or four year property distribution settlement with the Brits, only to have a couple more countries lined up for their turn at the exit. Chaos theory has been let loose upon us, the modern Frankenstein of our time. As to the chances of a peaceful resolution for all of these conflicts, I would not bet a dime. John Donne the poet, knew about this when he wrote, “Do not ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.” __________ Jim W.

If they don’t want it in their airspace its toast. Unlike the US and Saudi regime Russia knows what is a hospital, school, or quiet suburban neighborhood. The excuse that these places are traditionally used to hold terrorist stuff does not excuse civilian casualties and should never have been tolerated. Committing inhumane acts of wiping out neighborhoods for a few “suspects”? I know this occurred in Vietnam because I saw the news footage before it was censored. Its one of the reasons people were in the streets demanding it to stop. Where is the noise? Log in to Reply Amelius  October 10, 2016 at 10:16 am Very well done. Thank you Mr. Dean.

Log in to Reply roger  October 9, 2016 at 8:06 pm Excellent Jim. 100% Ok on the assessment, now we need the medicament. Edward Longshanks has a point. As the Roman Empire, with the Jewish advice, ruled the World on its time, the following British Empire expanded .what the Romans conquered also, under Jewish influence reached Balfour. US replaced and perfected the British Empire, as being the Masonry ointed one to carry on the following step, the foundation of Israel; all being the long march of History according (but the names) to the Holy Book, as it is the End. The domestic and overseas US policies were designed from the onset to have a unipolar World domination target. Beggining with challenging British pound and its backbone, the Royal Navy, which were replaced in time by the very kosher dollar and the zionistic bisexual Pentagon. What happened to Americans in XIX, XX or XXI centuries has been preplanned in advance according to boresighted rabbinical designs, in compliance with everyone and single American intervention or conflict , as are economic up and downs, racial degrading, a growing Godless State as endemic social meekness, It is time to organize, detox and provide for a healthy State.

Thank you Log in to Reply Edward Longshanks  October 9, 2016 at 11:32 am I like the straight logic in the article. It is well formulated to the main hitting points. Today German main TV-news “Tagessschau” declared the first time that peace activists do not see only Russian guilt for the suffering in Aleppo. Do we recognize a wind of change? In one point i do not agree with the article: When started the unacceptable behaviour of US governments. WW1, Spanish-/US-war, US-Mexican-war, the war with British Canada, the Civil War etcetc. It will beome difficult to prove >This unexceptional behavior may have started under Bush (43), but it was carried on in its shape-shifting forms with Obama, as Ash Carter and John Brennan were carry overs from Bush.- The historical unexceptional behaviour of lunatic US governments since Independence day is easy to prove.

We Americans tend to look at those previous events as the teenage years of the country, when we could do nothing about it. My framing was Obama’s mistake in being sold the American exceptionalism con, which he might have gotten suckered into by playing to his ego with the term being put on his legacy…and on those of us living at this time. We Confederates don’t blame Yankees for what happened in our Civil War, unless they start acting link Yankees 🙂 Khalid Talaat  October 9, 2016 at 8:53 am Thanks Mr. Dean for a informative article.

Log in to Reply JohnZ  October 9, 2016 at 8:30 am Jim, Very well said. I think no one could say it any better. The current regime in the White House and that is how I see it, has proven to be even worse than the previous one. With three wars and three nations destroyed and countless dead, injured and maimed for life, with millions more made homeless and desperate by the actions of this sitting fool in the White House, that for all reasons should be arrested along with the entire White House staff and charged with war crimes. America has no moral compass. It has no exceptionalism only in that it has destroyed the lives of more people on this planet than any previous nation. America does not have the blessing of any deity. It is to be condemned. While a great many Americans share the faith based on a violent, hateful religion created in a middle eastern desert, there are those of us who reject it wholesale as a fraud. I’m not talking about Islam either. America is now plummeting down an abyss from which it may never return. Too late, some are waking up to the mass delusion and the lies and deceits fed them. I fear we are doomed. Log in to Reply JS  October 9, 2016 at 7:48 am Excellent article, Jim. I want to add two things: First, I think this unexceptional behavior may have started in earnest under Bush 41 rather than Bush 43. Second, Samantha Power while in the Obama admin, kept harping on the “responsibility to protect” rather than the right to protect. Of course, that UN doctrine is a crock of you know what, but she has been rewarded for this by being promoted from NSC to now being US Ambassador to the UN. Quote from the wiki page on this globalist UN doctrine: “The Responsibility to Protect (R2P or RtoP) is a global political commitment which was endorsed by all member states of the United Nations at the 2005 World Summit to prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.” Log in to Reply JS  October 9, 2016 at 7:53 am When the member states of the UN voted for this in 2005, they were naive. This “responsibility to protect” doctrine has been turned on its head, and has been used an excuse to go into other countries and do precisely those things that the vote was supposed to prevent! JohnZ  October 9, 2016 at 8:37 am No it began much earlier that the Bush regimes. It began with Teddy Roosevelt. It began with the phrase “manifest destiny”, it began with”making the world safe for democracy”, it began with the absurd notion of “one nation under god” inserted into a mindless little ditty that we were made to repeat countless times in the name of freedom. One that I shall never utter again.

Print Email Brad Schmidt | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Brad Schmidt | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 09, 2016 at 6:01 AM, updated October 09, 2016 at 6:02 AM comments The lead crisis that gripped Portland's largest school district this summer might have been avoided if city leaders followed federal rules to minimize lead exposure in drinking water. An investigation by The Oregonian/OregonLive found state regulators let Portland off the hook two decades ago as federal officials turned a blind eye. In November 1997, state officials approved a one-of-a-kind deal that let Portland ignore rules other cities across the country had to follow. New federal guidelines would have required Portland to add chemicals to its water to minimize pipe corrosion and the release of lead. But the city effectively bet it could reduce overall health risks — and save money — by focusing on lead paint instead of aggressively targeting lead in water. That decision affected not only schools but also thousands of homes, apartments and offices across the region connected to Portland's water supply. Now 19 years later, it's impossible to say whether Portland's workaround has lived up to its promise. The Oregonian/OregonLive commissioned independent testing of lead in homes and reviewed hundreds of pages of documents that suggest, in many cases, the program has fallen short of its goals. Among the findings: The program's so-called "cornerstone," lead-paint fixes in homes with young children, was pitched as a national model. Although the work substantially cuts lead dust levels, several studies show reductions are short-lived. In homes with follow-up testing, about half had at least one sample topping hazard levels months or years later. Most of the more than 1,800 homes with lead-paint or soil work have never been retested. An independent analysis of select homes for The Oregonian/OregonLive shows both water and paint hazards previously identified by the city remain today – unbeknownst to residents. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency challenged the premise of Portland's program in 1997, saying expected benefits rested on uncertain assumptions. Water regulators from the Oregon Health Authority dismissed those concerns. Likewise, state regulators discounted federal objections about a lack of benchmarks for measuring success. Since then, state regulators have never independently evaluated Portland's program. At any point since 1997, Portland could have built a water treatment plant to minimize lead while still pursuing the rest of its reduction plan. One estimate pegged construction costs at just $3 million. Instead, as other water systems sharply brought down lead levels, Portland became an outlier. Lead levels in Portland's high-risk homes test the highest among the nation's largest water providers. Portland has exceeded the federal "action level" eight times since 1997, most recently in 2013. And tests this summer found lead-tainted water in virtually every Portland Public Schools building. The fallout prompted high-profile resignations, including Superintendent Carole Smith. Lead levels across Portland — and its schools — would be "dramatically lower" with stronger treatment, said Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech engineering professor who helped expose the 2015 lead scandal in Flint, Michigan. Every problem wouldn't disappear, but the scope and severity would be reduced. "It's frankly kind of scapegoating," Edwards said. "Why are these school officials taking the brunt of the blame here when the city utility and the state essentially failed to follow the law?" To be clear, federal regulators have never found Portland in violation of lead rules. But they now say Portland's levels "aren't good enough." They want the city to minimize lead, pushing levels as low as possible, beyond simply reducing it. Dave Leland, Oregon's drinking water program manager, argues stronger corrosion control would have made no difference for Portland Public Schools. "It's a different problem," said Leland, blaming district plumbing and fixtures. "The water treatment level wouldn't have solved this." No amount of lead exposure is considered safe, according to the World Health Organization. Locally, no children have been found with elevated blood lead levels this year because of water exposure, according to Multnomah County health authorities. State officials declined to say whether school district employees have tested high for lead, citing privacy concerns. City leaders and state regulators defend their decisions. They say the lead program is successful but don't have an overarching analysis to back it up. Among other things, they say lead levels have dropped by about two-thirds in water tests at high-risk homes. They tout increased testing for children. And they note blood lead levels have dropped in Multnomah County, even though national numbers have fallen, too. "You're looking for proof," said Yone Akagi, Portland's water quality compliance manager. "These children are being tested who would not have gotten tested. I feel strongly that there's been a benefit to public health." EPA concerned with program Portland's water comes from the Bull Run watershed.Jaime Francis/The Oregonian/OregonLive/2011  When the EPA tightened its lead rules in 1991, Portland officials balked. City leaders didn't believe lead exposure was a major problem in water. Portland's Bull Run watershed was considered lead-free. The city's delivery system never included lead service lines. But Portland's water was corrosive enough to leach lead from pipes and faucets. Testing from 10 percent of sampled high-risk homes revealed lead levels of at least 53 parts per billion; the EPA wanted it no higher than 15. The EPA set a deadline to start treatment in 1997. By June 1994, city officials were laying the groundwork for "flexibility." They pitched regulators on a "better approach" that would target plumbing instead of injecting chemicals into everyone's water. A weighty factor in Portland's hesitancy: the business community. Officials didn't want to upset companies using city water to clean microchips or concoct microbrews. The estimated cost for Intel alone to treat its water would be $670,000 up front plus $310,000 a year, according to records from city archives. Portland's water director flew to Washington, D.C., to lobby federal leadership. His takeaway, according to an internal memo: Portland had a shot, "but it is a very difficult proposition." In 1995, Portland studied its options and settled on a new path: light chemical treatment and a program to reduce lead paint dangers. Portland secured endorsements from a broad base of public health experts – including Grant Higginson, the state health officer who also served as Portland's water regulator. Over the next two years, Portland devised an official Lead Hazard Reduction Program, without pinning down how it would be monitored or measured. The plan included water treatment, education for residents, free water testing and paint repairs. City officials could have settled for state approval. Instead, they aimed higher. In March 1997, Portland hoped to join a federal pilot program for innovative approaches to environmental regulations. City leaders formally asked the EPA to approve its program "as a substitute" for minimizing lead levels. The EPA wasn't impressed. None of Portland's estimates on lead exposure was "sufficiently accurate" to be used as the program's underlying basis, EPA's then-assistant administrator for policy, David Gardiner, wrote in November 1997. Assumptions about paint fixes were "highly uncertain," he added, without being specific. Federal officials urged Portland to "clearly define" and measure success for the program. Regulators later wrote that approval would not be credible "without a meaningful evaluation and monitoring program." But state regulators, also considering Portland's program, didn't share those concerns. That month, the Oregon Health Authority approved the same documents Portland submitted to the EPA. State officials declared the program was as good as minimizing lead levels in water. And even though federal officials could have overturned Oregon's decision, they stood pat. Portland withdrew its federal application. Looking back, Oregon and the EPA faced "different kinds of decisions," Gardiner stressed in an interview. The EPA's concerns centered on the federal pilot program's standards. But state officials were free to ignore them. Oregon's criteria for lead-compliance were less rigorous. "Our view was that you wanted to be able to monitor and measure and evaluate the impact," said Gardiner, who left the EPA in 1999. A regional spokeswoman for the EPA declined to say why the agency let Oregon's decision stand given its well-documented concerns. As for the EPA, said Leland, the state's drinking water manager, "Everybody has different views." 'Hazardous levels' return Evaluating success today is difficult because state regulators never set clear expectations for Portland. After federal officials made noises about cracking down in 2002, Portland again pledged to "develop cost-effective criteria" for evaluating its program. But state regulators never pushed it. "These are very difficult things to measure," said Kari Salis, a state drinking water manager. "They're not really quantifiable." But a review of some two dozen reports spanning 18 years spells out several problems – including with the city's prized paint program. In its first few years, Portland handed community groups too much responsibility for getting the work done. "This model floundered," according to an undated city report. By 2001, crews made fixes at just 235 homes – 108 units below the initial goal. Portland has fallen behind again. Three years ago, officials pledged to finish repairs on 310 units by February 2017. With four months to go, only 142 have received improvements. The paint program relies on federal housing grants. Officials also knew early on that paint fixes were temporary. Levels dropped dramatically when work wrapped up. But in 44 percent of homes retested in 2001, "hazardous levels" of lead showed in at least one sample just 10 to 17 months later. "Our reaction isn't going to be to question the success of the Lead Hazard Reduction Program" based on one report, said Jonathan Modie, a spokesman for the Oregon Health Authority. Portland found similar results three different times between 2007 and 2013. About 100 of 1,800 homes were retested over the years. According to the most recent review, "significant sources of lead contamination" remained in 47 percent of homes that received follow-up testing three years ago. Bedroom floors at some retested homes during that last report had lead levels 10 to 72.5 times greater than the federal hazard level, which is 40 micrograms per square foot. Jonathan Wilson, research director for the National Center for Healthy Housing, praised Portland for conducting follow-up testing. But he said such high levels are a concern. "The program should be trying to figure out how they could get these levels lower," he said. Martha Calhoon, a city spokeswoman, said officials use different numbers to gauge success. In the past three years, officials found 13 children with elevated levels of lead in their blood because of problems in their homes. The city's program paid for fixes. "The children we are able to protect from lead-based paint hazards are the measure of this program's success," Calhoon wrote in an email. Lead levels remain high at Nicole Ball's bungalow in Northeast Portland. In 2009, Ball received a roughly $15,000 grant to replace her lead-caked windows. With kids 4 and 7 years old, she considered it a "huge gift." But follow-up testing months later found a high lead sample on a bedroom floor. The Oregonian/OregonLive returned last month — seven years later — and found continued problems. The news organization gathered dust samples from eight locations throughout the house. Two floor samples recorded levels double and triple hazard standards. "I'm inclined to do something about it," she said. Portland wins award; homeowners at risk Progress has been mixed in other areas. In 2004, the U.S. Government Accountability Office praised Portland's education work. A year later, the EPA gave Portland an award for raising awareness about lead hazards facing children. But there were challenges, too. As early as 2003, officials said education efforts were "effective in some areas but not others." In 2007, a report recommended better customer service for a lead hotline after nearly half of surveyed callers expressed negative comments. A program to raise awareness about water in high-risk homes "does not appear to be very successful," the same report read. Portland's free water testing program hasn't reached its potential, either. Testing requests are high in the first half of the year but then plummet by about two-thirds. The reason: Portland promotes the service in water bills only at the start of the year. Why not advertise more often? "Cost logistics," said Scott Bradway, Portland's lead hazard reduction manager. Records show Portland's annual spending on education, outreach and testing has hovered at $450,000 since 2002, even as the bureau's operating budget swelled. Only now, with an influx of testing requests, have costs spiked to $666,000. Wiley Wyss and Rachel Conrad could have benefited from testing – and aggressive water treatment. The 20-somethings bought a Southwest Portland starter home in 2013. Portland used to test water at the home, built in 1985, as part of compliance requirements. It repeatedly found high levels until it stopped testing there in 2002. Fourteen years later, lead levels in the home remain high. Water from the bathroom tested above the federal action level, at 17.7 parts per billion according to an analysis performed for The Oregonian/OregonLive. Wyss said the couple probably wouldn't have bought the house if they'd known. Conrad said she's frustrated Portland hasn't minimized its lead levels. "It kind of feels like it was swept under the rug a little bit," she said. "I would have liked to have known this would have been a risk for us." Time to re-evaluate Portland Commissioner Nick Fish has overseen the Water Bureau since 2013.Randy L. Rasmussen/The Oregonian  Portland could minimize lead in its water by adding more chemicals to increase pH and alkalinity. That change would reduce corrosion. Those standards were confirmed by outside technical experts in 2003. The city sought the advice because early attempts at light treatment failed to keep levels low enough. Building a temporary facility, with enough chemical capacity to actually minimize lead levels, would have cost just $3 million at the time. But experts didn't recommend moving forward. They figured Portland could save money and wait until it dealt with other federal mandates: shutting down open-air reservoirs and treating water for a parasite called cryptosporidium. Those improvements were expected by 2012. But Portland fought them. The city won an exception for cryptosporidium. And work on its underground reservoirs won't finish until 2020. "When people realized they weren't going to build the additional facilities," said Rhodes Trussell, an engineer on the advisory committee, "they could have re-evaluated." On Tuesday, the Portland City Council will consider long-term treatment options, with a decision expected next summer. Officials say improvements wouldn't be ready until 2022. Construction could cost $15 million. Portland Commissioner Nick Fish, in charge of the Water Bureau since 2013, declined to address past decisions or concerns from the EPA. Fish said any decision about water treatment, "if we can do better," will be based on "good science and Portland values." Boston offers a likely glimpse into Portland's future. In the 1990s, Portland and Boston shared similarly high lead levels in high-risk homes. Both had corrosive water. Both stored water in open reservoirs. Both considered alternatives. Ultimately, Boston's water provider agreed to minimize lead. Water in the top 10 percent of Boston's high-risk homes tested above 6.2 parts per billion last fall. Portland was more than double this spring, at 13.1. "We're satisfied," said Stephen Estes-Smargiassi, director of planning and sustainability for the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. Why didn't Boston pitch an alternative? Because when it came to creativity, regulators "were not as enthused as the folks out west." "You can't get in trouble as a regulator," he said, "if you just stick with the rule." -- Brad Schmidt Reporter Rob Davis contributed to this report. bschmidt@oregonian.com 503-294-7628 @cityhallwatch What do Portland city employees make?

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Articles PlayStation 4 Tech Analysis: 4K gaming on PlayStation 4 Pro How Sony's new console tackles ultra HD - and the options available in connecting to a 4K screen. By Richard Leadbetter Published 09/10/2016 It all seems to have rather gone rather quiet for PlayStation 4 Pro, mere weeks before the system's launch. What's clear is that anyone who didn't attend the PlayStation Meeting in person a couple of weeks back still hasn't seen much of what the system is capable of. Follow-up downloadable media released in the wake of the event has mostly been bereft of quality and doesn't showcase the hardware favourably. Meanwhile, the first public reveal of the system at EGX recently was limited to just six units running just one title - Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. With just over a month to go before the new console launches, the lack of exposure for the system is puzzling. There are many reasons to be optimistic about the hardware's chances, principally because the software I've seen - principally Days Gone and Horizon Zero Dawn - looks impressive. They're not launch titles, of course, but they perhaps hint at the kind of quality we may see more generally a couple of months on from release. More than that, the price-point of the PlayStation Pro - $399/£349 - makes the hardware a no-brainer for new console buyers as we move into the holiday season. The bottom line is this. While we can fully expect bundling deals and special offers to drive down prices on existing hardware, the retail pricing for PS4 Pro is undeniably compelling - $100/£100 more than the new CUH-2000 'Slim' PlayStation 4 model buys you 31 per cent of extra CPU power, 2.3x the GPU grunt, faster RAM and twice the storage space. As things stand, the base PS4 is suddenly looking very expensive for what it offers, relatively. How PS4 Pro connects to your display Connectivity between PS4 Pro and a 4K screen is very simple. In the resolution area of the video output settings, two new options join the existing 720p, 1080i and 1080p selectables. These are, in turn, 2160p YUV420 and 2160p RGB. 2160p YUV420 is interesting in that this allows PS4 Pro to connect to older 4K screens that lack the full HDMI 2.0 implementation. By reducing chroma information, the required bandwidth drops down in half, allowing HDMI 1.4 screens to get a full 60Hz signal. The compromise is that hard reds, blues and greens can show low resolution artefacting. However, in our tests, we've found that it's not an issue in a typical living room environment. 2160p RGB doubles the bandwidth requirement, meaning HDMI 2.0 is a must, and sends the framebuffer through losslessly to the 4K screen. What's curious here is that PlayStation VR's external processing box only seems to support HDMI 1.4, meaning that Pro functionality is limited to 2160p YUV420 - and HDR won't work either. Both 2160p RGB and HDR will require PSVR users to disconnect the external processor and hook up the console directly to the screen. This is not ideal, obviously. If it all sounds like a bit of a minefield, another new option is added to PS4 Pro's video output settings, called 'video output information'. Selecting this confirms the resolution and colour format (RGB etc) of the connected display, and whether HDR is supported or not. The HDCP level of the screen is also revealed. If an HDMI 1.4 receiver is detected, you are warned that certain 4K material (we assume video streaming from the likes of Netflix etc) may not display at 4K. A new HDR option has recently been added to the front-end of all consoles, and we've quickly tested Deus Ex: Mankind Divided on the base PS4. It is outputting a 1080p signal with HDR information to the display - a standard we weren't even aware of as existing until recently. We believe that it may be a recent addition to the HDMI 2.0b spec, and it requires that the PS4 is placed in full-range RGB output mode in order to work (we saw a very washed out image in limited range mode). By pricing PlayStation 4 Pro in line with the original PS4's launch cost, Sony has realised that there's a certain price ceiling acceptable for a mainstream console launch, and while the omission of the UHD Blu-ray drive is a bad move for a device aimed at the higher end, more discerning user, it's clearly a business decision aimed at getting as many consoles into homes as quickly as possible. Keeping the price low also helps to address the key concern about the hardware, which is pretty simple: to what extent does it actually improve the visual experience? Before addressing that, it's worth pointing out that the relatively small price bump from PS4 to Pro means that even if you're buying just for more refined performance, excellent anti-aliasing and 2x the storage, you're still not getting a bad deal. Thoughts and analysis on PlayStation 4 Pro, a couple of weeks on from the reveal. And that's important, because the pitch Sony has made has - at best - been rather shaky thus far. And what's concerning is that Microsoft's Project Scorpio proposition is basically the same. While both platform holders are giving developers carte blanche to use the new hardware as they see fit in terms of enhancing their games, the basic aim of the new kit is all about running existing games at higher resolutions, leveraging the advantages offered by 4K screens. The difference is, essentially, about pixel counts - as became clear in the recent Eurogamer interview with Microsoft. "[Sony is] talking about checkerboard rendering and up-scaling and things like that," says Microsoft's Albert Penello. "There are just a lot of asterisks in their marketing around 4K, which is interesting because when we thought about what spec we wanted for Scorpio, we were very clear we wanted developers to take their Xbox One engines and render them in native, true 4K. That was why we picked the number, that's why we have the memory bandwidth we have, that's why we have the teraflops we have, because it's what we heard from game developers was required to achieve native 4K." What you won't hear from Sony or Microsoft are the magic words - 60 frames per second - because fundamentally, both PlayStation 4 Pro and Scorpio are based on a similar technological base with the same key limitation in place: a hard and fast lack of choice on available x86 CPU technology. Hopes linger that Scorpio utilises AMD's new Zen architecture, but having already announced eight CPU cores in its next console, this seems highly unlikely. AMD's own eight-core Zen CPU targets Intel's high-end Broadwell-E processor as competition - and those processors start at $400/£400. Performance analysis of Horizon Zero Dawn in its preview state. What's clear is that most PS4 Pro titles will scale up resolution as opposed to handing in a 60fps frame-rate. The attempt to sell a mid-gen console refresh is therefore based on the idea of the user owning or upgrading to a 4K screen - something that's very hard to market to users who don't own the technology. On top of that, it really helps if you own the right 4K display, principally one that supports high dynamic range. Oh, and do make sure that it's the right HDR screen. Many otherwise excellent screens accept the input, then scale it back to SDR - rather like the Samsung KU6400 we reviewed yesterday. Others support HDR, but aren't particularly bright, meaning you need to play in a darkened room to get the best effect. Meanwhile, some of the best and the brightest HDR screens - such as the Samsung KS8000 series - don't support low latency game modes when working with HDR content, adding over 100ms to lag. It's a minefield. The question boils down to this: is 4K really worth it? And the answer to that is pretty straightforward - it definitely is. The detail increase is profound in its own right and moves into a different level entirely with HDR engaged. And the notion of a £350/$400 box able to service this resolution effectively represents a phenomenal value proposition, when a PC capable of doing the same job costs at least twice as much. However, In terms of enticing users towards upgrading their displays, much work remains to be done. All of the 4K content seen at the PlayStation Meeting is clearly and obviously a substantial visual upgrade over 1080p, even if it isn't actually native 4K. Sony's approach with the PS4 Pro is to treat ultra HD as a canvas for higher resolution gameplay, as opposed to a hard and fast pixel count that must be adhered to at all times. The quality of the upscaling varies on a title by title basis, but at its best, in living room conditions, it looks close to native. The principle behind the 'checkerboard' scaling is pretty straightforward - a 2x2 pixel structure is extrapolated up to 4x4, apparently using new hardware built into PS4 Pro's GPU, so there is no cost to developers. The real question is how the hardware does the job. This Deus Ex: Mankind Divided shot resolves at 3360x1890, but it may well be checkerboarding to get there before a conventional 4K upscale kicks in. When we saw the game in motion, artefacts were emphasised by the game's severe sharpening filter. Mark Cerny is apparently going to reveal more soon, but we're currently inclined to believe that a temporal component is involved - that information from previous frames is collated and used to help extrapolate the additional pixels. Perhaps we're looking at a more refined, non-interlaced version of the kind of technique used in Killzone Shadowfall's temporal upscaling. There's more evidence of this in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Playing the game at EGX on PS4 Pro hardware, Tom Morgan and John Linneman noted a perfectly mapped 4K output on static scenes, with some checkerboard fringing in motion. Owing to the extreme pixel density of 4K displays, the artefacts aren't so intrusive in motion. Returning to the PlayStation Meeting, Horizon and Days Gone really were the highlights in terms of producing a 4K presentation that could pass as native, but Infamous First Light was also striking. Sucker Punch's title also revealed a potential limitation of the technique - I noted some fuzzy fringe artefacting on alpha effects where the checkerboard isn't fully filled out, and similarly I saw something that looked very similar on Nathan Drake's hair in the Uncharted 4 demo. The difference between the two was that the artefact seemed to persist on the Naughty Dog demo, whereas I only spotted the issue on Infamous when the game paused to drop into Photo Mode. The commonality here is that it's alpha effects that are affected. We're also inclined to believe that checkerboarding can be used to scale up to an intermediate resolution - such as 1800p or thereabouts - before a standard upscale kicks in. This may explain the Deus Ex: Mankind Divided screenshot on this page. Pixel counting suggests a 7/8 pixel ratio, giving us 3360x1890. However, there are no checkerboard artefacts at all, initially leading us to think that's a simple, conventional upscale in place here. However, our hands-on time with Call of Duty showing just how good the technology works on static scenes suggests that this Deus Ex shot may have been taken from a relatively static image. It's certainly at odds with our perception of the title in motion at the PlayStation Meeting, where the artefacts were actually amplified by the game's overly intrusive sharpening filter. Another title that may combine checkerboarding and upscaling is Mass Effect Andromeda - though we really need better media to work with than is currently available. First video and analysis of Mantis Pro Racing on PS4 Pro - running at full-fat ultra HD at 60fps. But one comment in particular from a Sony developer I spoke to at the PlayStation Meeting stands out - that there's more to the PlayStation 4 Pro than the checkerboard upscaling alone, along with Mark Cerny's comment that the new hardware has "adopted many new features from the AMD Polaris architecture as well as several even beyond it". We already know that the revised AMD GCN cores available in the PS4 Pro are able to process two 16-bit floating point operations in the time taken for the base PS4 hardware to complete one, meaning that revised, Pro-optimised shader code can be much faster. On top of this, we now understand that the Pro GPU includes custom hardware for accelerating virtual reality. While we're still chasing down the precise detail here, logical steps forward would be akin to what we've seen in Nvidia's hardware - stereo geometry processing, and multi-resolution shading. The latter in particular is a big deal: it would allow Pro developers to concentrate GPU resources on elements of the scene that are actually visible, as opposed to fully processing the periphery of the viewport, with resolution literally wasted in the final lens warp. The question is really to what extent this is actually custom hardware developed by Sony, or whether we are looking at elements of AMD technology that have indeed been harvested from future Radeon kit. An interesting, albeit unverified report arrived this week discussing how the upcoming Vega architecture increases efficiency from the GCN shaders, and you can't help but wonder whether Sony already has access to this technology in the Pro based on what we've learned about the hardware so far. Similarly, we are curious about whether the relationship with AMD works both ways - the option to use checkerboarding in the PC space could be very interesting. With so many 23-inch and 27-inch 4K displays on the market, exhibiting extreme pixel densities, checkerboarding artefacts would be very hard to pick up on, even in a desktop environment with the user closer to the screen. Some titles may well be checkerboarding up to something in the region of 1800p before upscaling up to 4K. Mass Effect Andromeda is perhaps a case in point. It doesn't sound ideal, but the presentation on this title at the PlayStation Meeting was still very impressive. More interesting is that the fundamentals of the GPU design are more ambitious than we previously believed. PS4's GPU effectively uses a modified version of the Pitcairn design used in the Radeon HD 7850 and HD 7870. Xbox One is based on the Bonaire Radeon HD 7790 and R7 260X. With that in mind, when it was revealed that PS4 Pro features 36 compute units, it seemed that Polaris 10 integration in the new PS4 Pro processor was a lock. However, what's clear is that the new console is different, more functionally rich in some respects and much more of a custom design than its predecessor. It also helps to explain why there is not an existing Radeon part (that we know of, at least) on the roadmap that's a good candidate for Project Scorpio's six teraflop GPU. PS4 and Xbox One were built in an era where the future of console hardware was in doubt, where both Sony and Microsoft were conservative in their designs compared to Xbox 360 and PS3. With PS4 Pro and Scorpio, both platform holders know that they have a strong userbase leading to more ambitious designs. Thus far, everything we've seen so far suggests that the PS4 Pro is a really interesting piece of hardware, and we really can't wait to really put it through its paces. However, while remaining generally optimistic about the machine having seen some of its demos, there are some aspects where we should sound a note of caution. Firstly, while scaling up existing games to 4K (whether natively or via checkerboarding) inevitably leads to a cleaner, crisper, more impressive image than the base PS4's 1080p standard, it's our contention that other aspects of the presentation need to scale with it - and there have been signs that this could be challenging. Our Rise of the Tomb Raider PS4 Pro vs PC comparison highlights that the new console lacks the memory to house the top-tier textures put together by Crystal Dynamics. Instead, the artwork is a match for the Xbox One title. By and large this is not a huge issue during gameplay, but the high-end artwork requires little in the way of additional GPU computational resources but clearly makes much more of the stratospheric pixel count. It's an enhancement that - fundamentally - is worth having, but the PS4 Pro retains the same 8GB of GDDR5 as its older sibling, meaning that mostly the same assets will be used as the base 1080p titles. Crystal Dynamics told us that Rise of the Tomb Raider resolves to a 2160p framebuffer, but wouldn't go further. We believe it's using the checkerboard upscaling technique and you can see how it compares in this PS4 Pro vs PC comparison. Secondly, my colleagues John Linneman and Tom Morgan noted that the EGX demo of Infinite Warfare on PS4 Pro hardware appeared to use low levels of anisotropic filtering - the same as the base PS4 version. Texture filtering and the lack of it is a continuing issue with current-gen consoles generally, and doesn't look great at 1080p. Clearly, it will be more of an issue at 4K, regardless of whether you're upscaling or rendering natively. And finally, there's the issue of performance. We expect more from the Pro, but according to both John and Tom, the EGX demo of Call of Duty Infinite Warfare appeared to exhibit frame-rate drops more severe than the base version of the game. It should be pointed out that different content was running, and obviously the title may still have had development time remaining, but at the PlayStation Meeting, Deus Ex also seemed to run slower than the existing PS4 game. Assuming this is borne out in actual testing of final code, this is actually in breach of Sony's technical requirements for PS4 Pro titles. The platform holder has been stringent about upholding performance standards in PSVR so we hope the same applies to Pro software. And this highlights another concern we have right now: even if we factor in PS4 Pro's enhancements, the fact is that generally speaking, boosting a GPU's compute capability needs to be matched with increased memory throughput to get the most out of it - and PS4 Pro's 25 per cent increase in bandwidth seems a little lackluster compared to the 2.3x boost to compute throughput. As a counter-point, we should point out that AMD's RX 480 competes well with the outgoing R9 390, despite a huge shortfall in memory bandwidth between the new hardware and the old. Native 4K or upscaling isn't really our primary concern with the Pro. Performance is looking a little shaky on preview code that's pretty close to completion, as seen in Call of Duty Infinite Warfare, as played at the PlayStation Meeting. All of which helps to puts the spec for Microsoft's Project Scorpio into perspective. The bandwidth boost we would expect is there, the additional compute power is there and unless the Xbox designers are using cutting-edge G5X memory, it'll have a 4GB memory advantage too. Certainly, the motherboard renderings revealed at E3 do seem to show 12 memory modules in a clamshell arrangement around the main processor, suggesting a 50 per cent uplift in memory allocation vs PS4 and Xbox One. Just as much of a giveaway is the fact that Microsoft is building games right now that include high detail artwork designed to look good on 4K displays, requiring more memory than you'll find in the standard Xbox One. The weird world of 80s computer books Learning BASIC in the shadow of the bomb. At the time of its initial reveal, the notion of Microsoft touting "the highest quality pixels" for Project Scorpio sounded ridiculous - and maybe the point was badly phrased - but we've always been clear that is that there is more to image quality than pixel count alone. Time and time again we've seen either very little difference in quality between two images with different resolutions, or Xbox One titles presenting more detail than PS4 equivalents owing to much improved anisotropic filtering. "Higher quality pixels" - assuming we're referring to increased texture quality, decent anisotropic filtering and fewer post-processing compromises - may suggest that the next-gen console head-to-heads may be more interesting than the basic 1080p vs 900p differentials we tend to see in the here and now on current-gen console hardware. With PS4 Pro arriving imminently, we get the feeling it won't be too long before Microsoft shows Scorpio in action and at that point we should get a good measure of what the new Xbox offers. After all, the message from the Xbox team for the next 12 months is essentially going to be about how much more you could get by holding fire on a new console purchase. But the fundamental challenge remains in marketing what these machines are truly capable of, and it's equally applicable to both platform holders. We need to see 4K looking at its best, as a tangible upgrade to full HD, and somehow, we need a way of showing just how much HDR brings to the table.

Here is all we know about the Surface PC. In the photo is the Microsoft Surface Pro 4.  ( Andrew Burton | Getty Images ) Advertisement Microsoft has announced an event for Oct. 26 where the company is expected to unveil new products. Rumors about Microsoft's Surface All-In-One PC have been doing the rounds for several months now and it is likely that the company will officially reveal the device at the upcoming event. Here is all we know about the Surface All-In-One PC. Hardware Specs The rumored Surface All-In-One PC is said to sport a big touchscreen. The PC could be available in different sizes and it is likely that a 21-inch Full HD screen model with a display resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels is in the cards. Speculations are also rife that two of the Surface All-In-One PCs will support 4K, which means that the display resolution will be 3,680 x 2,140 pixels. Rumors also note that one of the 4K models will be available with a 24-inch screen. The Surface All-In-One PCs are likely to come running on Intel's Kaby Lake 14-nanometer processors. Other hardware details of the Surface PC remain unknown for now. Accessories Microsoft is also said to be working to redesign the accessory lineup for its Surface All-In-One PCs. Reports suggest that Microsoft may launch Surface-branded Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, which also appeared on FCC filings. These accessories are expected to be sold separately. Release Date At the upcoming Microsoft has an event, customers would want to lay their hands on the new PC as soon as possible, but the release date of the Microsoft PCs may depend on the release of Intel's Kaby Lake processors. Price The Surface All-In-One PC is hotly anticipated, but the price could be a factor, which would determine the success of the PC. Reports suggest that the Surface PC could have a price tag of about $999. Modular Design The Surface PC is said to have a modular design and users will be able to detach the screen and keyboard. Such modular design will allow users to use the Surface PC as a tablet or use it as a full-fledged PC for productivity purposes. Although, the Surface All-In-One PC is expected to be the highlight of the event, Microsoft is expected to unveil future plans of Windows 10 and Xbox One. Rumors of a Surface Phone have been circling the tech space for a few years now and smartphone enthusiasts are eager to see the first Surface-branded mobile phone. Microsoft's Oct. 26 event in New York starts at 10 a.m. EDT and customers will have to wait another few weeks to find more details on the Surface All-In-One PCs.

It seems unlikely, and here's why. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 8, 2016 at 9:22AM Image source: Google.  Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google recently announced its first in-house smartphones, known as the Pixel and the Pixel XL (a larger variant of the Pixel). These are premium devices, starting at $649 for the base Pixel model (5 inches) and $769 for the base Pixel XL model (5.5 inches). These phones currently use a Snapdragon 821 applications processor produced by wireless chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). However, according to Bloomberg, Google has expressed interest in building its own custom silicon out in time. This leads to a very interesting question: Will Google develop its own applications processors for future Pixel smartphones? Google could probably do it Putting together a reasonably competent smartphone-oriented applications processor these days isn't too difficult, especially if one has the money to spend (and Google can clearly afford it). Many of the key intellectual properties that go into a mobile processor -- CPU cores, graphics, memory controllers, eMMC, and so on -- can be licensed from third parties such as ARM Holdings, Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH: IGNMF), and Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS). One major hurdle that Google would undoubtedly face in trying to build its own custom chip is the fact that it could not easily license a cellular modem to integrate into such a chip. Google would either have to spend a lot of time, money, and effort to even hope to build a reasonably competitive cellular modem or it would need to use stand-alone modems from the likes of Qualcomm or Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the two suppliers of modems into the latest iPhone.  The stand-alone solution is less than ideal because the current Pixel phone uses a chip that integrates the modem onto the same piece of silicon as the applications processor, which helps to reduce board size as well as power consumption. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been dealing with stand-alone modems for as long as the iPhone has been around, but for Google it would represent a step back from the solution that it's already using.  In order to build a differentiated solution, Google could choose to build unique intellectual properties to integrate alongside the core technologies licensed from the above vendors. Custom hardware to accelerate certain common smartphone functions (thereby improving performance and/or lowering power consumption), for example, could be worthwhile projects for a potential Google custom silicon team to pursue if it really wants to build its own chips. Would it be worthwhile? The impression that I get is that most of the companies that build their own applications processors don't actually produce differentiated (or, frankly, even worthwhile) solutions relative to what can be purchased from the likes of Qualcomm and MediaTek. Apple's in-house chip efforts have been quite successful, and Samsung's (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been reasonable, but efforts from the likes of Huawei's HiSilicon and LG have been mostly underwhelming. If Google were a major smartphone vendor and its core revenue/profitability depended on selling large volumes of ultra-premium smartphones, then there might be a case to spend all of the time and effort to build in-house applications processors, though there's no guarantee that it'd be as good as, let alone better than, what Google could buy from Qualcomm. However, given that the Google Pixel is unlikely to be a particularly high volume seller, especially when it's charging premium prices, and given the fierce competition in the Android landscape from companies that have been at this longer than Google has been, I doubt that there's much of a (rational) business justification for such an effort. I'm not betting on it My guess is that Google will build a couple more generations of these Pixel devices, but they ultimately won't sell all that well. At that point, I expect the effort around the Pixel to be scaled back, if not outright shuttered. If the case for an in-house applications processor is tenuous at this point, I suspect that it'll seem downright silly if and when it becomes clear that the Pixel is a nice hobby, but not really a worthwhile product category for Google to pursue over the long haul.

For Microsoft, October has always been about Surface branded hardware. Last year, Microsoft stunned the world by announcing Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. However, it seems like a quite event this time around. According to ZDNet, Microsoft’s October 26 will be more about Windows 10 and less about Surface hardware. The focus is reportedly around Windows 10 Redstone 2 update and Microsoft is reported to showcase third party OEM products. Microsoft is widely rumoured to announce Surface All-in-One type device at this event. There are reports indicating Microsoft’s plan to announce a new type of Surface keyboard and mouse at this event. With Intel’s seventh gen Core i processors hitting notebooks, Microsoft would use the stage to demonstrate partner products – especially at a time when PC sales are going down globally. One thing is certainly sure – Microsoft won’t be launching a new fitness band and there are also no likelihood of Surface branded smartphone. Lately, Microsoft has taken great deal of time to unify Windows 10 across platforms and recently delivered Project Centennial – which acts as a bridge between traditional Windows program and Windows Store apps.

For comparison, a strand of human hair is about 50,000 nanometers thick. For more than a decade, engineers have been eyeing the finish line in the race to shrink the size of components in integrated circuits. They knew that the laws of physics had set a 5-nanometer threshold on the size of transistor gates among conventional semiconductors, about one-quarter the size of high-end 20-nanometer-gate transistors now on the market. Some laws are made to be broken, or at least challenged. A research team led by faculty scientist Ali Javey at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has done just that by creating a transistor with a working 1-nanometer gate. For comparison, a strand of human hair is about 50,000 nanometers thick. "We made the smallest transistor reported to date," said Javey, lead principal investigator of the Electronic Materials program in Berkeley Lab's Materials Science Division. "The gate length is considered a defining dimension of the transistor. We demonstrated a 1-nanometer-gate transistor, showing that with the choice of proper materials, there is a lot more room to shrink our electronics." The key was to use carbon nanotubes and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), an engine lubricant commonly sold in auto parts shops. MoS2 is part of a family of materials with immense potential for applications in LEDs, lasers, nanoscale transistors, solar cells, and more. The findings were published today in the journal Science. Other investigators on this paper include Jeff Bokor, a faculty senior scientist at Berkeley Lab and a professor at UC Berkeley; Chenming Hu, a professor at UC Berkeley; Moon Kim, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas; and H.S. Philip Wong, a professor at Stanford University. The development could be key to keeping alive Intel co-founder Gordon Moore's prediction that the density of transistors on integrated circuits would double every two years, enabling the increased performance of our laptops, mobile phones, televisions, and other electronics. "The semiconductor industry has long assumed that any gate below 5 nanometers wouldn't work, so anything below that was not even considered," said study lead author Sujay Desai, a graduate student in Javey's lab. "This research shows that sub-5-nanometer gates should not be discounted. Industry has been squeezing every last bit of capability out of silicon. By changing the material from silicon to MoS2, we can make a transistor with a gate that is just 1 nanometer in length, and operate it like a switch." When 'electrons are out of control' Transistors consist of three terminals: a source, a drain, and a gate. Current flows from the source to the drain, and that flow is controlled by the gate, which switches on and off in response to the voltage applied. Both silicon and MoS2 have a crystalline lattice structure, but electrons flowing through silicon are lighter and encounter less resistance compared with MoS2. That is a boon when the gate is 5 nanometers or longer. But below that length, a quantum mechanical phenomenon called tunneling kicks in, and the gate barrier is no longer able to keep the electrons from barging through from the source to the drain terminals. "This means we can't turn off the transistors," said Desai. "The electrons are out of control." Because electrons flowing through MoS2 are heavier, their flow can be controlled with smaller gate lengths. MoS2 can also be scaled down to atomically thin sheets, about 0.65 nanometers thick, with a lower dielectric constant, a measure reflecting the ability of a material to store energy in an electric field. Both of these properties, in addition to the mass of the electron, help improve the control of the flow of current inside the transistor when the gate length is reduced to 1 nanometer. Once they settled on MoS2 as the semiconductor material, it was time to construct the gate. Making a 1-nanometer structure, it turns out, is no small feat. Conventional lithography techniques don't work well at that scale, so the researchers turned to carbon nanotubes, hollow cylindrical tubes with diameters as small as 1 nanometer. They then measured the electrical properties of the devices to show that the MoS2 transistor with the carbon-nanotube gate effectively controlled the flow of electrons. "This work demonstrated the shortest transistor ever," said Javey, who is also a UC Berkeley professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences. "However, it's a proof of concept. We have not yet packed these transistors onto a chip, and we haven't done this billions of times over. We also have not developed self-aligned fabrication schemes for reducing parasitic resistances in the device. But this work is important to show that we are no longer limited to a 5-nanometer gate for our transistors. Moore's Law can continue a while longer by proper engineering of the semiconductor material and device architecture."         LATEST STORIES (10) American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US Eleven Killed, Wounded in Terrorists' Rocket Attack in Western Damascus Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syrian Army Discovers Terrorists' 700-Meter-Long Tunnel in Khan Al-Sheih Connecting Damascus to Quneitra Protests, Students Walkouts Mark Week after Trump's Win Yemen Water Crisis Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul Iraqi Forces Take Back Ancient City of Nimrud from ISIL Iraqi Popular Forces Safeguarding Peace in Newly Gained Territories near Mosul Police Violence during Anti-Trump Protests Iran and US: A Tale of Two Elections Supermoon in Iran's Sky Iran Eyeing NITC Listing in Int'l Stock Markets VP: World Admitting Iran's Constructive Role in Maintaining Regional Security Iraqi Interior Minister: Nearly 1,000 ISIL Terrorists Killed, Over 100 Captured in Mosul Operation American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US TEHRAN (FNA)- Protesters were not slowing down six days after Donald Trump's election, many of them high school students leaving class by the hundreds to carry signs and flags on the streets of several US cities.

Windows Live YahooBuzz FriendFeed Relative Merits of Three JavaScript Frameworks: AngularJS, ReactJS, and EmberJS Posted on October 5th, 2016 Vote! Tweet By Phong Bui When you're working towards creating a solid responsive design that works across multiple platforms, you need to choose the right client-side framework for best results. Anyone seeking a JavaScript framework for their project today is going to consider the big three: AngularJS, ReactJS, and EmberJS. But, how do you narrow down your choice? Which framework is going to deliver what you need? In this article, we're going to delve into the pros and cons of each framework in turn and try to help you make the right choice for your project. Background and Popularity The first framework on the scene was AngularJS, which was first released in October, 2010. It is maintained by Google and enjoys a large, active community of developers and organizations. You'll find it on the Web sites of ABC News, Intel, Walgreens, and others. Angular has 165,000 followers on Twitter. First released in March, 2013, ReactJS is the youngest framework of our trio. It's maintained by Facebook and a large community of individuals and corporations. You'll find it used on Netflix, Feedly, Airbnb, and many other Web sites. React has 93,500 followers on Twitter. EmberJS was first released in December 2011 and it also has a large active community, though it lacks the big-name backing of Angular and React. It can be found on Web sites like Groupon, Vine, and Chipotle. Ember has 35,200 followers on Twitter. The relative popularity of each platform on Twitter broadly reflects our own client experience. Around 60% of our clients use Angular, about 30% use React, and the remaining 10% are using Ember. Before we dig into the technical strengths and weaknesses of each platform, it's worth noting that Google's backing for Angular and Facebook's backing for React make both of them safe bets. They won't run into any funding issues or suffer from lack of support for the foreseeable future. Now, let's take each platform in turn and drill into the advantages and disadvantages, before suggesting some scenarios where they might be the right pick. AngularJS It looks as though Angular is the most popular choice, but the move to Angular 2.0 has been a bit disruptive. A lot of the community is still using Angular 1.x, and although Angular 2.0 offers many benefits, the transition is far from complete. Advantages of Angular MVC architecture Easy-to-customize DOM Two-way data bindings Extendable HTML directories Support for desktop and mobile applications Built-in dependency injection Support for server-side rendering Easy to build and deploy with AngularCLI tool Disadvantages of Angular The big disadvantage with Angular 2.0 is the lack of documentation. The problem is complicated by the fact that the wealth of resources for Angular 1.x don't really help because the framework has changed so much. Angular Is Recommended AngularJS is recommended for projects that need to support desktop and mobile. Also, because it is written in Microsoft's TypeScript, it's a good choice for large enterprises. ReactJS When Facebook created React, it was trying to find an efficient way to keep a consistent UI and it succeeded. It may be the newest kid on the block here, but it has made some innovative strides. Advantages of React Virtual DOM One-way binding Support for desktop and mobile applications Support for server-side rendering Fast performance Disadvantages of React The big disadvantage for React is the fact that it's not really a full framework. You still need a third-party framework such as Flux or Redux to make a full MV* architecture. React Is Recommended ReactJS is recommended for projects that require high performance and simple libraries over a complete MV* framework. EmberJS Started with a focus on ambitious Web applications, Ember has some serious programming talent behind it, even if it does lack the backing of Google or Facebook. Ember 2.0 was released in August, 2015 and brought a raft of enhancements to the platform. Advantages of Ember MVC architecture Two-way data bindings Fits well with the RoR model and applications Built-in dependency injection Easy to build and deploy with EmberCLI tool Quick to develop Disadvantages of Ember The relatively small community is a drawback for Ember and it's also hard to code if you stray beyond its typical uses. Ember Is Recommended EmberJS is recommended for any projects that strictly follow the namespace/convention over configuration, especially Ruby on Rails projects. How to Choose There is no overall winner. The framework you choose depends on the project you're working on. If you have the time, try them out and see what aligns most closely with your current requirements. Factor in any existing knowledge you might have to help you get a head start. Although there are some unique selling points for each framework, the majority of the best new features and functions can be found in each of them. These are the three most popular frameworks for good reason.

I liked the post. Also, I think you shouldn't gripe about Ember, or any other framework, copying things from React or anywhere else. They admit what they liked about React. We, as developers, rarely create anything very new. Its a great thing to have tools that are made better by combining the best-of-breed. It makes us better. I did not see you offering much constructive criticism. Reply MV* architecture ? Posted by Can Ho on 10/07/2016 12:07am Thanks for your post. I have some concerns: 1. AngularJs Angular 1.x and Angular 2.x are completely different frameworks. I don't think it makes sense when saying "Advantages of Angular", "Disadvantages of Angular". Are you saying "Advantages of Angular 1.x" and "Disadvantages of Angular 1.x" ? 2. ReactJs This is a library not a framework. So, you're comparing apples and oranges. I agree that "Virtual DOM" is what makes React famous. There're a lot more that make React really powerful: Unidirection data flow, composition, Unix mentality, free from Domain Specific Language, JSX,.. "You still need a third-party framework such as Flux or Redux to make a full MV* architecture." --> Flux is a design pattern, not a framework. Redux is "Flux like" implementation. Furthermore, I don't think that we need "a full MV* architecture" in React world. 3. Ember Ember 2.0 copied a lot from React (https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/15): * One-way data binding by default * Virtual DOM * Component based * Controller is deprecated * Lifecycle callbacks Generally speaking, I don't agree with your points on Ember's advantages. To be honest, after reading this post, it seems to me that this post was created years ago (which favors MV* a lot) Reply You must have javascript enabled in order to post comments.

BLAIR / Statesman Journal)Buy Photo 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — Ron Wyden is expected to comfortably coast to a fifth term in the Senate next month and, if Democrats win the majority, pick up the gavel as chairman of the Finance Committee again. “He has basically spent his adult life representing Oregon,” said William M. Lunch, a professor of political science at Oregon State University. “Wyden’s roots run deep,” he said, with 16 years in the House before winning a special election to the Senate in early 1996. In Oregon, he’s perhaps best known for holding town hall meetings in each county every year, including ones he knows he won’t win in the southern and eastern parts of the state. “Wyden goes to all those places and listens to people and talks to local leaders. Part of success in politics is showing up,” Lunch said. “He’s very good at interacting with people. It doesn’t mean he wins those districts or those counties, but he limits the degree to which he loses them. Those kinds of moves have made him a very formidable political force in Oregon.” Nationally, Wyden is perhaps best known these days for his concerns about government intrusions into privacy and for encouraging the expansion of the high-tech industry in a state where Intel is the leading private employer. He put a hold on the Intelligence Authorization Act this summer to call attention to provisions allowing the FBI to demand customers’ Internet browsing histories and restricting the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. As a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence since 2001, he was instrumental in getting the CIA inspector general’s report on 9/11 declassified. STATESMAN JOURNAL Wyden, Udall side with Feinstein on CIA issue Wyden, 67, also has a reputation for “going off the reservation” and finding areas of agreement with Republican colleagues on health care and other issues, Lunch said. But he doesn’t think that has harmed his reputation with the Democratic leadership that would return him to the Finance Committee chairmanship he held briefly when Max Baucus of Montana was tapped to become ambassador to China in early 2014. Wyden is the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee. The influential handicappers at the Cook Political Report have consistently put Wyden’s seat in their “Solid D” category. They also put seven Senate seats — six of them Republican-held — in the “toss up” column, suggesting the Senate majority could flip to Democrats. “There’s no indication that Wyden is in any trouble as he runs for re-election this year,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. By email before Sunday’s second presidential debate, he added that Hillary Clinton’s standing suggested Democrats are now “narrow favorites” to take the Senate. Professor James D. Moore, director of the McCall Center for Policy Innovation at Pacific University in Forest Grove, Ore., also noted Wyden’s efforts to “keep up connections with the Republican parts of the state,” and said he works to find bipartisan consensus on the Finance and Natural Resources committees. An example of the latter occurred in 2014, when Wyden sought to balance environmental and timber logging interests in a bill that could win Democratic support in the Senate. The bill took a different approach than a House bill co-sponsored by Rep. Greg Walden, a Republican whose district covers almost two-thirds of the state east of the Willamette Valley, and co-sponsored by Reps. Peter DeFazio, D-Eugene, and Kurt Schrader, D-Canby, favored by the timber industry. After lengthy negotiations, the deal fell through. “Greg Walden outflanked him and, in the end, nothing got done — not a surprise in this Congress,” said Moore. STATESMAN JOURNAL Wyden timber bill gets support, condemnation from enviros Contrasting Wyden with former Oregon Sens. Bob Packwood, the Republican chairman of the Finance Committee when major tax reform was passed in 1986, and the late Mark Hatfield, the Republican chairman of the Appropriations Committee from 1981-87 and 1995-97, Moore said Wyden doesn’t have their “kind of footprint” nationally. When both were serving as chairmen, “Oregon was in the catbird’s seat,” he said. “(Wyden)’s not behind any of the major legislation that affects either Oregon or the country, but he’s in the middle of the discussions,” Moore said. Wyden has been a sponsor of 79 bills in this session of Congress, ranking fourth of 100 senators. And he is in the middle of things. Just last week, Wyden was one of 14 senators asking Attorney General Loretta Lynch to investigate and, if appropriate, file charges against the Wells Fargo officials responsible for the creation of millions of fraudulent accounts. “Every time the Department of Justice settles a case of corporate fraud without holding individuals accountable, it reinforces the notion that the wealthy and powerful have purchased a higher class of justice for themselves,” they wrote. Wyden is well-regarded by colleagues, who say he’s known for his studious hard work. “Our entire delegation has achieved a great deal of success, especially coming from a  small state, and a lot of that has to do with the senator’s leadership here in Washington, as well as back at home," said Schrader. "That hasn’t gone unnoticed by Oregonians either, which is why I know it is going to be an easy vote for folks to re-elect him this fall. If the Senate flips, Senator Wyden will be in an even better position to continue to deliver for Oregonians.” Teresa Alonso Leon, the Democratic candidate for State House District 22 in Salem, said she was “thrilled” to get Wyden’s endorsement. Frank Dixon, chairman of the Democratic Party of Oregon, called Wyden an effective leader who “time after time has proven his service to the people of Oregon, standing up for our values and the issues that make a difference." But Wyden also has his critics. David Jaques, an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention last summer in Cleveland and editor of The Roseburg Beacon newspaper, says Wyden has been ineffective solving problems and has been in office too long. “I do think we need term limits,” he said. “There’s more turnover in the monarchies of Europe than there is in our Congress.” Jaques concedes Wyden will defeat Republican Mark Callahan, a Salem information technology consultant, and four others on the ballot. Callahan did not respond to a request for comment. Wyden ranks as 20th wealthiest in the Senate with an estimated net worth of $10.8 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. It noted he receives rent from a New York City building where the landmark Strand book store co-owned by his wife, Nancy, is located. Wyden won the Democratic nomination in May against two others with 84 percent of the vote. He has raised $11.4 million since his last re-election and has spent $4.2 million, while Callahan has raised just $15,852, records show. The center says Wyden’s biggest donors have been Nike ($89,922), Blue Cross-Blue Shield ($78,400), the League of Conservation Voters ($75,012), the law and lobbying firm Akin, Gump ($65,655) and Intel ($59,307). Not surprisingly, given his committee assignments, Wyden’s largest donor base is the securities and investment world, which has given his campaign committee $853,500 this cycle. Right behind that were lawyers ($801,517) and the insurance industry ($568,790). Thirty percent of his contributions have come from political action committees. “Ron Wyden isn’t shy about raising money, even though he isn’t in any danger of losing re-election,” political prognosticator Nathan L. Gonzales wrote in the Rothenberg-Gonzales Political Report after his primary victory. He rated Oregon’s Senate seat “safe for the Democrats.” Wyden appears to be preparing for victory. In a statement to The Statesman Journal, he said: “I appreciate the trust my colleagues placed in me when Democrats were last in the majority, and I’m planning to pursue policies important to Oregonians when Democrats win in November. “My goal in the Senate has always been to find a way to do the most good for Oregonians, and the rest of the country. Chairing the Senate Finance Committee would give Oregon a strong voice as I fight to pass policies that help bring down the cost of child care, education and homes for the middle class. I’ll fight to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, expand access to affordable, quality health care for women and men across the country, and provide resources to aid our nation’s most vulnerable children and families."

Unlike the conservative (but cheap) Google device, this new headset does have full movement sensing, and it bridges the gap between smartphone-based VR headsets and dedicated home VR headsets (such as Rift). We predicted the rise of these “dedicated portable VR headsets” in our VR headset forecast. At Oculus’s developer conference this week, the firm sought to regain momentum after a number of recent setbacks, including unfortunate publicity around founder Palmer Luckey’s political funding, shock at the leaked price of the Touch controllers, and the HTC Vive allegedly being favoured by developers. In among the Touch demos, reduced PC-spec requirements, and new content announcements was an intriguing demo of a tetherless headset (known as “Santa Cruz”) not requiring a smartphone – in Ovum’s VR headset forecast, we dubbed such headsets “dedicated portable VR headsets” and predicted a rosy future for them. While no actual product was announced, it will be interesting to see how this headset stacks up against those based on Intel’s Alloy design, Sulon’s long-awaited headset, and the raft of devices inbound from Chinese manufacturers (all dedicated portable headsets). Done right, Oculus’s experience of movement and positional tracking for the Rift should put it in good standing to provide a better experience than those attempting their first device. The downside of this headset type remains cost vs. performance; it won’t be as powerful as a full Rift or Vive, but it will have to include expensive dedicated components normally provided by a smartphone in the cheap Daydream View headsets.

Here’s Why Meg K. First Posted: Oct 09, 2016 05:40 AM EDT Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is unlikely to get a 2016 release date. (Photo : Spencer Platt / Getty Images) The question which is bothering Microsoft fans and tech enthusiasts is when will the official announcement about Microsoft's next gen Surface Pro 5 release date, specs, features and pricing details be made. Rumors about Microsoft Surface Pro 5 have been making rounds for quite some time now. But, unfortunately, the software giant hasn't spoken even a single word about the highly anticipated device. Advertisement Notably, Microsoft has already sent out invites for its fall hardware event which will take place on Wednesday, October 26 in New York City starting 10 am ET. According to The Verge, the tech giant's upcoming event will revolve around Windows 10 software updates, Xbox related updates, Microsoft Surface device news as well as OEM devices. Microsoft's 2015 October event saw the unveiling of the Surface Pro 4, Microsoft Band 2 and the Surface Book laptop. Microsoft to launch new Surface PC at October 26th event https://t.co/03RB5vNNps pic.twitter.com/75dvXXeZpX — The Verge (@verge) October 7, 2016 But, as per reports, the company seems to be in no mood to refresh its existing Surface devices. In fact, rumors are that the tech giant will showcase OEM products instead. There are also reports which claim that Microsoft will launch a Surface All-in-One type device at the event. So, going by the reports, it seems Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is very much unlikely to get a 2016 release date. It is expected that Intel's latest Kaby Lake processor and Windows 10 Redstone 2 update are the main reasons behind the release delay. Among other specs, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected to come with a 4K Ultra HD display, 16 GB of RAM, AMD or Nvidia Pascal GPU, a 16MP main camera, an 8MP front camera, a fingerprint sensor, a rechargeable Surface Pen, a USB Type-C port and Thunderbolt 3. Advertisement The base model Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected to be priced around $899, while, the high end model is expected to cost a whopping $1,599.

Image Source: Forbes Facebook revealed its plans for a new wireless VR set during the Oculus Connect 3 Conference. This event took place during the first week of October at San Jose, California. During the Oculus Connect, visitors could test the first functional prototype for the VR headset. The official code-name for this new device is Project Santa Cruz. The company did not mention when the schedule release is or how exactly this new set will work in the future. Also, due to privacy reasons, visitors could not take any pictures when testing the device. The headset is rudimentary and only has one handheld and the VR glasses. To prove this point, reporters mentioned that most of the internal components of the glasses are visible in the back whiteout no protection. This appearance is because the cooling systems do not work as they intended according to the developers. Mark Zuckerberg believes that the future of VR is Project Santa Cruz Facebook’s CEO explained during the conference that Project Santa Cruz takes the best from VR and blends it with the freedom of having no wires. He then proceeded to talk about the concept behind the glasses. Facebook’ developers just added four cameras to the front and then inserted the GPU, the graphic card and battery to the back of the headset. The system is still under development, but Mark Zuckerberg feels pleased with the results so far. To prove his point, he invited visitors to try the VR set with the two available scenarios. However, Intel and Qualcomm are also developing similar devices with wireless compatibility. All projects are still in their early stages due to the difficulty of fitting an entire computer in the back of a headset, mentioned most journalists that attended the event. Nonetheless, they believe that this concept is promising and is the future of VR. Project Santa Cruz already has some beta games under development During the conference, people could explore two different scenarios with the Santa Cruz VR. The first was a city in flames with interactive fire and citizens. Most of the people and cars that are featured in the city looked pixelated, but their movement was very natural. The second scenario was a simple walk in outer space. This one featured a lot more colors and different sized planets to look from afar. The 3D design and the zero gravity sensation are the main features of this second game. However, other games feature similar interactive systems, and Facebook hopes that Santa Cruz will support them in the future. A good example of this is Killing Floor Incursion, which features complete compatibility with VR systems and their controls. The game even has special features for players who choose to try the Virtual Reality experience with it.

Tech giants are hungry for artificial intelligence. In a race to create the best AI solutions in an increasingly hot sector, U.S. tech behemoths like Alphabet's Google and iPhone maker Apple have been quietly snapping up dozens of artificial intelligence companies over the last five years, according to a recent report from analysis firm CB Insights. The firm's data sheds new light on a trend that's been evolving for years. Nearly 140 private companies working to advance AI technology have been acquired since 2011, including 40 buyouts just this year, CB noted. From Google's Assistant to Apple's Siri; Microsoft's Cortana to Facebook chatbots, tech companies appear to be locked in a fierce competition to create autonomous technology that can understand users' needs, and provide information quickly and reliably, CB Insights noted. In addition, companies like AOL, IBM and Yahoo were also among the acquirers, CB said. The report comes as Silicon Valley makes increasingly aggressive inroads into AI, and last week, Microsoft created an artificial intelligence unit of its own. It's a hot market that research firm Tractica estimates will balloon from $643.7 million in 2016 revenues to $38.8 billion by 2025. show chapters <p>Samsung buys AI firm to take on Apple and Google</p> <p>The purchase will help the tech firm compete with Siri and Alexa in the world of artificial intelligence.</p> Samsung buys AI firm to take on Apple and Google    Thursday, 6 Oct 2016 | 9:00 AM ET | 04:50 Google has been the most prominent global player, CB noted, with 11 low-key acquisitions in the category. Most recently, the tech giant picked up Api.ai, a platfom used to develop chatbots. Earlier this year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company objective was to give each individual user their own Google. And last week, Google unveiled a high-end smartphone, Pixel, and home device installed with its AI software. Google said it believes that the next opportunity is building hardware and software together for better AI. The strategic move pitted the company against Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Corporate giants following closely in purchasing AI companies include Intel and Apple. Apple, which is usually quite about its acquisitions and planning, acquired Turi and Tuplejump recently, according to CB Insights. Earlier this year, Apple acquired an start-up called Emotient which has developed technology that can detect emotions. Not to be outdone, Samsung snapped up startup Viv Labs, amid a growing controversy over reports that its premium Galaxy Note 7 battery was exploding.

DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Twitter Facebook Instagram Google+ RSS Feed DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Cloud How DreamHost Builds Its Cloud: Architecting the Network October 8, 2016 Written by Luke Odom This is the fourth in a series of posts about how DreamHost builds its Cloud products. Written by Luke Odom straight from the data center operations. So far in this series, we have looked at what processors to use in our machines and what drives we should use. The next thing we are going to look at is how to connect all the machines and switches together. Image Source: Flickr We want to make sure we both have enough bandwidth and that it is fully redundant. Ceph recovery is the cluster’s most network-intensive activity. From experience, we knew that we would use 2-4 Gbps during Ceph recovery. To put that into perspective, the average American home has an Internet connectivity speed of 12.6 Mbps. During Ceph recovery, we are using about 4000 Mbps. This means that Category 5e ethernet cable, which is what most consumers are using for networking, isn’t practical. We needed to use a cable capable of 10Gbps. Here, we have 3 options: 1. The first is to use a form of fiber optics. There are different wavelengths and connectors with fiber optics, but they all work the same way. They work by sending light over a long and exceedingly thin strand of glass. The advantage of fiber is that it has very low latency and takes very little power to operate. The switches are also widely available as they use transceivers plugged into SFP+ ports which are very common. The compatibility page of Cumulus,  the software we run on our switches, highlights that every 10G switch but one is using 10G-SFP+ ports so we have many options available if we go with fiber. The big disadvantage to using fiber is its cost. You need dedicated SFP+ cards, as motherboards don’t usually have that built in, and you also need both transceivers and fiber, both of which are very expensive. Fiber is also more delicate than copper-based wires, which introduces a layer of complexity in  running it or working near it. Extreme care is required to avoid breakages. 2. Another similar option is Twinaxial cable, more commonly referred to as TwinAx. TwinAx uses an SPF+ port as well, but instead of a transceiver and a strand of fiber, you have a transceiver built into a copper cable. You still have the expense of the extra card, but a TwinAx cable is a third of the price of a strand of fiber and transceiver. It is also the same speed and can be used on the same gear. TwinAx is very similar to Coaxial cable, or “Coax.” Coax is used with cable internet and cable TV to transmit signals to consumers’ homes. The difference is that TwinAx has two copper cables instead of one. TwinAx is what we used for the original DreamCompute cluster as it is a great low-cost alternative to fiber! The downside to TwinAx is latency. TwinAx uses pulses of electricity instead of light to send signals. As electrons travel slower than the speed of light, it takes them three times longer to travel down the same length of cable. 3. The third option we considered was 10G-baseT. For the last decade, almost every server we have purchased has had 1G-baseT ports integrated into the motherboard. Most consumer laptops and desktops that have a wired network port today are also 1G-baseT. 1G-baseT and 10GbaseT both use four pairs of very thin twisted copper wire and an rj-45 connector (which looks like a large phone jack), though the cabling standards for 10G are slightly different to handle the higher speeds. 10G-baseT was standardized 10 years ago, but until recently implementations have been very rare and expensive. That started changing last year with the Intel x540 chipset. This allowed inexpensive onboard 10G-baseT, and manufacturers quickly began adding it as an option. Cumulus also started supporting a 10G-baseT switch. Using on-board 10G-baseT and category 6 ethernet is a tenth of the cost of using fiber and significantly cheaper than TwinAx. The downside to 10G-baseT is latency. At the lengths of cable we use, it takes about 0.000001 seconds longer for a signal to get from the computer to the switch. This seems inconsequential, but some applications, such as Ceph, are very latency sensitive. Even slight latency can make a noticeable impact, and requires testing. We decided to use 10G-baseT. Weighed against the minor latency difference demonstrated in our testing, the ease of install and substantially lower price made our choice clear. We also decided to get motherboards with four 10Gbase-T ports. For the initial deployment, we set up 20 Gbps capacity between each machine and the switch. We didn’t want to use more than half the capacity at any given time. This would ensure that we wouldn’t be saturating one port if another port went down. Based on our testing, we didn’t expect to use more than 10 Gbps. As a failsafe, we got the extra two ports to make any necessary upgrades quick and simple if we needed it. Now that we are in production, we haven’t had any spikes of greater than 10Gbps from any individual machine. Still, it is nice to have the ability to add extra capacity if we need it. Stay tuned for our next post in the series, where we answer the question: To converge, or not to converge?

Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Edward Helmore in Pittsburgh Saturday 8 October 2016 07.00 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.28 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger When Uber chose to test its robot-driven taxis in Pittsburgh, some may have wondered why the tech company had chosen America’s former capital of steel for its road test into the future. But for those in the know, Pennsylvania’s second city is well on its way to establishing itself as the Silicon Valley of the east – and even its roads are helping. Unlike many American cities, Pittsburgh road system is literally off the grid, its origins dating back to twisty, pre-revolution forest trails. Then there are the city’s 446 bridges to navigate. More importantly Pittsburgh boasts the robotics department at Carnegie-Mellon University, recognized as the leading academic institution in the field. Uber’s first self-driving car spotted in Pittsburgh Read more It was here last month that Pittsburgh opened its doors to show the world why it is so well positioned to be a new tech hub. The city is now in a position to capitalize on the infrastructure of the past in ways that could not have been anticipated at the depths of its post-industrial depression two decades ago, when the city’s population was half its industry peak and the unemployment rate was worse than in Detroit. Last week, the city hosted Thrival, a three-day showcase of panel discussions and exhibitions designed to show off the city’s post-industrial charms. From robotics to biotech, performing arts to healthcare, the city’s premier boosters – many locals or returning natives – sought to describe the city’s upswing. The twin keys to the city’s current success, says the festival’s executive producer, Dan Law, are education and medicine – eds and meds – that helped bridge the gap between old industrial Pittsburgh and a new Pittsburgh that’s about innovation and technology. Now, instead of leaving, students from Pittsburgh’s tech university departments have more options to stay. “Eds and meds are the bedrock of the economic transition,” says Law. “UPMC – University of Pittsburgh Medical Center – alone is a $13bn health system and there are dozens of ancillary industries that began to innovate. So young people started to get jobs here and economic growing around the core economic pillars.” Correspondingly, the city’s arts and culture are thriving. “The City of Bridges is in the throes of a full-on nose-to-tail, barrel-aged, small-plates culinary renaissance,” according to Bon Appetit magazine. It rated one Spanish restaurant, Morcilla, the fourth best restaurant in the US. There’s a trendy Ace Hotel that was originally a YMCA and, of course, the Warhol Museum, dedicated to its most famous artist, and the Carnegie Museums of Art. How community-led renovation is helping a rundown Pittsburgh neighbourhood fight crime Read more “At the centre of it all, Pittsburgh is becoming a diversified innovation economy,” say Luke Skurman, founder of Niche.com and one of the founders of Thrill Mill, a not-for-profit organization providing mentorship and collaborative workspace to early-stage startups. “When I graduated Carnegie Mellon and stayed, people thought I was bananas. Now it’s becoming fashionable to do so.” Among the attendees at Thrival were Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian American neuropathologist who was the first to discover and publish findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players, and Jennifer Krusius, general manager at Uber. The transportation firm has about 500 employees in the city’s tech Strip district and plans to start testing as many as 100 Volvo sport utility vehicles on the city’s streets. Many of Uber’s employees were hired directly from Carnegie-Mellon’s computer labs and the state’s approach to the technology – called greenlight governing – effectively encouraged investment in the field. Uber estimates its investment will reach $1bn over the next few years. “It’s not just about self-driving cars,” says Law. “It’s about the future of urban mobility. How do you create smarter and more efficient cities.” Pittsburgh is ideal, he says, “because if you are going to design a car that needs to navigate some of the most complex road networks and systems, you’re not going to get a bigger challenge than here. It’s old, it was planned poorly, it’s built around hills and valleys, and the roads are windy and steep. If it works in Pittsburgh, it can work anywhere.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A self-driving Uber car drives navigates one of Pittsburgh’s many bridges. Photograph: Gene J Puskar/AP The firm is not alone: General Motors, Google – which has centered its engineering facilities here and employs 600 – and Intel have also come to Pittsburgh. While Apple, which employs 500 here, has not stated the reason for its interest, it is known to have already developed a prototype vehicle. But the city’s easy-going regulatory approach and an intelligent workforce is not the only reason Pittsburgh is becoming ground zero for auto-automation, widely regarded as one of the largest untapped economies. Google’s Mike Capsambelis explains the company’s explicit interest in Pittsburgh is machine learning, a sub-field of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. In other words, learning without needing to be explicitly programmed. “It’s uniquely a collaborative place. We tend to work together even when there’s actual competition,” says Capsambelis. Pittsburgh water: expensive, rust-colored, corrosive, and high in lead Read more Rasu Shrestha, chief innovation officer at UPMC, says healthcare is a natural fit for machine learning. Healthcare, he says, is so muchabout billing and book-keeping. “We want to free the data, to empower patients and consumers to take charge of their own data with the right sets of systems,” says Shrestha. “So the question is, how do we do a better job of precision medicine, not just do a better job of billing and documentation? The entrepreneurial knack is not just to create incremental innovation but to change the entire dynamic of healthcare innovation.” Tech companies, including Google, eye healthcare’s copious resources of data – UPMC’s nine petabytes of data is doubling every 18 months – with some envy. And vice versa. Says Shrestha: “Let’s create solutions that leverage machine learning and big-data-type technologies to create products we can then commercialize.” There may also be a natural symbiosis between healthcare advances and tech’s interest in transport. An ageing population suggests more will need assistance in terms of mobility. “There’s a ton of connections and overlap,” says Capsambelis. “A lot of people will still need cars, but there won’t be as many drivers.” The spirit of entrepreneurship suffuses the robotics lab at Carnegie-Mellon. Not only has tech become a major employer of the university’s graduates, but much of the computational power that was once available only to universities or government laboratories is now available to research. “Having machine learning has really changed the way we do research because the things we used to do at the university, companies can do much better because of their access to huge computing power and big data,” says professor of computer science Lenore Blum. But the city and its promoters at Thrival and Thrill Mill are keen to show off the small entrepreneurs along with the grand-scale technology behemoths that are beginning to occupy the same psychic space in the culture that the robber barons Carnegie and Frick did here in the late 19th century. An app for artists to find spaces, for instance, or a machine-learning ECG device for early stroke detection. Another involves cooking recipes for the sight-impaired. They may not or ever be Google or Uber but they are nonetheless imbibing Pittsburgh’s spirit of innovation. “It looks more like a continuum to us,” says Thrill Mill’s Stephan Mueller, “because we all have this fatal love for Pittsburgh and want to do something for it.” More features Topics Pennsylvania Apple Uber Google Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?
