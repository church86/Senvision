Twitter Facebook Back from dead: Intel's Atom chip, in Panasonic's $2,189 Android tablet Panasonic's Toughbook FZ-A2 uses an Intel Atom chip and runs Android 6.0 Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 13 January, 2017 08:19 - - - - print email Comments Intel is phasing out Atom chips from mobile devices and has scaled back Android development for such devices. But Panasonic has come out with a new tablet with an Atom chip and Android 6.0 anyway. Panasonic's new Toughbook FZ-A2 has a crazy starting price of US $2,189, and its Atom x5-Z8550 chip is a big problem. Atom chips are almost disappearing from tablets, especially devices with Android. There are also questions on whether the Toughbook will get upgraded to the newer Android 7.0, code-named Nougat. Panasonic didn't provide a response to the query. Panasonic's release of the new Toughbook with Android is an interesting move, especially as other PC makers abandon Atom and excitement around Android tablets fade. Dell last year stopped selling Android tablets -- which had x86 chips -- and won't be delivering OS upgrades to its existing Venue devices. Last year Lenovo started offering the Atom x5-Z8550 chip in its Yoga Book 2-in-1, which can be purchased with Windows or Android. The Yoga Book is unique as it replaces a hard keyboard with a virtual keypad, much like on tablets. At the time, Lenovo had to turn to Atom as the chip was ready for Android. But now, Intel is focusing on Windows, and promoting low-power Core, Pentium, and Celeron chips for tablets and 2-in-1s. The chipmaker continues to work with Google on Chromebooks and IoT devices using the Brillo OS, which is based on Android. Most Android tablets have chips based on ARM architecture, which dominates the mobile market. Panasonic's Toughbooks are known for their rugged features. The Toughbook FZ-A2 is water resistant and can withstand a 1.2-meter drop. The tablet is not targeted at average users. It's for enterprise users and field workers who use tablets in harsh conditions. Panasonic also offers rugged tablets with Windows. The Toughbook FZ-A2 has a 10.1-inch screen with a 1920 x 1200 pixel resolution. The tablet offers nine hours of battery life. The battery is replaceable. With all its aging technology, the tablet is keeping up with a USB Type-C port, a USB 3.0 port and Wi-Fi. The tablet can be bought with 4G LTE capabilities. It also has Bluetooth 4.2.

You can find it online for around $230.Photo by Intel What's an NUC? That stands for "next unit of computing," which is Intel's name for a line of mini desktop computers. Often, these are bare-bones systems that ship without an operating system or even all the required components, but the new NUC6CAYS model popping up in online stores now is a ready to run Windows 10 machine. And for everything that the preconfigured Intel NUC6CAYS has (Intel will also release a bare-bones version), it's an attractively affordable option. Intel's recommended customer price is $215 (converts to AU$297 and £175), but right now you can find it online at Amazon and Newegg for around $230 (converts to AU$318 and £187). It has an HDMI port that supports 4K.Photo by Intel NUCs, around since 2012, are basically one step up from a Compute Stick. Though they're usually pricier than similar mini PC counterparts made by other manufacturers, the NUC6CAYS bucks the trend with its low price and impressive specs.

Intel’s platform uses a system of HD cameras positioned around a sporting venue along with servers to capture and create a 3D rendering – from multiple angles--  of the on-field action.    RELATED: Intel Acquires Replay Technologies   “We tasked Intel to push their amazing Intel 360 Replay technology to the limit of what it could do, using their array of cameras circling the stadium to synthesize a player’s view on the field,” said Michael Davies, FOX Sports SVP of Field & Technical Operations.   “The cameras, backed up by a huge bank of Intel computing power, allow a moment to be recreated in 3D space, so that a ‘virtual camera’ can be placed at the player’s eye line -- not unlike how limitless camera views can be created in video games,” Michael Davies, Fox Sports’s SVP of field and technical operations, said in a statement.  “This broadcast enhancement is like no other -- it literally brings the audience down to the viewpoint of the player at the critical decision-making moment. What other choices did he have? Was his sight blocked? It all looks much different from field level, and can assist our announcers in describing what actually happened on the field.”   This video from the Foster Farms Bowl game between Indiana and Utah illustrates the POV feature that will be employed for Super Bowl LI.    Fox Sports said its production for Super Bowl LI, set for Feb. 5 at NRG Stadium in Houston, will utilize three production trucks and more than 30 cameras (including the use of Super Motion and 4K cameras) to deliver more than 20 hours of programming a day from “Discovery Green” in the city, and 70-plus cameras to cover the game itself.  Want to read more stories like this?

However, with Kaby Lake Intel is shaking up its Pentium-class processors a bit by introducing the first Pentium CPUs in years to feature Hyper-Threading technology. The last Pentium processor to feature hyper threading was the Pentium 4, which has been retired for many years now. Since then, the Pentium brand has been used for Intel’s low-end processors with fewer features. With Kaby Lake, this feature set is changing, with multiple Pentium SKUs being introduced that support hyper threading, meaning Pentium-based systems will have additional virtual cores on top of the physical ones. There are some additional improvements coming to Kaby Lake Pentiums though, including a 100MHz clock speed boost compared to last generation’s Skylake chips. There is also support for Intel’s Memory Protection Extensions, TSX-NI instructions and more. Those features are more likely to impress enterprise users or developers though, rather than regular system building customers. Prices won’t be rising at all, which is probably partially due to the fact that AMD is gearing up to take on the CPU market once more. This isn’t the only shake up we’ve seen Intel make in the low end with Kaby Lake though, this generation also brought along the first Core i3 with an unlocked multiplier, making them easier to overclock. KitGuru Says: While Intel might not be convincing many Skylake Core i7 or Core i5 owners to upgrade, with changes like these, we may see more low-end CPU users looking to make the jump this generation.  Similar Posts Categories Tags Related Related Tags: Intelkaby lakenews Categorized Under: CPU Polls Your next gaming screen should be?

And it really tried. The idea was a good one: Create a core computing module that could be surrounded with different cases and accessories so it could be customized for any use and reconfigured as needed. The idea was so good, but the core technology so flawed, that the concept has been bouncing around for nearly 20 years. Finally, with the Intel Compute Card, Intel may have finally gotten it right. With a lot of revolutionary things, the idea significantly leads the ability for technology to make it real. But, if the idea is good enough, it hangs in there until the technology can catch up. Let’s talk about the problems and promise of a true modular computer. IBM’s Revolutionary Modular Idea Today, the idea of a core module with computing capability doesn’t seem that revolutionary to all of us walking around with smartphones. But back in the 1990s, when we thought laptops at five pounds were incredibly light, desktop computers were these huge beige boxes that sat on desks, and the Simon smartphone was compared to a brick, it was pretty amazing. The idea was that you needed something more flexible, and if you could spread the cost of the core technology (processor, graphics, memory and storage) across a number of form factors, you could create something that was far more cost-effective than the combination of laptop/desktop/PDA that we had. Realize that, then, desktops cost in the $2K range, laptops in the $3K range, and PDAs like the Apple Newton were around a grand. That means to have one of each would set you back around $7K, but if you could reuse those core components you could get something very similar, and your data would automatically move between forms, for something closer to $4K, for a whopping $3K savings. It looked good on paper, but IBM at the time was bleeding money and had just had a series of revolutionary PC products flop in market. Even though IBM CEO Louis Gerstner seemed to like the concept, he killed it. And, to be clear, it likely wouldn’t have worked because, to get the module small enough, you had to make some rather massive performance tradeoffs, so you ended up with a desktop that was slow, a laptop that was slow, and a PDA that had impressive performance but no battery life. Dell’s Secret Success One of the things that we rarely talk about is Dell’s very successful imbedded computer business. This is on point because for around a decade, Dell has been selling what amounts to a modular desktop computer into industries like health care, and made billions doing it. Basically, for industries where computing is needed as part of the solution, Dell has one designed to fit into the solution and then handles support of the computing unit. This allows the company with the solution to focus on the part it is expert at, while Dell handles the part with the computer, lowering the price not only of the solution but of the support, as well. This unit is massively successful. Intel’s Compute Card However, a lot has changed in the last 15 years. As a result of the massive move to mobile, Intel can build a processor with decent battery life and low cost for the core module (about the size of a thick credit card). In addition, form factors have exploded as vendors have added computing power to everything from cars to vacuum cleaners, all of which could benefit from a common core computing module and operating platform. This means you get a computer with decent performance in a form factor in line with a smartphone that then can be imbedded in a variety of solutions and, with appropriate cloud backup and restore services, removed and replaced by the user or support tech in a matter of moments if there is a problem. In addition, because these things are now solid state, their failure rate is a fraction of what it was when we used rotating media. While I doubt we’ll see these in smartphones or even in regular PC solutions at first (though they would make an interesting desktop alternative, particularly in places where security requires the machines be removed and/or destroyed quickly), they will likely find themselves in even more interesting places than Dell’s solution did. Given that Dell has the organization already in place to use something like this, Dell is, at least initially, likely to be the biggest beneficiary. HP and Lenovo will clearly be working on this as well. Wrapping Up: IBM’s Old Idea Is New Again It is interesting to see the PC industry evolve. In this case, from large dedicated PCs to small card-like devices that can be built into a variety of increasingly connected devices in all shapes, sizes and colors. The old IBM team should be proud; their idea has morphed from something interesting to something almost magical. Now it will be up to their successors to see if they can do some incredibly interesting things with it. I’m betting they will.

It's Now Possible To Disable & Strip Down Intel's ME Blob Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 12 January 2017 at 02:00 PM EST. 40 Comments Many free software advocates have been concerned by Intel's binary-only Management Engine (ME) built into the motherboards on newer generations of Intel motherboards. The good news is there is now a working, third-party approach for disabling the ME and reducing the risk of its binary blobs. Via an open-source, third-party tool called me_cleaner it's possible to partially deblob Intel's ME firmware images by removing any unnecessary partitions from the firmware, reducing its ability to interface with the system. The me_cleaner works not only with free software firmware images like Coreboot/Libreboot but can also work with factory-blobbed images. I was able to confirm with a Coreboot developer that this program can disable the ME on older boards or devices with BootGuard and disable Secure Boot. This is all done with a Python script. Those unfamiliar with the implications on Intel's ME for those wanting a fully-open system can read about it on Libreboot.org. ME_Cleaner has been tested with boards ranging from Nehalem to Skylake with ME engines ranging from 6.0 to 11.x. With the exception of some Ibex Peak boards and not yet testing Broadwell mobile systems, ME_Cleaner is working as outlined via this matrix. Those wishing to learn about ME_Cleaner for trying to eliminate Intel's Management Engine form your system as much as possible can visit the GitHub project site to learn more. 40 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The culprit is the debugging interface of the CPU that can be accessed through USB. Positive Technologies discovered that on some Intel CPus the debugging interface is accessible through USB 3.0. This allows specially prepared USB sticks to take full control over the computer. With full control over the computer it’s possible to install malware of eavesdrop on activity on the computer without detection of security software. It’s also possible to brick the PC because the debugging interface makes it possible to fully overwrite the BIOS. The bug is relatively easy to exploit as no special equipment is required, according to the researchers. However, attackers do need physical access to the system and the bug only appears to be only present on Skylake U CPUs that are only used in NUCs and Ultrabooks. On older CPUs this was not possible because the debugging interface could only be accessed using a special (expensive) device. The security researchers demonstrated their method (video) during the 33rd Chaos Communication Congress held in Hamburg, Germany.

SUBSCRIBE Super Bowl LI advertisers: Here are the brands gearing up for game day Marketing Land is keeping track of this year's Super Bowl LI brands, with updates as new advertisers and campaign details are announced. Amy Gesenhues on January 12, 2017 at 1:00 pm More With less than a month before Super Bowl LI’s kickoff, brands are gearing up to take the field in hopes their campaigns will have a lasting effect on their advertising goals throughout the rest of 2017. Today, Intel released a 30-second spot scheduled to air during Fox’s Super Bowl broadcast on Sunday, February 5. The ad, featuring NFL MVP Tom Brady, showcases Intel’s 360-degree replay technology — the same technology Fox will be using when it airs the game. While we are starting to see more announcements around this year’s Super Bowl brands, advertisers haven’t been as quick to share their Super Bowl ads or teaser ads this year compared to Super Bowl 50. Last year, both Wix and Butterfinger had released teaser ads before the start of the year.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 12, 2017 at 12:42PM Earlier this month, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) released a whole slew of chips as part of its seventh-generation Core processor family. The chipmaker had previously released a handful of seventh-generation Core processors aimed at ultra-low power laptops late last year, but waited until early January of this year to roll out chips appropriate for a broader range of personal computers, including desktop computers. Image source: Intel.  Intel's desktop personal computer lineup consists of chips sold under the Celeron, Pentium, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 brands, in order of pricing, performance, and features. Intel's Pentium and Celeron desktop processors are not branded as "Core" but are, at least for desktop computer-oriented products, based on de-featured variants of its workhorse Core processor designs.   As part of the de-featuring, Intel would reduce frequencies (higher is better), disable portions of the graphics processors (making them less capable of handling 3D graphics workloads, like video games), and even turn off features fundamental to the processor cores.  One such feature is called hyper-threading (HT), Intel's marketing term for a feature more generally known as simultaneous multithreading (SMT). This allows a processor core's resources to be better utilized in some cases, as HT makes each processor core appear to software as multiple processor cores (two, in the case of Intel's chip designs).  Image source: Intel.  This is a feature that helps speed up applications that can take advantage of multiple processor cores, and can also aid in allowing systems to better handle several tasks concurrently. In its desktop processor product line, Intel had traditionally reserved HT for its dual-core Core i3 processors as well as its quad-core Core i7 processors, disabling the feature in its mid-range Core i5 and low-end Celeron and Pentium processors. However, as PC World's Gorgon Mah Ung points out, Intel's seventh-generation Pentium processors now include this feature. Let's take a closer look at the potential business reasons why Intel is finally bringing this feature to those lower-cost chips. An easy, margin-neutral way to boost performance Hyperthreading is a technology that's fundamentally built into all of Intel's Core architecture based processors; Intel's marketing department simply chooses to disable it in certain models for market segmentation reasons. Image source: Intel.  This means that chips with the technology enabled don't carry a fundamentally higher cost structure than ones that don't. The idea behind Intel's market segmentation practices is simple: It wants to give customers incentives to purchase higher-end products by reserving features and functionality for higher-end chips to keep its average selling prices as high as possible. At the same time, though, Intel needs to be sure that it delivers additional performance at established price points each year so that computer makers can offer faster computers without raising prices on consumers.  Intel enabling Hyperthreading on the lower-end Pentium chips is a way for the company to increase performance on these chips without ballooning its cost structure, which could translate into either price hikes or gross profit margin reductions.  It also serves to further differentiate the company's Pentium offerings from the even lower-end Celeron processors, which still -- per Intel's ARK product page -- come with HT disabled.  The catch PC World sought industry analyst Kevin Krewell's input on Intel's move here, and he brought up a good point (his analysis is paraphrased by PC World): One issue for Intel, Tirias Research analyst Kevin Krewell noted, is the lack of air between its pricier Core i3 and Pentiums. For example, the dual-core 3.9GHz Core i3-7100 costs $117 in volume and has Hyper-Threading and graphics. The dual-core 3.7GHz Pentium G4620 costs $86 to $93, has Hyper-Threading and HD 630 graphics. For that roughly 25% increase in price, all the customer gets is about a 5-percent performance boost. While it may be the case that the lower price-to-performance ratio of the lowest end Core i3 relative to the Pentium G4620 could impact the appeal of the i3 chip to those who buy chips directly to build/upgrade their own computers, most chips are sold as part of pre-assembled personal computers. Typical consumers probably don't know (or care) about these "speeds and feeds," and thus may find value in picking Core i3-based systems for a couple of reasons: System vendors tend to bundle better system components around faster processors, so even if a customer might not necessarily think the extra processor performance is worth it, the Core i3 systems are likely to offer better features elsewhere; and Intel has done a good job of establishing that its Core brand is a premium one relative to Pentium/Celeron (which have been relegated to budget personal computers for a while). This means that a customer who isn't paying attention to the speeds and feeds may believe that even the lowest-end Core i3 processor will deliver a significantly better user experience than the best Pentium processors.  What investors should watch Intel typically reports the changes in both unit shipments and average selling prices of its notebook and desktop processors separately in each quarter on year-to-date, year-over-year, and sequential bases. Investors interested in seeing if Intel's new strategy has a significant impact on product mix should pay attention to the changes that Intel reports in its desktop platform average selling prices in the coming quarters.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Image Credit: Intel There was a time when computer chip makers had no interest in car electronics. But times have changed as self-driving cars and the artificial intelligence used to pilot them have taken off. Now those cars are set to consume a huge amount of computing power and generate a ton of data to be processed in the cloud, internet-connected data centers. And that’s why Intel is excited about self-driving cars. It is pushing forward with technologies such as AI, computer vision, 5G wireless connectivity, and infotainment centers in vehicles. At CES 2017, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas last week, Intel said it had developed 5G infrastructure chips that will bring connectivity to self-driving cars, and it also said it was working with BMW on cars of the future. And it bought a stake in the mapping firm Here. Doug Davis is senior vice president and general manager of the automated driving group at Intel. I caught up with Davis at CES 2017 to discuss Intel’s announcements, including its new Intel Go brand for cars. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview. Above: Doug Davis is head of the automated driving group at Intel. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VentureBeat: Autonomous cars are big this year. Do you have any news at the show on that front? Doug Davis: We announced a new brand called Intel Go. It’s intended to comprehend what we’re doing from an autonomous driving standpoint. Within that, this week we announced a development platform that spans from our Intel Atom product family all the way to the Intel Xeon product family. It’s a development platform for 5G development. It’s (field programmable gate array) FPGA-based, so it allows developers to get started now on 5G for automotive applications. There’s also a software development kit that spans from the car to the cloud, to get developers up and running on those kinds of applications. The other thing we announced this week that’s directly attributable to what we’re doing in the autonomous space is our 5G modem. It’s the first modem device available for 5G. It’s the second half of 2017. VB: Every autonomous car is going to need one, basically? Davis: I wouldn’t say you can’t do an autonomous vehicle without 5G. A lot of the development on cars that are already out on the road is done on 4G LTE technology. But as we look at mainstream deployment, if you’ve been hearing from all the different OEMs, they’re all gravitating to about 2021 as a time frame they’re shooting for. You look at the timing of 5G, it’s very similar. As we get autonomous vehicles on the road, we’ll go from being drivers to passengers. As passengers we’ll have a lot of spare time. We can do work, do some shopping, watch our favorite series from whatever service we like to watch. That 5G bandwidth will be able to support the end-to-end artificial intelligence that’s necessary for these vehicles. It’ll be able to supply us with broadband connectivity for the things we want to do in the car. But it’ll also have the latency, the speed, to be able to support what’s called “V-to-X.” Vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to infrastructure, vehicle to pedestrian. 5G will support that as well. As we look at when these mainstream fleets of autonomous vehicles begin to get out on the road and the timing for 5G, we think it’ll be an important capability to combine together there. In the meantime we’ll see development happening on 4G technologies, obviously. VB: In autonomous cars, Jen-Hsun Huang says they have a three-year head start at Nvidia. Davis: But if you think about it, we have our 5G development platform now. You can put that in a car and begin doing development work. They’ll both have a long development cycle, but their timing is very similar. VB: They got into a cycle of announcing car supercomputer chips. A couple of them are out there now already. For Intel, what’s the road map? Have you put any word out as to which kind of processor will be your main processor for these applications? Davis: I can say, “Yes, and…” When we think about autonomous driving, it’s not just one chip. An autonomous vehicle will become an artificial intelligence implementation. To be able to put these cars on the road, especially when you think about putting large fleets on the road or making them consumer vehicles, you need to be able to build a model of the vehicle’s behavior. You’ll do that in the data center. That becomes your trained model, built using massive amounts of data. That trained model will then be deployed into the car, the inference that sits in the vehicle. That inference then defines the behavior of the car. But the car will also be collecting lots of data and sending it back to the data center. When we think about this, the data center, the network infrastructure, and the vehicle are all important elements of delivering the solution. The connectivity part of it is very important. Training in the data center will happen on Xeon, Xeon Phi FPGAs. We’ll have accelerator devices to accelerate certain algorithms via what we’re doing with Nirvana. If you think about what’s happening in the network infrastructure, they’re moving the software-defined networks with certain functions that get virtualized in the network. We’re delivering Atom through Xeon technologies to support that. Above: Intel believes that AI will be a huge part of car computing in the future. Image Credit: Intel In the car — everybody wants to talk about fully autonomous vehicles, but there will be an evolution from driver assist L3 all the way up to L4 and L5. We have products that support that capability. From a compute standpoint, it ranges from Atom for driver assist functions now up to Xeon for fully autonomous. But FPGAs play an important role in that. We have FPGA technology that scales accordingly. We’ve talked a lot about communications with that connectivity part that will sit in the vehicle. When we think about these things, it’s much more than just a chip. It’s the ability to deliver an end-to-end artificial intelligence implementation. You think about all those things I just described, nobody else in the industry has that breadth of assets. VB: You have the car-makers and their suppliers, and all the startups in the space. Who do you work with? Have you set up all those relationships? Davis: We described the range of companies. There are the OEMs building cars. There are tier one suppliers providing them, typically, with the compute elements that go into the car. Intel would be considered a tier two. We supply products and technologies to the tier ones. That’s the role we play in the industry. We’re also very mindful and respectful of our OEMs that we work with. For those that are to a stage where they’re ready to talk about who they’re working with — of course, we’re thrilled to make those kinds of announcements. We’ve talked about the work we’re doing with BMW and Baidu. Delphi recently acknowledged they’re working with us on the solution they’re building for the OEMs. But today, if you think about all the different autonomous vehicles in development, there are more than 200 based on Intel technology now. We have engagements with many OEMs, many tier ones, but we’re not naming those companies unless they’re at a stage where they’re ready to talk about it. VB: I was chatting with ARM a bit. They were saying that the ecosystem is changing a lot. In the microcontroller era, everybody had some very specific function they were doing. The suppliers would handle that — chips for the brakes or whatever. It would stay in that section. But now it’s more general-purpose computing and software that spreads across the whole car. No single supplier can be so narrow anymore. Davis: Obviously our focus, up until recently, has been around infotainment. We’ve done quite a bit for the past several years around driver assist and autonomous technologies, but the infotainment space is an interesting one. We’ve been advocating a technology road map that says you can start to consolidate numerous functions in our microprocessor. We have entertainment and navigation in that center stack, the screen that sits in the middle of the dash. Then the instrument cluster is becoming a display. Rear-view mirrors are becoming a display. The outside mirrors will ultimately become a display. Rear-seat entertainment includes displays. We’ve been advocating for quite some time — why can’t you have all these systems running on a single microprocessor with an operating system that provides a level of robustness and reliability that’s necessary, and then virtualize those workloads on top of that microprocessor? Above: The Intel Go platform will span from the car to the cloud. Image Credit: Intel If you get a chance to go by the Delphi booth, they have a great demo in there using our Intel Atom processor 3900, the Apollo Lake. They have a cockpit, if you will, where they’re running the infotainment system and the instrument cluster on one Apollo Lake processor. They can reboot the infotainment system and the instrument cluster remains fully functional, despite the fact that you’re rebooting the entire infotainment platform. If the system has a significant problem, it has the ability to still sustain the necessary level of performance. You don’t lose the instrument cluster. It’s a great demo. It shows exactly what you described in this space. They’re even talking about the ability to drive seven different displays simultaneously with one microprocessor. They have a cool cockpit where they’ve taken the instrument cluster and the infotainment system, and then this little clock display down here. They’re multiple displays stacked together. The one on top is fully transparent, so the instrument cluster is three-dimensional. Your infotainment platform is three-dimensional. The little clock is three-dimensional. Each of them is two screens sandwiched together. These gauges really look like physical objects. It’s one of the coolest things I’ve seen. Sorry, but I’m a little excited about it. [laughs] VB: You had your BMW announcement here. Davis: Wednesday morning, Intel and BMW and Mobileye had a press event at BMW’s booth. We talked about the progress we’ve made over the last six months. We announced the partnership back on July 1. This was a report on the progress we’ve made. We’re making great progress on the development of the platform we’ve described, and on this whole notion of how we can work together with other OEMs and tier ones. We said at the beginning that we wanted that to be a state-of-the-art platform that could be used by others in the industry as well. The work that we’re doing isn’t just limited to BMW. We’re continuing that development to enable that capability. We talked a bit about the work that’s going on. We defined this to a level of detail. There are 19 different work streams that define all the effort to make that happen. We also talked about the number of cars that are being built and put on the road in 2017. We’ll have as many as 40 cars on the road being used to do this development work. If you think about the number of autonomous vehicles out there now, that’s a pretty big number. We’re making good progress. Above: Intel Go Image Credit: Intel We announced the stake and the work we’re doing with Here. There’s really two objectives there. The first is to be able to work together with them on the data center technologies and capabilities they’re developing to be able to create, deliver, and update high-definition maps, and then the way in which they’ll be deployed to vehicles on the road. From an Intel perspective, there’s a lot of technology around the data center and how that gets optimized, and the way in which these maps can be delivered through network service providers. In the data center, Here will maintain these high-definition maps of, essentially, the planet. But when you’re in an autonomous vehicle, you probably don’t need a map of the whole planet in your car if you’re only driving around Vegas. Those cars will get updates based on their location. If you think about driving from Vegas to Phoenix, you’ll get updates of those maps as your trip progresses. The way in which those maps get deployed through the networks will be important. We’ll work together with them to figure out how you build and optimize and deliver these maps, as well as the way in which the car downloads and uses them. The other part is working together with OEMs as far as how they implement the maps within their cars, integrating that into their autonomous vehicles. Above: Interior of Panasonic’s concept car for autonomous driving. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VB: Do you have a sense of how big this whole auto ecosystem is, with so many startups involved? Nvidia was saying that just in AI alone, they’re working with 1,500 startups, and it seems like a lot of those are in cars. Davis: When we step back and think about AI, it will span a lot of different applications: health care, manufacturing, drug development, all kinds of things. We’re building an artificial intelligence capability as a company, an end-to-end artificial intelligence capability. The car just happens to be a very complex, comprehensive implementation of artificial intelligence that will be very visible, because we interact with cars on a daily basis. I don’t know about exact numbers. I haven’t heard a number like that. But it’s clear in the industry that it’s a hot area. A lot of startups, a lot of development. I think there will be a lot of technology investment in that space for a while. Part of it — I always say these things happen when they become economically viable. We’ve all talked about AI for a very long time, but we’re reaching a point where you have the compute and storage capacity in the data center to cost-effectively go do this broad range of AI implementations. You have the ability to deploy those cost-effectively through the networks. Thanks to Moore’s Law, we have the ability to put enough compute and storage in a device to deploy these kinds of solutions. AI has been around a long time, but it’s a confluence of those things, as well as all the software we need to fuel it. It’s kind of like the internet of things. I like to say that the internet of things is an overnight sensation that’s 20 years in the making. It’s because the compute, the connectivity, the cost of sensors, all those things have finally reached a point where it’s economically viable to implement them.

SUBSCRIBE Intel’s Super Bowl LI ad turns NFL MVP Tom Brady’s daily routines into epic experiences The 30-second spot showcases Intel's 360-degree replay technology, the same technology Fox Broadcasting will use during the game. Amy Gesenhues on January 12, 2017 at 12:15 pm More Intel has recruited Super Bowl veteran and MVP Tom Brady for its 30-second “Brady Everyday” Super Bowl ad scheduled to air during Fox’s broadcast of the game on February 5. The spot features Tom Brady doing his usual daily routines, but with the added experience of Intel’s 360-degree replay technology — the same technology that will be used by Fox during the Super Bowl broadcast. Brady is just brushing his teeth or fixing a pancake, but Intel’s 360-degree replay effects make his most mundane tasks look larger than life. “For the first time, a company is airing an advertisement during the Super Bowl that is actually part of the broadcast and part of the game itself,” said Intel CMO Steve Fund in a release announcing the brand’s Super Bowl campaign. Fund said it was a “true example of innovative marketing” and that Tom Brady was the perfect partner for the brand because, “… he exemplifies high performance and is one of the best quarterbacks of all time.” Intel will also bring a new “Be the Player” viewer-experience to this year’s Super Bowl broadcast, using the 360-degree replay technology to “freeze a moment” during the game so that it can be seen from the player’s viewpoint. “The technology can bring a viewer onto the field from the quarterback’s position to see what it’s like to catch the snap, see the options and feel the pressure of the line rushing toward them,” reports Intel. As part of the campaign, Intel has also launched a site where NFL fans can create their own frame of Tom Brady to add to user-generated videos. Intel says it will create an online gallery of the best images created.

Josh Miller/CNET Wearable Tech by Scott Stein January 12, 2017 8:59 AM PST @jetscott Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS A Vive headset was lowered over my face, and a rifle placed in my hands. The cleared-out room space around me was ready for me to take on a few waves of attackers. All around me, I saw enemies coming. I ducked, I aimed, I ran towards a wall and tried to hide. And it was pretty amazing stuff, maybe the best time I had in Las Vegas over a busy CES week. All because I wasn't tripping over any wires. Wireless dongles are here (if you're willing to pay) TPCast's wireless adapter for the Vive (with a version also coming for the Oculus Rift) is very real, and it really works. It's arriving in the second quarter of this year, and it streams audio and video to the PC-connected Vive headset, removing the last tether between my VR gear and the rest of the physical world. Going wireless with Vive means no tripping when turning, and it works with no lag.Photo by Josh Miller/CNET It's the best example of wireless VR I've ever seen, and it turns the Vive into a true Holodeck experience. But, at $300 for a snap-on thing that sits on your head and also requires a separate battery pack on a tether, it's gear on top of gear. The battery lasts either two or five hours, depending on how big the battery pack you buy. TPCast's solution is one of several coming this year: another, an Oculus/Vive wireless adapter from KwikVR, is also coming (I didn't get a chance to try KwikVR at CES, though). These gadgets are building onto existing hardware. But, amazingly, it really works well. I didn't feel any lag, and being totally cable-free changed the way VR felt. I was still smothered in a helmet and other gear, but it felt more relaxed, more natural. All I could keep thinking was, when will this be built into the actual headset? Last year's solution to wireless PC VR was strapping on a backpack PC. This year, it's an expensive wireless dongle. A better answer might not be coming anytime soon. More advanced wireless tech like WiGig, that could handle this level of wireless video and data throughput, isn't here quite yet, and it's unclear what building such powerful wireless into a headset would mean for adding bulk or batteries. New cameras, like Google Tango, could make mobile VR more...mobile.Photo by James Martin/CNET Mobile wireless: Just add movement In mobile VR, wireless has already been available: slot your phone in, and you're ready. But mobile VR currently lacks walk-across-the-room positional tracking, or "six degrees of freedom." That means you can't lean forward, or go for a stroll. Instead, with Gear VR or Daydream, you sit and turn your head. But it's coming, thanks to possibilities from Google's depth-sensing Tango cameras combining with Daydream View VR in phones like the Asus Zenfone AR. Qualcomm's vision for mobile VR powered by its new Snapdragon processors allows for walking around too, provided you have a wide-angle lens on your phone. In Qualcomm's Power Rangers demo, walking around was halfway decent. If a cheap phone VR headset let me walk around like this for a few basic apps, I'd be satisfied in a pinch. It's not great, but it works. Intel's Project Alloy is a VR headset worth waiting for We tried Intel's all-in-one VR headset that doesn't need cables or a computer and lets you roam freely in the real world... Just watch out for walls. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 1:40 Close Drag Putting the whole PC on your head: Intel's Project Alloy In more advanced PC and console gaming VR, cutting the cord is more complicated, because all the processing's done on a big box somewhere else, not on your face. So, what about just taking it all and wrapping it around your skull? Intel has a number of VR and AR initiatives, from creating VR content like immersive 3D video to Project Alloy, a headset that promises to capture real-world data with embedded cameras, then blends that into virtual reality. Project Alloy isn't like HoloLens. Instead of the HoloLens' see-through visor that projects images so they seem like they're floating in real space, Alloy looks like a regular VR headset, with no see-through element. It's bulky, too. But Alloy is a full Windows PC, built on Intel's Kaby Lake chips. It's compatible with Windows Holographic, Microsoft's cross-platform initiative to support multiple VR, AR and mixed-reality devices in the next Windows 10 update this year. It's a reference design for how mixed (or, per Intel, "merged") reality headsets could be built on Windows hardware. I played a simple shooter demo during my time at CES in Las Vegas, where I held a small wireless motion remote and aimed at flying drones as I ran around a little base station on some sci-fi planet. Project Alloy could track my walking with its built-in cameras and sensors, offering six degrees of freedom via its cameras along with tilt and gyro sensors. Alloy could also scan my room with its cameras, theoretically adding my furniture and room dimensions into VR. But it doesn't seem like it'll happen in real-time. The room scan had already happened before my demo started, and I was in a prepared demo room with a table and sofas that were set by Intel. Even then, the objects showed up as rough polygon blobs, not realistic things. I wasn't convinced it would really merge reality and VR in ways that could happen in real time dynamically. And as a wireless demo, Project Alloy didn't seem like it was delivering VR at anywhere near the smooth graphics of what's already available on Vive or Oculus Rift. That's not a surprise, considering Alloy has nowhere near the graphics power of a VR-ready desktop PC. But it did give me a new appreciation for what HoloLens already does. Microsoft's wireless stand-alone mixed-reality headset has been in developer's hands for months, and it does a pretty good job overlaying graphics and games into the real world -- and tracking motion in any space. You probably won't be tetherless yet VR is on its way to wireless this year in some exploratory ways, but I don't see any evidence that it'll be really ready in great products for a while. But, clearly, lots of companies are trying to get there from a lot of different directions at once. There are plenty of indications that will change, and TPCast's adapter could be a magic solution for a lot of people. But you'll need expensive dongles, patience, or be ready to experiment with funky new phones or hardware. Polished wireless VR might be a 2018 thing. But it's going to happen, and it'll be great when it gets here.

Intel is using Tom Brady to help show off its 360-degree replay technology. The tech giant today rolled out a new advertisement featuring the Patriots quarterback that shows 360-degree angles of Brady going through a morning routine — like brushing his teeth and cooking pancakes. “Intel’s 360-degree technology makes anything look epic,” the narrator says. The 360-degree replays will be utilized during next month’s Super Bowl (the commercial will also air during the big game). Intel will use 38 cameras, all 5K, to help create the 360-degree replays. The cameras help digitize the entire playing field and, along with the help of algorithms and computing power, create a 3-dimensional view of the action. Each replay clip will last 15-to-30 seconds and use 1 TB of data. Intel did the same for last year’s Super Bowl, as well as the NBA All-Star Game and the MLB All-Star Game. Intel said it will also for the first time utilize 360-degree replay to show point of view from a player’s perspective. From Intel’s press release: “Be the Player” uses Intel 360 replay technology to freeze a moment in the game and see the field from the player’s standpoint. The technology can bring a viewer onto the field from the quarterback’s position to see what it’s like to catch the snap, see the options and feel the pressure of the line rushing toward them. Commentators can share a new level of insight into the gametime decisions players have to make, as well as give an entirely new perspective to fans. Some of the technology that makes it all work comes from Intel’s acquisition of Replay Technologies in March of last year. Jeff Hopper, general manager of immersive experiences at Intel, called 360-degree replays the “best technology in live sports.” For more than a year, Intel has made a serious effort to bring its technology into the sports world. At CES in Las Vegas earlier this month, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich appeared on stage at multiple events and talked about sports. "By 2019, the technology will be advanced enough that we’ll put you in the QB’s helmet and you’ll watch the game,” says @intel CEO. #CES2017 pic.twitter.com/gk4ElBxV97 — GeekWire (@geekwire) January 6, 2017 Krzanich also led the company’s press conference, which took attendees on a virtual reality tour. One demo included a live-look at a college basketball game, showing the fruits of Intel’s Voke acquisition last year. Intel also has partnerships with sports companies like New Balance and media giants like ESPN. It also tapped Michael Phelps, who was just at CES for Under Armour, for a recent commercial that has more than 3 million views on YouTube.

We round up the rumours about new iMacs, including the theory that new iMacs will feature AMD Radeon Polaris graphics chips and might even be VR-ready. Latest: Tim Cook hints at the future of the Mac desktop, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac by Ashleigh Macro | 12 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will Apple release new iMacs in the UK? Will Apple update its iMac desktop line to add Intel Kaby Lake processor chips, and what other specs, design changes and new features should we expect in the next generation of iMacs? How much will the new iMacs for 2017 cost? Apple last updated its iMac line on 13 October 2015, bringing Retina-class screen resolution to the smaller Macs for the first time and equipping the larger models with new Skylake processor chips. Before that, you had to go back more than two years - if you don't include the cheaper iMac which Apple launched in June 2014 - to the last proper new iMac update, in September 2013, when Apple added Haswell processors, new graphics, next-gen Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options. (For more information on that update, read our review of the 2013 iMacs.) So much for Apple's iMac updates over the past few years. Right now we're looking ahead to the next iMac launch - what we hope will be an early-2017 iMac update. In this article we round up all the speculation about Apple's next iMac update: when new iMacs will be released in the UK, new iMac prices, tech specs and new features to expect, any leaked photos and videos that appear online, and all the other new iMac rumours that are fit to print. Updated, 22 December 2016, with comments from Apple CEO Tim Cook about the future of the Mac desktop Read next: Where to buy iMacs in the UK | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iMac deals UK New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Launch date When will new iMacs come out? Early in 2017, we hope, but we had been confidently expecting an iMac update in late 2016 and that came to nothing. (A contact told us, under condition of anonymity, that the Mac Pro would be updated before the end of November 2016, and we reasoned that it would make sense for Apple to announce at least a minor update to the iMac at the same time. But the year ended with no word on new Mac desktops.) The Best Buy leak discussed in the processor section of this article, which emerged at the start of October 2016, strongly suggests that the retailer has had advance warning of an imminent launch and posted a listing slightly too early by mistake - although it's also possible that this was a speculative listing created on the basis that it would probably be needed at some point. New iMac 2017 release date: Apple CEO hints at future of the iMac In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important.  A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell.  New iMac 2017 release date: What does previous launch history tell us? The last iMac update was in October 2015. Apple's yearly cycle is built around three major press events: autumn - usually September (new iPhones and iPads); spring - usually March (new iPhones and iPads, sometimes MacBooks and watches); and summer - usually June (WWDC - operating system updates, and occasional hardware). But that doesn't mean the company stays quiet the rest of the year. Mac updates can be folded into the big three events, but they're often launched at their own smaller launch events. The iMac update in 2015 got its own announcement, a few weeks after the iPhone 6s reveal. But bear in mind that, unlike the yearly or event twice-yearly update events we're used to for iOS devices, desktop Mac refreshes have frequently come several years apart. WWDC 2017 (which will take place in June next year) is therefore a possibility, and we may have to wait even longer than that. New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Specs We'll add leaked details about the tech specs of the new iMacs to this section as we hear them. Here's what we know so far. New iMac 2017 specs: Processor Apple skipped Intel's much-delayed Broadwell processors and went straight from Haswell to Skylake for the 2015 update. Skylake uses the same 14nm manufacturing process as Broadwell, but brings even greater CPU and GPU performance, along with reduced power consumption. But what chips will appear in the next set of iMacs? Clearly that will depend on their launch date and the hardware that's available at the time. After 2015's Skylake, the next round of Intel processors, which started going into mass production in late 2016 and is still being rolled out, is Kaby Lake; this will be followed by Cannonlake (Cannonlake was due to be next, but it's been delayed until the second half of 2017). Then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019, for those who enjoy this sort of thing. Kaby Lake uses a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake, but Cannonlake switches over to a more accurate 10nm process. If Apple does manage an iMac update before the end of 2016 the machines could feature Kaby Lake processors, but remember that Apple skipped Broadwell and delays are common in the chip sector - so we're not banking on anything. Intel started shipping its Kaby Lake processors in July 2016, and the chips offer support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. It's therefore now possible that Apple will squeeze Kaby Lake chips into the next iMac update, but by no means guaranteed, given Apple's past behaviour. Some of the Kaby Lake chips aren't expected to ship until very late 2016 or more likely early 2017, so be prepared for a wait. Read more on MacRumors. Processor models The specific model of Kaby Lake processor we're expecting to appear in the next iMac is the i7-7700. And as luck would have it, Tom's Hardware has got hold of what they understand to be a pre-release sample of that chip. Naturally they promptly overclocked it and put it through rigorous speed tests. Those speed tests found that the i7-7700 (or rather the i7-7700K - the K in the name denoting that the clock multiplier has been unlocked to allow for overclocking) was capable of 4.2GHz under normal circumstances, and 4.8GHz when overclocked. Serious speed which, as BGR observes, would give the new iMac bragging rights over the rival Surface Studio, launched before the relevant Kaby Lake chips became available. Micosoft could always launch an updated Surface Studio with Kaby Lake, of course, although that might hack off the early buyers. Evidence for Kaby Lake Back in October 2016, the US retailer Best Buy leaked a listing for a new iMac, and it had a Kaby Lake chipset - a "7th Gen Intel Core i7 processor". As Technobuffalo points out, this isn't necessarily genuine: an employee could have created this as a placeholder until official information is available. But slip-ups of this kind more often happen because a retailer has been given advance warning of an imminent launch and somebody sets it live too early by mistake. We'd say - based on this and other clues - that a Kaby Lake iMac is looking like a decent bet for launch in the near future. In November 2016, further evidence emerged that sheds light on the prospects of a Kaby Lake iMac. Intel briefly made documents available on its website, intended for PC manufacturer partners rather than consumers, that detail specs of new Kaby Lake processors - and Anandtech spotted and grabbed them. The documents detail 11 new processors, including seven i5 chips and three i7s; 10 of them are designated for desktop use and one is for worktop. There's still no sign of the Kaby Lake laptop processors we expect to use as part of a MacBook Pro update in early 2017. AMD processors We expect Apple to choose Intel-based CPUs, but there's a chance AMD could also make an appearance in certain iMac models. With the new AMD Zen processor, we hope to see the CPU make an appearance in a lot of high-end machines, given its tremendous processing power. The new processor boasts 8 cores and 16 threads - a massive amount of raw processing power. Given the suggested price tag of the Zen CPU, we expect it either to be in the top-spec iMacs or be an upgrade option. The inclusion of other AMD processors is also not far-fetched, as we still see it being an option for cheaper iMac models. New iMac 2017 specs: Graphics chips It's believed that Apple's next generation of iMacs (or its higher-specced models, at least) will feature graphics chips from AMD's Polaris set, which were announced at the start of 2016. WCCF Tech reports that AMD won the contract last October but was only able to get confirmation from additional sources in April 2016. The contract is for two chipsets: Polaris 10 (previously known as Ellesmere) and Polaris 11 (previously known as Baffin), and WCCF Tech says these processors will appear in "new desktops and notebooks from Apple, which the company plans to bring to market later this year". With the MacBook and MacBook Air having recently seen updates, and the Mac mini highly unlikely to incorporate a discrete graphics unit, the remaining candidates are the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro. MacRumors reasons that the power range of these chips makes Polaris 11 a strong fit for the MacBook Pro, while Polaris 10 suits the iMac. The Polaris chips offer improved graphics performance compared with previous generations (as much as twice the speed per watt) and potential reductions in both power consumption and waste heat. They are built using a 16nm or 14nm FinFET production process, compared to 28nm on AMD's earlier chips, which means that the chip maker can fit more transistors in a given space (which makes the chips ideal for ultraportable laptops and ultraslim desktops - the latter fitting recent iMac designs) and, because the transistors are closer together, less power is needed to move a signal across them. Apple's current iMac line-up features AMD Radeon graphics chipsets as standard in the 27-inch models. The 21-inch models come with integrated Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics. Read next: New Mac Pro rumours | New Mac mini rumours New iMac 2017 specs: Virtual reality Talking about graphics architecture can be a little dry, but the Polaris rumour discussed above has a sexier element to it: VR. AMD has consistently talked up its Polaris graphics chips as a way of bringing VR within the reach of a wider market of PC users. At present Macs are basically unusable for VR, as we discuss in our articles Can you use Oculus Rift with Mac? and How to use a Mac for VR, and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey specifically cited underpowered Mac GPUs as the reason why the company was focusing on Windows: "People have said, 'Why don't you support Macs? So many people have Macs.' It's true. A lot of people have Apple hardware, especially in the laptop space. But the GPUs in those, they're not even close to what we're pushing for our recommended spec." But adding Polaris GPUs to the iMac could change Luckey's mind. AMD's Roy Taylor thinks the company's new GPUs are about to massively expand the available market for VR. "AMD has just completed the shrink to 14nm [with Polaris]," he said. "This means we can produce GPUs that will run the minimum spec of VR at a lower cost, in larger volume, consuming less power and running faster. That means in the second half of this year and going forward, more people will be able to run those headsets." Visit WCCF Tech for more info. VR remains a niche topic in tech - the number of people actually willing to shell out for the whole shebang remains small, even if casual gamers who try the Vive or the Oculus Rift tend to love it - but it gets a lot of press at the moment. And it can't be nice for a company that prides itself on the quality of its products to hear them disparaged as "not even close" to being up to a task. As Jim Lynch on CIO colourfully phrases it, "As far as VR goes, it's not something that I have paid much attention to, but it certainly couldn't hurt for Apple's computers to be able to do it adequately... If VR lights a fire under Apple's rear end and gets the company to put out a pro version of the iMac, then it will be a good thing for all users." New iMac 2017 specs: Flash storage We'll repeat our hope, expressed this time last year while waiting for the 2015 update, that Apple makes flash storage standard across the entire range of iMacs. At present the 27-inch iMacs get a Fusion Drive by default (Fusion Drives are a high-performance hybrid blend of flash and conventional storage) and the 21.5-inch models can add them as a build-to-order option for an extra £80. We think it should be offered as standard in all Apple's desktops. The current 21.5-inch iMac range is crippled somewhat by its hard drives, which are a lot slower than the flash drives used in all of Apple's laptops - to the extent that Mac laptops with similar processors will perform noticeably better than the equivalent iMac because of their faster SSD drives. Read next: Best external SSD flash drives for Mac New iMac 2017 rumours: Could the iMac replace the Mac Pro? In our roundup of rumours about the next Mac Pro, we discuss the possibility that Apple is planning to wrap up that line - and one way such a move could work is by ramping up the top spec of the iMac line so that it meets the needs of professional users, rendering the Pro irrelevant. TechRadar has speculated about the specs of a theoretical 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling. All of this is certainly a possibility. But while the Mac Pro doesn't appear to be tearing up trees commercially, it was never a line that was about making money. The Mac Pro is a flagship product, a niche offering and a positioning exercise - a way of reassuring Mac buyers that Apple is still a company that makes products for pro users.

(Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group) By Jimmy Golen | January 12, 2017 at 7:14 am BOSTON (AP) — Have you ever wanted to know what Tom Brady sees as he stares down a pass rush, scans the field for an open receiver … or brushes his teeth in the morning? This year’s Super Bowl broadcast could be just what you’re looking for. Thanks to a 360-degree replay technology called “Be the Player,” Fox TV broadcasters will be able to show a play from virtually any spot in the stadium within minutes of the action taking place. The spin-around-and-zoom “freeD” system has been used at other sporting events – including the NBA and MLB All-Star Games and the Olympics – but this will be the first that takes the extra step and shows events from the athlete’s perspective. “The difference here is you would be able to go in and see from his vantage point what the player actually saw,” said Zac Fields, a senior vice president for graphic technology and integration at Fox Sports Group. “It’s something that most of us have never been able to see before. The vantage point that most of us have on TV is really different than what the guys see on the field. That’s what the promise of this technology is.” Intel is rolling out the new technology at this year’s Super Bowl, and promoting it in an ad that will feature Brady in his everyday life – waking up, making breakfast, brushing his teeth – with the tagline: “Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic.” As the Patriots quarterback snarfs down a pancake, the camera spins around to a new angle and shows the crumbs falling from his mouth. And, if New England makes it to the Feb. 5 Super Bowl in Houston, there will be even more opportunities to see things from Brady’s perspective. “It’s something that fans have always dreamed about: ‘What did Tom see when he threw that pass?'” Jeff Hopper, the general manager of strategy and marketing for the Intel Sports Group, told The Associated Press in advance of the announcement. “Everyone wants to be the player, to see what it’s like to see it from that point of view.” To make the “Be the Player” video possible, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras in a perimeter inside NRG Stadium, creating what Hopper calls “a volumetric capture of everything that’s going on on the field.” The cameras are connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a special control room, where a half-dozen Intel producers, working with one from the Fox Sports broadcast, can pick out and package the replays that will be used in the broadcast. The massive amount of data – about 1 terabyte per 15-30 second clip – allows producers to position a “virtual camera” anywhere it wants – including, virtually, inside a player’s helmet. (Early versions even toyed with superimposing a facemask on the screen, though that has apparently been dropped.) It will take about two minutes to produce the clips, meaning it’s not yet ready for instant replay but could, for example, be available to show a new view of a touchdown by the time the teams are done with the extra point or kickoff. In an interview in Boston’s Back Bay this week, Hopper said there could be up to 20 “Be the Player” replays, though ultimately it is up to Fox to decide how to use it. “It will depend upon the story you are trying to tell,” Fields said. “It’s not something we’re planning on using because it is a new bell and whistle. It is a storytelling tool, and that’s how we’re planning to utilize it.” Right now, use of the system is limited to big events: It took about a month to retrofit the stadium in Houston with all of the equipment needed for the freeD data capture. Also, each 15-30 clip consists of about 1 terabyte of data. But Hopper said new stadiums are already being built with the cameras in mind. “Anyone who’s building a new stadium now is saying, ‘What do we need to do to make it freeD ready?'” he said. “Because everyone sees it as the future.” Eventually, Hopper said, the technology will not be limited to storytelling. Teams and leagues are hoping to mine the data to improve performance. In the X-Games, Hopper said, the athletes were eager to figure out how high they jumped and use that information to tune their techniques – or just brag about big air with the competition. In time, coaches will be able to use the video to see what their player saw, instead of relying on overhead shots of the field. And, as the turnaround time quickens, the technology would also help replay reviews by giving officials the ability to freeze the action and zoom in at any angle to look, for example, to see whether a player’s knee was down before the ball popped out. “We’re working with pretty much the entire sports world,” Hopper said. “All the leagues, all the teams. I don’t think there’s anyone that we’re not. We can’t do them all, but we’re talking with them all.” And Hopper envisions a sports world where every fan will be able to immerse himself in the game on his phone or a virtual reality headset – not just view the shots curated by a TV producer sitting in a trailer next to the stadium. “That’s good; I think it’s interesting. But the transformative nature of what we’re working on is: Everybody gets to do it themselves,” Hopper said. “Ultimately you’ll be able to be on the field, with the players – the best players in the world.” Tags:  Sports Buzz Jimmy Golen Subscribe Today!

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature An indie/retro/moba box in your pocket Home Hardware Voyo 1 Mini PC Can you use a pocket-size PC as a games machine? By Alec Meer on January 10th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit The PC is dead, long live the PC, etc. By which I mean ‘a big box that sits underneath your desk’ is an increasingly inaccurate definition of PC. The concept is heading off in all sorts of directions, from patently ridiculous laptops to transforming tablets to all-in-one giant touchscreens to surprisingly games-capable laptops to yes, big boxes under your desk but also small boxes on top of your desk. And, as I’m looking at today, teeny-tiny boxes that just about fit into the back pocket of your trousers or can slip behind your TV. Can a $235/£188, 12x12x3cm box really work as a PC? And, more pertinently, can it possibly be any kind of games machine? The box in question is a VOYO V1 Mini PC. Similar boxes from other firms are available, and I’m using this one as an example rather than the be-all and end-all of this sort of thing. Inside it contains an Intel Pentium N4200, aka an Apollo Lake – the latest iteration (and reportedly last gasp of) the Atom ultra-mobile, system-on-a-chip range that powered netbooks and, indeed, lesser versions of teeny-tiny PCs like this. The numbers: quadcore, clockspeed that shifts between 1.1 and 2.4GHz depending on load, paired with 4GB of DDR3 and, on this model, a 128GB SSD plus bonus, confusing extra 32GB drive. (There’s also space to fit an extra laptop-sided drive of your choosing inside). Not big numbers, but not terrible numbers either – not for £188. Doing some research while waiting for the thing to arrive, I read some claims that the N4200 performs on a par with some of the Core i3 chips that we see in cheap laptops. Though I don’t own one of those to benchmark against it, using Windows 10 on this thing certainly feels very similar to my experience of recent £300-400 laptops. Eminently usable, in other words – lag here and there, takes noticeably longer to open applications than a mid-spec PC does, and once in a while it chokes for half a minute. Also, Task Manager invariably shows 100% CPU usage – even when it doesn’t seem troubled by it – so clearly it’s working flat out. But I used it as my work machine for a couple of days and, though I missed the comparative immediacy of my main PC’s task management, there was none of the screaming and weeping that characterised the half-year I spent using a netbook for work. (I will note before I forget that I had to turn off Windows Defender whenever I wanted to do any significant, such as Photoshop or games, as it alone uses 30-60% of processor time near-constantly. It’s an insufferable bastard even on a ‘proper’ PC, but it really does a number on the poor wee N200. For example, with it on my Steam download speeds halved, 4K video on YouTube turned jerky, and it made the difference between Inside running pleasantly at 30 frames per second and 12 with it on. If you’re tempted by a box like this, get in the habit of turning Defender off, or replace it with some alternative anti-malware app.) Anyway – that aside, for browsing, working and video-watching (1080p and 4K files and streams, though 4K Netflix is locked out on anything other than Intel’s latest Kaby Lake range of CPU), there’s not much to complain about, bar a little extra waiting before you get going. Though sometimes the inverse is true – it’s quicker and quieter to resume from sleep than any other PC I’ve owned. That’s systems-on-a-chip for ya, I guess – certainly, it’s pleasant to just tap the single button on the front (or keyboard if you’re using a USB one) and have it spring straight to life like a phone would. This isn’t really our bailiwick I realise, but I have been using it as a mini-media centre on the family TV. I was one of those idiots who bought a Smart TV (albeit a discounted factory outlet one) a couple of years ago, and though it’s a decent enough screen, it was a terrible mistake in every other respect. BBC iPlayer only works 50% of the time, it doesn’t recognise half the codecs I need it to if I’m streaming a file from my main PC, the UI is polluted with nonsense streaming services that not even their creators use and there’s no way to install Amazon Prime Video on it. (I don’t really use that, but I have a Prime account because next-day childcare supplies are easier than the long trek down and up a big hill to the nearest supermarket). Basically, the not-really-smart-at-all-is-it TV is locked into video tech from a few years back, and will only become increasingly infuriating as time progresses. Using a bluetooth keyboard and mouse to control the Voyo is a fiddlier solution than big fat buttons on a remote control, but it’s counter-balanced by the fact that this is a PC and thus I can install or update whatever I need. Which – we’re here at last! – includes games. Now, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. The N4200 includes Intel integrated graphics, but far short of even the broadly 3D-useless fare found in a full-fat Intel CPU, even though it shares the Skylake GPU’s architecture. The GPU’s called the HD Graphics 505, it runs at 750 MHz and shares system memory. Do not expect great things. In fact, if it’s a 3D game from the last two to four years, rule it out entirely unless it’s lo-fi or otherwise minimalist. This sounds as though it’s a death knell for the Voyo/N4200 as a games machine, but no, not at all. Because the CPU itself is fairly capable, there’s a whole world of 2D games, older AAA and retro that it is totally happy with. For example, of the 24 games in our best-of-2016 advent calendar, the Voyo can comfortably* handle the following: INSIDE Sorcery! The Curious Expedition hackmud Darkest Dungeon Burly Men At Sea Owlboy Duskers Thumper (Our game of the year) Devil Daggers * By this I mean ‘at least 30 frames per second on minimum settings, but in fully 2D stuff it’s running faster and looking better than that. It can also just about handle Civ 6 and Overwatch, depending on whether you can handle playing at 20-25 frames per second at sub-720p. It’s not as bad as it sounds, though it’s definitely not how I’d choose to play. I haven’t tried the other 3D stuff on the list yet, partly due to download sizes and partly due to a certainty that I’d be wasting my time. However, here are some other, off-list games which fall into the Comfortably category: Invisible Inc Dota 2 Team Fortress 2 World of Warcraft AM2R FTL Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines Quake Odallus: The Dark Call X-COM: UFO Defense Proteus Day Of The Tentacle Remastered The Binding Of Isaac: Afterbirth Kentucky Route Zero Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga (And depending on your personal threshold for acceptable framerates, you can get 15-20 frames out of XCOM 1, which I personally didn’t find too bad for a turn-based game. I also get between 15 and 25 on Skyrim which sometimes feels OK and other times does not. Extensive tweaking and modding may be able to get it close to 30, though). So on and so on. As you can see, pretty much anything 2D is a dead cert, while anything 3D from the last decade or before should be OK, plus a few ringers from more recent times. No, you’re not going to play DOOM or Hitman or Dishonored 2 or even XCOM 2 on it, but this is still a PC that just about fits into a pocket yet can play many thousands of cool videogames. In a horribly, cheesy way, one might call this the IndieBox. But one most certainly should not. The other thing I’ve been using it for is as a retro emulator, due to having recently fallen down an ‘oh god so many modern games are so long and complicated and self-regarding so 90s Nintendo games suddenly seem highly appealing after years of Ninty abstinence’ rabbit hole. RetroArch is a fine, fine application that acts as an all-in-one emulator for any console that can be successfully emulated, though is at its best for NES, SNES, Megadrive, N64 and PSX. I haven’t bothered with the latter two as yet, but it’s been glorious on the Voyo for GBA and SNES games, hooked up to the TV with a wireless gamepad. There are all sorts of bespoke or single-platform retro boxes around these days, but you can’t beat the all-purpose nature of the PC, and I would say that both price and performance are right for this one if that’s the kind of gaming you want to do on it. Only you get all this amazing 2D/older 3D stuff from Steam, GoG, itch etc too. I’ve used both an older (full-size) PC and a Steam Link to try and achieve similar, but either space and noise are an issue or there’s just a bit too much fiddle and compromise involved. This wee thinger fits the bill very well. Sure, you could achieve similar on a cheap laptop or a more powerful second-hand machine for similar money. But it won’t go in your back pocket or tuck behind a couple of books, will it? There’s one major exception to my fondness for this thing, which is that it’s surprisingly noisy. Not noisy-noisy, but the fan is very noticeable and a little more high-pitched than I’d like with it whenever it’s doing anything intensive. If you’re just, say, tapping words into a CMS, it’s silent, but videos and games or loading applications into memory spool it up and, in a quiet room, it’s always there in the background. If I had the time/patience, I might crack it open and try and fit a larger, therefore quieter fan to it. I’d stick another 4GB of RAM into it while I was there, which is possible but requires total and possibly scary disassembly. (An extra hard drive only requires taking off the bottom side, however). I also wish it had built-in WiFI and Bluetooth – there’s an adaptor for the former included, but you’ll need to supply the latter yourself, and if you have both that’s two of its three USB ports gone. That aside, it’s hard to argue with. It’s cute, its blantantly Mac Mini-aping style is pleasant to behold and yeah, it’s totally a usable Windows 10 PC. For £100 it would be a no-brainer, for £150 it’d still feel OK as a secondary PC/media centre/indie-retro games console – or even for a box you can sling in your pocket/bag and take it round your mate’s to play Dota or League of Legends. For £190 though, it’s moving beyond random indulgence and into ‘need to really rationalise this purchase’ territory, although I should mention that it does come with Windows 10 pre-installed, which sweetens the deal. But yeah, currently just slightly too expensive to feel comfortable as a suck-it-and-see purchase. There will be more boxes like this, perhaps some that much cheaper, and on the other side of the scale Intel are putting their new full-fat Kaby Lake CPUs into teeny PCs, which will cost more but be more capable. This type of PC is here to stay, I think. And with PC gaming such a broad church now, they’re going to make for lovely mini-consoles.

Well, of course, if you want to play latest AAA graphic games such as Tomb Raider or Witcher 3 in 1080p at very high to ultra-super-duper-max then you need expensive hard-ware. Still it seems a lot is a sales-pitch by companies, and the people who test stuff on a regular basis, of course they will notice the difference. But let’s be honest – as average user, if you have an “ok PC” and you play say Witcher 3 in medium to high at around 30-40 fps without, or very few, hick-ups and don’t have the direct comparison, you won’t notice the difference. I recently built on office PC from scratch parts, old PSU, a 7950, external harddisc. Bought a cheap mobo and an i3, plus SSD as boot media and 16 GB memory (I didn’t save on the latter 2), and voila, I can play any “simple” game at max settings at 60 fps, I can play Wicher 3 or Dark-Souls III at satisfying settings and fps, so I am good with that. The i3 has an Iris chip built in which also works fine for the majority of smaller titles (ok, not Witcher 3, but anyway). And as media-PC, currently, I have a ras.Pi2 and works fine with hdmi streaming from my NAS. So again, alot of the fancy hardware for the average Joe is just a sales-thing from the hardware producers.

It’s similarly specced to the box in the article but not much bigger than a cigarette box. Similar to the Intel compute stick, it plugs straight into a hdmi port. I’m very impressed with it for what it is. I plugged it into a little chinese projector and had system shock 2, deus ex etc running at 1080p down scaled to the projectors native resolution of 800×400. Considering I bought it just as a retro machine to play old pc games from my teens it’s done the job admirably. There’s some good youtube videos on how to squeeze the most out of integrated graphics, and once it was all configured I could run anything up to around doom 3 in 1080p. If you dropped that to 720p you’d probably cope fine with half life 2 and others from around that era. I was skeptical because there’s barely any info or reviews of the t08 online but it’s worked out really well so far Log in to Reply 10/01/2017 at 23:42 alison says: I don’t think I have ever read a hardware article on RPS, and tbh I only skimmed this one too. But I should comment because I have been a “low spec” gamer for a long, long time. Back in 2002-ish I gave up on traditional desktop computers and since then have always gamed on SFF PCs. First was the Mini-ITX. Back then the only manufacturer was VIA, and their CPU wasn’t even Intel. It was the laughing stock of computers, but it ran Deus Ex and Counter-Strike acceptably. Later I moved to the Alienware 11″ laptop, back when they still cared about making smallish computers. But in the smartphone era that got too big too, so I moved to a Lenovo Miix 11″ tablet. I am still using that tablet today, along with an Alienware Alpha in the corner of the room bought solely for the purpose of Steam streaming to the tablet. I can barely grasp how anyone would buy a “big” computer for gaming these days. The Alienware Alpha has a laptop NVidia chip that is several years old, but I can still play (via streaming) the latest games in 1080p in high or ridiculous graphics settings. When I was playing games direct from the tablet I could still happily play 3D games from several years ago in 720p or 800×600. Occasionally it was jerky (which is why I bought the Alpha), but the ergonomics balanced that out. I play everything in my bed, lying on my stomach. Sitting at a desk to play computer games seems like a weird thing people only did… well, 15 years ago before laptops got gud. Anywho. Point is. If you want portable gaming and you don’t mind low res on last-gen games, just get a tablet. And 1080p will work fine on adventures and other 2D games. But if you desperately want to play games on your television (who the fuck owns a television in the 21st century!?), then just get an Alienware Alpha. Or put a real computer in your closet and attach a stick of chewing gum with wifi to your television, because Steam streaming rocks all ass.

You have an initial outlay once, and then all you do is incrementally upgrade one or two components once every few years. The last time I upgraded my “big” computer was plugging a new graphics card in about 2 years ago, and before that a new CPU about 5 years ago. It still runs all the latest games at their highest settings in 1080p. It’d probably struggle with 4k, but seeing as I haven’t got, nor have any intention to buy, a 4k screen that’s irrelevant to me. “Sitting at a desk to play computer games seems like a weird thing people only did… well, 15 years ago before laptops got gud.” Well, yes if you only play casual games on a tablet or with a controller in your living rooms. Anything beyond that, i.e. requiring a keyboard is pretty damn uncomfortable if you’re not sitting at a desk. And laptops are damn expensive and even then don’t match the performance of a mid-range desktop PC, so unless you’re short on space make no sense at all unless you’re actually going to be travelling with them. “But if you desperately want to play games on your television (who the fuck owns a television in the 21st century!?),” Errr, most people that live in something bigger than a bedsit??

I love living in the future. Log in to Reply 10/01/2017 at 23:52 piphil says: Did you try any over network streaming? I have an older mini-PC (Gigabyte uBrix) based on a several-generations-old i3. I run Kodi on it, but it’s pretty much useless for games. It’s hobbled by the lack of decrete graphics card. It does have 8 GB RAM, an SSD, and most importantly a gigabit network port though. And this allows me to run Steam In-Home Streaming. Which I’ve been consistently impressed with. Frankly, with a strong enough signal, it’ll run on wifi – I use my HP Stream netbook/mini laptop for this with slower games. OK, it blocks up your gaming PC, but if this isn’t an issue, streaming in general – I think NVIDIA has a similar tech – makes these little machines into genuine gaming systems.

Retro PC gaming via DOSBox is also possible on the Pi, but I haven’t tried it yet. Overall, the Pi seems like the most cost-effective way for PC gamers to dip their toes in the living room.

Third-party apps have lots more bells and whistles that take up more processor time. Some of their additions also reduce your security: link to pcworld.com Log in to Reply 11/01/2017 at 01:25 racccoon says: not for another 5 years as most are shit box’s Log in to Reply 11/01/2017 at 07:20 Ack says: Alot of the CPU usage etc sounds like the usual stuff you get with a new windows 10 install. It likes to update itself and use all your resources to do so. Probably need to leave it over night and set it to automatically restart when needed. This even happened with a fast gaming laptop I recently bought.

Kodi even recognises my aging telly’s remote, meaning I can control the Pi via that. And I’ve just bought the Pi 3 with the intention of using it variously as a game and Mumble server. Being able to change the thing’s functionality in a matter of seconds by swapping out the SD card is fab.

This year’s Super Bowl broadcast could be just what you’re looking for. Thanks to a 360-degree replay technology called “Be the Player,” Fox TV broadcasters will be able to show a play from virtually any spot in the stadium within minutes of the action taking place. The spin around and zoom “freeD” system has been used at other sporting events — including the NBA and baseball All-Star Games and the Olympics — but this will be the first that goes the last step and shows things from the athlete’s perspective . “The difference here is you would be able to go in and see from his vantage point what the player actually saw,” said Zac Fields, a senior vice president for graphic technology and integration at Fox Sports Group. “It’s something that most of us have never been able to see before. The vantage point that most of us have on TV is really different than what the guys see on the field. That’s what the promise of this technology is.” Intel is rolling out the new technology at this year’s Super Bowl, and promoting it in an ad that will feature Brady in his everyday life — waking up, making breakfast, brushing his teeth — with the tagline: “Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic.” As the Patriots quarterback snarfs down a pancake, the camera spins around to a new angle and shows the crumbs falling from his mouth. And, if New England makes it to the Feb. 5 Super Bowl in Houston, there will be even more opportunities to see things from Brady’s perspective. “It’s something that fans have always dreamed about: ‘What did Tom see when he threw that pass?'” Jeff Hopper, the general manager of strategy and marketing for the Intel Sports Group, told The Associated Press in advance of the announcement. “Everyone wants to be the player, to see what it’s like to see it from that point of view.” To make the “Be the Player” video possible, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras in a perimeter inside NRG Stadium, creating what Hopper calls “a volumetric capture of everything that’s going on on the field.” The cameras are connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a special control room, where a half-dozen Intel producers, working with one from the Fox Sports broadcast, can pick out and package the replays that will be used in the broadcast. The massive amount of data — about 1 terabyte per 15-30 second clip — allows producers to position a “virtual camera” anywhere it wants — including, virtually, inside a player’s helmet. (Early versions even toyed with superimposing a facemask on the screen, though that has apparently been dropped.) It will take about two minutes to produce the clips, meaning it’s not yet ready for instant replay but could, for example, be available to show a new view of a touchdown by the time the teams are done with the extra point or kickoff. In an interview in Boston’s Back Bay this week, Hopper said there could be up to 20 “Be the Player” replays, though ultimately it is up to Fox to decide how to use it. “It will depend upon the story you are trying to tell,” Fields said. “It’s not something we’re planning on using because it is a new bell and whistle. It is a storytelling tool, and that’s how we’re planning to utilize it.” Right now, use of the system is limited to big events: It took about a month to retrofit the stadium in Houston with all of the equipment needed for the freeD data capture. Also, each 15-30 clip consists of about 1 terabyte of data. But Hopper said new stadiums are already being built with the cameras in mind. “Anyone who’s building a new stadium now is saying, ‘What do we need to do to make it freeD ready?'” he said. “Because everyone sees it as the future.” Eventually, Hopper said, the technology will not be limited to storytelling. Teams and leagues are hoping to mine the data to improve performance. In the X-Games, Hopper said, the athletes were eager to figure out how high they jumped and use that information to tune their techniques — or just brag about big air with the competition. In time, coaches will be able to use the video to see what their player saw, instead of relying on overhead shots of the field. And, as the turnaround time quickens, the technology would also help replay reviews by giving officials the ability to freeze the action and zoom in at any angle to look, for example, to see whether a player’s knee was down before the ball popped out. “We’re working with pretty much the entire sports world,” Hopper said. “All the leagues, all the teams. I don’t think there’s anyone that we’re not. We can’t do them all, but we’re talking with them all.” And Hopper envisions a sports world where every fan will be able to immerse himself in the game on his phone or a virtual reality headset — not just view the shots curated by a TV producer sitting in a trailer next to the stadium. “That’s good; I think it’s interesting. But the transformative nature of what we’re working on is: Everybody gets to do it themselves,” Hopper said. “Ultimately you’ll be able to be on the field, with the players — the best players in the world — whatever sport that is, whether it be soccer, football or cricket, whatever. You’ll be able to be part of the action. I don’t think you can get any more immersed.” ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Tags: ap, be the player, Fox, nfl, Super Bowl, tom brady Top Videos TUESDAY NEWS IN A RUSH: 10 things in 60 seconds and A-TownTV NewsMinute Police: Beating on video began after friendly encounter — VIDEO CLIPS OF COPS FRIDAY NEWS IN A RUSH: 10 things in 60 seconds and A-TownTV NewsMinute WEDNESDAY NEWS IN A RUSH: 10 things in 60 seconds and A-TownTV NewsMinute WEDNESDAY NEWS IN A RUSH: 10 things in 60 seconds and A-TownTV NewsMinute View more Top Videos Aurora Sentinel Local news, sports & entertainment News Opinion Sports Guide Events Colorado Table Markets & Events Recipes Dining Pure Colorado Sustainable Living Drink American Buffet Aurora Magazine The Lifestyle magazine for the greater Aurora region Home Features Check Please About Us Email Newsletters Daily Headlines Prep Sports FindIt!

Tech Industry by Terry Collins January 12, 2017 6:00 AM PST @terryscollins Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Will fans get to see New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady avoid tackles in 360-degree replays during the Super Bowl LI telecast? Photo by Getty Images Imagine seeing up close how NFL quarterback Tom Brady avoids a linebacker barreling down on him as he throws a game-winning touchdown pass -- or how he scarfs down a pancake. Intel is giving a glimpse of its new 360-degree replay technology called "Be The Player," debuting at this year's Super Bowl LI by featuring Brady in a funny 30-second commercial. The New England Patriots star is seen waking up, brushing his teeth and making breakfast, complete with the tagline: "Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic." And just as the ever-competitive Brady beats his dog to devour a pancake that falls to the floor, the camera spins around to show crumbs falling from his mouth. "This feature is going to be the football fan's ultimate dream," said Jeff Hopper, general manager of strategy for Intel's Sports Group. "It's going to be like if you're right on the field seeing why Brady threw that pass, right from his point of view." That's if Brady's heavily favored New England Patriots can make it all the way to Super Bowl LI in Houston on Feb. 5. The team must first beat the upset-minded Houston Texans in an AFC divisional playoff game on Saturday. "I'm excited for the potential of this incredibly unique 360 replay technology to transform the viewing experience for sports fans," Brady said Thursday in a statement. The 360 replays, which are already used in National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball games, could be the star of the Super Bowl. The replay feature comes as the NFL is trying to boost ratings after last year's big game in the heart of tech-rich Silicon Valley, attracted 112 million viewers, a reported 2 percent dip from the previous two years. Overall, NFL TV ratings are down this season as many fans are turning to streaming games online or simply just watching highlights. To bring "Be the Player" to life, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras inside Houston's NRG Stadium, creating a "volumetric capture," Hopper said. The cameras will be connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a control room where a half-dozen Intel producers will be working with Fox Sports, which is airing the game, to sort out which replays to show. "The magic will start in the control room that will then take fans right onto the field and inside the players' head," said James Carwana, general manager of Intel's Sports Group. Only the biggest plays, expected to be around 20, will get the 360-degree treatment, Carwana added. With each replay using about 1 terabyte of data, it could take up to two minutes to get the replays ready for broadcast. But after testing the technology across 15 stadiums during the NFL regular season, Carwana said he knows it will be worth it.

From glitchy displays to subpar battery performance and eventually receiving a negative recommendation from the Consumer Reviews. Many consumers were asking why Apple even bothered releasing the laptop in the first place. A lot of fans were banking on Apple releasing the MacBook Pro with an Intel Kaby Lake processor. However, due to delays from Intel’s side, Apple was forced to release the laptop with the current Skylake. Now, rumors have it that Apple is gearing up for the MacBook Pro 2017 release as the Kaby Lake processors become available in the market. Intel has finally officially unveiled the seventh generation processor to come out of its foundry. The Kaby Lake was formally introduced during this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES). According to Intel, availability of the new processors will be some time in the first quarter of the year. This announcement led many to believe that Apple is now considering re-releasing the MacBook Pro this year. The MacBook Pro 2017 is said to feature the latest Kaby Lake chip from Intel. Not only that, the laptop is also rumored to get a new display – a much better one – on its release. MacBook Pro 2016 (via apple.com) According to Digitimes, market watcher IHS Markit made it public that Apple will proceed with the indium gallium zinc oxide display panels this year. These metal oxide or IGZO panels are to be used for notebook devices, possibly the MacBook Pro 2017. The report also mentioned that Sharp will be the major supplier of Apple for the said display, with deliveries starting mid-2017. The new MacBook Pro 2017 could benefit from the new display owing to its increased power efficiency. This is due to the inherently high electron mobility of the semiconductor material. This may result in increased display brightness and a much wider color gamut. IGZO displays may pave the way for a much longer performing MacBook Pro 2017. Perhaps with the use of the display technology, Apple may be able to extend battery life by a couple of hours on average. This is highly probable with the combination of the more efficient Kaby Lake processor and the metal oxide display. Although Apple has yet to comment on the MacBook Pro 2017 release, many believe that it will happen some time in September this year.

For the NFL championship game Feb. 5 in Houston, Fox will use technology developed by Intel to produce the “Be the Player” enhancement, a feature that displays a POV perspective from any player on the field without ever having a physical camera attached to the player. (Pictured above is an example of the QB’s view captured at last month’s Foster Farms Bowl matchup between Indiana and Utah.) Intel’s 360 Replay technology synthesizes a player’s view to let plays be recreated in 3D space. For Super Bowl LI, Fox Sports and Intel are using an array of 38 cameras positioned around NRG Stadium to capture the video necessary to generate the POV replays. Each 15-30 second clip, which will take about two minutes each to compile, eats up around 1 terabyte of data. Related Fox Builds Live Commercial Concept for Super Bowl “From the beginning, seeing and breaking down the play from the player’s point of view is the undiscovered country of sports broadcasting,” said Michael Davies, Fox Sports senior VP of field and technical operations. “This broadcast enhancement is like no other — it literally brings the audience down to the viewpoint of the player at the critical decision-making moment.” Fox Sports says it may use up to 20 “Be the Player” replays during the Super Bowl. The broadcaster’s Super Bowl LI production will use three production trucks and more than 30 cameras to deliver more than 20 hours of programming daily from Discovery Green in Houston, in addition to the more than 70 cameras at NRG Stadium covering the game. Intel will air a 30-second ad during Fox’s Super Bowl LI telecast featuring New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to promote the 360 Replay technology. In the spot, “Brady Everyday,” Brady’s boring morning routine — brushing his teeth, eating pancakes — is transformed into epic, highlight-worthy moments with the Intel tech. (Watch the full commercial on YouTube here.) In addition, Intel has teamed with Brady on a promo inviting fans to to create their own frame of the NFL star to add to a user-generated video at experiencemore.intel.com. Intel will post the best images of Brady online and will release the winning video on Super Bowl Sunday. Meanwhile, Fox Sports in November teamed with GoPro to offer the first POV camera perspectives from the hats of referees working the Big Ten Championship Game.

(AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead AMD stock has turnaround potential, but not much else By Ryan Fuhrmann, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 9, 2017, 10:20 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead 10 Best Stocks for Retirement Investors Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead Recent Posts: Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a “Hold” at Best Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is a Zombie, But the Cure Is Coming View All Posts Back in 2011, semiconductor chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NYSE:AMD) generated about $100 million in free cash flow. Since then, it has bled cash. On an earnings basis, AMD stock was also last profitable in 2011. Those are two pretty long dry spells. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Sales also haven’t moved much for the better part of a decade. In addition, Advanced Micro Devices has a fair amount of debt (around $2 billion), and has accumulated $7.3 billion in deficits on the balance sheet. This indicates it hasn’t generated a cumulative positive return for AMD stock owners since it was founded in 1969. The profit outlook for Advanced Micro Devices is pretty grim. Analysts are projecting a loss of 23 cents per share for the company’s full year (AMD reports its fourth quarter on Jan. 17). But 2017 could see a return to profitability, as analysts expect 6 cents in earnings for the year. A recent investor presentation on AMD’s website does tout that the company is a leader in “visual” computing that includes gaming, artificial intelligence and virtual/augmented reality. It is a claim-to-fame that resembles why rival Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is popular among investors right now. I recently covered why Nvidia’s stock has been on fire. NVDA also sells chips that power the gaming and AI space, but also data centers. The greatest hype surrounds its autonomous car initiative, including the Nvidia Drive PX 2 in Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) autos. 10 of the Worst Values on Wall Street The upside for AMD is that it also operates in growing areas of the market. It has sold chips to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) for its Xbox and Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) for its PlayStation, but is well behind Nvidia in gaming. Advanced Micro Devices Lags Intel Badly Advanced Micro Devices says it is also a “strong No.2 in computing”, but has struggled for years to successfully compete against industry titan Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel is expected to report sales of around $59 billion this year. AMD stock will log just over $4 billion in sales, making it about 7% the size of Intel. Advanced Micro Devices has lagged Intel for years now. The race was much closer around 2000, but Intel has moved forward and AMD stock has not. Obviously, Intel is much larger and can easily outspend Advanced Micro Devices in research and development. Last year, Intel invested $12.1 billion in R&D, qualifying it as one of the largest spenders on R&D in the world. AMD spent less than $1 billion, and its annual R&D spend has fallen in recent years. Advanced Micro Devices is said to be at least a couple of years behind Intel in terms of technology.  AMD is just rolling out 14-nanometer chips while Intel has had the technology for a couple of years now. Advanced Micro Devices also doesn’t have the strength to produce its own chips any longer. Instead, it has to pay outside parties to do so, which increases costs. The market share differential says it all. Intel’s computing market share is nearly 88%, while AMD’s is only 12%. Intel has also been increasing its share recently.

Intel Think an NFL star's morning routine is boring? Well, it kind of is, but not when viewed through Intel's 360-degree replay technology. That's the story the tech brand is telling in its Super Bowl spot from mcgarrybowen starring New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. In the 30-second ad, "Brady Everyday," the four-time Super Bowl champ brushes his teeth and whips up a batch of pancakes, but Intel's replay technology, which will be featured in Fox's broadcast of the Big Game, turns these tasks into epic moments. "People typically show the athlete in the uniform and on the field," said Steve Fund, svp and CMO at Intel. "We wanted to do something different. We're making these everyday things look heroic and interesting because that's what our technology does. The idea is, if we can make him look epic brushing his teeth, wait until you see how we can use the technology in the game." Intel has its fingers crossed that the Patriots and Brady will appear in the Super Bowl, as they're currently favored to do. "If he's playing in the game, that would be awesome," Fund said. "We wanted to get the biggest name in the game, and someone who symbolizes performance and what our brand stands for." People can also visit a website to design their own videos featuring frames of Brady throwing a football to be aggregated into an online gallery and video compilation released on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 5. Last year, Intel integrated its replay technology into the Super Bowl broadcast and ran an ad just prior to kickoff. This year's spot will run during the game. The brand recently teamed up with another sports icon, Michael Phelps, who appeared in ads hot off his incredible performance at the Summer Olympics. "Our association with sports allows us to connect performance with Intel," Fund said. "We're trying to get people to think differently about Intel. It's still thought of as a PC microprocessor company, and we're trying to change perceptions through efforts like this."

Tech Industry by Terry Collins January 12, 2017 6:00 AM PST @terryscollins Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Will fans get to see New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady avoid tackles in 360-degree replays during the Super Bowl LI telecast? Photo by Getty Images Imagine seeing up close how NFL quarterback Tom Brady avoids a linebacker barreling down on him as he throws a game-winning touchdown pass -- or how he scarfs down a pancake. Intel is giving a glimpse of its new 360-degree replay technology called "Be The Player," debuting at this year's Super Bowl LI by featuring Brady in a funny 30-second commercial. The New England Patriots star is seen waking up, brushing his teeth and making breakfast, complete with the tagline: "Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic." And just as the ever-competitive Brady beats his dog to devour a pancake that falls to the floor, the camera spins around to show crumbs falling from his mouth. "This feature is going to be the football fan's ultimate dream," said Jeff Hopper, general manager of strategy for Intel's Sports Group. "It's going to be like if you're right on the field seeing why Brady threw that pass, right from his point of view." That's if Brady's heavily favored New England Patriots can make it all the way to Super Bowl LI in Houston on Feb. 5. The team must first beat the upset-minded Houston Texans in an AFC divisional playoff game on Saturday. "I'm excited for the potential of this incredibly unique 360 replay technology to transform the viewing experience for sports fans," Brady said Thursday in a statement. The 360 replays, which are already used in National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball games, could be the star of the Super Bowl. The replay feature comes as the NFL is trying to boost ratings after last year's big game in the heart of tech-rich Silicon Valley, attracted 112 million viewers, a reported 2 percent dip from the previous two years. Overall, NFL TV ratings are down this season as many fans are turning to streaming games online or simply just watching highlights. To bring "Be the Player" to life, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras inside Houston's NRG Stadium, creating a "volumetric capture," Hopper said. The cameras will be connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a control room where a half-dozen Intel producers will be working with Fox Sports, which is airing the game, to sort out which replays to show. "The magic will start in the control room that will then take fans right onto the field and inside the players' head," said James Carwana, general manager of Intel's Sports Group. Only the biggest plays, expected to be around 20, will get the 360-degree treatment, Carwana added. With each replay using about 1 terabyte of data, it could take up to two minutes to get the replays ready for broadcast. But after testing the technology across 15 stadiums during the NFL regular season, Carwana said he knows it will be worth it.

(Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images) Print Email Joe Giglio | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Joe Giglio | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 12, 2017 at 9:00 AM, updated January 13, 2017 at 3:37 PM comments It's the most wonderful time of the year, NFL fans. With Wild Card weekend in the books, the 12-team tournament to crown a Super Bowl champion has been whittled down to eight--giving us the best weekend of football all year: Saturday Seattle Seahawks at Atlanta Falcons, 4:35 p.m. Eastern, FOX Houston Texans at New England Patriots, 8:15 p.m. Eastern, CBS Sunday Pittsburgh Steelers at Kansas City Chiefs, 8:20 p.m. Eastern, NBC Green Bay Packers at Dallas Cowboys, 4:40 p.m. Eastern, FOX Throughout every week of the regular season, NJ Advance Media's football experts made picks vs. the spread for every single game. We'll continue that through the postseason. Have you ever wanted to know what Tom Brady sees as he stares down a pass rush, scans the field for an open receiver ... or brushes his teeth in the morning? This year's Super Bowl broadcast could be just what you're looking for. Thanks to a 360-degree replay technology called "Be the Player," Fox TV broadcasters will be able to show a play from virtually any spot in the stadium within minutes of the action taking place. The spin around and zoom "freeD" system has been used at other sporting events - including the NBA and baseball All-Star Games and the Olympics - but this will be the first that goes the last step and shows things from the athlete's perspective . "The difference here is you would be able to go in and see from his vantage point what the player actually saw," said Zac Fields, a senior vice president for graphic technology and integration at Fox Sports Group. "It's something that most of us have never been able to see before. The vantage point that most of us have on TV is really different than what the guys see on the field. That's what the promise of this technology is." Mock Draft Intel is rolling out the new technology at this year's Super Bowl, and promoting it in an ad that will feature Brady in his everyday life - waking up, making breakfast, brushing his teeth - with the tagline: "Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic." As the Patriots quarterback snarfs down a pancake, the camera spins around to a new angle and shows the crumbs falling from his mouth. And, if New England makes it to the Feb. 5 Super Bowl in Houston, there will be even more opportunities to see things from Brady's perspective. "It's something that fans have always dreamed about: 'What did Tom see when he threw that pass?'" Jeff Hopper, the general manager of strategy and marketing for the Intel Sports Group, told The Associated Press in advance of the announcement. "Everyone wants to be the player, to see what it's like to see it from that point of view." To make the "Be the Player" video possible, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras in a perimeter inside NRG Stadium, creating what Hopper calls "a volumetric capture of everything that's going on on the field." The cameras are connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a special control room, where a half-dozen Intel producers, working with one from the Fox Sports broadcast, can pick out and package the replays that will be used in the broadcast. The massive amount of data - about 1 terabyte per 15-30 second clip - allows producers to position a "virtual camera" anywhere it wants - including, virtually, inside a player's helmet. (Early versions even toyed with superimposing a facemask on the screen, though that has apparently been dropped.) It will take about two minutes to produce the clips, meaning it's not yet ready for instant replay but could, for example, be available to show a new view of a touchdown by the time the teams are done with the extra point or kickoff. Giants JPP: 'I'm not signing a one-year deal' In an interview in Boston's Back Bay this week, Hopper said there could be up to 20 "Be the Player" replays, though ultimately it is up to Fox to decide how to use it. "It will depend upon the story you are trying to tell," Fields said. "It's not something we're planning on using because it is a new bell and whistle. It is a storytelling tool, and that's how we're planning to utilize it." Right now, use of the system is limited to big events: It took about a month to retrofit the stadium in Houston with all of the equipment needed for the freeD data capture. Also, each 15-30 clip consists of about 1 terabyte of data. But Hopper said new stadiums are already being built with the cameras in mind. "Anyone who's building a new stadium now is saying, 'What do we need to do to make it freeD ready?'" he said. "Because everyone sees it as the future." Eventually, Hopper said, the technology will not be limited to storytelling. Teams and leagues are hoping to mine the data to improve performance. In the X-Games, Hopper said, the athletes were eager to figure out how high they jumped and use that information to tune their techniques - or just brag about big air with the competition. In time, coaches will be able to use the video to see what their player saw, instead of relying on overhead shots of the field. And, as the turnaround time quickens, the technology would also help replay reviews by giving officials the ability to freeze the action and zoom in at any angle to look, for example, to see whether a player's knee was down before the ball popped out. "We're working with pretty much the entire sports world," Hopper said. "All the leagues, all the teams. I don't think there's anyone that we're not. We can't do them all, but we're talking with them all." And Hopper envisions a sports world where every fan will be able to immerse himself in the game on his phone or a virtual reality headset - not just view the shots curated by a TV producer sitting in a trailer next to the stadium. "That's good; I think it's interesting. But the transformative nature of what we're working on is: Everybody gets to do it themselves," Hopper said. "Ultimately you'll be able to be on the field, with the players - the best players in the world - whatever sport that is, whether it be soccer, football or cricket, whatever. You'll be able to be part of the action. I don't think you can get any more immersed." (The Associated Press contributed to this report.) Joe Giglio may be reached at jgiglio@njadvancemedia.com.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature An indie/retro/moba box in your pocket Home Hardware Voyo 1 Mini PC Can you use a pocket-size PC as a games machine? By Alec Meer on January 10th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit The PC is dead, long live the PC, etc. By which I mean ‘a big box that sits underneath your desk’ is an increasingly inaccurate definition of PC. The concept is heading off in all sorts of directions, from patently ridiculous laptops to transforming tablets to all-in-one giant touchscreens to surprisingly games-capable laptops to yes, big boxes under your desk but also small boxes on top of your desk. And, as I’m looking at today, teeny-tiny boxes that just about fit into the back pocket of your trousers or can slip behind your TV. Can a $235/£188, 12x12x3cm box really work as a PC? And, more pertinently, can it possibly be any kind of games machine? The box in question is a VOYO V1 Mini PC. Similar boxes from other firms are available, and I’m using this one as an example rather than the be-all and end-all of this sort of thing. Inside it contains an Intel Pentium N4200, aka an Apollo Lake – the latest iteration (and reportedly last gasp of) the Atom ultra-mobile, system-on-a-chip range that powered netbooks and, indeed, lesser versions of teeny-tiny PCs like this. The numbers: quadcore, clockspeed that shifts between 1.1 and 2.4GHz depending on load, paired with 4GB of DDR3 and, on this model, a 128GB SSD plus bonus, confusing extra 32GB drive. (There’s also space to fit an extra laptop-sided drive of your choosing inside). Not big numbers, but not terrible numbers either – not for £188. Doing some research while waiting for the thing to arrive, I read some claims that the N4200 performs on a par with some of the Core i3 chips that we see in cheap laptops. Though I don’t own one of those to benchmark against it, using Windows 10 on this thing certainly feels very similar to my experience of recent £300-400 laptops. Eminently usable, in other words – lag here and there, takes noticeably longer to open applications than a mid-spec PC does, and once in a while it chokes for half a minute. Also, Task Manager invariably shows 100% CPU usage – even when it doesn’t seem troubled by it – so clearly it’s working flat out. But I used it as my work machine for a couple of days and, though I missed the comparative immediacy of my main PC’s task management, there was none of the screaming and weeping that characterised the half-year I spent using a netbook for work. (I will note before I forget that I had to turn off Windows Defender whenever I wanted to do any significant, such as Photoshop or games, as it alone uses 30-60% of processor time near-constantly. It’s an insufferable bastard even on a ‘proper’ PC, but it really does a number on the poor wee N200. For example, with it on my Steam download speeds halved, 4K video on YouTube turned jerky, and it made the difference between Inside running pleasantly at 30 frames per second and 12 with it on. If you’re tempted by a box like this, get in the habit of turning Defender off, or replace it with some alternative anti-malware app.) Anyway – that aside, for browsing, working and video-watching (1080p and 4K files and streams, though 4K Netflix is locked out on anything other than Intel’s latest Kaby Lake range of CPU), there’s not much to complain about, bar a little extra waiting before you get going. Though sometimes the inverse is true – it’s quicker and quieter to resume from sleep than any other PC I’ve owned. That’s systems-on-a-chip for ya, I guess – certainly, it’s pleasant to just tap the single button on the front (or keyboard if you’re using a USB one) and have it spring straight to life like a phone would. This isn’t really our bailiwick I realise, but I have been using it as a mini-media centre on the family TV. I was one of those idiots who bought a Smart TV (albeit a discounted factory outlet one) a couple of years ago, and though it’s a decent enough screen, it was a terrible mistake in every other respect. BBC iPlayer only works 50% of the time, it doesn’t recognise half the codecs I need it to if I’m streaming a file from my main PC, the UI is polluted with nonsense streaming services that not even their creators use and there’s no way to install Amazon Prime Video on it. (I don’t really use that, but I have a Prime account because next-day childcare supplies are easier than the long trek down and up a big hill to the nearest supermarket). Basically, the not-really-smart-at-all-is-it TV is locked into video tech from a few years back, and will only become increasingly infuriating as time progresses. Using a bluetooth keyboard and mouse to control the Voyo is a fiddlier solution than big fat buttons on a remote control, but it’s counter-balanced by the fact that this is a PC and thus I can install or update whatever I need. Which – we’re here at last! – includes games. Now, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. The N4200 includes Intel integrated graphics, but far short of even the broadly 3D-useless fare found in a full-fat Intel CPU, even though it shares the Skylake GPU’s architecture. The GPU’s called the HD Graphics 505, it runs at 750 MHz and shares system memory. Do not expect great things. In fact, if it’s a 3D game from the last two to four years, rule it out entirely unless it’s lo-fi or otherwise minimalist. This sounds as though it’s a death knell for the Voyo/N4200 as a games machine, but no, not at all. Because the CPU itself is fairly capable, there’s a whole world of 2D games, older AAA and retro that it is totally happy with. For example, of the 24 games in our best-of-2016 advent calendar, the Voyo can comfortably* handle the following: INSIDE Sorcery! The Curious Expedition hackmud Darkest Dungeon Burly Men At Sea Owlboy Duskers Thumper (Our game of the year) Devil Daggers * By this I mean ‘at least 30 frames per second on minimum settings, but in fully 2D stuff it’s running faster and looking better than that. It can also just about handle Civ 6 and Overwatch, depending on whether you can handle playing at 20-25 frames per second at sub-720p. It’s not as bad as it sounds, though it’s definitely not how I’d choose to play. I haven’t tried the other 3D stuff on the list yet, partly due to download sizes and partly due to a certainty that I’d be wasting my time. However, here are some other, off-list games which fall into the Comfortably category: Invisible Inc Dota 2 Team Fortress 2 World of Warcraft AM2R FTL Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines Quake Odallus: The Dark Call X-COM: UFO Defense Proteus Day Of The Tentacle Remastered The Binding Of Isaac: Afterbirth Kentucky Route Zero Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga (And depending on your personal threshold for acceptable framerates, you can get 15-20 frames out of XCOM 1, which I personally didn’t find too bad for a turn-based game. I also get between 15 and 25 on Skyrim which sometimes feels OK and other times does not. Extensive tweaking and modding may be able to get it close to 30, though). So on and so on. As you can see, pretty much anything 2D is a dead cert, while anything 3D from the last decade or before should be OK, plus a few ringers from more recent times. No, you’re not going to play DOOM or Hitman or Dishonored 2 or even XCOM 2 on it, but this is still a PC that just about fits into a pocket yet can play many thousands of cool videogames. In a horribly, cheesy way, one might call this the IndieBox. But one most certainly should not. The other thing I’ve been using it for is as a retro emulator, due to having recently fallen down an ‘oh god so many modern games are so long and complicated and self-regarding so 90s Nintendo games suddenly seem highly appealing after years of Ninty abstinence’ rabbit hole. RetroArch is a fine, fine application that acts as an all-in-one emulator for any console that can be successfully emulated, though is at its best for NES, SNES, Megadrive, N64 and PSX. I haven’t bothered with the latter two as yet, but it’s been glorious on the Voyo for GBA and SNES games, hooked up to the TV with a wireless gamepad. There are all sorts of bespoke or single-platform retro boxes around these days, but you can’t beat the all-purpose nature of the PC, and I would say that both price and performance are right for this one if that’s the kind of gaming you want to do on it. Only you get all this amazing 2D/older 3D stuff from Steam, GoG, itch etc too. I’ve used both an older (full-size) PC and a Steam Link to try and achieve similar, but either space and noise are an issue or there’s just a bit too much fiddle and compromise involved. This wee thinger fits the bill very well. Sure, you could achieve similar on a cheap laptop or a more powerful second-hand machine for similar money. But it won’t go in your back pocket or tuck behind a couple of books, will it? There’s one major exception to my fondness for this thing, which is that it’s surprisingly noisy. Not noisy-noisy, but the fan is very noticeable and a little more high-pitched than I’d like with it whenever it’s doing anything intensive. If you’re just, say, tapping words into a CMS, it’s silent, but videos and games or loading applications into memory spool it up and, in a quiet room, it’s always there in the background. If I had the time/patience, I might crack it open and try and fit a larger, therefore quieter fan to it. I’d stick another 4GB of RAM into it while I was there, which is possible but requires total and possibly scary disassembly. (An extra hard drive only requires taking off the bottom side, however). I also wish it had built-in WiFI and Bluetooth – there’s an adaptor for the former included, but you’ll need to supply the latter yourself, and if you have both that’s two of its three USB ports gone. That aside, it’s hard to argue with. It’s cute, its blantantly Mac Mini-aping style is pleasant to behold and yeah, it’s totally a usable Windows 10 PC. For £100 it would be a no-brainer, for £150 it’d still feel OK as a secondary PC/media centre/indie-retro games console – or even for a box you can sling in your pocket/bag and take it round your mate’s to play Dota or League of Legends. For £190 though, it’s moving beyond random indulgence and into ‘need to really rationalise this purchase’ territory, although I should mention that it does come with Windows 10 pre-installed, which sweetens the deal. But yeah, currently just slightly too expensive to feel comfortable as a suck-it-and-see purchase. There will be more boxes like this, perhaps some that much cheaper, and on the other side of the scale Intel are putting their new full-fat Kaby Lake CPUs into teeny PCs, which will cost more but be more capable. This type of PC is here to stay, I think. And with PC gaming such a broad church now, they’re going to make for lovely mini-consoles.

Well, of course, if you want to play latest AAA graphic games such as Tomb Raider or Witcher 3 in 1080p at very high to ultra-super-duper-max then you need expensive hard-ware. Still it seems a lot is a sales-pitch by companies, and the people who test stuff on a regular basis, of course they will notice the difference. But let’s be honest – as average user, if you have an “ok PC” and you play say Witcher 3 in medium to high at around 30-40 fps without, or very few, hick-ups and don’t have the direct comparison, you won’t notice the difference. I recently built on office PC from scratch parts, old PSU, a 7950, external harddisc. Bought a cheap mobo and an i3, plus SSD as boot media and 16 GB memory (I didn’t save on the latter 2), and voila, I can play any “simple” game at max settings at 60 fps, I can play Wicher 3 or Dark-Souls III at satisfying settings and fps, so I am good with that. The i3 has an Iris chip built in which also works fine for the majority of smaller titles (ok, not Witcher 3, but anyway). And as media-PC, currently, I have a ras.Pi2 and works fine with hdmi streaming from my NAS. So again, alot of the fancy hardware for the average Joe is just a sales-thing from the hardware producers.

It’s similarly specced to the box in the article but not much bigger than a cigarette box. Similar to the Intel compute stick, it plugs straight into a hdmi port. I’m very impressed with it for what it is. I plugged it into a little chinese projector and had system shock 2, deus ex etc running at 1080p down scaled to the projectors native resolution of 800×400. Considering I bought it just as a retro machine to play old pc games from my teens it’s done the job admirably. There’s some good youtube videos on how to squeeze the most out of integrated graphics, and once it was all configured I could run anything up to around doom 3 in 1080p. If you dropped that to 720p you’d probably cope fine with half life 2 and others from around that era. I was skeptical because there’s barely any info or reviews of the t08 online but it’s worked out really well so far Log in to Reply 10/01/2017 at 23:42 alison says: I don’t think I have ever read a hardware article on RPS, and tbh I only skimmed this one too. But I should comment because I have been a “low spec” gamer for a long, long time. Back in 2002-ish I gave up on traditional desktop computers and since then have always gamed on SFF PCs. First was the Mini-ITX. Back then the only manufacturer was VIA, and their CPU wasn’t even Intel. It was the laughing stock of computers, but it ran Deus Ex and Counter-Strike acceptably. Later I moved to the Alienware 11″ laptop, back when they still cared about making smallish computers. But in the smartphone era that got too big too, so I moved to a Lenovo Miix 11″ tablet. I am still using that tablet today, along with an Alienware Alpha in the corner of the room bought solely for the purpose of Steam streaming to the tablet. I can barely grasp how anyone would buy a “big” computer for gaming these days. The Alienware Alpha has a laptop NVidia chip that is several years old, but I can still play (via streaming) the latest games in 1080p in high or ridiculous graphics settings. When I was playing games direct from the tablet I could still happily play 3D games from several years ago in 720p or 800×600. Occasionally it was jerky (which is why I bought the Alpha), but the ergonomics balanced that out. I play everything in my bed, lying on my stomach. Sitting at a desk to play computer games seems like a weird thing people only did… well, 15 years ago before laptops got gud. Anywho. Point is. If you want portable gaming and you don’t mind low res on last-gen games, just get a tablet. And 1080p will work fine on adventures and other 2D games. But if you desperately want to play games on your television (who the fuck owns a television in the 21st century!?), then just get an Alienware Alpha. Or put a real computer in your closet and attach a stick of chewing gum with wifi to your television, because Steam streaming rocks all ass.

I use Steam in-home streaming myself, from a Windows host to both a laptop and desktop running Ubuntu 16.04, and I don’t have any stability issues at all. Is the crash at five minutes something you can produce in other circumstances? (Also, clearly this isn’t a support forum, so I’d suggest hitting up the Ubuntu forums for help if you haven’t already.)

You have an initial outlay once, and then all you do is incrementally upgrade one or two components once every few years. The last time I upgraded my “big” computer was plugging a new graphics card in about 2 years ago, and before that a new CPU about 5 years ago. It still runs all the latest games at their highest settings in 1080p. It’d probably struggle with 4k, but seeing as I haven’t got, nor have any intention to buy, a 4k screen that’s irrelevant to me. “Sitting at a desk to play computer games seems like a weird thing people only did… well, 15 years ago before laptops got gud.” Well, yes if you only play casual games on a tablet or with a controller in your living rooms. Anything beyond that, i.e. requiring a keyboard is pretty damn uncomfortable if you’re not sitting at a desk. And laptops are damn expensive and even then don’t match the performance of a mid-range desktop PC, so unless you’re short on space make no sense at all unless you’re actually going to be travelling with them. “But if you desperately want to play games on your television (who the fuck owns a television in the 21st century!?),” Errr, most people that live in something bigger than a bedsit??

I run Kodi on it, but it’s pretty much useless for games. It’s hobbled by the lack of decrete graphics card. It does have 8 GB RAM, an SSD, and most importantly a gigabit network port though. And this allows me to run Steam In-Home Streaming. Which I’ve been consistently impressed with. Frankly, with a strong enough signal, it’ll run on wifi – I use my HP Stream netbook/mini laptop for this with slower games. OK, it blocks up your gaming PC, but if this isn’t an issue, streaming in general – I think NVIDIA has a similar tech – makes these little machines into genuine gaming systems.

Retro PC gaming via DOSBox is also possible on the Pi, but I haven’t tried it yet. Overall, the Pi seems like the most cost-effective way for PC gamers to dip their toes in the living room.

Third-party apps have lots more bells and whistles that take up more processor time.

Kodi even recognises my aging telly’s remote, meaning I can control the Pi via that. And I’ve just bought the Pi 3 with the intention of using it variously as a game and Mumble server. Being able to change the thing’s functionality in a matter of seconds by swapping out the SD card is fab.

Show More When Microsoft held an event last October, everyone thought it was prepping to announce the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 or Surface Book 2. Instead, we got the new Surface Studio, Windows Creative Update and a beefed-up Surface Book i7 with Performance Base. The Performance Base addition brought a redesigned keyboard base to the device, while the tablet display remained the same. With the hope of swaying creative professionals away from Apple, these internal updates include an NVIDIA GPU, a 6th generation Intel Core i7 processor and a 1TB hard drive. I've used the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base regularly for the last month, and there's a lot that I love about the it. Even though it's a device targeted at creative professionals, it's a notebook that will suit anyone that values performance. Unmatched performance This should come as no surprise, but the performance on the updated Surface Book i7 has been consistently impressive. But when I talk about performance, it's important to remember that I'm not an artist, a 3D video editor or even a heavy gamer. Pushing the limits of my notebooks typically means I'm 100 tabs deep in Google Chrome or I'm rehashing my youth by playing The Sims 4. But the Surface Book happily encourages my pathological level of browser tabs without a single complaint. And light gaming was more enjoyable; everything ran faster and smoother than on my HP Spectre x360, which houses a 6th gen Intel i7 processor and integrated graphics. I wouldn't say it's worth spending over $3,000 on a notebook just to browse the internet with wild abandon and occasionally play The Sims 4 on the highest settings, but I can say my experience with the Surface Book this past month has truly spoiled me. If you need that level of performance, the Surface Book i7 is a strong contender and offers best performance you can get in this class of 13-inch notebooks. And, when you consider what it packs under the hood, it's incredibly thin and lightweight. [ Related story: Macbook Pro vs Surface Book i7 ] Portability While Surface Book i7 with Performance Base is a compact device for the performance it delivers, compared to other, less powerful 13-inch notebooks, it is kind of a beast. The display is a bit taller than your average 13-inch display, and with the dual cooling fans to support the improved GPU, it's slightly thicker and heavier than even the original Surface Book. And since I'm not someone who realistically needs that level of performance daily, I'd be more apt to grab the Surface Pro 4 if I'm travelling. The size and form factor are what would prevent the Surface Book from replacing my need for another device. But that's because my average workday consists of a steady Wi-Fi connection, the Microsoft Suite, Slack and, on rare occasion, Adobe Photoshop Elements. For me, carrying this updated Surface Book i7 on a work trip would feel excessive. I just don't need that level of performance on an average day and it would be too expensive to replace if stolen or damaged. If I needed to use 3D software or other high-powered design and editing software as part of my job, I I would be excited to travel with the Surface Book. It's certainly light and compact for someone who needs that level of performance, but for the average business user, or at least in my case, the Surface Pro 4 offers more than enough in a smaller package. [ Related story: 10 most popular hybrid tablet stories of 2016 ] It's not a tablet There's always a caveat to hybrid devices; they promise you both a tablet and notebook experience, but the truth is that they always fit more into one category. With its built-in trackpad and full Windows 10 OS, the Surface Pro 4 feels more like a notebook, while the iPad Pro, running iOS 10 and lacking a track pad, feels more like a tablet. They each fit different needs -- some people need a notebook more often than a tablet and vice versa. While the iPad Pro and Surface Pro 4 share more overlap in each category, the Surface Book is almost entirely a notebook that happens to have a detachable display. Without the keyboard dock, the tablet feels cumbersome and, since it lacks the kickstand on the Surface Pro 4, you can't just prop it up. Personally, I haven't found a need to use the Surface Book display as a tablet, and the same goes for my HP Spectre x360. I rarely find myself using either device in tablet mode, but I do frequently interact with the touch displays. I can see how if you were an artist, designer or worked in the field, the detachable display might be a bonus when combined with the Surface Pen. But for my personal needs, I'd be more inclined to reach for my iPad Air 2 or Surface Pro 4 before the Surface Book display. The little things There are so many minimal, thoughtful features that stand out on the Surface Book. The design is unique -- and love or hate the hinge, it's still a sleek device. Most of all, I appreciate that Microsoft nods to the industrial-chic design popularized by Apple without mimicking it the way other manufacturers have. Beyond the overall design, I also can't say enough good things about the Surface Book keyboard -- an often-overlooked feature on notebooks. It has the perfect key travel and the chiclet keys are spaced out just enough to make it comfortable to type. The Surface Book's trackpad offers just the right amount of responsiveness, especially compared to the hyper-sensitive trackpad on my HP Spectre x360. Battery life on the device is also unmatched -- thanks to the second battery. You can easily get through the day on one charge with light use. With heavier use, or if you're using battery draining peripherals like a wireless mouse, you can still get a solid six to eight hours before looking for an outlet. Buy now or wait it out? With so many hybrid rumors on the horizon for 2017, I can't help but wonder if the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base is just a taste of what we might see in the purported Surface Book 2. The updates in this case were purely internal and focused on packing in as much performance as possible. In the near future, there's the potential for 7th-generation Kaby Lake Processors and possibly even more graphics cards to choose from. Right now, the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base is so close to being the do-it-all notebook that can handle your work, editing, entertainment and gaming needs. But, considering the cost of this device at just over $3,000, I would say it's worth waiting to see what Microsoft has in store for the next Surface Book update. It reminds me of when the first Microsoft Surface was released -- the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base feels more like a taste of what's to come.

Here’s everything we know about the iMac 2017 UK release date, price and specification rumours. With Intel's new Kaby Lake processor announcements at CES 2017, new iMacs surely must be coming soon By Marie Brewis | 12 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Intel has announced Kaby Lake processors that we will likely see in Apple iMacs, but how long will we have to wait? A new iMac is hotly tipped for March 2017. Here’s everything we know about the iMac 2017 UK release date, price and specification rumours.  Also see: New MacBook Pro  iMac 2017 UK release date rumours: When is the iMac Pro coming out? New iMac UK release date: March 2017 (TBC)  Apple held a special event on 27 October in which it was expected to unveil new Macs. Chief among those Macs, following a Best Buy slip up that saw a Kaby Lake-powered iMac listed for sale, was a new iMac family. This didn't happen, but we're still fairly confident new iMacs are coming soon - with the next possible launch date March 2017. A Q1 2017 release date is all the more likely following Intel's Kaby Lake processor announcements at January's CES. We'd expect to see the S-Series desktop chips (7500/7600/7700K) in the 27in iMac, although there is no clear upgrade path for the 21.5in iMac - we'll just have to wait and see. Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated on an internal Q&A session that, "Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." iMac 2017 UK price rumours: How much is the iMac Pro?  According to Best Buy, if accurate, a 27in iMac with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive will cost $3,199.99. This appears to be slightly higher than the current 27in iMac with 32GB RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive, though of course we don’t know exactly what other upgrades this model includes (and whether or not it is merely placeholder text).  Over in the UK the current 21.5in iMac starts at £899 or £1,199 with a 4K display, while the 27in 5K model starts at £1,449, both direct from Apple. We would expect prices to remain roughly the same.  iMac 2017 specification rumours: Is the iMac Pro any good?  Following that Best Buy leak, it’s highly likely the new iMac will feature a processor upgrade to Intel’s latest Kaby Lake family. The listing also mentioned a 27in 5K display, 32GB of memory and a 2TB Fusion Drive, with the model priced at $3,199.99. It could be placeholder copy, but why bother to update the processor? We’d really like to see this Fusion Drive rolled out as standard across the range.  Apple could well turn to AMD once again for its graphics solution, with Polaris 10 a prime candidate. It offers improved graphics performance (naturally), plus potential reductions in power consumption and waste heat. More exciting, though, is that these new graphics chips would for the first time bring VR potential to the Mac.  We’ve seen Apple bring the Pro name to its iPad line-up over the past year, and we’re anticipating that the iPad mini will also get a Pro makeover next week. One rumours circulating online is that the iMac will also get Pro treatment, and we could be about to see a sufficiently powerful iMac Pro to replace the Mac Pro.  Content continues below For more new iMac rumours see our sister site Macworld.

After quietly unveiling some of the lower powered U-series 7th Generation Kaby Lake processors in September, Intel this week rolled out the full line of dozens of Linux-friendly Kaby Lake processors at the CES show in Las Vegas. The product line includes dual-core Y-series parts for 2-and-1s and compute sticks that run at a low 4.5W TDP, as well as more dual-core U-series models with 15W and 28W TDPs. The previously revealed U-series chips re already being tapped by Congatec’s Conga TC175 and MSC’s MSC C6C-KLU COM Express Compact modules. Intel chart showing 7th Gen family (left) and U-series processor (click images to enlarge) Intel also unveiled a new range of mostly quad-core H-series mobile Core and Xeon E3 CPUs with 35W and 45W TDPs. Rounding out the launch are 16 quad- and dual-core S-series desktop-class models with TDPs ranging between 35W and 91W. As part of the announcement, Intel teased a new Kaby Lake ready Intel Compute Card form factor that partially updates the Intel Compute Stick. In addition, Intel announced four NUC mini-PCs featuring dual-core, U-series Kaby Lake processors, one of which — the Intel NUC Kit NUC7i7BNH — represents a new hardware design and is available for presale. Intel 7th Gen Kaby Lake SKUs: Y-, U-, and H-series (left) and S-series Source: Intel via AnandTech (click images to enlarge) Intel’s Kaby Lake roll-out was only one of many other announcements at CES. These included new virtual reality collaborations, the Intel 5G Modem, and plans to acquire 15 percent ownership of the HERE location technology firm. Intel jumped further into automotive by unveiling its Intel GO technology for autonomous driving, as well as a related collaboration with BMW Group and Mobileye that aims to deliver self-driving cars by 2021. The companies plan to develop an “open platform for autonomous driving.” Intel’s soft pedaling of its flagship processors is not surprising given several independent benchmarks that show only slightly greater CPU and GPU performance than the 6th Gen Skylake, with modest improvements in power efficiency and other functionality. This was more or less expected given that the 7th Generation is the third generation of processors using Intel’s 14nm process, albeit slightly improved to a “14nm+” process. So while Kaby Lake is highly optimized compared to the 5th Gen, 14nm Broadwell, it’s not much of an improvement over Skylake. Profile view of 4.5W Kaby Lake Y-Series CPU (click image to enlarge) Although Kaby Lake did “squeeze an extra 8-10% out of Skylake in equivalent power envelopes,” according to ExtremeTech, the publication questioned whether it might be “time for a new x86 architecture.” Ars Technica found the new Kaby Lake desktop models, such as the Intel Core i7-7700K, to be a “disappointment,” leading to the rhetorical question: “Is the desktop CPU dead?” The publication did like the fact that some of the 15W U-series processors add Intel Iris Plus graphics, which “promise as much as a 65 percent performance boost over older Intel HD graphics.” The publication also praised the new 45W H-series chips for enabling overclocking. AnandTech took the deepest dive, and was somewhat less critical, while still concluding “For the most part, Kaby Lake doesn’t do much new.” Most of the improvements came in power efficiency. “What used to get you 3.0 GHz last year now gets you 3.3 GHz, which means saving time doing work or saving money burning less power,” says the story. AnandTech also looked into features like the speedy new Intel Optane caching memory and SSD technology supported by Kaby Lake, as well as the improved 10-bit video decoding. The story examined the subset of U-, Y-, H-, and S-series chips imbued with vPro security technology, as well as the expanded use of overclocking, especially in regard to the Core i3-7350K, Intel’s first ever unlocked Core i3. If the response to Kaby Lake was muted, it is perhaps because of the greater improvements announced at CES with two other major processors. First, there’s AMD’s Ryzen family of high-end, x86-based gaming processors, including an 8-core, 16-thread model. Let the overclocking begin. Receiving even more attention is Qualcomm’s 10nm fabricated, ARM-based Snapdragon 835, which is 35 percent smaller and claimed to use 25 percent less power than the Snapdragon 820. The octa-core SoC runs half of its Kryo 280 cores at 2.45GHz, and the other half at 1.8GHz. The Snapdragon 835 features an Adreno 540 GPU with up to 25 percent improved rendering, as well as a new Hexagon 682 DSP. The SoC provides support for low-power LPDRR4X RAM, Category 16 LTE, 802.11ad WiFi, and Bluetooth 5.0. Benchmarks will await shipments due this spring.   Further information Intel’s 7th Gen Core “Kaby Lake” processors appear to be shipping now. More information may be found in Intel’s 7th Gen Intel Core briefing and in-depth fact sheet.   Related posts: Intel NUC mini-PCs set sail on Kaby Lake COM Express modules build on Intel's Kaby Lake Intel ditching tick-tock, shifting to three-stage CPU… Intel's Kaby Lake arrives on COM Express Compact at up… Intel Compute Card standard to turbocharge CE devices Kaby Lake board lineup includes a Mini-ITX SBC and two COMs Intel reveals Broxton Atoms with Gen9 GPUs Tough Skylake box PC has four GbE and eight USB ports 10-core MediaTek Helio X30 SoC to include two Cortex-A73… "Apollo Lake" Atoms to offer graphics-rich… (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Here is the Fora team’s guide to the most promising firms to keep an eye out for in 2017: 1. Arklu The year gone by was a successful one for the Donegal-based toymaker. In July it was announced as the winner of Google’s latest Adopt a Startup program for Ireland and it also signed a publishing deal with children’s books giant Penguin in mid-October, with the first books set to be launched in May 2017. Nuritas 28 Source: Sebastiaan ter Burg Some interesting names have put their money behind the biotech startup, which is isolating active ingredients in food that can help improve human health. Billionaire Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, Bono, and The Edge have all dipped into their pockets to fund the company, founded by Nora Khaldi, and the young firm has already discovered a peptide that has the capacity to kill the bacterial infection known as MRSA. Deposify 28 Source: Deposify This fintech startup likes to think of itself as ‘PayPal for deposits’. Earlier this year it raised over a million euro in venture capital funding and also signed a deal with Irish property management startup Property Button, which has the potential to bag Deposify nearly €3 million a year in revenue. In 2017, the payments company’s service will be used in roughly 50,000 deposit transactions in the UK and Ireland, which together are worth up to €100 million. Movidius 28 Movidius founders Sean Mitchell (left) and David Moloney. Source: Maxwell Photography One of the bigger success stories from last year, the chip designer made the news when it was confirmed the company was going to be purchased by Intel in a deal worth at least €300 million. Intel said that the Irish company will help speed up its work in emerging technology markets, such as artificial intelligence and Internet of Things. Intercom 28 Source: Intercom The four Irishmen behind customer service startup Intercom saw their company hit new heights in 2016. After completing a series C round of $50 million in funding, total investment in the startup now stands at $115 million. It is thought to be closing in on so-called unicorn status – a venture capital-backed startup priced at $1 billion or more. The company also opened a new Chicago office and ran a series of events, called ‘Inside Intercom’ across the world to showcase its tech products. Chopped 28 Source: Shane O’Neill Photography Healthy fast-food chain Chopped had a busy year opening more outlets across Dublin, while also spreading its wings outside the capital by opening in Newbridge, County Kildare. The company’s co-founder Brian Lee told Fora earlier in the year it is now eyeing up an expansion to the UK in 2017. Wyldsson 28 Source: Joe Keogh Photography This food startup achieved what many before it have failed to do – it ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund a new product line. It actually reached its funding goal twice over, surpassing its €5,000 target to wind up with just over the €10,000 mark. Teamwork 28 Source: Gerard McCarthy The Cork software firm made a lot of noise in 2016 by opening a new office (complete with slide), launching an incubator for SaaS startups and announcing plans to hire 50 new staff to fill up the new space. The company is also hiring for a senior software engineer out in Sofia, Bulgaria, which hints that further expansion at the company’s operations could lie overseas. XSellco 28 Source: Xsellco The e-commerce software firm XSellco, which was founded by Hostelworld founder Ray Nolan, poached two senior employees from Irish travel startup Boxever and media company Storyful during the past year. The startup has also grown its headcount from 6 to 40 employees since 2015. Cohort 28 Next year looks like it could be a big one for Cohort, the latest company being cooked up by serial tech entrepreneur Eamon Leonard. According to his Twitter feed, the company, which is developing an app to help people make better use of their network, reached a funding milestone recently, which means it’s likely that a full version of the app could be released before long. BHSL 28 Source: BHSL Founded by Jack O’Connor, a poultry farmer-turned-entrepreneur, BHSL has developed technology that turns chicken manure into a source of fuel and heating for farms. The company recently announced that it completed €13 million in UK sales this year and appointed ex-Kerry Group chief executive Denis Brosnan as chairman, with O’Connor telling Fora it will be hunting for €7 million in funding to help boost its global sales in 2017. Digit Game Studios 28 Source: David Donoghue It has been a quiet year for Digit Games Studios on the announcements front, but the games developers that produced the popular Kings of the Realm app-based game have been busy working on a new Hollywood-based title that is set to be released in 2017. Voxpro 28 Source: Voxpro Since Cork-based Voxpro switched tack from being a paging company to operating specialized call centers for international clients a few years back, it has been on a huge expansion drive – and it kept growing fast in 2016. The firm announced in November that it is planning to hire over 2,000 people during the next 12 to 18 months, which will take its workforce to 3,000 globally. Voxpro is also one of the few Irish companies to have developed a major presence in the US, and with its hiring drive that looks set to swell. Carrick Therapeutics 28 Source: Carrick Therapeutics This firm was one of the biggest surprise packages of last year. Virtually nothing was known about Dublin-based Carrick Therapeutics when it made the huge announcement that it had raised a whopping $95 million to fund cancer research. The company has some serious backers behind it including Woodford Investment Management, led by Neil Woodford, regarded as one of the UK’s best fund managers. The company is now getting to work on treatments for colon and breast cancer, and will hopefully make some more noise in 2017. Inflazome 28 Source: Nick Bradshaw While it might not sound quite as impressive next to Carrick’s $95 million, the €15 million raised by Irish health startup Inflazome is not to be sneezed at. The company is looking to develop treatments for chronic inflammatory diseases and has one of Ireland’s brightest scientists, Trinity College professor Luke O’Neill, on board. O’Neill told us during the year that he is hopeful of selling the company at some point, so one to keep an eye on. GP Wood 28 Source: GP Wood It might not garner the attention like the next hot tech startup, but 2017 could be a big year for Cork timber processor GP Wood. The low-key company is one of the most successful in its area and has just sunk €14 million into a major sawmill upgrade. GP Wood is looking to top its pre-recession heights in 2017, and if all goes well it will double in size in the coming years, which would cement its position as one of Ireland’s biggest manufacturers. Providence Resources 28 Source: Finbarr O’Rourke 2016 was a poxy year for Providence and for most Irish resource-exploration companies. Like the rest of the industry, the Dublin-based firm was struggling with low oil prices and had to suspend its shares at one point as it grappled with its debts. However, the firm managed to raise €66 million by selling shares in what was essentially a company-saving exercise. Providence recently struck a deal to drill off the coast of Ireland in the hope of making a major oil find – and while commercial oil projects in Ireland are currently non-existent, this looks like as good a prospect as there is out there. Cartoon Saloon 28 Angelina Jolie is backing Cartoon Saloon Source: AP/Press Association Images. Irish animation has been booming lately, and Cartoon Saloon has been one of the companies leading the charge. It has already produced critically acclaimed and Oscar-nominated movies in the form of Song of the Sea and the Secret of Kells. We’re expecting big things and a big fuss when the next feature film it’s working on, the Breadwinner, which is being backed by Hollywood A-list actress Angelina Jolie, premieres in September. Rubicoin 28 Source: Rubicoin The fintech startup, founded by Emmet Savage and John Tyrrell, wants to turn legions of average Joes into savvy stockholders, and it raised €1.2 million in 2016 with a hit list of five international markets to target. Valitacell 28 Source: YouTube Early-stage Dublin medtech startup Valitacell, which produces a kit that speeds up the process for making biological drugs, is gearing up to trial its product with two of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. Towards the end of 2016, the company also took home the overall prize in InterTradeIreland’s annual Seedcorn competition, giving it a significant publicity boost coming into the new year. Showtime Analytics 28 Source: Akai-Cas At the end of last year, the startup that provides data analytics services to the cinema industry made the headlines when it netted €1.2 million from Alibaba Pictures, a group associated with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The deal gives Showtime Analytics a foothold in the growing Chinese cinema sector, which has been tipped to soon overtake the US as the world’s largest movie market. Wicklow Wolf 28 Source: Philip Leonard The Wicklow-based craft brewer has plans to bring its popular line of beers international in 2017 after it received a €2 million round of investment in October. The company will also be increasing its production 15-fold in the coming year to keep up with demand from domestic and foreign markets. Version 1 28 Source: Maxwell Photography Last year, Version 1 completed two acquisitions, bringing the total number of companies it has acquired to seven since it was founded in 1996. The company also took part in the Irish Stock Exchanges IPO-Ready program, which hints at the possibility of a public listing sometime in the future. The firm’s co-founder, Justin Keatinge, earlier this year told Fora the business was aiming for €1 billion in turnover within 10 years. Genomics Medicine Ireland 28 Source: Conor McCabe Photography Ltd This Irish healthcare startup is partly bankrolled by Starbucks’ head honcho Howard Schultz and, although it was only founded in 2015, it raised a $40 million series A round last year. The company is researching the genetic causes of conditions such as Alzheimer’s and multiple sclerosis and will soon announce its first collaboration with an Irish hospital. Teckro 28 Source: Teckro This startup had been operating under the radar for a while before shooting to prominence last year when it raised $6 million from Founders Fund, the same venture capital fund to back Facebook, SpaceX, and Airbnb. The Limerick-based company is using the funding to build its product-development team. Beautifi 28 Source: Beautifi Dubbed the JustEat of Irish salon bookings, Beutifi made a splash last year when it bought one of its biggest rivals, SalonAddicts, as part of an aggressive move into the UK. The company, which first launched in mid-2014, stated the sale would allow it to grow revenues from €2 million to €10 million by the end of 2016. Brown Bag Films 28 Source: YouTube The Oscar-nominated Irish film studio went on a major hiring drive after it opened its new flagship studio in Smithfield. The company already has a studio in Manchester and an office in Los Angeles, and numbers at the Irish base are set to swell to 255. The growth in staff numbers will help the company take on further production contracts, like the one it signed to create children’s television show Gilbert and Allie. UrbanVolt 28 Source: Naoise Culhane This startup, which installs energy-efficient lights for businesses free of charge and splits the money from the energy savings, signed some big deals in 2016. UrbanVolt only started trading in April, but it has already received backing from Irish rugby international and investor Jamie Heaslip, while during 2016 it signed a €30 million funding deal with Swiss sustainable energy private equity firm Susi Partners. It also agreed on a partnership with Bord Gáis Energy to be the lighting provider for 30,000 of its commercial customer base. --- This article was originally published in Dublin Globe.

Print Email Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com By Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on January 12, 2017 at 6:10 AM, updated January 13, 2017 at 4:22 PM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- In a statement released Wednesday evening, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper essentially confirmed the CNN report that Donald Trump, Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer had derided as "fake news." CNN had reported that President-elect Trump's last security briefing had included a two-page summary of a 35 page dossier making unverified claims that Russia had compromising financial and personal information on Trump.  CNN never reported details of what the accusations were because the claims were unverified.   Hours after the CNN report was published, BuzzFeed published the entire 35 page dossier that had been compiled by a credible former MI6  agent who had spent his career working in Russia as a British spy. After Trump accused the Intelligence community of leaking news of the Intel briefing, Clapper released a statement Wednesday saying he had the opportunity to speak with Trump again that evening, "to discuss recent media reports about out briefing last Friday." Clapper said he expressed to Trump "profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press."  He said he told Trump he does not believe  the leaks came from within the Intelligence community.    Referring to the two-page summary in the Friday Intel briefing, Clapper said, "part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security." The Washington Post has also reported that a two-page summary of the allegations was included in Trump's Friday Intel briefing.   "A U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the nature of the summary "was fully explained" to Trump on Friday and "put into context," reported the Post. According to the Post, Clapper, FBI director James Comey, CIA director John Brennan and NSA director Mike Rogers, all had agreed that the summary needed to be included in the briefing to Obama and Trump on the results of the investigation into Russian hacking.    The group felt they had no choice but to make Obama and Trump aware of the information because the dossier had already been circulated in recent months among the media and members of Congress, "even before the IC became aware of it," Clapper said in his statement.   They feared the dossier would be published in the press before Obama and Trump were made aware of it, and the Intel agencies would look negligent and uninformed. Trump himself confirmed the CNN report when he blasted the IC accusing them of leaking what was discussed in the Friday briefing.  In his press conference he said the only people in his office who even knew the briefing took place would not have said anything. The statement from Clapper and Trump, and the Washington Post story mean that Kellyanne Conway was really the one reporting fake news when she said on  Seth Meyers' show that Trump was never briefed on the allegations.   She continued to spread fake news when she later claimed in an interview with Anderson Cooper that Trump never was briefed on the dossier.  Trump's press secretary Sean Spicer also spread fake news when he conflated what CNN had reported with what BuzzFeed published. Trump spread fake news again when he labeled CNN "fake news" and praised other news organizations.   The New York Times reported the same story CNN did, but the Times went into more descriptive detail in summarizing the allegations than even CNN did.    Trump's ticked at CNN because they broke the story that he was given the two-page summary, not because what they reported was fake, because it wasn't. The question is who in the U.S. government leaked to the press that the two-page summary was in the brief, and why did they leak it?    Clapper asserted to Trump that he doesn't believe the IC leaked it.    But who else could have known about the summary besides the CIA, FBI and the NSA? Did someone in the IC leak it as payback for Trump denigrating the IC?    Was it leaked to send a message to the press that it's a legit story that should be given more attention.     Clapper in his statement said he emphasized to Trump that the dossier "is not a U.S. Intelligence Community  product." He adds, "the IC has not made any judgement that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely on upon it in anyway for our conclusions"   Which makes it all the more unusual that the IC still felt they needed to brief Obama and Trump on the information. In reading part of the 35 page dossier, what struck me was how in sync some of the allegations were with Trump's comments on Putin and Russia on the campaign trail and since his election.   The allegations also line up with Paul Manafort's involvement in the Trump campaign and his sudden departure. Trump's press conference wasn't a press conference.   It was Trumptantrum in which the father of fake news declared war on real journalism after he spent eight years spreading his bogus Obama birther story. While Trump has routinely attacked the U.S. free press, the U.S. Intelligence agencies and war heroes like John McCain, he's never said a negative thing about former KGB officer Vladimir Putin.   If you haven't wondered why, you should start to if you care about the integrity of the office of the presidency.

There were important announcements from two of the most established chip suppliers in the auto sector, NXP and Nvidia – the former particularly closely watched because it will soon be part of Qualcomm. Its launches reminded the industry how strategic an acquisition it will be, bringing significant depth and breadth to its new parent’s auto offering, surrounding the core Snapdragon modem/processor with many other car-related chips, and adding valuable connections with the car industry and its channels. NXP adds to Qualcomm’s dowry The main CES launch by NXP was a software defined radio (SDR) solution for IVI systems called the SAF4000. This claims to be the world’s first one-chip system covering all global audio broadcast standards, including AM/FM, DAB+, DRM(+) and HD. The primary benefit is to slash hardware costs, as car radio systems generally require bulky circuit boards and six separate integrated circuits – whereas the SAF4000 is the size of just a fingertip. Other companies provide a single RF front end to all these standards, but this is the first to deliver an entire system-on-chip (SoC), rather than offloading some of the processing to a device CPU. This is part of NXP’s wider push to simplify the connected car device ecosystem by replacing multichip systems with compact RFCMOS chips, which will drive down costs and encourage mass uptake. That will complement Qualcomm’s existing presence in some Android Auto IVI systems, as well as its constant drive towards greater integration. “The step from multichip discrete to a one-chip RFCMOS solution is a true quantum leap for the industry,” said Torsten Lehmann, general manager Car Infotainment and Driver Assistance at NXP. “One-chip means a significantly smaller hardware footprint, easier development and simple worldwide integration with the ability to receive multiple different digital, as well as analog, radio standards and to switch between them via software. Centralized infotainment head units, distributed radio/audio systems, as well as smart antenna solutions are perfectly supported by this new one-chip family.” Qualcomm’s $47bn acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, once it closes, will push the US firm into lead place in the auto chip market and third place in the overall global semiconductor industry. NXP says its radio designs are in 19 of the top 20 Tier 1 automotive offerings, adding up to over 500m car radio deployments in the past 10 years. It also claims that its i.MX multimedia app processors have been deployed in over 65m vehicles. Qualcomm launches Drive Data Qualcomm itself, which unveiled an automotive variant of its Snapdragon SoC (the 820A) at CES 2016, followed up this year with new X16 LTE modems for next-gen auto applications; a customer win in Volkswagen IVI systems for the updated Snapdragon 820Am; and a partnership with Panasonic to develop a next-gen Android-based IVI system for vehicles, using the Snapdragon 820Am running Android 7.0. The Panasonic concept was on display at CES. More important to the US chip giant was the launch of the Drive Data Platform, which is Qualcomm’s brand for its sensor-fusion platform for collating and acting on all the sensor inputs that are generated by a vehicle, ranging from cameras to radar and lidar. The Drive Data Platform is based on the Snapdragon 820Am, and will make extensive use of the Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine (SNPE), to use machine learning and AI techniques to enhance its data processing abilities – allowing the car to identify what it sees via those sensors. More details are due to be announced after CES, but this sounds like the first step down a very significant road for Qualcomm. Drive Data highlights the fact that chip giants need to provide full platforms, not just silicon, in order to dominate the IoT. With Nvidia well ahead of the game in supporting intelligent and driverless cars via an AI-driven big data system, Drive Data states Qualcomm’s intention of going up against that rival, as well as Intel, in the intelligent car data platform game – not to mention other contenders from outside the chip industry, such as Google, Tesla, Baidu and Uber. Audi divides its favours Nvidia itself is already a powerhouse in the connected car, and is particularly looking to harness its GPU-based computational/AI platform to power the driverless vehicle. At CES, is touted new partnerships with Here, Audi, ZF and Zenrin as stepping stones to auto dominance. Audi was spreading its favors between Qualcomm and Nvidia. With the latter, it announced a collaboration to put the world’s most advanced AI-driven car on the road by 2020 – a claim that has probably irked Google’s newly minted Waymo division (see inset). Before 2020, Audi will be using Nvidia’s Drive PX 2 platform and DriveWorks software. The partners had an Audi Q7 SUV at CES, running demos of in which passengers were driven around while sitting in the backseats, with no driver. Nvidia’s PilotNet deep neural networks are the basis for the car’s ability to see and understand the driving environment, providing machine vision, object recognition and allowing the Q7 to adapt to the demo’s changing road surfaces and lane markings, with a simulated construction zone detour. Car makers extend their wireless partnerships Fiat-Chrysler (FCA) and Alphabet’s new Waymo division announced a partnership to work on an Android-based reboot of FCA’s Uconnect operating system – possibly the first iteration of a complete version of Android for vehicles. FCA also showed off its new concept autonomous vehicle, Portal, at CES. It has worked with the Panasonic Automotive Advanced Engineering team to create a user experience with facial recognition and voice biometric software, to identify who is in the vehicle at any one point to customize the environment for them with music, lighting, vehicle temperature, heated or cooled seats and so on. The experience is powered by Panasonic’s Cognitive Infotainment (PCI) platform, which will be trying to eat into an AI-driven market currently led by Google and IBM. Ford is integrating its Sync IVI system with Samsung Gear S2 and S3, so that wearable owners can be given notifications, such as parking alerts, by their car. Ford has also implemented high speed in-car WI-Fi hotspots into its 2017 models, powered by AT&T’s LTE service. The Sync Connect system can allow up to 10 connected devices in any one car. Mercedes will integrate Google Assistant into its 2017 models and expects to see customers communicate with their cars through Google Home, in a similar way to Ford’s Amazon Alexa-based system (see separate item). Nvidia and Audi first graced CES together some seven years ago, in a partnership that gave birth to the latter’s MMI navigation system and virtual cockpit, powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. The latest announcement sees Audi promise to roll out its new A8 sedan, which it claims will be the world’s first Level Three automated vehicle. This will allow drivers to turn their attention away from the road and allow the system to control the car and monitor the environment, with the expectation that the human driver will respond only to a request to intervene. Audi’s zFAS system is the heart of its autonomous vehicles, and is built around Nvidia silicon (though there is speculation that the ties may be loosening because of Intel’s MobilEye deal—see below). For the new A8 car, the zFAS platform will be using Nvidia’s Tegra SoC and software, but it’s noteworthy that the Q7 that is being demonstrated is using the entire Drive PX 2 system, and not just a chip and code. Other Nvidia moves at CES Also on the self-driving front, Nvidia said that ZF, a major provider of equipment to the commercial vehicle and trucking industry, is the first top tier auto supplier to make a self-driving computer based on the Drive PX 2 commercially available. Called the ZF ProAI, the unit uses the Drive PX 2’s AutoCruise configuration, which should allow companies to build self-driving vehicles, ranging from trucks to warehouse forklifts. The unit processes inputs from multiple sensors, including cameras, lidar, radar, and ultrasonic sensors, which help the vehicles locate themselves locally on a map of the wider world. And speaking of world maps, Nvidia also announced a deal with mapping firm Here, once part of Nokia and now owned by a consortium of German auto makers, to expand the capabilities of cars powered by Nvidia tech. The new partnership sees Here use Nvidia’s MapWorks AI tech to improve its HD Live Map, with Nvidia developing a localization technology for HD Live Map as part of its DriveWorks software – which will allow automakers using the Drive PX2 computer to integrate the Here localization. The third part of the agreement sees the pair collaborate on incorporating real-time updates into the IVI systems, so that occupants can see the changes dynamically. “HD maps are essential for self-driving cars,” said Jen-Hsu Huang, Nvidia’s CEO. “Here’s adoption of our deep learning technology for their cloud-to-car mapping system will accelerate automakers’ ability to deploy self-driving vehicles.” Despite the Here deal, Nvidia also announced a deal with Zenrin, a Japanese mapping company, to jointly develop another cloud-to-car system for self-driving cars, with the Drive PX 2 and DriveWorks software being paired with Zenrin’s mapping platform – in a pretty similar arrangement to Here’s. “Zenrin’s big data includes road images and point-cloud data captured by mapping-survey vehicles,” said Koji Haraguchi, head of R&D at the mapping firm. “Combining Nvidia’s AI technologies and Zenrin’s big data will enable us to provide wider coverage of HD maps to automotive manufacturers with a dramatically shorter lead time.” Intel takes 15% stake in Here If Nvidia was not being exclusive, neither was Here, which has also got far closer to Intel since the holiday. This is symptomatic of more than just a battle with Nvidia for a particular platform, however important – Intel wants to undermine its rival’s entire GPUbased approach to AI and big data platforms, whether for connected cars, the IoT or enterprise cloud. If it can push its own architectures - which are focused on microprocessors, specialized AI chips and FPGAs rather than GPUs - as superior solutions, it could weaken the whole Nvidia philosophy in key areas of deep learning, such as autonomous vehicles. There is a long way to go with that strategy, since the GPU-based approach has so far proved to be a powerful and relatively simple one for high end AI-driven platforms. But Intel is putting many of the pieces in place to attack Nvidia’s areas of strength. This was the thinking behind the recent acquisition of Nervana, which had already mounted a credible challenge to Nvidia’s CUDA software, which powers its GPUs, with its own Neon cloud service, and is set to launch a deep learning accelerator chip on the drawing board, and set to launch next year. Intel has also acquired Movidius to expand its machine vision capabilities, and now taken a stake in Here. The companies which acquired Here from Nokia - Audi, BMW and Daimler – have reduced their one-third stakes to 25% each, selling 15% of the total to Intel and another 10% to a group of Chinese companies (Tencent, NavInfo and GIC). Intel and Here say they plan to develop a “highly scalable proof-of-concept architecture that supports real time updates of high-definition maps for highly and fully automated driving as well as explore opportunities in IoT and machine learning.” For Intel, this is a fairly straightforward way for it to secure the mapping and locational data that it needs to power its automotive ambitions, while adding a lot of contextual richness to the data sets. With a little dot-joining, one can spot patterns leading to the deal, such as Intel’s previous partnerships with Mobileye and BMW to build a fleet of fully autonomous cars by 2021. Indeed, at CES, Here announced its own deal with Mobileye – another of the prominent companies making specialised, optimised chips for AI and IoT functions, and so potentially strengthening Intel’s platform against Nvidia’s. The importance of the Mobileye deal Intel’s partnership with Mobileye, augmented by a new deal last fall with Delphi, is so important in the connected car world that some are calling it the Wintel of that market, because it could combine the smaller firm’s excellent and specialized vision algorithms with a more advanced processor roadmap than its own. Daniel Galves, Mobileye’s chief communications officer, recently told EETimes about the possible division of labor between its own technology and Intel’s, saying: “The Mobileye SoC will run all sensor processing software (8-camera surround view by Mobileye, radar/lidar processing by Delphi), localization mapping by Mobileye REM, and sensor fusion will run. On the Intel SoC, all driving policy (reinforcement learning algorithms for path strategy by Mobileye) and driving control (driving behavior software by Delphi’s Ottomatika) will run.” That is before Intel has even unveiled its expected automotive system- on-chip, based on multiple Xeon cores, which could combine with Mobileye’s EyeQ chip, which supports computer vision in the ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) which Mobileye dominates. There has already been speculation that Intel has struck a real blow at Nvidia with its Mobileye and other partnerships. Nvidia was at the heart of the Audi zFAS – a centralized assistance controller the German carmaker is developing with Delphi and Mobileye, which also uses FPGAs from Altera, now part of Intel. If Altera will open doors for Intel in some unfamiliar markets, supporting optimized coprocessing for tasks with which standard x86 CPUs struggle, that will also squeeze some other chipmakers with a longer history in machine-to-machine and automotive. Mobileye, for instance, has traditionally worked with STMicro, but may now be hedging its bets with its Intel partnership. And now Here is part of the web too, announcing its own deal, to integrate data from Mobileye’s automotive machine vision sensors into Here’s Open Location Platform (OLP), using Mobileye’s Global Roadbook (GLRB) as a data layer. This is designed to increase the accuracy of the OLP, by adding contextually up-to-date landmark and roadway information pulled from vehicles using Mobileye’s sensors – the eyes of many of the most advanced semi-autonomous cars on the market. These vehicles will be piping the Road Segment Data (RSD) generated by Mobileye’s REM technology to the Here cloud, which will then be able to be shared with other vehicles using Here’s Live Map platform. As Here’s CEO, Edzard Overbeek, put it: “A real time self-healing and HD representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms. As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate Here’s ambitions in this area, but support the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud, and everything else connected.” Intel Go This is the latest step in Intel’s automotive transition, which has seen the division emerge from the IoT wing in the past year or so. That division is now getting its own brand, called Intel Go, which will revolve around new developer kits for automakers, based on its Atom and Xeon processors. Under the Go brand, Intel said at CES that it was launching two new developer kits for auto makers looking to add a brain to their vehicles. With a variant based around the low-power Atom processor, and another with a far more powerful Xeon backed up by new Arria 10 FPGAs, Intel is pitching the designs as the answer to all automotive computational needs – for sensor fusion to decision making. The new Intel Go Automotive SDK is Intel’s answer to the software side of the picture, while the Go Automotive 5G Platform aims to provide the V2X communication requirements, and to be the first commercial ‘5G’ world modem (see separate item). The new Go kits are going to be rolled out in a fleet of 40 BMW cars this year, as part of the test platform for the fleet with Mobileye and Intel. Towards the 5G car Of course, nobody could escape that ‘5G’ label, even in the car sector where 4G standards for wireless connectivity are not yet fully supported – last week saw tests based on the new LTE-V specifications, but there are all kinds of disputes between the 3GPP approach, the Wi-Fi community’s 802.11p and the DSRC specialized protocol. More of that potential industry split in an upcoming issue, but we can be sure that 5G, for all the hopes that it will prove to be an umbrella for many connectivity specs, will not really manage to neutralize all the politics behind these varying standards. But as long as 5G is not commercially real, participants from the car and wireless industries can keep their visions alive. For instance, PSA Group, owner of Peugeot and Citroёn, has partnered with Orange and Ericsson to work on "Towards 5G" car platforms based for now on the emerging LTE-V standard and on virtualization, but with a view to creating a roadmap towards 5G-based Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) to support smart and autonomous vehicles. Their pilot project sits outside similar efforts by the Qualcomm-driven 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), although Ericsson is part of both efforts. Orange will provide the spectrum and cellular network for the trial sites; Ericsson the radio and distributed, virtualized core network; and PSA will define the requirements, scope and user experience and provide technical validation. “Connected IoT services are a crucial way to enhance the user experience for our customers, who today demand unprecedented levels of comfort and convenience as well as personalized services in their vehicles,” said Carla Gohin, VP of research, innovation and advanced technologies at PSA.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola) More BOSTON (AP) -- Have you ever wanted to know what Tom Brady sees as he stares down a pass rush, scans the field for an open receiver ... or brushes his teeth in the morning? This year's Super Bowl broadcast could be just what you're looking for. Thanks to a 360-degree replay technology called "Be the Player," Fox TV broadcasters will be able to show a play from virtually any spot in the stadium within minutes of the action taking place. The spin around and zoom "freeD" system has been used at other sporting events — including the NBA and baseball All-Star Games and the Olympics — but this will be the first that goes the last step and shows things from the athlete's perspective . "The difference here is you would be able to go in and see from his vantage point what the player actually saw," said Zac Fields, a senior vice president for graphic technology and integration at Fox Sports Group. "It's something that most of us have never been able to see before. The vantage point that most of us have on TV is really different than what the guys see on the field. That's what the promise of this technology is." Intel is rolling out the new technology at this year's Super Bowl, and promoting it in an ad that will feature Brady in his everyday life — waking up, making breakfast, brushing his teeth — with the tagline: "Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic." As the Patriots quarterback snarfs down a pancake, the camera spins around to a new angle and shows the crumbs falling from his mouth. And, if New England makes it to the Feb. 5 Super Bowl in Houston, there will be even more opportunities to see things from Brady's perspective. "It's something that fans have always dreamed about: 'What did Tom see when he threw that pass?'" Jeff Hopper, the general manager of strategy and marketing for the Intel Sports Group, told The Associated Press in advance of the announcement. "Everyone wants to be the player, to see what it's like to see it from that point of view." To make the "Be the Player" video possible, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras in a perimeter inside NRG Stadium, creating what Hopper calls "a volumetric capture of everything that's going on on the field." The cameras are connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a special control room, where a half-dozen Intel producers, working with one from the Fox Sports broadcast, can pick out and package the replays that will be used in the broadcast. The massive amount of data — about 1 terabyte per 15-30 second clip — allows producers to position a "virtual camera" anywhere it wants — including, virtually, inside a player's helmet. (Early versions even toyed with superimposing a facemask on the screen, though that has apparently been dropped.) It will take about two minutes to produce the clips, meaning it's not yet ready for instant replay but could, for example, be available to show a new view of a touchdown by the time the teams are done with the extra point or kickoff. In an interview in Boston's Back Bay this week, Hopper said there could be up to 20 "Be the Player" replays, though ultimately it is up to Fox to decide how to use it. "It will depend upon the story you are trying to tell," Fields said. "It's not something we're planning on using because it is a new bell and whistle. It is a storytelling tool, and that's how we're planning to utilize it." Right now, use of the system is limited to big events: It took about a month to retrofit the stadium in Houston with all of the equipment needed for the freeD data capture. Also, each 15-30 clip consists of about 1 terabyte of data. But Hopper said new stadiums are already being built with the cameras in mind. "Anyone who's building a new stadium now is saying, 'What do we need to do to make it freeD ready?'" he said. "Because everyone sees it as the future." Eventually, Hopper said, the technology will not be limited to storytelling. Teams and leagues are hoping to mine the data to improve performance. In the X-Games, Hopper said, the athletes were eager to figure out how high they jumped and use that information to tune their techniques — or just brag about big air with the competition. In time, coaches will be able to use the video to see what their player saw, instead of relying on overhead shots of the field. And, as the turnaround time quickens, the technology would also help replay reviews by giving officials the ability to freeze the action and zoom in at any angle to look, for example, to see whether a player's knee was down before the ball popped out. "We're working with pretty much the entire sports world," Hopper said. "All the leagues, all the teams. I don't think there's anyone that we're not. We can't do them all, but we're talking with them all." And Hopper envisions a sports world where every fan will be able to immerse himself in the game on his phone or a virtual reality headset — not just view the shots curated by a TV producer sitting in a trailer next to the stadium. "That's good; I think it's interesting. But the transformative nature of what we're working on is: Everybody gets to do it themselves," Hopper said. "Ultimately you'll be able to be on the field, with the players — the best players in the world — whatever sport that is, whether it be soccer, football or cricket, whatever. You'll be able to be part of the action. I don't think you can get any more immersed." ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Did Packers get away with holding on Aaron Rodgers' game-saving throw? 501 messages8%73%19% New Federal Program Helps Pay Off Your Mortgage TheEasyLoanSiteSponsored Congress Members Join John Lewis in Boycott of Trump's Inauguration 109 messages6%63%31% Man Who Shot Wife Claimed She Killed Herself Over Body Image Issues 215 messages5%61%34% #2 of 10 Most Popular News Galleries of 2016: 9/11: Then and now - 15 years later 862 messages5%56%39% 2016 Federal Rebate To Pay Off Your Mortgage Get My RefinanceSponsored Protesters Take to the Streets Across the Country 31 messages9%58%33% Obama on Trump: ‘Don’t underestimate the guy, because he’s going to be 45th president of the United States’ 1569 messages6%67%27% Eight men own half the world's wealth: Oxfam 834 messages3%69%28% 2016 Solar Tax Rebates Terrifying Power Companies Free Solar QuotesSponsored Seldom-called penalty is very costly for Cowboys in first-quarter drive 361 messages6%68%26% #8 of 10 Most Popular News Galleries of 2016: Deadly attack at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport 884 messages9%12%79% Heartbreaking and Joyful Reunion for 18-Year-Old Kamiyah 3 messages0%67%33% 2016 Federal Rebate Pays Off Your Mortgage Smart Money Decisions TodaySponsored ‘Hidden Figures’ Prevails as ‘Monster Trucks,’ Ben Affleck’s ‘Live by Night’ Bomb at Box Office 1535 messages6%68%26% ‘Fame Can Change Things’: Aaron Rodgers’ Family Opens Up About Their Rift 425 messages3%79%18% Arkansas tries to strip Gen.

Jeff Hopper, the general manager of strategy and marketing for the Intel Sports Group, told The Associated Press in advance of the announcement. "Everyone wants to be the player, to see what it's like to see it from that point of view." To make the "Be the Player" video possible, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras in a perimeter inside NRG Stadium, creating what Hopper calls "a volumetric capture of everything that's going on on the field." The cameras are connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a special control room, where a half-dozen Intel producers, working with one from the Fox Sports broadcast, can pick out and package the replays that will be used in the broadcast. The massive amount of data — about 1 terabyte per 15-30 second clip — allows producers to position a "virtual camera" anywhere it wants — including, virtually, inside a player's helmet. (Early versions even toyed with superimposing a facemask on the screen, though that has apparently been dropped.) It will take about two minutes to produce the clips, meaning it's not yet ready for instant replay but could, for example, be available to show a new view of a touchdown by the time the teams are done with the extra point or kickoff. In an interview in Boston's Back Bay this week, Hopper said there could be up to 20 "Be the Player" replays, though ultimately it is up to Fox to decide how to use it. "It will depend upon the story you are trying to tell," Fields said. "It's not something we're planning on using because it is a new bell and whistle. It is a storytelling tool, and that's how we're planning to utilize it." Right now, use of the system is limited to big events: It took about a month to retrofit the stadium in Houston with all of the equipment needed for the freeD data capture. Also, each 15-30 clip consists of about 1 terabyte of data. But Hopper said new stadiums are already being built with the cameras in mind. "Anyone who's building a new stadium now is saying, 'What do we need to do to make it freeD ready?'" he said. "Because everyone sees it as the future." Eventually, Hopper said, the technology will not be limited to storytelling. Teams and leagues are hoping to mine the data to improve performance. In the X-Games, Hopper said, the athletes were eager to figure out how high they jumped and use that information to tune their techniques — or just brag about big air with the competition. In time, coaches will be able to use the video to see what their player saw, instead of relying on overhead shots of the field. And, as the turnaround time quickens, the technology would also help replay reviews by giving officials the ability to freeze the action and zoom in at any angle to look, for example, to see whether a player's knee was down before the ball popped out. "We're working with pretty much the entire sports world," Hopper said. "All the leagues, all the teams. I don't think there's anyone that we're not. We can't do them all, but we're talking with them all." And Hopper envisions a sports world where every fan will be able to immerse himself in the game on his phone or a virtual reality headset — not just view the shots curated by a TV producer sitting in a trailer next to the stadium. "That's good; I think it's interesting. But the transformative nature of what we're working on is: Everybody gets to do it themselves," Hopper said. "Ultimately you'll be able to be on the field, with the players — the best players in the world — whatever sport that is, whether it be soccer, football or cricket, whatever. You'll be able to be part of the action. I don't think you can get any more immersed." ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL 136 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

This year’s Super Bowl broadcast could be just what you’re looking for. Thanks to a 360-degree replay technology called “Be the Player,” Fox TV broadcasters will be able to show a play from virtually any spot in the stadium within minutes of the action taking place. The spin around and zoom “freeD” system has been used at other sporting events — including the NBA and baseball All-Star Games and the Olympics — but this will be the first that goes the last step and shows things from the athlete’s perspective . Blast from the past: House reinstates rule targeting agency spending, employee salaries “The difference here is you would be able to go in and see from his vantage point what the player actually saw,” said Zac Fields, a senior vice president for graphic technology and integration at Fox Sports Group. “It’s something that most of us have never been able to see before. The vantage point that most of us have on TV is really different than what the guys see on the field. That’s what the promise of this technology is.” Advertisement Intel is rolling out the new technology at this year’s Super Bowl, and promoting it in an ad that will feature Brady in his everyday life — waking up, making breakfast, brushing his teeth — with the tagline: “Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic.” As the Patriots quarterback snarfs down a pancake, the camera spins around to a new angle and shows the crumbs falling from his mouth.

(Early versions even toyed with superimposing a facemask on the screen, though that has apparently been dropped.) It will take about two minutes to produce the clips, meaning it's not yet ready for instant replay but could, for example, be available to show a new view of a touchdown by the time the teams are done with the extra point or kickoff. In an interview in Boston's Back Bay this week, Hopper said there could be up to 20 "Be the Player" replays, though ultimately it is up to Fox to decide how to use it. "It will depend upon the story you are trying to tell," Fields said. "It's not something we're planning on using because it is a new bell and whistle. It is a storytelling tool, and that's how we're planning to utilize it." Right now, use of the system is limited to big events: It took about a month to retrofit the stadium in Houston with all of the equipment needed for the freeD data capture. Also, each 15-30 clip consists of about 1 terabyte of data. But Hopper said new stadiums are already being built with the cameras in mind. "Anyone who's building a new stadium now is saying, 'What do we need to do to make it freeD ready?'" he said. "Because everyone sees it as the future." Eventually, Hopper said, the technology will not be limited to storytelling. Teams and leagues are hoping to mine the data to improve performance. In the X-Games, Hopper said, the athletes were eager to figure out how high they jumped and use that information to tune their techniques — or just brag about big air with the competition. In time, coaches will be able to use the video to see what their player saw, instead of relying on overhead shots of the field. And, as the turnaround time quickens, the technology would also help replay reviews by giving officials the ability to freeze the action and zoom in at any angle to look, for example, to see whether a player's knee was down before the ball popped out. "We're working with pretty much the entire sports world," Hopper said. "All the leagues, all the teams. I don't think there's anyone that we're not. We can't do them all, but we're talking with them all." And Hopper envisions a sports world where every fan will be able to immerse himself in the game on his phone or a virtual reality headset — not just view the shots curated by a TV producer sitting in a trailer next to the stadium. "That's good; I think it's interesting. But the transformative nature of what we're working on is: Everybody gets to do it themselves," Hopper said. "Ultimately you'll be able to be on the field, with the players — the best players in the world — whatever sport that is, whether it be soccer, football or cricket, whatever. You'll be able to be part of the action. I don't think you can get any more immersed." ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Will you soon be able to buy a virtual ticket the game? Share twitter Tom Taylor Wednesday January 11th, 2017 Half a century after the first VR headset was built by American computer scientist Ivan Sutherland, virtual reality still isn’t quite reality. But Intel’s CEO Brian Krzanich is banking on his company to fix that, and sports, he believes, might be the perfect playground for VR. At Intel’s press event at CES 2017, the company live streamed a Butler-Villanova men’s basketball game in VR, using footage captured by a six-camera pod, and also showed a 3D replay of a Read Madrid-Barcelona soccer game generated using 36 cameras placed around the Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona. For fans, says Krzanich, “our goal is that you could take any sport and through VR pick your seat.” Selling virtual tickets could significantly add to league revenues, especially since major teams already have the untapped potential of fanbases that just won’t physically fit inside their stadiums. FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images Last year, the Pokémon Go craze introduced many people to the idea of augmented reality, where computer generated entities are inserted into a view of the real world. Intel’s spin on this is merged reality, where real-world objects are inserted into the virtual world, and users can explore that world without fear of tripping over reality. The company plans to release its Project Alloy merged reality headsets to consumers by the end of this year, with the focus being on gaming. In a way, virtual reality feels like a solution waiting for a problem. It is fun and interesting to watch sports in VR, but not essential in the way that following a live game is all-but impossible without a radio or a television. And VR headsets are few and far between. Everyone who owns a car almost by default owns a radio, and there are 260 million cars in the U.S. Almost everyone who owns a home owns a TV, and there are 120 million homes in the U.S. In comparison, in 2016, only about 10 million VR headsets were sold worldwide. Ownership numbers are growing, but the available VR content has not yet made the headsets indispensible. Edge Indian brand Boltt aims to change the game with AI-powered fitness wearable devices Sports, according to Krzanich, might offer that content. You need to experience sports events live and they just aren’t the same when you’re not in the stadium. Last year Intel installed its 360-degree replay technology at Levi’s stadium—the 49ers home is barely a mile away from Intel’s HQ in Santa Clara, Calif. Using the footage from 36 cameras, the company can create a 3D model of each Niners home game and recreate a view of the action from any point within that space. The problem, though, is that the system generates two terabytes of data per minute, more than all the data a single person might generate over five years. “That’s a massive compute problem to solve,” Krzanich says. “So that’s why we feel we’re uniquely qualified to solve.” Intel’s current system takes about 90 seconds to generate its 3D world, which is only fast enough right now to be used for game highlights. Krzanich predicts, though, that within two years the system will work in real-time. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images “It is a bit of a fun engineering challenge,” Krzanich says about the data processing demands with a smile, betraying his background as an engineer. “But it’s a huge business opportunity,” he adds more seriously, switching back to CEO mode. Giving fans the opportunity to pick their seats, even if they can’t physically get to a game, means that both real and virtual tickets could be sold. There will be 71,500 people in NRG Stadium in Houston for Super Bowl LI on Feb. 5, paying an average ticket price of more than $2,500. But an unlimited number of people could sit in any single virtual seat, and with Intel 360-degree replay, viewing positions that would be impossible in the real world can be created—perhaps the hash marks at the 50-yard line. If even a fraction of the several hundred million expected to watch the Super Bowl paid a small percent of the in-person ticket prices for a virtual experience that would represent a whole lot of real money.

ISSN 2330-717X Home News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology Health Misreading Trump, Putin And US-Russian Relations – Analysis Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Photo montage from Wikipedia Commons sources. By Michael Averko January 12, 2017 The ongoing biases against Russia lead to new matters to refute. Matching the gross one-sidedness of her Washington Post (WaPo) employer, Kathleen Parker’s January 6 essay “If Obama Is a Muslim, Is Trump a Russian Spy?“, overlooks some damning points running counter to her faulty slant. Donald Trump has taken back his comments that questioned whether Barack Obama is American born. For its part, The WaPo continues to denigrate Russia in a factually challenged manner. (The use of the crank Propornot website and the false claim of a Russian hacking of the Vermont power grid being prime examples, along with continuous top heavy anti-Russian op-ed pieces and news reports.) Parker suggests a double standard favoring Muslim bashing over her presented claim of Russian mischief against the US. She describes Russia as an “enemy”. Her overlooked hypocrisy concerns the select outrage over anti-Muslim stances (real and hyped), while being soft on the frequent instances of bias against pro-Russian advocacy. Lacking specifics, Parker’s “proof” against Russia is the faith based US Intel report, which unlike her doesn’t refer to Russia as an “enemy”, while claiming a concerted Vladimir Putin approved Russian government effort to support Trump by defaming Hillary Clinton. Regarding that report, the mind reading point about the Russian government and Russia’s mass media preferring Trump over Clinton is in the no kidding and so what category. Trump has openly sought better US relations with Russia, as Clinton was the preferred choice of the anti-Russian neocons. The January 8 exchange between Fox News host Chris Wallace and Trump’s Chief-of-Staff Reince Priebus included the latter saying in the beginning that “he thinks” that Trump accepts the claim of Russian hacking of Democratic Party emails. Wallace’s persistent questioning led Preibus to change course later on in the discussion, saying that the president-elect accepted the Intel take of Russian hacking. In any event, Trump (for now) doesn’t seem to believe that this matter should cloud the effort to improve US-Russian relations. There’s a difference between hacking from the Russian government and Russian hackers who hack en masse, independent of the Kremlin. For several years, there’ve been reports of hacking from Russia, the US and elsewhere against ordinary Americans and others throughout the world. Ideally, there should be conclusive proof that the Russian government used a third party to advance their purported cause, as has been suggested in some circles. With confidentiality respected, a CNN host privately asked how I could consider Julian Assange’s take over US Intel? For the record, I didn’t specifically say such. Is Assange less biased than the Democratic Party utilized CrowdStrike, that has also essentially been used to promote negativity towards the counter-Euromaidan rebels in Ukraine? CrowdStrike has ties to the Atlantic Council – a group that has been overly partisan against Russia. I’m not alone in believing that the trustworthiness of US Intel is compromised by its politicized element and a past that has been found to not always be honest. This politicization was noted last week by Fox news host Brett Baier, who said that Trump’s criticism of Intel has been misrepresented. Opposing politically driven and questionable Intel claims doesn’t necessarily belittle the need for accurate Intel and recognizing that not everyone associated with that grouping has the faulty slants of John Brennan, James Clapper, Malcolm Nance and Michael Hayden. (Nance and Hayden are former US Intel personnel, who’re frequent US mass media talking heads.) There’s ample reason to seriously question if the released Democratic party emails (however done) made a difference in the outcome of the 2016 US presidential result. To date, I’m unaware of any poll revealing that the released Democratic Party emails had significantly changed the outcome of that vote. The Democratic Party should be faulted for having a lax cyber security regimen, along with saying some ethically challenging things. Not to be overlooked are the numerous instances of US government meddling in the elections of other countries  and the reality of major powers (perceived allies and otherwise) spying on each other. On January 3, there were two segments featuring different perspectives on the released Democratic Party emails in question. Fox News’ Sean Hannity, had a lengthy one on one with Assange, that brought up the criminal charges made against the WikiLeaks founder. The PBS NewsHour segment with CIA Director John Brennan, included this quote from him: “We see what he has done in places like Crimea and Ukraine and in Syria. he tends to flex muscles, not just on himself, but also in terms of Russia’s military capabilities. He plays by his own rules in terms of what it is that he does in some of these theaters of conflict. So I don’t think we underestimated him. He has sought to advance Russia’s interests in areas where there have been political vacuums and conflicts. But he doesn’t ascribe to the same types of rules that we do, for example, in law of armed conflict. What the Russians have done in Syria in terms of some of the scorched-earth policy that they have pursued that have led to devastation and thousands upon thousands of innocent deaths, that’s not something that the United States would ever do in any of these military conflicts.” Own rules as in what Turkey has done in northern Cyprus and the Clinton led NATO in Kosovo? It was a shameful example of journalism on the part of PBS to let Brennan’s comments go unchallenged. PBS had earlier run a pro-CrowdStrike feature. It’s not as if there aren’t any expert cyber security/ intelligence sources offering a different perspective. As for the devastation of thousands of civilians during war (raised by Brennan), consider some past US actions like what happened in Japan during WW II, the Cold War activity in Southeast Asia, as well as post-Cold War actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. The collateral damage emphasis has been hypocritically applied. Along with the subjectively dubious comments of Hayden and Nance, the above excerpted comments from Brennan are indicative of a (past and present) politicized element within US Intel. Among Russia friendly circles, some kudos has been given to Fox News’ Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Like their employer, these two individuals have a preference for Trump over the Democrats. However, like many pro-Trump sources, Hannity and Carlson maintain some of the anti-Russian biases, as The WaPo and some others speak of a possible unknown money trail linking Trump to Russia. Trump has had known business interests involving China and some predominately Muslim countries. That aspect hasn’t prevented him from saying things that aren’t favored in these countries. There’re other Americans besides Trump who favor improved US-Russian relations in opposition to the neocon/neolib preference. Pat Buchanan serves as an example of an anti-Communist patriotic American, who second guesses the negative image of Putin and Russia. There’s also the community of anti-Communist White Russians in the US and elsewhere, which have a good number opposed to the current hostility towards Russia. From a more left leaning perspective, Stephen Cohen and some lessor known individuals aren’t anti-American in believing that the US (from its interests) shouldn’t be so antagonistic towards Russia. American foreign policy realists include disagreement with the need for having unfriendly US-Russian relations. An example of the ongoing bias is the obligatory “Putin is a thug” disclaimer frequently bandied about. As has been confidentially acknowledged to me, some well meaning folks do this as a means to soften criticism against their commentary, which otherwise goes against the neocon/neolib slant. Talk about “self censorship”. From a distance, Putin (IMO) doesn’t come across as being more mean spirited than Clinton, John McCain and some others who disparage him. With the pro-Trump/anti-Russian leaning people in mind, was Trump elected for being a nice guy? The personal insults against Putin are hypocritically petty. Upon a reasonable objective and comprehensive overview, the litany of negative claims against him are quite suspect. Yet, they keep getting uncritically rehashed in a way that exhibits a lack of diversity in US mass media and body politic. Short of providing greater attention to the likes of Lindsey Graham and McCain, the provocative name calling and other forms of posturing against Putin/Russia haven’t worked. It’s not in America’s best interests to use Russia as a political football to get at Trump and cater to anti-Russian advocacy. Trump should be accorded the opportunity to pursue better US-Russian relations. My last Strategic Culture Foundation article of January 1, counters the presentation of Obama and his predecessors (Bill Clinton and GW Bush) seeking to pursue that endeavor.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 11, 2017 at 7:13PM At the J.P. Morgan 15th Annual Tech Forum, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) client computing group (CCG) chief Navin Shenoy offered up some insights about his business unit, the company's largest by revenue.  Image source: Intel.  Near the end of his presentation, Shenoy talked about Intel's chip manufacturing strategy, exuding confidence that the company's manufacturing technology is the "best in the world." As part of this discussion, he took the time to explain how the technology that Intel calls 14 nanometers is more like what its competitors -- Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) -- call 10 nanometers (smaller is generally believed to be better). He then offered the following commentary with respect to its upcoming 10-nanometer technology (emphasis mine): "I'm confident that when 10 nanometer -- our 10 nanometer -- comes out, and this is something that maybe we should rename it, I don't know, we'll think about that, but when our 10 nanometer comes out, we will have a clear density advantage, and a clear performance and power advantage versus what others in the industry have." I agree, and even suggested that Intel do just that back in October. Since this is something that Intel seems to be considering now, it would be wise to just do it. Here's why.  Lots of benefit, little risk/effort In the past, when Intel had a full-generation lead in manufacturing technology over its peers, it was easy for the company to stick to its own naming schemes, even if it served to undersell the characteristics of the underlying technology.  For example, Intel's 14-nanometer technology was generally ahead of what its competitors were calling 14/16-nanometer technologies. The chipmaker may have been able to score some additional marketing points by rebranding its technology as 10-nanometer to make this superiority clear, but -- at the time -- that naming methodology didn't create the perception that Intel is a generation behind.  If Intel could get to market with future technologies (10 nanometer, 7 nanometer, etc.) at the same time as its competitors got to their respective technologies going forward, then Intel could leave its naming scheme unchanged -- again, short-changing itself, but not giving competitors opportunities to say that they are ahead. But that's not going to be the case going forward. Intel's 14-nanometer technology will be the company's only production-worthy technology over the next year. Its competitors, on the other hand, will ramp up their respective 10-nanometer technologies in 2017, and Taiwan Semiconductor plans to ramp up its 7-nanometer technology beginning in early 2018, right around when we will see Intel bring its 10-nanometer technology to market.  Intel will then go from squandering a potential marketing point, but at least appearing competitive, to flat-out looking as though it is a generation behind. Intel's competitors will surely use this against the chipmaker as they craft their own marketing messages, which are likely to be carried far and wide by the tech press.  The easiest argument for renaming Intel's marketing/PR team will have two basic options for how to educate people about how the company isn't actually a full generation behind what its chip manufacturing peers (and their customers -- Intel's direct competitors) are fielding.  Intel can rename its technologies to accurately reflect their competitiveness.  Intel can spend undue time and energy arguing that its technologies are competitive despite being branded in such a way as to suggest that they are behind the curve.   One of these options is a very easy solution to the problem that has virtually no downside. The other is much more complicated, has the potential to come off as damage control, and might not even work (Intel's attempts to explain why its 14-nanometer technology is superior to competing 14/16-nanometer technologies have often fallen on deaf ears in the tech community).  If Intel loses a single chip sale because it refused to do something as simple as renaming its manufacturing technologies, then that would be a wholly unnecessary destruction of shareholder value.  Do the right thing, Intel: Rename your future manufacturing technologies, beginning with your next-generation 10-nanometer technology.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Announcement  ⋮  Hardware AMD Zen Architecture For Ryzen and Naples Processors Will Last Four Years on 14nm – Future Zen+ Revisions To Improve Architecture By Hassan Mujtaba Posted Jan 9, 2017 124Shares Share Tweet Submit AMD has confirmed that their Zen CPU architecture for Ryzen processors is expected to last four years. It took AMD four years to develop Zen and it will take another four for Zen to complete its shelve time. AMD Zen Based Ryzen Processors Expected To Last Four Years In an interview with PCWorld, Mark Papermaster confirmed that Zen will feature a four year lifespan. He mentioned that AMD will not follow Intel’s Tick-Tock model and instead go for Tock, Tock, Tock. This means that AMD will be planning to offer future revisions of Zen with an improved architecture to increase performance and efficiency. AMD will be featuring future revisions on Zen on their consumer, server and workstation processors. When asked how long Zen would last, compared to Intel’s two-year tick-tock cadence, Papermaster confirmed the four-year lifespan and tapped the table in front of him: “We’re not going tick-tock,” he said. “Zen is going to be tock, tock, tock.” via PCWorld A tock cycle represents a new architecture while a tick cycle represents a process shrink along with architecture improvements. Intel has dropped this in favor of the PAO Cadence (Process-Architecture-Optimization). AMD is going to follow with the Tock, Tock, Tock cycle which means the next two generations of Zen will come with an improved architecture rather than a process shrink. This also confirms that AMD will be sticking with 14nm for a while. AMD will stick with the 14nm node and jump ship to the 7nm process after 2020. AMD Zen To Be Replaced With Zen+ and Zen++ Cores In The Future? So what comes after Zen? In previously shown slides, AMD calls the core after Zen as Zen+. Zen+ is going to lift the IPC and efficiency further but there’s also a third tock which we are going to call Zen++ (not an official name). If we look at the past, Bulldozer had a revision known as Piledriver. There was also Steamroller and the Excavator microarchitecture after that. The construction of all the cores had one thing in common, they were derivatives based on the original Bulldozer design. But the latter two were a Tick-Tock cycle since Steamroller was based on 28nm rather than 32nm (Bulldozer / Piledriver). Intel on the other hand has totally dropped the Tick-Tock cycle and gone with a new plan. They have launched Broadwell (process shrink or Tick), Skylake (architecture upgrade or Tock) and Kaby Lake (optimized microarchitecture or a half Tock). But they will have a second optimized node based on 14nm launching in 2017 known as Coffee Lake. So Intel is stuck with 14nm on the desktop front for some time too. This puts Zen in a pretty good launch position against Intel’s offerings. The 10nm processors from Intel won’t be ready for desktops and there are rumors that Intel may entirely skip 10nm for desktops in favor of the 7nm process on Ice Lake or Tiger Lake chips. What those improvements will be, of course, is anyone’s guess. But Papermaster said he’s a believer in architecture improvements that go beyond simple manufacturing, something he’s previously referred to as “Moore’s Law Plus.” via PCWorld Next Generation AMD CPUs And APUs WCCFTech AMD Raven Ridge AMD Gray Hawk AMD Summit Ridge AMD Bristol Ridge Product Architecture Zen Zen+ Zen Excavator Process Node 14nm 7nm 14nm 28nm CPU Cores Up to 4 Up to 4 Up to 8 Up to 4 GPU Architecture Vega Navi N/A Caribbean Islands TDP TBA TBA 65W-95W 35-65W Socket AM4 AM4+ AM4 AM4 Memory Support DDR4 & HBM DDR4 & HBM DDR4 DDR4 Launch 2H 2017 2019 Q1 2017 October 2016 Analysis: Emerging Trends in the PC and Hardware Industry for 2017 - What Do Intel, NVIDIA and AMD Have in Store? AMD Zen To Last Several Generations of Consumer, Workstation and Server Processors AMD’s CEO and President, Lisa Su, also confirmed that Zen will last three to five years with itself and its ZEN+ successors. Advertisement I think Zen is the first of a multi-year strategy so you know again you ask me what are my thoughts around the company I think AMD at our core we are a high performance computing company and so you know Zen is a from scratch architectural design, for those of us who do those you know it takes a lot of work. It’s a multi-year effort but I think it’s a multi-year effort that we can see coming to fruition. And so what datacenter customers want from us is one we want you to be competitive and two we want a long term roadmap. And so we’ve really talked about Zen+, Zen follow ons, as you know a three to five year view of what’s needed to be successful in the datacenter. via Wccftech AMD doesn’t see any major threats from Intel that may affect Zen’s launch. It was met with great response at the showcases from the PC gaming and enthusiast community. Ryzen is shaping up to be the processor series that AMD and PC gaming fans have long been waiting for. The future Zen+ cores will ensure that performance of Zen based chips keeps going up and will deliver the best efficiency possible.

AMD ZEN CPU Architecture and X370 AM4 Platform Details Highlighted AMD Ryzen processors will feature up to 8 cores and 16 threads with the Zen architecture. The processors will deliver up to 40% IPC gains and great performance increases over Bulldozer CPUs. All Ryzen processors come with new boost technology that are part of the SenseMI feature set. The Ryzen processors also feature a fully unlocked multiplier across several variants which would support overclocking on the new AM4 motherboards. If you would like more details about the Zen architecture, here’s the link. AMD SenseMI Technology: Pure Power – more than 100 embedded sensors with accuracy to the millivolt, milliwatt, and single degree level of temperature enable optimal voltage, clock frequency, and operating mode with minimal energy consumption; Precision Boost – smart logic that monitors integrated sensors and optimizes clock speeds, in increments as small as 25MHz, at up to a thousand times a second; Extended Frequency Range (XFR) – when the system senses added cooling capability, XFR raises the Precision Boost frequency to enhance performance; Neural Net Prediction – an artificial intelligence neural network that learns to predict what future pathway an application will take based on past runs; Smart Prefetch – sophisticated learning algorithms that track software behavior to anticipate the needs of an application and prepare the data in advance. As for the platform itself, AM4 X370 will be top of the line. Aside from the budget friendly B350 and A320 chips, the X370 PCH will offer increase PCIe lanes and increased storage / connectivity features. AMD has planned a total of 16 new AM4 motherboards which will be available at launch through their partners. The boards are detailed in our post here. The platform itself looks fantastic but the processors are the key component for AMD. We know some numbers in regards to performance and efficiency, but we can’t wait for these chips to actually hit the market. The expected arrival date of Zen based processors and the AM4 platform is Q1 2017 (February-March).

There has been so much unveiled that it would take weeks to disassemble and dissect all of it - but this is why we have our 'Best of CES 2017' awards, and this article. Below we list the products and tech that were lucky enough to get our award.     Let's kick things off with the CPU and GPU side of things:   CPU: AMD has impressed not just us, but gamers and consumers throughout the world with their next generation Ryzen CPUs. We're looking at 16-threaded CPUs that should hopefully come in at half the price of Intel's competing processors, offering new technologies like SenseMI - a self-overclocking, self-adjusting processor that learns how you use your system and predicts your next movement. Expect much more from us here at TweakTown on Ryzen in the coming weeks and months.   GPU: You have to hand it to Radeon Technologies Group, the upcoming Vega GPU architecture is beyond exciting. High Bandwidth Cache. HBM2 technology. The Vega GPU architecture itself. We're looking at 4K 60FPS performance in games like DOOM with all the graphical bells and whistles turned on. AMD is returning to the high-end in a very, very big way.   Motherboards: AMD wins our 'best CPU technology of CES 2017' but Intel went on the offensive with Kaby Lake and their motherboard partners with a near unlimited range of Z270 motherboards. GIGABYTE's new Z270X-Gaming 9 motherboard will be my new desktop gaming PC motherboard of choice, but ASUS impressed yet again with its high-end ROG Maximus IX Formula Z270. And so did ASRock with its new Z270 Taichi, and MSI with its beautiful Z270 XPOWER Gaming Titanium - all worthy choices for your new Kaby Lake CPU.   Laptop: Dell and Razer had some great laptops shown off at CES 2017, and this is why I've chosen two. Dell first as their next-gen XPS 13 and XPS 15 laptops are already here, with some of the higher-end SKUs shipping soon. Dell updated the new XPS 13 and XPS 15 with Intel's new Kaby Lake processors, continued the use of their beautiful edge-to-edge 1080p/4K display (the 4K option is an additional $300). The higher-end XPS 15 can even be configured with NVIDIA's new GeForce GTX 1050.   The second laptop worth mentioning is the ambitious Project Valerie from Razer, which has not 1 - but 3 damn 17-inch displays. I don't know how Razer continue to do it, but they do.   SOC/Mobile Tech: Qualcomm, by a long shot. The company unveiled their next-gen Snapdragon 835 processor, which is poised to take over the mobile market in smartphones and tablets later this year. Not only that, but we're getting our first teases of 5G technology - which is going to blow the world away. Qualcomm said during its CES 2017 press conference that current 3G and 4G technologies were designed before they knew what people would do with their smartphones - you know, before Netflix, YouTube, Facebook, and so on - 5G, is ready for it all. It's ready for 4K 60FPS streamed to your phone, and at up to 1Gbps. Yikes.   Not only that, but the new Snapdragon 835 processor is built on the 10nm process - meaning Qualcomm is the first to hit the 10nm node, which is an impressive feat. Qualcomm is the company I'm most excited for out of everyone from CES, as they'll have more of an impact on the entire planet and billions of consumers with their new processors, 5G technology, and more.   TV: LG is the leader in TV technology, it's that simple - and the South Korean giant continued that dominance with the unveiling of their latest W-series 4K OLED HDR-capable TV. An impressive feat, with a near impossibly thin bezel, and beautiful image quality - it's the new TV to beat in 2017.   Living Room: NVIDIA's new Shield TV. I use NVIDIA's current-gen Shield all the time, it's an amazing device - but NVIDIA doesn't stop, so it made the new Shield even better. It's HDR-capable, 4K-capable (like the current-gen Shield), has the Shield Remote in the box (versus being an accessory), and has Google Assistant built-in. You can search for shows on Netflix by talking to it, and Google Assistant responds with much more realistic, human responses.   Keyboard: Corsair has been killing the peripherals game for years now, and heck - I'm typing up this post on their Vengeance K95 RGB keyboard. It's a pleasure to use, but the new K95 RGB Platinum keyboard? Oh gosh. That reminds me, I've got to email Corsair and ask for some new keyboards...   Monitors: Holy crap was CES 2017 a massive year for displays... NVIDIA went the whole hog and unveiled two totally next generation gaming displays: 4K resolution, 144Hz refresh rate, G-Sync refresh technology... and HDR. They sound great on paper, but in person the ASUS ROG Swift PG27UQ and the Acer Predator XB272-HDR are absolutely stunning. It will redefine what you think is a high-end monitor, and some. You simply need to see it in person to believe the leap it represents.   General Tech: NVIDIA's advancements (AI Car) in self-driving car technology are always fun to see at CES, but it scares me to think where we'll be at CES 2018, 2019, 2020 and beyond - scares me, in a good way.   Qualcomm also gets awarded for its impressive 10nm processor technology.   VR: HTC Vive, as always - it hasn't changed. Oculus were nowhere to be seen at CES. They're probably scared, but HTC has been killing the VR scene with the Vive - if you haven't got one, you need to try it. The future of VR is going to be huge.   Storage: Kingston wants us all to have 2TB on a USB stick with their impressive new DataTraveler USB 3.0 flash drive. 2TB in your pocket allows for hours upon hours of 4K footage, emergency (and fast) storage, and so much more.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 11, 2017 at 7:13PM At the J.P. Morgan 15th Annual Tech Forum, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) client computing group (CCG) chief Navin Shenoy offered up some insights about his business unit, the company's largest by revenue.  Image source: Intel.  Near the end of his presentation, Shenoy talked about Intel's chip manufacturing strategy, exuding confidence that the company's manufacturing technology is the "best in the world." As part of this discussion, he took the time to explain how the technology that Intel calls 14 nanometers is more like what its competitors -- Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) -- call 10 nanometers (smaller is generally believed to be better). He then offered the following commentary with respect to its upcoming 10-nanometer technology (emphasis mine): "I'm confident that when 10 nanometer -- our 10 nanometer -- comes out, and this is something that maybe we should rename it, I don't know, we'll think about that, but when our 10 nanometer comes out, we will have a clear density advantage, and a clear performance and power advantage versus what others in the industry have." I agree, and even suggested that Intel do just that back in October. Since this is something that Intel seems to be considering now, it would be wise to just do it. Here's why.  Lots of benefit, little risk/effort In the past, when Intel had a full-generation lead in manufacturing technology over its peers, it was easy for the company to stick to its own naming schemes, even if it served to undersell the characteristics of the underlying technology.  For example, Intel's 14-nanometer technology was generally ahead of what its competitors were calling 14/16-nanometer technologies. The chipmaker may have been able to score some additional marketing points by rebranding its technology as 10-nanometer to make this superiority clear, but -- at the time -- that naming methodology didn't create the perception that Intel is a generation behind.  If Intel could get to market with future technologies (10 nanometer, 7 nanometer, etc.) at the same time as its competitors got to their respective technologies going forward, then Intel could leave its naming scheme unchanged -- again, short-changing itself, but not giving competitors opportunities to say that they are ahead.

The other is much more complicated, has the potential to come off as damage control, and might not even work (Intel's attempts to explain why its 14-nanometer technology is superior to competing 14/16-nanometer technologies have often fallen on deaf ears in the tech community).  If Intel loses a single chip sale because it refused to do something as simple as renaming its manufacturing technologies, then that would be a wholly unnecessary destruction of shareholder value.  Do the right thing, Intel: Rename your future manufacturing technologies, beginning with your next-generation 10-nanometer technology.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The anticipation for the new processor series for AMD is growing every day thanks to the marketing machine over at AMD continually showing it performing better than an Intel Core i7-6900K processor that costs over $1000. The thought of AMD releasing a processor that can compete with Skylake-E at any level a year ago, would have caused laughter in the room. Now, it looks like AMD has something that appears to come close to those levels of performance in applications like Blender and Handbrake. Check out the Handbrake results below. While we were at CES 2017 last week in Las Vegas we heard all sorts of people talking on and off the record about Ryzen. This is our attempt to summarize all that information in a single one-page article. AMD Debuts New X370 and B350 boards New consumer desktop boards featuring  AMD X370 and B350 chipsets with the AMD AM4 CPU Socket that supports Ryzen were finally shown off for the very first time at CES 2017. All of the motherboard manufactures were ecstatic that these boards were finally getting to market. Many of the companies designed this boards months ago, and have just been sitting on it waiting for AMD to finalize Ryzen and get them the hooks and data needed to finalize the UEFI. Despite so much being moved to the CPU we’ve been told that the boards will cost more than we expect by multiple sources at CES as the motherboard makers will try to recuperate the money they have spent on R&D. No one was talking numbers, but multiple sources made it sound like we are spoiled by low cost AMD motherboards right now. For example the ASRock 970A-G/3.1 motherboard came out in February 2016 with support for AMD’s flagship FX-9590 Vishera 8-core 4.7 GHz processor for just $68.99 with free shipping.  This is one of the newest AMD AM3+ boards (released February 2016) with support for AMD FX 9590 & 9370 220W CPUs, DDR3 2400MHz memory, M.2 PCIe Gen2 x 4 (20 Gb/s) and even has USB 3.1 Type-A + Type-C 10 Gb/s ports. Don’t expect to see AMD X370 boards this low at launch. AMD informed us that the AMD X370 will be priced comparable to Intel Z270 boards and the AMD B350 will be priced against Intel B250 boards. Motherboard makers like Gigabyte have 31 different Intel 200 based boards with prices ranging from $69.99 for a B250 board all the way up to $519.99 for a Z270 board. One thing to keep in mind is that Ryzen has 24 PCIe lanes with 16 dedicated to graphics, four for the M.2 PCIe NVMe slot and the final four connect to the chipset. The AMD X370 chipset itself has eight PCIe lanes, so running a multi-GPU configuration (NVIDIA SLI or AMD CrossFire) might be a bit tricky. Motherboard makers  could feature two x8 slots for graphics from the CPU and one x8 slot from the chipset. Depending on the features that motherboard markers want, enabling multi-GPU support in the UEFI may disable some board features. AMD Ryzen might have performance comparable to Broadwell-E, but the number of PCIe lanes might become an issue for some power users. Somewhat Boring DDR4 Performance We’ve run DDR4 memory kits on the new Intel Z270 platform with Kaby Lake processors like the Intel Core i7-7770K processor at speeds of up to 4.0 GHz and we saw companies hitting 4.5 GHz clock speeds on DDR4 memory kits with extreme overclocking techniques. Multiple sources wishing to remain anonymous spoke with us at CES 2017 and said that DDR4 support on Ryzen boards is no where near as good and that now and that DDR4-2400 is a good all around kit for these processors. Overclockers might be able to squeeze out DDR4 3000 MHz on these boards, but that has been tricky on the early pre-production processors.  AMD hasn’t finalized Ryzen processors yet and the UEFI still has many updates coming, but we’ve been told not to hold out breath when it comes to high-speed DDR4 memory kits on these boards. Sources inside AMD are saying that they will launch Ryzen with support above the DDR4 JEDEC standard speeds, but noted that Ryzen has a new memory controller with brand new IP over Bristol Ridge and that they are working on making improvements with regards to DDR4 performance here in the home stretch. USB 3.1 Gen 1 and USB 3.1 Gen 2 Performance is Solid It will be interesting to see how AMD’s inclusion of USB 3.1 into the processor goes as implementing new SATA and USB technologies can be tricky as Intel had a small USB 3.0 bug on Haswell processors back in 2013 and then way back in 2011 there was SATA controller issue on the 6 series chipset that led to a recall of that platform for Sandy Bridge processors. AMD has told us that USB 3.1 performance is spot on and a non-issue on Ryzen. That is a good thing as they have four USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports on the Ryzen CPU itself and then another six USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports, six USB 3.0 ports and two USB 3.1 Gen2 (10Gb/s) ports on the AMD X370 chipset. That means the AMD X370 boards with a Ryzen processor can have up to 20 total USB ports. Our industry sources said that AMD did not include ReDrivers into thier IP, so an actual ReDriver chip will need to be used by motherboard makers for USB type-C support. Ryzen Processors Are Multiplier Unlocked AMD Ryzen processors are all multiplier unlocked as long as the motherboard supports unlocked processors. From what we are hearing AMD X370 &  B350 motherboards will both support CPU Multiplier adjustment and are the enthusaist-class boards you need if you want to overclock. AMD A320 and A300 chipsets do not support overclocking. Ryzen Clock Speeds AMD still hasn’t set clock speeds for Ryzen processors, but most recently have been showing them clocked at 3.4 GHz with no Turbo Boost. Everyone we talked to at CES 2017 gave us different stories on Ryzen clock speeds and we left the show without a good feeling on how they are doing. One informant told us that they are only getting 200-300 MHz over the 3.4 GHz clock speeds on their early pre-production sample processors while others told us they were getting over 5 GHz. So, there isn’t a good consensus on what the clock speeds will other than the fact that we are certain that AMD is trying everything they can to get the highest clock speeds possible. With Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake processors shipping with Turbo Clock speeds of up to 4.5 GHz and overclocking beyond 5 GHz on air it feels like AMD is slightly concerned with the gap in clock speeds. Years ago clock frequency meant everything, but an 8-core 16-thread Ryzen processor doesn’t have to be clocked that high to compete with 4-core 8-thread Kaby Lake processors on multi-threaded applications. Hopefully that message will get out there and our fingers are crossed that single-thread performance isn’t horrible on Ryzen. One not good sign about Ryzen clock speeds is that CyberPowerPC had a Ryzen system on display and the placard showed that the AMD Ryzen processor inside was running at 3.15 GHz, reportedly an early ES part. CyberPowerPC quickly pulled the sign, said it was wrong, and denied to know Ryzen clock speeds. We know that AMD will have multiple Ryzen sku’s, so some might be clocked that low? AMD has since clarified that all 8-Core 16-Thread processors will have at least a base clock of 3.4GHz and that they want to give consumers the best performance per dollar in their return home to the enthusiast space. Ryzen Release Date It appears that AMD might have accidentally posted up the official Ryzen CPU launch date. AMD will be holding a session at annual Game Developer Conference (GDC) in San Francisco on ‘Optimizing for AMD Ryzen CPU’ on a TBD date during the show for the ‘recently-launched’ AMD Ryzen CPU. GDC kicks off on February 27th and runs until March 3rd, so could AMD be launching Ryzen at the start of GDC? AMD has been saying for weeks that Ryzen will be launching in Q1 2017 and this would certainly hit that intended launch date. Our sources are quiet on this one, but it will be interesting to see what happens. We don’t see AMD releasing their most exciting processor in years at an industry event, but we could be very wrong.   Ryzen Pricing AMD told us that Ryzen will be priced below the Intel Core i7-6900K ($1000) and that it won’t be $999. Online rumors have put Ryzen at $350 and several people we spoke with at CES 2017 said that the flagship Ryzen processor will cost less than the Intel Core i7-7700K processor ($349.89 on Amazon) or be right around there depending on how final performance looks. That is exciting news if it does turn out to be true, but is that a good sign of Ryzen performance? The demos that AMD have shown are all on 16-threaded applications with the processor pegged at 100% load or close to it. Hopefully the IPC performance on 4-threads or less is solid. Our guess is that AMD Ryzen will be priced comparable to what Intel has to offer. The AMD X370 motherboards are said to be price comparable to Intel Z270 boards, so were thinking that the Ryzen processors will line up with those associated processors. AMD’s flagship FX-9590 8-core processor costs $199.99 right now, so an upcoming Ryzen 8-core processor at $350 or less doesn’t sound out of the question. At the end of the day we can’t wait to learn more about AMD Ryzen and are extremely excited by the upcoming launch. Seeing AMD show off Ryzen and VEGA in the same system at CES 2017 was a good sign, but both the CPU and GPU were run on development boards. Hopefully, AMD will be showing off final consumer boards the next time we see both! Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

Intel's Pentium-class processors, designed for budget PCs, will get hyper-threading technology that lets them run multiple tasks on a single processor core. Intel's new hyper-threading Pentium CPUs are based on the Kaby Lake architecture, which also powers the latest Core i3, i5, and i7 processors. Intel announced those devices at CES last week, and appears to have quietly added the new Pentiums to its product listings, ExtremeTech reports. The hyper-threading feature was last available in Pentium-class chips with the Pentium 4, which was introduced in 2004. At the time, they were the only processors to feature it; even the first-generation Core processors, introduced in 2006, didn't have it. But as the Pentium brand transitioned to lower-end desktops and laptops and the Core series gained hyper-threading technology, newer Pentiums dropped the feature. Now, all Kaby Lake-based processors will support the technology. Related Intel Unveils Kaby Lake Processor Details Intel Unveils Kaby Lake Processor Details There are five new Pentium processors listed on Intel's product page, from the 2.9 GHz G4560T to the 3.7 GHz G4620. The G4620 is 100MHz faster than its predecessor and offers support for Intel's TSX-NI instructions, Memory Protection Extensions, and Intel's OS Guard platform protection technology, ExtremeTech notes. That signals that Intel intends to offer them to enterprise customers, which hasn't been the target market for Pentium-powered PCs. The addition of the new Pentium chips is the latest step in a gradual Kaby Lake refresh that began in August for notebooks and portables, followed by last week's announcement that extended the lineup to desktops and workstations. Meanwhile, Intel competitor AMD announced its own refreshed processor lineup last month. Called "Ryzen," it will be rolled out gradually over a four-year period.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Lenovo Y910 27 AiO Gaming PC Review: Hands-On By Hubert Nguyen on 01/11/2017 12:54 PST All-in-One PC has evolved from “Familly computers” limited by their relatively thin form-factor, they have now become one of the best-selling categories this year. The Lenovo IdeaCentre Y910 AiO breathes Gaming Performance (including VR-Capability) into the All-in-One category, opening a Pandora box that will never be close from now on. The Lenovo IdeaCentre Y910 AiO should have been called Lenovo Legion Y920 AiO. The thing is: Lenovo went public with this computer before the “Lenovo Legion” gaming brand was made official at CES 2017. Therefore, the closest line of product that it would fit in is the IdeaCentre, which is typically family/productivity oriented. This is not your regular IdeaCentre computer (not that there anything wrong with productivity computers, lol). Display “The display is the computer” – this line which NVIDIA came up with fits the all-in-one category. The Y920 AiO display uses LCD TN technology, which offers some (but not all) benefits of LCD IPS, and historically had the better ratio between price, (image) quality and fast response time. Although IPS LCD have come down in price, this is still true overall. As such, this makes this display an excellent candidate for a gaming computer. Quick display specs: 27” (2560×1440) 144Hz LCD TN with AMD FreeSync support. Monitor-only mode (HDMI-in) 96% RGB gamut, 75% Adobe RGB gamut 340 Nit brightness, 5ms response time 144 FPS games possible at 1080p One thing that some of you may notice is that the display is compatible with AMD FreeSync stutter-free technology, while it may ship with an NVIDIA GPU, which has NVIDIA G-Sync, a similar, but otherwise incompatible technology. Important: The Y920 AiO computers configured with NVIDIA GPUs will not have a stutter-free technology because the screen is only AMD FreeSync compatible. I don’t see a Y910 AiO model with AMD GPU on the Lenovo website at publishing time, but sources tell me that Lenovo should come up with an AMD option at some point. You can visit the official site, or contact Lenovo directly to enquire about “when/where”. In theory, it would be possible to support both G-Sync and FreeSync, because the technologies are very similar. However, my understanding is that this is a licensing (and licensing fee) issue, with NVIDIA being the most expensive option. One possible solution would be to choose the standard at order time, but there won’t be such an option. That aside, the display looks good with a resolution of 2560×1440 and a maximum refresh rate of 144Hz. When we played with it, the image quality was quite good. It’s fair to say that you can find better image quality in PC monitors, but many of those monitors would not be “gaming friendly”, so it’s an important distinction to make. The resolution of 2560×1440 also is a fine choice. On the one hand, the GPU should be fast enough to play many current games at 60FPS at the native resolution. On the other hand, the text and interface are sharp and clear because it is still a high PPI monitor. If you decide to play at 1080p (with scaling), some game can even hit the maximum 144Hz rate. From the front, the monitor bezels seem  thin, and to keep that design element, Lenovo has embedded the Intel Realsense webcam into a retractable chassis. It’s a good idea because the computer is not designed to be super-slim. Intel RealSense webcams are 3D capable, in a similar way that the Xbox Kinect camera is. For everyday usage, Windows 10 Hello can let you log-in using a 3D scan of your face. In the future, I hope that Lenovo would even come up with 30”, 32” or even 34” versions of this computer. Industrial Design The Lenovo Y920 AiO is really unique. It has the aggressive design language of the Legion Y-Series line of laptop and desktop computer, but at the same time, it doesn’t look like anything else. The external surfaces are mostly plastic, but the computer doesn’t feel cheap or fragile. At the same time, I’m glad it doesn’t weigh a ton like some all-steel gaming PC chassis do. On the left of the screen, there’s a retractable headphones holder. This is a very nice touch because I’m currently using a terrible Ikea hack to do this (lol). Just below the screen you will find the Speaker, which is place optimally for single-user situations. In my dreams, there would be an analog volume knob somewhere, but for now you can control the volume with the dedicated keys on the Lenovo Keyboard. Designed for User Upgradability The user upgradability is another unique aspect of the Lenovo Y920 AiO. AiO computers are normally not designed to have users change parts. However, this is a frequent requirement from gaming rigs customers. To reconcile the two, Lenovo has managed to create a design that lets people upgrade the SSD (small PCIe card), HDD (2.5”), Graphics card (GPU) and RAM modules – all without tools. This is great because a computer’s lifecycle can last for some years during which upgrading any of those components can make a huge difference in user experience. People can do that for much lower prices down the road as well. Of course, there are sometimes ways to open an AiO to change parts even if it wasn’t designed for this purpose. However, this may void the warranty, and you may get in troubles if the design uses glue, just to cite the obvious. System configuration CPU: Intel Core i5 and i7 6th Gen As you may expect from a Gaming system, Lenovo allows configurations are going from an Intel Core i5 (i5-6500) to an Intel Core i7 (i7-6700) CPU. Note that the current offerings aren’t using the 7th generation Intel CPUs, but rather a 6th Generation. In reality, it only makes a small difference because the performance jump wasn’t that high, and in the end, the speed/price ratio might even be better that way. That said, I wanted to point this out, just in case. Memory configurations go from 12GB up to 32GB max, which is quite comfortable as a maximum. The system storage is an SSD of 128GB or 256GB while the larger storage is a 1TB to 2TB HDD. Again, both are user-upgradable. GPU: Up to NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 8GB (Desktop Card) While most AiO computers have “mobile” (=slower) GPUs attached to the motherboard, this computer uses a full-on desktop GPU that is completely normal/standard and that you can change. Some cables will simply route the native graphics card connectors to the ones found in the AiO chassis. The GTX 1080 makes this computer “VR Ready”. As we said before, we expect Lenovo to have an AMD model at some point, although “when” isn’t clear and no official information is available at publishing time. You will have to mind the GPU card form-factor because there’s a large variety of them out there with various width and height, but the possibilities offered by this AiO chassis are infinitely higher than other AiOs! We have yet to run some benchmarks on this computer, but we will update this article with them at a later time. For now, the CPU+GPU configuration should give you a rough idea of what to expect, if you compare that with computers running with the same components. The system has a 380W Power supply, and you should also be mindful of this when upgrading the GPU. In general, both AMD and NVIDIA make it easy to have powerful updates within the same thermal and power envelope so that I wouldn’t worry about it. Ports/connectors/inputs: well endowed The Lenovo Y910 has a wealth of ports that easily compare to a desktop computer: 7 USB 3.0 ports and a Killer Ethernet network interface for low-latency gaming. Front Ports Pop-up Hideaway Camera Dual Microphone Rear Ports 4 x USB 2.0 Power AC in RJ45 Ethernet 1x HDMI™-in / 1x HDMI™-out Side Ports 3 x USB 3.0 6-in-1 Card Reader (SD, SDHC, SDXC, MMC, MS, MS-Pro) Head and Microphone Array HDMI™-in Switch Button Optical drive Conclusion: excellent, VR Ready If you are looking for a gaming computer that can keep your desk looking neat at the same time, the Lenovo IdeaCentre Y910 AiO is a very attractive “true” gaming computer that offers a lot of power and upgradability in a chassis that will save space and look neat. While it may not (yet) represent the absolute most powerful gaming rig you can buy, it’s fair to say that the trade-off is completely fair, if not advantageous in terms of speed/chassis volume. Performance comes with heat (and top dollars), and heat needs to be dissipated. That’s why absolute fastest gaming rigs will remain in large water-cooled chassis with multi-GPUs for some time. It’s just physics. In the end, the IdeaCentre Y910 AiO is an AiO without performance compromises and a great computer overall. It creates a brand new market segment that I’m sure others will look at and copy. Starting at $1800, the Core i5/GeForce 1070/12GB RAM/128GB SSD/1TB HDD is shipping now. At $2300 there’s a Core i7/GeForce 1080/16GB RAM/256GB SSD/2TB HDD available too. Filed in Gaming. Read more about all-in-one, CES, CES 2017, gaming pc and Lenovo.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 11, 2017 at 1:03PM Analyst Steve Mullane with BlueFin Research Partners (via Barron's) recently said that microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) chip production during December "indicated no signs of slowing down even through the holiday period." Image source: Intel.  This, the analyst says, "strongly suggests that [Intel] could guide March quarter revenues above the current Wall Street consensus of -7.8%." What Mullane is referring to is the fact that Intel's business largely follows a seasonal pattern in which sales during the first half of the year tend to be weaker than sales during the second half of the year. "Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter," Intel's most recent form 10-K filing reads. Perhaps more interestingly, on Intel's most recent earnings call, the company explicitly said that it expected revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 to be "below the average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter," as the company expected "the worldwide [personal computer] supply chain to reduce their inventory." If Intel's chip production remained steady through December, then -- assuming BlueFin's read on the situation is accurate -- that could bode well for the company's first quarter of 2017 guidance (or as BlueFin refers to it, the March quarter, because it ends in March). Let's examine what could be driving this reportedly unusually strong production. Low expectations + better demand = channel refill? Back on Sept. 16, a month before its earnings release, Intel positively pre-announced its financial results, telling investors that it expected third-quarter sales of $15.6 billion (give or take $300 million), compared to a prior outlook of $14.9 billion (give or take $500 million). When the final numbers came in, the chipmaker didn't disappoint, raking in $15.8 billion in revenue, and delivering strong gross profit margin results, too (64.8% on a non-GAAP basis, against prior guidance of 62% give-or-take a couple percentage points.  At the time, the company said that this was "primarily driven by a replenishment of [personal computer] supply chain inventory." It also said that, "the company is also seeing some signs of improving [personal computer] demand." Intel didn't pre-announce this time around, so unless Intel is sitting on a big financial surprise, I'm not expecting anything out of the ordinary from the company when it reports its fourth-quarter of 2016 results on Jan. 26. Intel may have shipped what it expected to ship during the fourth quarter, but due to strong personal computer sales, Intel's customers found that their inventory levels had been drawn down too much. So, to bring/keep their inventories at appropriate levels, Intel's customers may have gotten more aggressive about their chip orders near the end of the quarter, leading Intel to keep production levels up through December. Put simply, we might be seeing a repeat during the first quarter of 2017 of what led Intel to report better-than-expected revenues for the third quarter of 2016. Could it be the non-PC business? The preceding discussion has focused on personal computer sales, but it's important to keep in mind that Intel sells other processors, too. It sells chips into data center applications -- its second-largest business by revenue -- as well as in Internet of Things applications. However, the kinds of chip volumes that Intel sells into these applications are far smaller than the chip volumes that the company ships into personal computers. The much lower volumes in, say, data center applications can be partially offset by the fact that chip sizes there are generally much larger than they are in personal computers. However, Intel's chip production is primarily dependent on its personal computer chip shipments. Combine that with the fact that Intel's recent business trends have pointed to better-than-expected personal computer chip shipments and worse-than-expected data center chip shipments, and I'm inclined to think that any potential upside that Intel may be experiencing is personal-computer-based. Intel's Internet of Things business, though interesting, just isn't large enough from a unit or revenue perspective -- it generates less than a tenth of what Intel's personal computer chip business does in sales -- for shifts in demand to have a measurable impact on the company's overall chip production levels.

Intel’s Compute Card is as small as a credit card, but, packs everything needed for computing, including the CPU, DRAM, storage, communications and I/O. The first cards are set to be introduced in mid-2017. Computing has become so ubiquitous nowadays that almost every more or less sophisticated piece of hardware has a microprocessor inside. Many such devices are designed to operate for years, but, since computer chips inside them get outdated, it is almost impossible to upgrade their functionality (e.g., add new security capabilities, speed up processing, etc.) without replacing the whole unit, or a significant part of it. Alternatively, if a CPU or a memory IC fails, repair of such a device may cost a lot in terms of money and effort. This translates to downtime and lost revenue. Such things happen because of various reasons, but the main two are proprietary platforms with tight integration and no upgrade path, or complex architectures that do not allow for a quick replacement of faulty components. The list of such devices includes everything from business PCs to point-of-sale kiosks and from smart TVs to commercial equipment. The Intel Compute Card has been designed to be a universal computing platform for different kinds of devices, including those that do not exist yet. The ultimate goal is to simplify the way companies develop equipment, use, maintain, repair, and upgrade it. Creators of actual devices have to design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their product and then choose an Intel Compute Card that meets their requirements in terms of feature-set and price. For example, PC makers could create systems in all-in-one or clamshell form-factors and then use Compute Cards instead of motherboards. For corporate customers that need to provide a lot of flexibility (and, perhaps, solve some security concerns too) - every employee has a card and can switch between PCs. In other markets such as automated retail kiosks, vendors can easily provide upgrades to deliver better functionality as Intel releases new Compute Cards in the future. Intel Compute Card at Glance CPU Various Intel SoCs / SiPs, including Intel Core with vPro (up to 6W TDP) DRAM, NAND Integrated Cooling Fanless, but, I/O docks may have their own thermal design Dimensions 94.5 mm × 55 mm × 5 mm I/O Physical USB-C + Extension Logical USB, PCIe, HDMI, DP and additional signals Wireless Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Docking Integrated locking mechanism Launch Partners Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sharp and local companies Initial Availability Mid-2017 From a technology standpoint, Intel’s Compute Card resembles the company’s Compute Stick PC. However, its purpose is much wider: it is a small device that packs an Intel SoC or SiP (including Kaby Lake-based Core processors with vPro and other technologies), DRAM, NAND flash storage, a wireless module and so on into a small enclosure. Nonetheless, there are a number of important differences between the Compute Card and the Compute Stick. The Compute Card is a sealed system with “flexible I/O” in the form of a USB Type-C and an extension connector. The “flexible I/O” is not Thunderbolt (obviously, due to power consumption concerns), but it handles USB, PCIe, HDMI, DisplayPort connectivity and has some extra pins for future/proprietary use. Intel is currently working with a number of partners to enable the Compute Cards ecosystem. The list of global players includes Dell, HP, Lenovo and Sharp. There are also regional partners interested in the new form-factor, including Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk and Pasuntech. At the moment, Intel and its partners are not discussing their Compute Card-based projects, which is understandable. Moreover, do not expect all these companies to release their Compute Card hardware simultaneously because different equipment has different design and validation cycles. Speaking of the form-factor itself, this is by far not the first form-factor the size of a credit card or something close (e.g., Mobile-ITX, Pico-ITX were announced, but never took off). However, this one seems easy to integrate and it is backed by Intel, which gives it credibility. There are a number of applications (and usage scenarios) that could take advantage of the Compute Card right away (e.g., corporate PCs, smart TVs, digital point-of-sales, emerging devices, etc.). However, there are also many embedded applications that just require uninterrupted operation without any need to upgrade. For those, traditional industrial PCs and boards will continue to be the mainstay, and the credit card form-factor will not bring any clear advantages. The other interesting aspect here is the future of the Compute Stick form factor. Given that the ARM-based HDMI sticks are not a popular form factor any more, it is not surprising that Intel has also not decided to update the Compute Stick lineup with Kaby Lake. Intel indicated that they would be evaluating the future of the Compute Stick in 2018, and decide if it warrants an update with the latest processors at that time. Our opinion is that the Compute Stick form factor has reached the end of its life, and it is for the Compute Card to carry on the miniaturization revolution. The Compute Card has much more flexibility in terms of the differentiation from the vendors' side, and it is not encumbered by an active cooling mechanism. Obviously, the ability to just plug the device into a HDMI port is not there, but, the Compute Card, by itself, is light enough to just hang directly off a display's HDMI port. Therefore, it is possible that some vendors can deliver a Compute Stick-like platform with the Compute Card also (albeit, with a slightly different form factor). We expect to hear more about Compute Card related projects in Q3, either during Computex or Intel's Developer Forum.

This is actually pretty cool. Just a moonshot, but if you threw this with a foldable display that might appear in a couple of years... Reply Yojimbo - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link Does this thing have a GPU on it? I guess you would want a video decoder and some rendering ability if you're linking it to a display. Reply ddriver - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link doh, it has video output, do you think it has gpu? disappointing it only has ubs connectivity, some lower level analog and digital i/o would have been nice, and allow to avoid the need for a high end mc for interfacing Reply Yojimbo - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link I looked and couldn't see any mention of a GPU. Of course it's hard to get much technical information from Intel's websites without reading their whitepapers. It could have display logic without any hardware acceleration. Reply ddriver - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link They may have a gpu-less version as well, but from the looks of it, it will have gpu. It has hdmi and dp, and the article mentions intended usage in smart tvs and such. You obviously need graphics for that. All intel chips aside from enterprise products and one poor little atom have graphics. Reply MrSpadge - Thursday, January 12, 2017 - link I don't know of any <6 W TDP Intel CPU which has no GPU integrated. MAybe some ultra small Curie-Chip, but you wouldn't want that to handle rich graphical output anyway. Reply Tylanner - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link Pair this with wicked AI, seamless wireless battery charging, wireless display output then put one in every pocket and you have the birth of the Exonet. Reply ddriver - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link Yeah, just add a battery and a display and you got yourself ... a smartphone! Oh wait, we've had that for a long time now. Reply Vlad_Da_Great - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link For automation/industrial equipment that is great product and will fly out of the shelves. For the consumer products, not at all. Companies want you to buy the whole thing. Imagine if Intel comes with a phone, on which you can change the CPU, Memory and the modem. Apple will lose 1/2 of their value in an instant. Reply ddriver - Wednesday, January 11, 2017 - link It doesn't look like you can change anything on the card. You could get a new card. But that's no different than getting a new phone...

Spare5 founders, from left to right: Patrick O’Donnell, Founder and Chief Architect; Matt Shobe, Founder and Chief Product Officer; Matt Bencke, Founder and CEO; Daryn Nakhuda, Founder and CTO. Photo via Mighty AI. On the surface, artificial intelligence is sexy. The technology, which has become one of the hottest trends, helps turn products and services human-like, accomplishing computational tasks that were either previously impossible or took far too long. But underneath the AI lays less flashy, yet equally crucial infrastructure that makes everything tick. It’s why computer vision and natural language model companies like Mighty AI are becoming more and more important — and also why investors like Intel, Accenture, and Google just put their money behind the Seattle startup. Matt Bencke. Mighty AI, previously known as Spare5, today announced a $14 million round led by Intel Capital, the investing arm of Intel, and also included participation from Accenture and GV, the investing arm of Google. Previous investors like Foundry Group, Madrona Venture Group, and New Enterprise Associates (NEA) also participated; total funding in Spare5 is now $27 million. Mighty AI originally launched in 2014 as Spare5, debuting an app that enables everyday people to perform short tasks on their smartphone — like photo tagging, price guessing, and sentiment analysis of text —  in exchange for payment. Then late last year, the startup narrowed its focus on what it calls “Training Data as a Service,” as CEO and co-founder Matt Bencke told GeekWire. The service provides the human insights AI engines need to “think” like people and helps companies across a variety of industries scale their computer vision and natural language models. Mighty AI, the first spin-out from Madrona Venture Labs, is essentially making artificial intelligence more intelligent by using human labor to re-tune those models. Bencke said his team is solving a “big data problem” at enterprise scale by turning “blank slates into simulations of human knowledge,” as the company describes. An example of Mighty AI helping identify objects in a photo and training computer vision models. Photo via Mighty AI. Now Spare5 is having a re-launch of sorts with a new name and a more focused product. Bencke was careful not to call the strategic change a “pivot,” but more doubling down on an opportunity. “Everybody knows AI is probably the biggest wave in technology innovation right now,” explained Bencke, formerly a senior vice president at Getty Images. “Yet there is a lot of anticipation and frustration about seeing it applied successfully across a number of specific use cases. I think our investors are looking at us as providing picks and shovels to the AI goldrush. No one knows exactly where the gold is, but everyone knows you need picks and shovels.” Bencke added that if AI engines don’t have good training data, then you “basically have a really expensive data science team.” He said the AI models need to understand how humans think; Mighty AI provides this via its community of “Fives,” the human users who get paid by the company to perform short tasks that improves training data. “Training data isn’t the sexiest part of AI,” Bencke said. “But it is vital.”  Personal digital assistants like Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri, for example, have the benefit of using conversations with users to improve their data sets. But other applications that aren’t consistently interacting with end users don’t have this benefit — that’s where Mighty AI comes in with help. “A computer is only as smart as the people who train it or teach it,” Bencke said. One customer is GumGum, a computer vision company that sells advertising and visual intelligence solutions for brands and publishers. GumGum uses Mighty AI to help advertisers understand the context of where their advertisement will be placed, either on websites or social media. “They need to train their computer vision models to recognize logos in all kinds of different context,” Bencke noted. Mighty AI, which has also developed its own AI technologies to help improve the quality of the “Fives” community, does have competition in the form of services like Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower, but Bencke said those require more management from employees. “We are agnostic about domains,” Bencke added. “We are just trying very hard to abstract human knowledge and make it available to our customers on demand.” As a result of the funding, Mighty AI will partner with Intel and Accenture, who will promote and sell the company’s training data services to customers worldwide. Ken Elefant, managing director at Intel Capital, told GeekWire that Intel sees AI as the “next major turning point in human history” with applications like automated driving, robotics, healthcare, and IoT. Elefant said Mighty AI has the best CEO and team compared to other competitors.  We are just trying very hard to abstract human knowledge and make it available to our customers on demand. “Unlike other traditional business outsourcing or crowdsourcing sources, Mighty AI can provide high quality, domain specific, on-demand data annotation, gathered via a community of thousands of experts,” he said. The 30-person company, named a Seattle 10 startup in 2015, will use the fresh funding to grow its team and build out its platform. Bencke called the new investor group a “dream team of strategic partners who are also investing.” Along with Bencke, the Mighty AI leadership team is impressive. CTO Daryn Nakhuda is a former CTO at TeachStreet and Director of Engineer at Porch; Patrick O’Donnell co-founded Urbanspoon; and Matt Shobe helped start of Feedburner. Robin Murdoch, a global managing director at Accenture, called Mighty AI “a leader in the critical area of training data.” “It’s an area that is particularly challenging for our clients, and their technology will help us develop and implement AI solutions that help our clients’ businesses compete more effectively,” he said. Mighty AI is one of many new AI/machine learning startups in Seattle, which is becoming somewhat of an epicenter for companies developing technologies related to machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, algorithms, data analytics, and more.

Matching the gross one-sidedness of her Washington Post (WaPo) employer, Kathleen Parker’s January 6 essay «If Obama Is a Muslim, Is Trump a Russian Spy?», overlooks some damning points running counter to her faulty slant. Donald Trump has taken back his comments that questioned whether Barack Obama is American born. For its part, The WaPo continues to denigrate Russia in a factually challenged manner. (The use of the crank Propornot website and the false claim of a Russian hacking of the Vermont power grid being prime examples, along with continuous top heavy anti-Russian op-ed pieces and news reports.) Parker suggests a double standard favoring Muslim bashing over her presented claim of Russian mischief against the US. She describes Russia as an «enemy». Her overlooked hypocrisy concerns the select outrage over anti-Muslim stances (real and hyped), while being soft on the frequent instances of bias against pro-Russian advocacy. Lacking specifics, Parker’s «proof» against Russia is the faith based US Intel report, which unlike her doesn’t refer to Russia as an «enemy», while claiming a concerted Vladimir Putin approved Russian government effort to support Trump by defaming Hillary Clinton. Regarding that report, the mind reading point about the Russian government and Russia’s mass media preferring Trump over Clinton is in the no kidding and so what category. Trump has openly sought better US relations with Russia, as Clinton was the preferred choice of the anti-Russian neocons. The January 8 exchange between Fox News host Chris Wallace and Trump’s Chief-of-Staff Reince Priebus included the latter saying in the beginning that «he thinks» that Trump accepts the claim of Russian hacking of Democratic Party emails. Wallace’s persistent questioning led Priebus to change course later on in the discussion, saying that the president-elect accepted the Intel take of Russian hacking. In any event, Trump (for now) doesn’t seem to believe that this matter should cloud the effort to improve US-Russian relations. There’s a difference between hacking from the Russian government and Russian hackers who hack en masse, independent of the Kremlin. For several years, there’ve been reports of hacking from Russia, the US and elsewhere against ordinary Americans and others throughout the world. Ideally, there should be conclusive proof that the Russian government used a third party to advance their purported cause, as has been suggested in some circles. With confidentiality respected, a CNN host privately asked how I could consider Julian Assange’s take over US Intel? For the record, I didn’t specifically say such. Is Assange less biased than the Democratic Party utilized CrowdStrike, that has also essentially been used to promote negativity towards the counter-Euromaidan rebels in Ukraine? CrowdStrike has ties to the Atlantic Council – a group that has been overly partisan against Russia. I’m not alone in believing that the trustworthiness of US Intel is compromised by its politicized element and a past that has been found to not always be honest. This politicization was noted last week by Fox news host Brett Baier, who said that Trump’s criticism of Intel has been misrepresented. Opposing politically driven and questionable Intel claims doesn’t necessarily belittle the need for accurate Intel and recognizing that not everyone associated with that grouping has the faulty slants of John Brennan, James Clapper, Malcolm Nance and Michael Hayden. (Nance and Hayden are former US Intel personnel, who’re frequent US mass media talking heads.) There’s ample reason to seriously question if the released Democratic party emails (however done) made a difference in the outcome of the 2016 US presidential result. To date, I’m unaware of any poll revealing that the released Democratic Party emails had significantly changed the outcome of that vote. The Democratic Party should be faulted for having a lax cyber security regimen, along with saying some ethically challenging things. Not to be overlooked are the numerous instances of US government meddling in the elections of other countries  and the reality of major powers (perceived allies and otherwise) spying on each other. On January 3, there were two segments featuring different perspectives on the released Democratic Party emails in question. Fox News’ Sean Hannity, had a lengthy one on one with Assange, that brought up the criminal charges made against the WikiLeaks founder. The PBS NewsHour segment with CIA Director John Brennan, included this quote from him: «We see what he has done in places like Crimea and Ukraine and in Syria. he tends to flex muscles, not just on himself, but also in terms of Russia’s military capabilities. He plays by his own rules in terms of what it is that he does in some of these theaters of conflict. So I don’t think we underestimated him. He has sought to advance Russia’s interests in areas where there have been political vacuums and conflicts. But he doesn’t ascribe to the same types of rules that we do, for example, in law of armed conflict. What the Russians have done in Syria in terms of some of the scorched-earth policy that they have pursued that have led to devastation and thousands upon thousands of innocent deaths, that’s not something that the United States would ever do in any of these military conflicts». Own rules as in what Turkey has done in northern Cyprus and the Clinton led NATO in Kosovo? It was a shameful example of journalism on the part of PBS to let Brennan’s comments go unchallenged. PBS had earlier run a pro-CrowdStrike feature. It’s not as if there aren’t any expert cyber security/ intelligence sources offering a different perspective. As for the devastation of thousands of civilians during war (raised by Brennan), consider some past US actions like what happened in Japan during WW II, the Cold War activity in Southeast Asia, as well as post-Cold War actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. The collateral damage emphasis has been hypocritically applied. Along with the subjectively dubious comments of Hayden and Nance, the above excerpted comments from Brennan are indicative of a (past and present) politicized element within US Intel. Among Russia friendly circles, some kudos has been given to Fox News‘ Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Like their employer, these two individuals have a preference for Trump over the Democrats. However, like many pro-Trump sources, Hannity and Carlson maintain some of the anti-Russian biases, as The WaPo and some others speak of a possible unknown money trail linking Trump to Russia. Trump has had known business interests involving China and some predominately Muslim countries. That aspect hasn’t prevented him from saying things that aren’t favored in these countries. There’re other Americans besides Trump who favor improved US-Russian relations in opposition to the neocon/neolib preference. Pat Buchanan serves as an example of an anti-Communist patriotic American, who second guesses the negative image of Putin and Russia. There’s also the community of anti-Communist White Russians in the US and elsewhere, which have a good number opposed to the current hostility towards Russia. From a more left leaning perspective, Stephen Cohen and some lessor known individuals aren’t anti-American in believing that the US (from its interests) shouldn’t be so antagonistic towards Russia. American foreign policy realists include disagreement with the need for having unfriendly US-Russian relations. An example of the ongoing bias is the obligatory «Putin is a thug» disclaimer frequently bandied about. As has been confidentially acknowledged to me, some well meaning folks do this as a means to soften criticism against their commentary, which otherwise goes against the neocon/neolib slant. Talk about «self-censorship». From a distance, Putin (IMO) doesn’t come across as being more mean spirited than Clinton, John McCain and some others who disparage him. With the pro-Trump/anti-Russian leaning people in mind, was Trump elected for being a nice guy? The personal insults against Putin are hypocritically petty. Upon a reasonable objective and comprehensive overview, the litany of negative claims against him are quite suspect. Yet, they keep getting uncritically rehashed in a way that exhibits a lack of diversity in US mass media and body politic. Short of providing greater attention to the likes of Lindsey Graham and McCain, the provocative name calling and other forms of posturing against Putin/Russia haven’t worked. It’s not in America’s best interests to use Russia as a political football to get at Trump and cater to anti-Russian advocacy. Trump should be accorded the opportunity to pursue better US-Russian relations.

Intel's Joule 570x and 550x are powerful computer boards that can be built as a PC, or be used to build robots, drones, or smart devices. But Intel is now seeking government certification so the boards can be cleared for shipment in those countries. Joule shipments have currently been blocked in a number of countries, including Taiwan, Japan, and Israel, all of which have active technology markets where hobbyists design hardware. Users that have ordered Joule boards from retailers abroad can't receive shipments in the blocked countries. China is not listed on the page describing the blocked shipments, and Intel can ship and sell the device in Hong Kong. Intel is currently going through the certification process in blocked countries, which may take some time. The Joule boards are on sale in countries like U.S. and Canada, where the certification process was quick. Device makers have to get certifications from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and other regulatory agencies before putting hardware on sale. Some of the certifications depend on the communications technologies and materials used to make the board. Intel couldn't provide a specific date on when Joule shipments will start in other countries. However, as the boards are certified in countries, shipments will start. Intel will keep its website updated to signify where the Joule boards are available, a company spokesman said. Joule is similar to the Raspberry Pi 3 and targeted at hobbyists and device makers, but it is more powerful. It also has features not found on Raspberry Pi 3 like 4K video and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. The boards are based on Atom x86 processors. The first Joule to go on sale was the 570x, back in August. It is priced at US $219 on Mouser. Recently, the 550x went on sale for $179. The boards can also be bought with development kits, but that costs more. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

PrintCommentRecommend (-) By Abhinav Davuluri | 01-11-17 | 06:00 AM | Email Article We came away from CES 2017 with greater confidence in the prospects for key technology players such as  Intel ,  Qualcomm , and  Nvidia . Pre-eminent trends--including 5G, artificial intelligence/deep learning, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality—that have been exhaustively discussed in theory in recent years were on full display across the premier electronics trade show. We believe investors should not view these burgeoning trends in isolation, but rather as an interconnected tapestry intricately woven with key elements from a host of firms. Given Intel’s expertise in high-powered computing, Qualcomm’s connectivity and mobile chip leadership, and Nvidia’s versatile graphics processing units, we expect all three to benefit immensely from these opportunities. We are maintaining our fair value estimates and moat ratings for these companies. We continue to view the shares of Qualcomm as having an adequate margin of safety, while Nvidia and Intel appear overvalued, albeit to varying degrees. About the Author Abhinav Davuluri is an equity analyst for Morningstar. Contact Author | Meet other investing specialists At a high level, new applications such as autonomous driving have a long list of requirements that can vary from high-powered and energy-efficient chips to overarching regulatory and infrastructure upheavals. As automated vehicles will generate and take in enormous amounts of data to navigate and react instantaneously to abrupt deviations, a futuristic network (5G) that can deliver faster speeds, ultra-low latency, vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity, and reliability is of the utmost importance. Meanwhile, the components in the vehicle itself also must be fit for the task, ranging from basic sensors that identify surroundings to advanced processors capable of almost instantaneously crunching mission-critical data to safely drive a vehicle without human intervention. The data center will also play a pivotal role in this ambitious pursuit. The computational power required to create, simulate, and train self-driving algorithms can only be found in servers accessed by vehicles via the cloud. We believe a successful autonomous vehicle will be the product of an ecosystem of partnerships among an army of firms. Noteworthy announcements from Intel at CES 2017 included a new 5G modem, an automated driving platform called Intel GO, and the expectation of having 40 autonomous test vehicles on the road by the end of 2017 via a partnership with BMW and Mobileye . Intel also agreed to purchase a 15% ownership stake in Here, a global provider of digital maps and location-based services. Strategically, we think this is a prudent move, as location data is a critical component in achieving fully autonomous vehicles. The firm also held a virtual reality news conference, with each participant given an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset powered by a seventh-generation Intel core processor-based PC. We came away impressed by the various VR examples, including a look at a live NCAA basketball game from a courtside vantage point via Voke VR and a live industrial inspection of a solar power plant via a drone. Cumulatively, these products and endeavors show how Intel continues to distance itself from the traditional PC market. Our wide economic moat rating stems from the firm’s scale and ability to invest heavily in developing and making processors, regardless of application. By continuing to diversify, Intel is positioning itself to be instrumental in the success of whatever growth vector proliferates the most, in our view. Qualcomm also provided a host of updates on its contributions to the aforementioned trends. The firm noted a collaboration with Ericsson and AT&T on radio trials for the second half of 2017, intended to accelerate the deployment of 5G. Qualcomm also announced its inclusion in a consortium of telecom and automotive companies to carry out trials for vehicle-to-everything communication. This primarily focuses on vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure, vehicle-to-pedestrian, and vehicle-to-network communications. These developments will form the foundation for 5G and autonomous vehicles, and we expect Qualcomm to leverage these roles into meaningful licensing revenue related to 5G connected devices and chip sales primarily from modem processors. The firm’s incremental progress into cars was bolstered by the integration of Qualcomm chipsets into next-generation Volkswagen vehicles, a new in-vehicle infotainment system being developed with Panasonic, and a new modem tailored to connected cars. We think Qualcomm is appropriately shifting its focus toward more promising avenues of growth as it looks to mitigate its reliance on the smartphone space. We expect the impending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors will augment this undertaking. We reiterate our narrow moat rating for Qualcomm, stemming from intangible assets related to the firm’s CDMA technology patents. Qualcomm continues to innovate on the mobile chip side, introducing its latest Snapdragon processor, the 835, built on Samsung’s 10-nanometer process technology. It is speculated the chip will be featured in the Samsung Galaxy S8. The 835 was designed to support a bevy of devices including virtual reality/augmented reality head-mounted displays, tablets, and mobile PCs. We note process specifications indicate the central processing unit in the 835 is a semicustom architecture, in contrast to the fully custom predecessor 820. When we asked why this was the case, Qualcomm representatives said the strategy was consistent with efforts to cut back research and development spending in mobile chip design, while redeploying the investment capital in other areas such as the Centriq 2400 server chip, which is currently sampling at customers. While we view this move as prudent for Qualcomm’s overall business, we think it also provides second-tier mobile chip competitors such as MediaTek a chance to catch up to Qualcomm. Nvidia’s presence at CES 2017 was balanced between its leading gaming GPUs as well as its well-publicized products tailored to autonomous driving. Nvidia unveiled the GeForce NOW service, which delivers high-performance PC gaming via the cloud using a pay-by-play model. We think this service was inevitable, but we are concerned it will cannibalize Nvidia’s high-end GPU sales, as the GeForce NOW can be used on computers without Nvidia GPUs. Nvidia also reignited its decade-long partnership with Audi, announcing a goal to put self-driving cars on the road by 2020. The graphics leader noted two developments related to mapping for cars: an extension of its existing collaboration with Here and a new partnership with Zenrin, Japan’s leading mapping company. The firm’s Drive PX 2 platform for autonomous driving has gained significant traction in the development of self-driving vehicles, but we expect competition to increase materially. Between Qualcomm-NXP and Intel-Mobileye, we think Nvidia will find it difficult to maintain its current leadership position. Our no-moat rating stems from the fact that gaming GPUs dominate total revenue for the firm and our view that the longevity of Nvidia’s competitive edge in the space is far from guaranteed. With the shares priced as if Nvidia will dominate the self-driving market in the automotive industry, we continue to view the firm as considerably overvalued.

Intel vs. Modesetting X.Org DDX Performance Impact Written by Michael Larabel in Display Drivers on 11 January 2017. Page 1 of 4. 27 Comments With word of Fedora switching away from using the Intel X.Org driver in favor of the generic xf86-video-modesetting driver, following in the steps laid by Debian/Ubuntu, there is fresh discussions over features and any performance impact of xf86-video-modesetting vs. xf86-video-intel DDX drivers. As such, here are some fresh 2D and 3D benchmarks. For those curious about the current xf86-video-intel vs. xf86-video-modesetting performance differences, from a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon with Core i7 5600U Broadwell CPU (GT2 graphics). Various OpenGL and 2D benchmarks were run via the Phoronix Test Suite. Atop Ubuntu 16.10, the system was upgraded to Mesa 17.0-devel, xf86-video-intel 2.99.917 Git, xf86-video-modesetting 1.18.4 with X.Org Server 1.18.4, and the Linux 4.10 kernel. While the default behavior has changed for Ubuntu/Debian and with Fedora 26, you can still load your own modesetting/intel DDX driver preference via the xorg.conf/xorg.conf.d and that's how this testing was facilitated.

Almost every traditional desktop or laptop PC runs on the Santa Clara company’s processors, but that tradition is fast being eroded by more mobile, ARM-powered alternatives. Apple’s most important personal computers now run iOS, Google’s flagship Chromebook has an ARM flavor, and Microsoft just announced Windows for ARM. And what’s more, the burden of processing tasks is shifting away from the personal device and distributed out to networks of server farms up in the proverbial cloud, leaving Intel with a big portfolio of chips and no obvious customer to sell millions of them to. If you want to talk about the most influential chip company in history, Intel’s name is the one you want. But the most influential for the future? That’s a much more open question. AMD (blue) and Nvidia (green) stock prices over the past year Yahoo! Finance During the course of 2016, Nvidia and AMD saw their stock prices skyrocket. Both companies are now trading at multiple times their value from a year ago, and the explanation lies in their massively expanded potential for future growth. All the AI hype that we heard during CES this past week is underpinned by a multitude of algorithms and mathematical calculations, and in its most sophisticated form it harnesses methods of machine learning and deep learning to evolve its awareness without being fed answers directly by a human. All of that new technology requires a lot of processing power, and it just so happens that AMD and Nvidia were already making the perfect processors for the task: graphics cards. GPUs, or graphics processing units, can be thought of as a specialized breed of the CPUs that Intel dominates in. Unlike central processing units, however, graphics chips are less versatile in the tasks they can perform and are best suited to running a ton of parallelized workloads. They don’t have four or eight cores, they have hundreds and thousands, and each of them is frightfully efficient at handling some small recurring tasks over and over again. GPU acceleration has fast become the standard for machine learning, and this year Google’s Cloud Platform will be powered by AMD’s FirePro server GPUs. It’s not that Intel is oblivious to the expanding market being created by the move toward machine learning — the company has an entire aspirational website dedicated to the subject — but its chips are at a fundamental disadvantage and it hasn’t secured the customers or made the same sort of progress that its rivals already have. Radeon Instinct GPUs (click image to expand) AMD AMD now has an entire line of GPUs dedicated to accelerating machine learning, which has been branded as Radeon Instinct. Every single trending thing in tech can benefit from these new cards: from autonomous vehicles, self-piloting drones, and personal robots to fintech, nanobots, and advanced medicine. Investors are buying up AMD stock because they know the processing challenges of the future are practically tailored for the massively parallel architecture of a GPU — and AMD has some really good GPUs. GPU server farms are going to be as significant to our future as ocean-floor cables are to our present Nvidia’s rise is also no surprise. The green graphics giant has been talking about deep learning and autonomous cars for at least three years at CES. It was bemusing at first, intriguing after a while, and now it’s turning into real-world self-driving vehicles thanks to a partnership with Audi. At the same time as Google and AMD were announcing their 2017 plans for Radeon-driven machine learning in the cloud, Nvidia and IBM revealed their own agreement to provide "the world’s fastest" deep learning enterprise solution. These deals might not be rich on hype, but one day soon they’re going to be as significant as the ocean-floor cables keeping the internet connected today. If I had money to invest, I'd buy as much $NVDA as possible pic.twitter.com/0h2aO6v9gh— Darshan Shankar (@DShankar) January 5, 2017 The next time a company offers you a cloud-based service of any kind — such as Google’s system for handwriting recognition in the new Chromebooks — odds are good that there’ll be a GPU farm somewhere churning through the mathematical tasks of making it happen. As AI and VR grow, so will graphics card sales More in line with their traditional businesses, AMD and Nvidia both stand to benefit from the growing consumer interest in virtual reality. The two most promising solutions, the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, both require a reasonably beefy PC spec, replete with a modern and powerful graphics, so the more people buy into VR, the more GPUs each company is likely to sell. But the most interesting dynamic that’s developed over the past year is how, ever so subtly and behind the scenes, AMD and Nvidia have essentially stolen Intel’s future away from it. Intel exists to satisfy our processing needs, but just as we discover a rich new vein of computational power needs, it turns out that Intel’s CPUs have already been surpassed by the basic architectural advantages of chips that were originally designed to push pixelated shoot-em-up targets around a monitor. It’s a fun twist of fate for everyone outside Intel, and the good execution exhibited by both AMD and Nvidia so far also portends well for the speed of improvement in AI and machine learning capabilities. At a time when Intel is still scrambling to find mega-tasking scenarios for its chips, its GPU rivals are more concerned with how fast they can churn out the hardware to satisfy demand that looks set to only continue growing.

A swath of AM4 motherboards and impressive demos—it may be time to get excited. Mark Walton (UK) - Jan 11, 2017 1:54 pm UTC Enlarge Mark Walton reader comments 237 Share this story During AMD's "New Horizons" live stream, which served as a coming out party for the Ryzen CPU, the company showcased a brand new performance demo. It pitched a stock Intel Core i7 6900K processor—an eight-core Broadwell-E chip that retails for just shy of £1,000/$1,100—against an eight-core Ryzen CPU. Both chips were tasked with transcoding a short video clip into the "Apple TV 3" preset in Handbrake, a notoriously CPU-heavy workload that scales well across several cores. The result, according to AMD's demo, was a completion time of 54 seconds for Ryzen and 59 seconds for Broadwell-E; Ryzen was about 10 percent faster. But the real kicker was that while the Broadwell-E chip ran with its standard boost enabled (up to 3.7GHz), the Ryzen chip was locked at its base clock of 3.4GHz. Not only did AMD claim to have caught up with Intel's multithreaded performance, it claimed to have surpassed it—and with TDP of just 95W compared to Intel's 140W. Further ReadingAMD’s Zen CPU is now called Ryzen Naturally, the Internet cried foul. Flick through the various subreddits dedicated to Zen, AMD, and Intel, and you'll find all manner of conspiracy theories about how AMD artificially capped performance on the 6900K by using a sub-par air cooler (it used the Intel-recommended part), or how there were differences in the video files used in the demo. Not all of these criticisms are without merit, of course. For example, it's not clear whether the Intel chip could have reached its full boost with all cores under heavy load. Or why not just lock the Intel chip at 3.4GHz for a straight IPC (instructions-per-clock) comparison? AMD demos Ryzen in a Handbrake test against Intel's i7-6900K. Despite these concerns, AMD has shown enough of Ryzen to make it an exciting product. For the last five or so years, Intel has remained unchallenged in just about every segment of the PC market, and improvements over time have slowed to a crawl. Its latest chip, the Kaby Lake i7-7700K is an incredibly marginal upgrade over its Skylake predecessor. Even a six-year-old Sandy Bridge i7-2600K can still hold its own when overclocked. Ryzen might just be the kick in the butt that the market needs—and thus, AMD is now working as hard as possible to convince the sceptical masses that Ryzen is more than just a tech demo, that Ryzen is a real product that will be on shelves before the end of March 2017. Motherboards galore To that end, AMD wheeled out its motherboard partners at CES, along with 16 of the 50 or so products that will launch alongside Ryzen. All the usual suspects are present and correct, including heavy hitters like Asus, MSI, and Gigabyte. What's most notable about the lineup is just how varied it is. AMD suffered from a lack of support with its AM3 chipset, resulting in a monolithic product line. AM4 changes that. For enthusiasts, there's X370, which brings together dual-channel DDR4, Radeon Crossfire, and Nvidia SLI support (yes, these boards are SLI certified), multiple SATA and M.2 slots, native USB 3.1 Gen 2, overclocking support, and the styling (read: gaudy l33t gamer) and build quality typical of premium motherboards. Further ReadingBad news, rich people: You won’t be able to use your GTX 1080 in 4-way SLIThe only nitpick with X370 is that it has only eight PCIe lanes of its own. Coupled with the 24 PCIe lanes of Ryzen—16 for graphics, four for NVMe, and four to communicate with the chipset—users have 32 lanes to work with. That's comparable with Intel's mainstream chips but lacking compared to Broadwell-E. Crossfire and SLI certainly aren't as appealing as they used to be (and if Nvidia's recent moves are anything to go by, SLI isn't long for this world), but the rapid proliferation of PCIe-based storage means PCIe lanes are quickly becoming a prized commodity. Enlarge / Chipset features. Enlarge / Ryzen processor features. A step down from X370 is B350, which also supports overclocking but drops some USB and SATA ports, two PCIe lanes, and Crossfire/SLI support. A320 drops even more USB and SATA ports, another two PCIe lanes, and overclocking support. Expect the latter to be priced very reasonably indeed. Perhaps most interesting, though, is the X300 chipset. This is a chipset designed explicitly for mini-ITX motherboards. After the longest time, AMD's high-end chips will find a home in small form factor PCs—and with just a 95W TDP, an eight-core Ryzen will make for an imposing SFF workstation and gaming rig. With X300, AMD has ditched all motherboard-based IO, leaving just the USB, SATA, and 24 PCIe lanes that are part of the Ryzen core. Curiously, the 4 PCIe lanes a Ryzen chip would typically use to communicate with the motherboard I/O can be repurposed by motherboard makers to add an extra M.2 slot or more SATA ports. Intel uses PCIe, too, but via a proprietary DMI interface (AMD uses SMI) that can't be accessed by motherboard makers. AMD has an impressive product stack with AM4, but more than that it shows just how invested in Ryzen the industry is. With the lacklustre Bulldozer architecture, high-end AMD chipsets were thin on the ground. Now, there are multiple chipsets, premium features and designs, and support from the biggest players in the industry. Cooling companies like Noctua have even pledged to send out new mounting brackets (AM4 is slightly wider than AM3) for free to anyone with a Ryzen receipt. AMD might not have revealed the product SKUs or the boost clocks of Ryzen itself, but there's no doubt that the ecosystem surrounding it is ready for launch. Enlarge / A selection of AM4 motherboards on show at CES. Mark Walton That said, AMD has promised that all Ryzen chips—whether that's the octa-core used in its demos or the rumoured hexa- and quad-core parts—are multiplier unlocked for overclocking, which is another departure from the mostly locked chips from Intel. The only limiting factor is the chipset. Even then, there may be performance boosts on offer for those with exotic cooling as part of its "Extended Frequency Range" (XFR) feature. "A lot of processors have pre-programmed clock speed voltage tables," explained AMD's Robert Hallock at CES. "We don't. This is very algorithmic. We analyse power consumption limits, thermal limits, silicon utilisation limits, and out of that boundary, if none of those limits are being met, you can just keep raising clock speed until one of them is. Then you level off the boost and then try to sustain it as long as possible. The system is smart enough to know what's going on inside itself, and adaptive enough to prevent sudden drops in clock speeds." Time for a change What's most impressive, though, is just how quick AMD has been to respond to critics. When commenters worried that Ryzen might bottleneck high-end graphics card performance like AMD's older CPUs, the company showed a demo of Ryzen running Battlefield 1 on an Nvidia Titan X Pascal, with a frame rate identical to that of a stock i7-6900K system with its own Titan X. When commenters asked what the value of an eight-core system would be compared to a quad, AMD showed how it would enable gamers to play a game like Dota 2 and stream it to Twitch simultaneously at the highest settings with even less dropped frames and delay than an i7-6900K (a feat AMD says is down to its more efficient inter-core communication). I tried those demos myself at CES, and it's hard to not be impressed. Until Ryzen lands in the hands of reviewers and the public, though, we should take everything with a large pinch of salt and a donning of the great scepticism hat. After all, this is a company that has a vast history of over promising and under delivering. Enlarge / AMD gave press hands on with its Battlefield 1 Ryzen cs. Broadwell-E comparison at CES. But there's a confidence around Ryzen that's been missing from AMD's CPU division for the longest time. Having seen Ryzen in action and just how hard AMD is working to make it a success, I'm hopeful that it will go some way towards helping the company's shaky financials from the past few years and that AMD might finally have a chip that moves desktop CPU performance forward. Further ReadingThe desktop CPU isn’t dead, it just needs a swift kick in the butt Assuming Ryzen's performance really is that good, the big question is: how far will AMD go down the price/performance rabbit hole? At CES, the company openly asked journalists what it should be priced at. Price an eight-core Ryzen at around £400/$500 and you bring down the cost of eight-core chips to that of a six-core—a solid move for consumers, but not one that will greatly affect mainstream performance. Price it the same as a quad-core i7-7700K—about £300/$330—and you dramatically shake up the industry. The decision is yet to be made. "There are a lot of discussions going on," says Hallock. "We're capturing the feedback. We wanna take share, we wanna be the best price/performance option, we wanna be the first on people's minds. That's part of the bounding box for pricing discussions as well as paying off the R&D investment... We're looking at what Intel does—and we're not gonna do that. We think people want the choice, and need the choice. The market needs the choice—hopefully we can turn it around."

With its seventh generation designs Intel has mixed things around a bit. Previously modern Pentium chips didn't offer HT (Hyper Threading) but now they are all 2C/4T designs, with all the benefits that brings. However, another range-wide change won't be so welcome - the removal of support for ECC RAM. You can read up on the five new HT enabled Pentium chips direct on Intel's ARK site: Pentium G4560 Pentium G4560T Pentium G4600 Pentium G4600T Pentium G4620 The above Pentiums might now feature HT but, in general throughout the range, have the following disadvantages compared to a Core i3 counterpart; lower base clock speeds, 3MB rather than 4MB of cache, lack of AVX2 instruction set support, greater power consumption, lower spec HD graphics, and lack of ECC RAM support. The lack of ECC RAM support in the new Pentiums could annoy some who have previously bought/created servers or NAS boxes using these cheaper processors. Of course the other differentiator between Pentium and Core i3 is the price. There is a $50 to $60 uplift in RRP for a corresponding i3 chip. Intel Core i3-7350K Processor Review On the topic of lower end Intel chips, we previously reported on an overclockable Kaby Lake Core i3 chip dubbed the Core i3-7350K. That interesting new i3 has recently been through the Legit Reviews labs. Priced at $168, the unlocked i3 processor on the test bench easily overclocked from its base freq of 4.2GHz to 5.1GHz by tweaking the multiplier and voltage. On lightly threaded tasks the i3-7350K could be a winner, reckoned the Legit guys in the review conclusion.

The range-topping Core i7-7700K isn't massively quicker than 2015's Core i7-6700K, and given the familiarity of the refreshed Z270 chipset, we imagine enthusiasts won't be rushing out to upgrade. We're intrigued to see whether or not AMD's Ryzen can put a cat among Intel's pigeons, but while Kaby Lake may have failed to get our hearts racing, there's no getting around the facts: Core i7-7700K is the fastest quad-core processor available today, making it a prime choice for a new PC in 2017. Furthermore, there's greater overclocking headroom than previous-generation parts, and that plays right into the hands of specialist system integrators seeking to put forth gaming rigs configured at dizzying speeds. Bolton-based Scan Computers is quick off the mark with the 3XS Z270 Vengeance SLI. Priced at £3,000 and aimed squarely at gaming enthusiasts, this eye-catching machine is designed showcase said overclocking potential by running the liquid-cooled Core i7-7700K at a guaranteed speed of 5GHz across all four cores. Acknowledging the trends that are likely to extend throughout the remainder of the year, Scan's premium rig champions tempered glass panels and enough RGB lighting to illuminate a small disco. Corsair's stylish Crystal Series 570X RGB chassis is the enclosure of choice, and we suspect the same case will feature in many SI catalogues as the centrepiece of illuminated builds. Having the components on show opens the door for even more lights and Scan takes full advantage by installing an Asus Strix Z270E Gaming motherboard and not one, but two, Asus Strix GeForce GTX 1080 Advanced graphics cards. There's even an Asus RGB SLI bridge, and all the lights can be customised via the bundled Asus and Corsair software utilities. We're nonplussed by the industry's desire to add lights to every conceivable component, but on the flip side, if you happen to be partial to some RGB-lovin', the Z270 Vengeance SLI will be right up your street. Scan's implementation is, as expected, very neat and tidy, and hats off to the engineer who managed to build into a glass-covered case without leaving a fingerprint in sight. The area behind the 570X motherboard tray can be tricky to keep tidy on account of the fan hub and various cables, but credit where it's due, this PC certainly looks the part. The caveat, however, is that the Corsair chassis has a tendency to favour form over function. It looks pretty, there's no doubt about that, but the position of the I/O ports along the top-right edge isn't ideal, there's no front-facing USB Type-C, and the floating glass panels do little to help contain noise. This, ultimately, isn't going to be a particularly quiet PC. What the Z270 Vengeance SLI will deliver, in spades, is performance. The Core i7-7700K's 5GHz overclock is the star attraction and represents a meaningful gain over the 4.6GHz speed that became commonplace on turnkey gaming rigs from the previous generation. Ticking the relevant boxes, Scan pairs the chip to 16GB (2x8GB) of DDR4-3000 memory, a roomy 512GB Samsung SM961 M.2 SSD, a 2TB WD Blue hard disk for secondary storage and a Corsair RM750i power supply with individually sleeved cables. The 5GHz overclock is interesting insofar as it's an early indication as to what tier-one system integrators will be offering to enthusiast customers. Though, there is still a bit of working out left to do. Our review sample wasn't completely stable to begin with and we had to manually bump-up CPU core voltage from 1.29 to 1.32 in order to complete our benchmarks successfully. Given that new Z270 BIOS releases are coming thick and fast, we imagine it will be a couple of weeks before system integrators strike the perfect balance between voltage and multiplier. Could you build the same machine for less using off-the-shelf components from various suppliers? Sure, but taking the pre-built route offers peace of mind, and Scan's three-year warranty holds weight when a new chip and chipset are being pushed closer to their limits. Going the extra yard, Scan also adds 150MHz to each of the GTX 1080 GPUs, raising boost clock to 1,802MHz. It's a machine crying out for benchmarks, so let's get to it.

After all, he had just become the new leader of Apperian, a Boston mobile app management and security startup that had raised about $40 million from investors, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Intel Capital and Bessemer Venture Partners. The reason he was taking the lead role? Apperian agreed to be acquired by San Francisco mobile app and IoT security company Arxan Technologies — a deal that was officially announced Wednesday — and Lorion was next in line after its former CEO, Brian Day, decided to step down to pursue a new venture. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Apperian will remain in Boston, where it has "a few dozen" employees and will continue to hire. "The application security and management capabilities Apperian provides are pivotal for organizations to securely deploy and manage their apps and we’re excited to offer our customers Apperian’s [mobile app mangement] products," Joe Sander, CEO of Arxan, said in a statement. "This acquisition puts Arxan in a unique position with the strongest and most comprehensive solution for enterprise application protection and management for both mobile and IoT.” I'm happy to be in the trenches with them. So yeah, with Arxan closing the acquisition and Lorion charged with leading Apperian's transition as its new president and general manager, Lorion, who's also co-founder of Boston TechJam, could probably use an extra coffee if you see him. "Basically by the middle of December, I was responsible for the company," Lorion told me. He was previously Apperian's chief marketing and products officer, having originally joined the company in November 2012 as its CMO. Before that, he was a marketing executive for Palo Alto-based TIBCO Software. "It’s exciting. I've been in the trenches with these guys for a long time. We have the battle scars and trophies to show it," he said of his team at Apperian. "I'm happy to be in the trenches with them." Lorion is taking over from Day, who left after being CEO for two years and became CFO of Cambridge cloud communications startup Fuze in December. Day had joined Apperian as its CFO in 2011 and was promoted to CEO in 2014. Related Meta Search Has a Killer Product — Here's Why It Decided to Get Acquired "He orchestrated and completed the acquisition and then transitioned the Apperian reins over to me," Lorion said. "Arxan liked my customer and product experience and felt that I would be able to lead Apperian." Day told me he decided to step down because he while he enjoyed being CEO of Apperian, he didn't "really want to be a president of a division of another company." Day said Fuze had been courting him to join for a while so he took the acquisition as an opportunity to join Fuze, an IPO candidate whose valuation is reportedly nearing $1 billion. "Apperian is in great hands with Mark," Day said, adding that he recommended Lorion to Arxan CEO Joe Sander. "Between Apperian's tech and Arxan's salesforce, they got a good deal." Between Apperian's tech and Arxan's salesforce, they got a good deal. Apperian began exploring the idea of getting acquired by Arxan about four or five months ago, according to Day. The company was originally looking for a potential partner to expand its business, but after speaking with Arxan, whose majority stakeholder is Boston private equity firm TA Associates, the two decided they could complement each other's business. While Apperian provides mobile app management and security for enterprise customers, Arxan focuses on that space from a consumer perspective. Lorion said both companies were hearing from customers that they were interested in the consumer or enterprise spaces, which signaled to Apperian and Arxan an opportunity to cross-sell each other's products. For instance, a large company that uses Apperian to deploy and secure apps on the mobile devices of employees and contractors might want to have similar security capabilities for consumer apps on a variety of devices. "Apperian does a great job at securing apps in the enterprise — apps used by employees, contractors" for example," Day said of the two companies' strengths. "What Arxan does a great job is securing apps that are publicly available.  No one wants their banking app hacked. If you think about it, it’s a pretty good fit."

Intel refers to its 3D XPoint storage devices under the name Optane, while Micron’s 3D XPoint-based brand is QuantX. The technology has been in development for several years, but Intel’s 7th-gen processors and their support for Optane memory points towards the expected arrival of completed products. Below is an overview of 3D XPoint and why it is an important technology. Architecture and Design 3D XPoint is designed to be the first major memory design overhaul since the implementation of NAND flash. The premise of 3D XPoint involves stacking thin layers of memory in a cross point structure to optimise density. The amount of voltage sent to each memory cell means data can be written or read without a transistor, decreasing both the size and price of the memory. The memory is non-volatile and its lifespan does not degrade due to continuous operation, like conventional SSDs. 3D XPoint is also extremely fast and cheap, meaning it may replace both conventional storage (HDDs and SSDs) and even DRAM memory. Performance Intel outlined the performance improvements of 3D XPoint over conventional storage in its initial announcement. While the hardware was not fully-developed or tested at the time, information released so far gives users an idea of what to expect. 3D XPoint storage is only slightly slower than DRAM, and much faster than SSDs and hard drives. Intel describes the speed of the memory as up to 1,000-times faster than NAND, with extremely low latency. The memory will also be as cheap as conventional storage, although this may only be true later in the production cycle. Products Intel has made steady progress in developing 3D XPoint-based products, with its Optane storage drives set to release this year. Intel has ensured that Optane is supported on its latest CPU architecture, which includes its 7th-gen processors, which means more commercial hardware may be announced soon. Early Optane products will likely be small, lightning-fast storage and cache drives, if development models are anything to go by. Full systems using unified 3D XPoint memory and storage are out of reach for the moment, although further refinement of the technology could make it a possibility.

This provides the hacker - and at the point of using as USB flash drive, any person in the world that can hold a USB stick in their hands - full control over the PC. Worse yet, it is completely undetectable by current security tools.   The possibilities of this are virtually unlimited, as someone could plug a USB 3.0 stick in and upload malicious code, keyloggers, and virtually anything else they want. The same flaw allows someone to make the PC completely inoperable, where it is capable of rewriting the entire BIOS. Yeah, that's a pretty big deal.   When talking about the new hacking potential on Intel's processors, Maxim Goryachy and Mark Ermolov at the 33rd Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany said: "These manufacturer-created hardware mechanisms have legitimate purposes, such as special debugging features for hardware configuration and other beneficial uses. But now these mechanisms are available to attackers as well. Performing such attacks does not require nation-state resources or even special equipment".   Goryachy said: "We have reported this case to Intel. As of today, this mechanism can be exploited only on Intel U-series processors". So while it's not on every Intel processor out there (that we know of anyway), but the Skylake-based U-series processors are found inside of plenty of laptops and NUCs. Goryachy added: "As of today, no publicly available security system will detect it".

Well, it's one that can do everything - but there isn't just one, here are 18 best laptops By Marie Brewis | 04 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments What's the best laptop? Best laptop Price Key specifications Dell XPS 13 9360 £999 Windows 10, Intel Core i5-7200U, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 13.3in 1920x1080 display, 60Wh battery Lenovo Yoga 710 11in £549 Windows 10, Intel Core M3-6Y30, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 11.6in 1920x1080 display, 40Wh battery Asus ZenBook UX310UA £699 Windows 10, Intel Core i5-6200U, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 500GB hard drive, 13.3in 3200x1800 display, 48Wh battery Jump straight to our full best laptops chart What's the best laptop? We round up the best laptops you can buy in the UK in 2017, including best Windows laptops and best MacBooks. The best laptop is the Dell XPS 13, followed by the Lenovo Yoga 710 and the Asus ZenBook UX310, but there are plenty of other options in our list below. Also see: Best Laptop Deals Despite the rise of tablets, there are still plenty of reasons to choose a laptop. Sometimes you just can't beat a bigger screen, a keyboard and Windows for getting stuff done. But, if you want a laptop that's also a tablet, there are plenty of convertible or 'hybrid' laptops which have a touchscreen which folds right back behind the keyboard and can be used as a tablet. The Yoga 710 is one of the best we've seen in this respect, although if its 11in screen is too small, Lenovo does offer larger versions. Before you buy any of the MacBooks in this chart, note that Apple unveiled a new MacBook Pro on 27 October. We will add the new MacBook Pro to our chart once we have completed our testing. Best laptops 2017: Buying guide As with any product we review, the best laptops are rated on various factors - performance, build quality, features and value for money – along with an overall score, potentially with an award, too. Note that star ratings don't always dictate where a product ranks in the list below, as the score applies to the date it was reviewed. If you're looking for a laptop that can handle the latest games, see our up-to-date list of the best gaming laptops. As much as we can, we make sure all the laptops in the chart are available to but in the UK. However, it's not something we can check every day so there's a chance you might not find the model listed. There are also often many different SKUs (versions/models) of a laptop so the specs might vary to those on the model we've reviewed (we can't always choose the exact model to review). Most laptops will come pre-installed with Windows 10 now. Of course, our best laptops group test also includes the best MacBooks, which run OS X (now macOS) out of the box. Macs are often more expensive than Windows laptops, but Apple's laptops are better value than ever before. You might feel that the premium build quality and features warrant spending extra, although many Windows laptop manufacturers have stepped up their game recently. Best laptops 2017: How much should I spend on a laptop?  In this chart, there's no cap on how much the device can cost – sometimes the best does come at a steep price. Equally you can get a lot of laptop for under £300 – provided you only need to do basic tasks like browse the web, email and create the odd document. If so see the best budget laptops. Spending a bit more, around £500 and above, will potentially get you a nice laptop but it's likely to have an entry-level set of specs. We're talking a relatively basic processor, minimal SSD storage and a low resolution screen. It might also be a bit heavy and bulky. Content continues below Ramp up the amount you're happy to splash out - £800 and up - and you'll be looking at the best of the best with a blazing fast processor, plenty of RAM, hordes of storage and a gorgeous display. You should also expect excellent build quality and premium materials. That's why it's crucial to read laptop reviews before you buy.  Best laptops 2017: What screen size laptop do I need?  The size of your screen is an important decision when buying a laptop. After all they typically range from 11- all the way up to 17in. A smaller screen might be harder to work on but it means that the laptop will be far more portable, handy if you need to take it around with you wherever you go. Bear in mind that a smaller device means less space for features like ports. At 17in, you're buying a desktop replacement laptop which isn't deigned to be moved around often. You'll likely get a full-size keyboard, lots of connectivity and possibly even an optical drive, too. Generally, unless you're looking at either end of the spectrum, a 13in laptop is the sweet spot for us combining portability with usability. While many laptops have a resolution of 1366x768, you should look for something more if you want the best. Full HD (1920x1080) and higher should be a tick box and you can even get 4K laptops now, although arguably it's not necessary. If you want a touchscreen, this normally adds to the cost. Most laptops come with a glossy screen but most people prefer a less reflective matt finish so that's something to look out for, too. Best laptops 2017: How much laptop storage do I need?  As usual, storage depends on what you want to use a laptop for. As a general rule of thumb get as much as possible without wasting money on the upgrade (manufactures can charge a premium on this area). An SSD will mean your laptop runs faster but doesn't provide as much space as a traditional hard drive. Remember that there are also plenty of cloud storage options but this isn't so helpful when you don't have an internet connection. If you're going to need to storing a large amount of data (perhaps you make home videos or you simply want all your TV box sets ready to go) then look for 1- or 2TB of space. Don't forget you can buy a portable USB drive to supplement a laptop which has only a small-capacity SSD.  Memory (RAM) is where programs and files are stored only while you're using them, and more is always better. Consider 4GB an absolute minimum, unless it's a Chromebook, with 8- to 16GB the ideal figure if you can afford the upgrade. You can't have too much. Best laptops 2017: Which laptop processor is best?  Unless you're going to run complex and demanding software or gaming, you don't need the latest top-spec processor. It doesn't hurt, of course, but it's best to find a nice balance as there's nothing worse than waiting for a app to load etc. If you're happy to splash out then you're probably looking at the latest generation (6th) Intel Core i7 chip. Entry-level spec models are likely to offer a Core i3 or even a Core M processor instead. A Core i5 sits nicely in-between so check how much extra it is to upgrade before making a final decision. If you're not sure which generation the Intel processor is, look at the model number as the first digit represents this. For example, a Core i5-6500 is a sixth-generation CPU. While most come with Intel processors, you can still find AMD powered devices around. See AMD vs Intel for more information. Best laptops 2017: Ultrabooks and ultraportable laptops Buying an ultraportable laptop is really no different than any laptop, except that your priorities are likely to be different. You might want an ultraportable laptop that's light and will last a long time away from the mains.  However, other people want an ultrabook that's powerful and can handle demanding applications without breaking your back when you carry it around. Both types are available. Some compromises are inevitable if you want a thin and light laptop, though. There's less space for a battery, so it's typical to find shorter runtimes. But some companies have overcome this with clever packaging, such as the MacBook Air.  Another factor is efficient hardware, so a newer processor is likely to sip rather than guzzle power. The same goes for other components. But you should always read our reviews to find out how long a particular laptop lasted in our tests as you can't rely on specifications and it's unwise to go only by manufacturers' claims.  Thin laptops tend to have shallow key travel, so if you need a laptop to do a lot of typing then, again, read our reviews as they're the only way (short of hunting down the machine in a shop) to find out whether a keyboard is a joy or a pain to use.  Many ultrabooks use low-power processors which are better for battery life, but may not have much power for running Windows apps. Our benchmarks sort the speed demons from the sluggards. Best laptops 2017: Warranty and other considerations  We recommend all the laptops here: there isn't a duff one among them. However, we urge you again to read through the full review before spending your hard-earned cash. None of them are perfect and what will suit your needs might not simply be the device ranked at number one. Battery life and warranty are two things which vary between laptops. The latter may well differ depending on where you buy the laptop from, too. John Lewis, for example, tends to offer longer warranty than rivals. After-sales service is something you should consider, not only laptops but pretty much everything you buy. Check whether the company has a UK-based support line, and forums (including our own) are an ideal place to get an idea of whether a manufacturer is generally good or bad at carrying out work under warranty. You might not even have to deal with the manufacturer directly if you have a fault in the first six months as it's the retailer's responsibility to deal with issues. This is when it pays to have purchased from Amazon, John Lewis and others which will often replace or refund without quibble. After al that, it's also worth considering whether a laptop is what you really want. You can get some great bargains on desktop PCs these days, and if you don't want a large tower system taking up space there are plenty of all-in-one PCs to choose between. These integrate the computer behind the monitor, so they're much neater. Also, some tablets offer similar functionality to basic laptops. See our piece about choosing between laptop vs iPad, for instance.  Read on for our pick of the UK's best laptops and links to our best laptop reviews.

Dell XPS 13 9360 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 December 16 RRP: From £999 inc VAT (model reviewed £1499 inc VAT) The Dell XPS 13 is an excellent ultraportable laptop, the best 13-inch Windows model going for many. Dell hasn’t aimed for a single superlative feature, a potential gimmick. Its footprint is smaller than the competition, but it’s thicker. Its screen resolution is excellent, but display colour is normal rather than super-saturated. There’s also a mix of old and new connections, and a combo of a large battery and smart power management means the Dell XPS 13 lasts significantly longer than most a lot of the time. The balance is just right - we'd spend our own money on it. Read our Dell XPS 13 9360 review. 2. Lenovo Yoga 710 11" Rating: Reviewed on: 9 August 16 RRP: £549 inc VAT The Lenovo Yoga 710 wants to offer the best, most convenient ultraportable laptop experience you can get without spending a scary amount of money. It has a 360-degree hinge and a touchscreen, which makes is a fun machine for use while travelling around. You wouldn’t want to go any smaller for all-day work tasks, but there is also a larger 14in version of this laptop if you think the 11.6in Yoga 710 will prove too small. For what it’s worth, Lenovo has nailed the display, glossy, sharp, bright enough for outdoor use, covered in toughened glass and jet black when switched off. Core hardware includes an Intel Core M3-6Y30 processor, 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 128GB SSD. You get a single USB 3.0 port, plus micro HDMI, but no microSD slot for storage expansion. There are stereo speakers, a nice tiled keyboard with two-button trackpad that is mostly comfortable to type on, and this 1.06kg laptop runs on a 40Wh battery. It’s not the fastest Windows laptop, but sufficient for everyday tasks that don’t include gaming. It’s silent in use, with respectable audio and long battery life - 9 hours 45 minutes in our tests. Lenovo’s Yoga 710 is one of the best Windows alternatives to the 12in MacBook. Read our Lenovo Yoga 710 11" review. 3. Asus ZenBook UX310UA Rating: Reviewed on: 6 October 16 RRP: £699 inc VAT The Asus ZenBook UX310A is an ideal mid-range ultraportable laptop. It is what happens when a practical everyday laptop and an expensive all-aluminium Ultrabook fall in love, bringing you the pricey look and feel of a portable, stylish machine with the features of a workhorse and a price way below that of a rival MacBook. Core hardware includes a Core i5-6200U CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM and both a 128GB SSD and a 500GB HDD. There’s a single USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0, plus USB-C, HDMI and SDXC. The Asus sports (albeit so-so) Harman Kardon stereo speakers, and with its 48Wh battery weighs in at 1.45kg. A cheaper version has the Core i3, 4GB of RAM and a lower-res display. The 13.3in screen is a highlight, with unbelievable sharpness (276ppi) and colour saturation at this price, and this matt screen excels in outdoor use. It’s paired with a scissor-mechanism keyboard with backlight and a large, comfortable trackpad. The ZenBook is not perfect - we’d like the display to tilt back further, the shell displays some flexing, and it’s a tad chunky thanks to the HDD inside - but it scored well on performance, provided you avoid intensive gaming. Battery life is solid, at 8 hours 10 minutes. You can’t have it all at this price, but the ZenBook gets close. Read our Asus ZenBook UX310UA review. 4. Dell Latitude 13 7370 Rating: Reviewed on: 22 July 16 RRP: From £1,079 Okay so it’s a business laptop, but check out that 13in edge-to-edge display. You wouldn’t be ashamed to show off the Dell Latitude 13 inside- or outside the office, with design hints taken from the awesome Dell XPS 13 listed higher up this chart. It’s customisable to suit your needs, but the model we reviewed came with an Intel Core m5-6Y57 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. There’s a USB 3.0 port, two USB-C, Micro-HDMI, a microSD card slot and two optional Micro-SIM slots. This 13.3in-screen laptop also sports a 34Wh battery and a fingerprint scanner, and weighs in at 1.12kg. The Latitude 13 has a pleasant matt finish to its base half, but the outer side of the lid is a cool (in every sense) aluminium that is surprisingly sturdy. Or you can add a carbon-fibre lid for an extra tenner. The keyboard is distinctly business-fare, somewhat cramped and with concave, clicky keys, but it’s workable. The trackpad is good, but small. And the screen offers great colours and viewing angles, even outdoors, but it lacks brightness. What really impresses is the Professional version of Windows it ships with, the silent running of the still-powerful processor, and its outstanding battery life of 8 hours 23 minutes in our tests. Read our Dell Latitude 13 7370 review. 5. HP Envy 13 Rating: Reviewed on: 25 February 16 RRP: From £649 inc VAT (model reviewed £799) You won’t find a laptop with a decent-sized screen more portable than this HP Envy 13. It’s incredibly slim and light, powerful, and it doesn’t cost the earth. Magic. Key specs for our review sample include the Intel Core i7-6500U processor with 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 256GB SSD. There’s a 13.3in full-HD screen, three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI 1.4, a fingerprint scanner, SDXC slot, Bang & Olufson stereo speakers and a tiled keyboard complete with numberpad. With a 45Wh battery the Envy 13 weighs just 1.3kg. Cheaper Core-i5 and more expensive higher-resolution-screen options are also available. Sensationally petite, the Envy 13 has plenty of its own visual personality. This ultra-light system offers a mix of officiousness and cuteness: an unusal combo. There’s a pleasant matt screen, a shallow but crisp keyboard, and HP’s trademark ultra-big, ultra-rounded touchpad - one of the best you’ll find on a 13in Windows laptop. Day-to-day performance is excellent, and more demanding tasks such as photo- and video-editing are well within the HP’s remit. With integrated graphics, though, you’ll want to keep games at low settings. In our tests battery life ran to 8 hours 5 minutes. Read our HP Envy 13 review. 6. Acer S 13 S5-371 Rating: Reviewed on: 13 October 16 RRP: £549.99 Introducing the Windows ultrabook for normal people (the ones whose jaws drop when they see the price of a new MacBook Air), the Acer S 13 is an affordable and recommended alternative to such wallet-busters. There’s a quirky trackpad and some parts of the build are cheap, but this is a very decent Windows laptop. The S 13 has an embossed ‘ridged’ plastic lid, offset by a silvery hinge that gives it a recognisable two-tone style. Its underside is plastic too, and the use of this material is one way Acer has managed to keep down the price. Elsewhere the build is more premium, for example the aluminium keyboard surround. On the whole, though, the spec is good. You get an Intel Core i3-610U processor (a Core i5 option is available) paired with 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 128GB SSD. There are two USB 3.0 ports, one USB-C, HDMI, SDXC and stereo speakers. The 13.3in Acer has a 4,030mAh battery and weighs 1.3kg. Day-to-day performance is good and battery life is very good, but the Acer is not a great gaming machine. It’s mostly quiet, with the fans kicking in only when necessary, yet the stereo speakers are loud. Watch it, though, as they’ll distort at maximum volume. Read our Acer S 13 S5-371 review. 7. Microsoft Surface Book Rating: Reviewed on: 30 June 16 RRP: From £1,299 inc VAT Microsoft thinks it has made the ultimate laptop, which is also a tablet. It's difficult to argue. There are five models, with the top offering the new £2,649 Surface Book i7. We reviewed the original Intel Core i7 Skylake model with 16GB of RAM and Nvidia GPU, and found excellent performance but have to point out the Core i5 model offers better value. The Surface Book is very angular, a slightly unusual shape for a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio, though we got used to it quickly. The 13.5in PixelSense display is stunning, with a crisp 267ppi density. Colour reproduction, brightness and viewing angles all excel. The Book itself is made from magnesium alloy, lighter and more durable than aluminium. The Book splits apart into the 724g screen with a 18Wh battery and the 860g keyboard with a 51Wh battery (battery life is fantastic at 16 hours, 25 minutes). The most striking part of its design its the ‘Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge’, which looks cool and improves balance. Meanwhile, an equally cool ‘Muscle Wire Lock’ uses an electrically charged nickel titanium alloy to hold it all together. The Surface Pen attaches magnetically to the side. You’ll find ports for USB 3.0 (x2), Mini-DisplayPort and an SD Card reader. USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 are missing, but this is still an amazing example of Windows laptop tech. Read our Microsoft Surface Book review. 8. MacBook Pro 2016 Rating: Reviewed on: 11 January 17 RRP: Base prices £1,449 (13-inch without Touch Bar), £1,749 (256GB 13-inch model with Touch Bar), £1,949 (512GB 13-inch model with Touch Bar), £2,349 (2.6GHz, 256GB 15-inch with Touch Bar), £2,699 (2.7GHz, 12GB 15-inch with Touch Bar) We're rather in love with the new MacBook Pro, but as with many love affairs there are irritations. The trackpad is huge and wonderful to use; but it's so big that the keyboard has been pushed up to make room, as well as flattened down to make the laptop slimmer. These factors together mean typing on the new Pro is a little harder - especially for touch typists, who will struggle to locate keys at first - than on on previous models. And those arrow keys are a nightmare. The Touch Bar is lovely to look at and fun to use. It's early days, both for us - we're only beginning to grasp its capabilities - and for app developers, who will surely come up with reams of clever Touch Bar features. Right now it's fun, but we're reasonably confident that it will become essential; the key will be getting lots of users on machines with Touch Bars. The tech is in this respect a little further back along the track that 3D Touch is following. This is a fast machine, of course, but maybe not quite fast enough for some tastes; it's worth reflecting on that maximum spec of 16GB of RAM, which may hold this machine back from a role in genuine pro settings. We're somewhat hopeful for a March update to add the option of more RAM and Kaby Lake processors. All in all, this is a fast and beautiful laptop but one with some flaws to consider. And ouch, that price tag is steep. Read our MacBook Pro 2016 review. 9. HP Spectre 13 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 August 16 RRP: £1299 inc VAT The HP Spectre 13 is desperate to appear a laptop of the future, and that comes with substantial pros and cons. Its supreme portability is quite wonderful, and while its design may polarise, it certainly is fancy. There's substance too, with a surprisingly powerful CPU for a laptop this thin and solid build in the keyboard and trackpad. Its message is a little confused, though. The processor courts enthusiasts, but that's exactly who's likely to be most annoyed by the lack of memory card slot and a traditional USB port. There's an audience for the Spectre 13, but if you've not signed-up to a wireless way of working yet you may want to think twice. Read our HP Spectre 13 review. 10. Lenovo Yoga 900 Rating: Reviewed on: 26 February 16 RRP: From £1199 inc VAT (model reviewed £1499) The Lenovo Yoga 900 is a laptop that really asks you to believe in its design style. After all, it doesn’t come cheap and for the price you can get a laptop with much more power if you’re not out for something immensely portable. That’s where this laptop excels: portability. As well as being slim, light and all-round lovely, the smart hinge lets it sit where most other laptops just can’t. The battery should last through a full day’s work as well. The trackpad can feel fiddly and the display isn’t perfect, but if you’re feeling flush this is one of the top ultraportables around. Read our Lenovo Yoga 900 review. 11. 13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015) Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £849 (with 128GB storage), £999 (with 256GB) Buy from Apple After some extensive testing, we found the MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) to be little different overall to the 2014 model. The Thunderbolt 2 update will prove useful for connecting to high-resolution UHD displays, and a few percent of added processor power is never unwelcome. But hoped-for improvements in graphics performance and battery longevity did not arise in our testing, in spite of a new Intel processor which was expected to shepherd benefits in both areas. Launched at the same price as last year’s model it still deserves attention as one of the finest ultraportable laptops available - doubly so now that its flash-drive speed has shot up another 100 percent - and it will remain the more affordable option in lightweight notebooks when the new MacBook launches this month. Read our 13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015) review. 12. Apple MacBook (early 2016) Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £1,049 There's no escaping the fact that this is a very similar laptop to its 2015 predecessor, which so divided the tech community. But we think the problems have been overblown. The engineering on show is superb, and the performance is completely acceptable for a modern-day computer of this size. The arguments that there should be more ports on the MacBook only exist because people want one, and are frustrated that their current set-up needs will not allow for it. Apple has undoubtedly improved the MacBook for 2016. It is a truly outstanding laptop that will be wrongly categorised as a luxury technological item. There's a difference between something costing a little too much and it being luxurious - just like the MacBook Air, this laptop deserves to fall in price and rise in specs to continue to be what we consider an excellent flagship computer. The world and its ports just need to catch up. Read our Apple MacBook (early 2016) review. 13. Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA Rating: Reviewed on: 5 January 17 RRP: From £1099 inc VAT (model tested £1499 inc VAT) The Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA is an extremely light laptop and one that doesn’t compromise performance or kill battery life as a result. It’s also more affordable than some of the alternatives, particularly in its entry-level spec. However, we’re not convinced about all the choices Asus has made. A single USB-C port won’t cut it for a lot of buyers, the ultra-slim keyboard isn’t great for long-form typing and the trackpad’s clicker mechanism has some real issues. The trackpad also seems a bit pointless when it’s reliability is mediocre, even if it’s down to Microsoft’s software. Its portability is just about unbeatable, but some of you may prefer the more accommodating style of the Dell XPS 13 or one of Asus’s cheaper ZenBook models Read our Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA review. 14. Dell Chromebook 11 (3120) Rating: Reviewed on: 9 March 16 RRP: £202 inc VAT Buy from Dell Dell knows what it’s doing when it comes to Chromebooks. This new, rugged model has plenty to offer in terms of speed and durability, but you don’t feel like you’re sacrificing much in return. With the long battery life and unique waterproofing feature it does seem like a device that’s built to last, which is good as you’ll want to keep using it for a long time to come. Read our Dell Chromebook 11 (3120) review. 15. Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Rating: Reviewed on: 14 September 16 RRP: £799 inc. VAT The Dell Inspiron 13 5000 tells you larger convertible laptops have truly entered the mainstream. It’s reasonably affordable, still looks good and has the roughly the same power as some laptops costing way over £1000. Down sides include that the screen isn’t as colourful as the best and that the casing is made of plastic rather than something fancy like aluminium or a magnesium alloy. Oddly enough, though, it actually fits in well among its more stylish peers. Read our Dell Inspiron 13 5000 review. 16. HP Envy 15-as001na Rating: Reviewed on: 13 September 16 RRP: £799 inc. VAT The HP Envy 15 doesn't seem like a desperately interesting laptop at first glance. It's too big to be cool, not quite cheap enough to be a stone-cold bargain. However, the longer you use it, the more you realise quite what a sound fit it is for people who want a larger laptop, but one not ugly, chunky or liable to last 90 minutes between charges. Sound performance, a smart trackpad, a respectable display and sensible price make the HP Envy 15 one of the best laptops for those who don't really need a super-performance PC but still want the desktop-replacer feel you get with a 15.6-inch laptop. Read our HP Envy 15-as001na review. 17. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 June 16 RRP: From £749 inc VAT (model tested £1079) There is a great deal to like and rave about the Surface Pro 4. The design is thinner and lighter for starters. The screen is awesome, there's plenty of power available, the new Surface Pen is better and the Type Cover is a vast improvement on the last one. However, the design is inherently awkward at times, it's more expensive that a lot of laptops and the Type Cover, which you'll pretty much need, isn't included lowering the value. Read our Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review. 18. Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 22 January 16 RRP: From £639 inc VAT A very decent laptop replacement, and an okay tablet, the Surface Pro 3 is undeniably impressive. If you need a single device to do everything we can't think of any better device. And when you consider the cost of buying a discrete laptop, tablet and desktop PC the Surface Pro 3 is priced to shift. The question remains as to whether people want a single device rather than multiple gadgets that are better at their individual tasks. Microsoft's latest results suggest that Surface Pro 3 is winning hearts and minds. Has it won yours? Read our Microsoft Surface Pro 3 review.

Intel gives its low-end Kaby Lake Pentium some Hyper-Threading bling to boost sales This performance boost just might make budget users more eager to upgrade. Gordon Mah Ung (PC World (US online)) on 11 January, 2017 23:00 0 - - - - print email Don’t say Intel never gave you nuthin’ for free. Although this news flew well under the radar when the company’s 7th-gen Kaby Lake desktop CPUs were launched last Tuesday at CES, Intel’s newest budget Pentium CPUs have received a performance buff with Hyper-Threading. The Pentium G4600, Pentium G4620, and Pentium G4560, as well as their power-saving “T” versions, all feature Intel’s Hyper-Threading, which delegates unused portions of the CPU for other tasks (you can see the chips here on Intel’s ARK site.) While it doesn’t quite turn these dual-core CPUs into quad-cores, there is a real-world performance boost on most multi-threaded loads. Hyper-Threading was introduced with the Pentium 4 in 2000 and has been a standard feature of Intel’s higher-end processors since then. The budget Pentium series, however, hasn’t had the feature until now. Making budget chips sexier Besides the support for Hyper-Threading, the new Kaby Lake budget chips also support Ultra HD 4K resolution and are capable of playing back 10-bit content easily. That can’t be done on Skylake, Haswell, or Ivy Bridge’s integrated graphics. One issue for Intel, Krewell noted, is the lack of air between its pricier Core i3 CPUs and Pentiums. For example, the dual-core 3.9GHz Core i3-7100 costs $117 in volume and has Hyper-Threading and HD 630 graphics. The dual-core 3.7GHz Pentium G4620 costs $86 to $93, has Hyper-Threading and HD 630 graphics. For that roughly 25-percent increase in price, all the customer gets is about a 5-percent performance boost. Not all are as close, though. Some Core i3 chips have larger caches and much higher clock speeds. Intel also recently unveiled an unlocked “K” CPU with very high overclocking capability. Why this matters: Company officials didn’t tell PCWorld why they decided to make the change, but the move gives Intel’s sub-$100 fare a performance edge compared to previous Pentium chips. Kevin Krewell, a chip analyst with Tirias Research, said the move could signal Intel's desire to offer budget shoppers an incentive to upgrade.

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

When you look at the evidence presented and the sources it becomes evident that the Russian hack story doesn't stand up against Crowdstrike's own facts. By examining facts, timelines, and sources needed for the DNI report, the only conclusion is the DNI report is strictly political. Because of this Craig Murray- Julian Assange's story showing the emails were leaked is the only version of the story that stands. The facts on hand show criminality and negligence on the part of Crowdstrike, the FBI, and the DNI. The Murray and Assange story stands on evidence many heavyweights in the Intel community are backing up their account as the only way the emails could have gotten to Wiki Leaks. The DNI report uses of information obtained by self-identifying Ukrainian neo-nazis (Pravy Sektor members). For US Intel to offer this proof of Russian involvement is really bizarre. While heading 17 Intel agencies, the DNI was not concerned enough about Russia hacking or influencing the 2016 election to look into. Why is it that during the 10 days following the election, James Clapper knew so little about the subject? According to the Washington Times" As recently as Nov. 17, James Clapper, the nation's top intelligence officer, told Congress his agencies "don't have good insight" into a direct link between WikiLeaks and the emails supposedly hacked by a Russian operation from Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign." But the FBI had it covered for months. James Comey, Director of the FBI is in charge of the domestic version of the CIA. According to the 2006 update of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, "the FBI's job in the streets of the United States would thus be a domestic equivalent, operating under the U.S. Constitution and quite different laws and rules, to the job of the CIA's operations officers abroad. - Advertisement - According to the FBI Director, "there are now 5,000 agents and 2,000 intelligence analysts" 41 in the branch. It is our hope that open source will become an integral part of all intelligence activities (FBI) and that, at some point in the future, there may no longer be a need for a separate directorate." With this in mind, Comey could have and should have simply phoned the NSA and received all the information he needed, chose not to. The question is why? Comey could have asked any of over 2000 analysts to look into it. Why didn't the Director of the domestic CIA request information? "According to William Binney(former Technical Director, World Geopolitical & Military Analysis, NSA), the NSA's "extensive domestic data-collection network," any data removed remotely from Hillary Clinton or DNC servers would have passed over fiber networks and therefore would have been captured by the NSA who could have then analyzed packet data to determine the origination point and destination address of those packets." After spending time in the election spotlight this year the only way FBI Director James Comey could not know any information about the alleged hack is that he didn't want to. - Advertisement - The FBI report is based solely on Crowdstrike's evidence which has become a laughing stock across the cyber security industry. Cyber security professionals are standing up saying how laughable Dimitri Alperovitch's information is. For there to be any evidence of a hack, the DNI report has to use the FBI report and Crowdstrike's evidence. This includes the tool X-Agent. X-Agent was a key proof for Crowdstrike. In the NPR interview with Judy Woodruff, Crowdstrike's CTO, Dimitri Alperovitch says the use of X-agent shows guilt as clearly as DNA results. This proof, according to him is unique to a single hacker group. Crowdstrike labeled this hacker group "Fancy Bear." Just as important is the timeline it was used in. According to Marcy Wheeler, Crowdstrike's story of a Russian hacker falls apart on this point. Part of the problem is that Alperovitch stated his final undeniable and overwhelming proof was that it was used to target Ukrainian artillerymen throughout 2014. She argues given that timeline, the GRU, X-Agent had to be in development at least 6 months BEFORE Victor Yanukovych was ousted in a coup. Ukraine and Russia were on friendly terms. Further, citing Jeffery Carr, X-Agent doesn't have anywhere near the functionality that Crowdstrike claims it does. Carr goes on further to say two other entities have access to X-Agent which Crowdstrike presents as unique. The first is Crowdstrike itself. The second is the Ukrainian hacking group RUH8 which self-identifies with Pravy Sektor. Next Page  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5   - Advertisement - 5   2   2   View Ratings | Rate It I live in Ukraine.

But at least this time you end with an understandable sentence: "Julian Assange and Craig Murray told the truth. The emails were leaked." I don't have the expertise (or the patience) to see how anything you say supports this conclusion, but maybe some other reader will find it useful. You have said you read David Spring's essay. Why do you not mention it here? Spring's essay says clearly that the govt info provides 885 IP addresses in 40 different countries (but mostly in the US) that could be the source of the hack. This presumes that it was a hack, but also shows that it could have come from anywhere. To my non-nerd mind, there does seem to be a question of whether it was a leak or a hack. Assange, Binney and Murray say it was a leak. It is clear that US intel cannot admit that it was a leak because that would put the source inside the DNC and therefore exclude Russian culpability. Hence it has to be a hack, for their purpose. But John McAffee says (again) here, very clearly, that if it was a hack it could have been perpetrated literally by anyone, anywhere, and that it was much too amateurish to have been done by Russian intel. So if it was a leak, it could not have been the Russians, and if it was a hack, it could have been anybody anywhere under the sun. Do you agree?

OF intelligence, he said he doubted them, then "I am a big fan of intelligence." You are still drinking the snake oil. I want a revolution that overthrows the whole bundle of crooks. Trump, to begin with, serves unjustly because as the Declaration says, those who rule without consent, rule unjustly. Clinton is history. The intelligence community has chosen Trump and then picked a fight to make it look otherwise. Trump says he thinks it was the Russians. That puts him back in tune with the fake intlligence squabble.

Trump denied, denied and then was shown the classified evidence. He has now admitted "I think it was the Russians."

I have just read this article by the Ukrainian author and I think it makes some sense. First, as to the debate about whether the DNC was hacked from the outside or leaked from the inside, my conclusion is that it was both hacked and leaked - with more than one hacker and more than one leaker. Security at the DNC was almost non-existent. Read my report for evidence of both hacking and leaking. Second, I briefly mentioned the link between Crowdstrike, Ukrainians and the Atlantic Council in my report. However, I had several other Ukrainian connections to the DNC hack that I did not put in the report. I omitted this information from the report for two reasons. First, I am not an expert on Ukraine - I am an expert on website security. Second, I did not want to get distracted from my main point which is that while the Russians were not involved in the DNC hack, the NSA likely was. I understand this is hard to believe - which is why my report is 85 pages long. I want to thank the Ukrainian author for his article. I agree that there is a very strong Ukrainian connection to the DNC hack and to Crowdstrike and the Atlantic Council. But I do not understand why these three groups are related - other than the fact that Dimitri's dad was perhaps a Russian turned CIA agent and Dimitri does not like Russia right now. The truth about all of this is very complex.

Mirrors indeed, on this question I can not profess that I know Trump's mind but I can say I see a war in this back and forth between the incoming and out going power base/s. There is a lot at stake and this intel battle is only part and parcel or a single battle in a much larger war. This is much like (IMHO) choosing the time and place of battles in the over all war. This could include the selection of which asset/s and which propaganda/truth/s will be challenged/accepted by the real winning of the people's support or trust which without nothing is possible. The word maybe (I recognize what you are saying or some sliver of possibility) does not win or lose but delay the battle until the time is right. I guess what I am trying to convey is that in the story of David and Goliath if David had attacked the army with his slingshot the result would have been disaster. Appropriate weapon for appropriate application to win one battle and then the war.

The Deep State will take him aside and convince him of anything they want -- it only takes a slide show.

He may be a f*cking idiot, but he knows how to win. If the Deep State had total control of him, he would not have said "I think Russia is behind the hacking...." and ended the fight with the Deep State, which provides cover for his complicity.

What I know is that wars have two purposes: 1. War as a racket, a business model for profits for the banks, energy cartels, and weapons makers who profit from war. 2. War as a cover for unpopularity, as a form of economic stimulus for a President trapped in recession, and war as a way to rally support for a leader who lacks organic support. My examples are Hitler, Mussolini, and Bush II. I suspect that Trump, being ou most disapproved President ever, will travel down this path. The movie Wag the Dog illustrates the latter purpose of war as coverup: "The President of the United States is caught making advances on an underage "Firefly Girl" less than two weeks before Election Day. Conrad Brean (De Niro), a top-notch spin doctor, is brought in to take the public's attention away from the scandal. He decides to construct a diversionary war with Albania, hoping the media will concentrate on this instead. Brean contacts Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Hoffman) to create the war, complete with a theme song and fake film footage of a photogenic orphan (Kirsten Dunst) in Albania. When the CIA learns of the plot, they send Agent Young (Macy) to confront Brean who convinces him that revealing the deception is against his best interests. The CIA announces that the war has ended, but otherwise maintains the deception and the media begins to turn back to the President's abuse scandal. Motss decides to invent a hero who was left behind enemy lines, and inspired by the idea that he was "discarded like an old shoe" has the Pentagon provide him with a soldier named Schumann (Harrelson) around whom he constructs a further narrative including T-shirts, additional patriotic songs, and faux-grassroots demonstrations of patriotism. At each stage of the plan, Motss continually dismisses setbacks as "nothing" and compares them to past movie-making catastrophes he averted." Wiki War as racket, war as diversion, war to create the illusion of solidarity......all these make sense in terms of Trump's choice of Wall St Billionaires, Exxon CEO as secy of state, and his need to find a basis of consent since most American's disapprove of him. Am I close? I can speculate about what is behind the fog but as for knowing, who knows? When in doubt, I go back and read Orwell's Politics and the English language, about the dangers of confusing language as a mask for the truth. All I know is that the truth is hidden and that the "explanations" are likely either naive or cover ups.

The Ukrainians are the extreme of politically active. They have over 2000 political groups in the US organized by subject, for instance womens rights, civil rights, religious rights, or multiculturalism. Each works independently until needed for a larger project. Trump saying it is, could be, or probably is Russians is a pressure relief. The proofs listed above are just short of a real smoking gun confession by Ukrainians. If that were to show up, could Hillary be indicted for the Russia hacks? Is this part of a coup attempt.

In October 2016, Yahoo named her one of the 16 most important people, who shaped this year's election. It was Chalupa, who blamed Shrillary's defeat on Russian hackers, and that Trump's campaign was aided by the Kremlin. This was because Trump had appointed Paul Manafort as his campaign manager, who had ties to Putin. Chalupa worked with Michael Isikoff, a journalist with Yahoo News, to publicise her views on Russian influence on the election campaign. She has also hysterically accused Trump of treason, even requesting the Department of Justice and other official government departments to investigate Trump for this alleged crime. Ames is very careful, however, to state that he is not arguing that Chalupa is one of those behind PropOrNot. Rather, he is using her to show how PropOrNot is part of a wider, venomously anti-Russian movement within the Democrat party. He states that in his opinion, it is a classic case of blowback. After the Second World War, the US supported Ukrainian Fascists, despite their collaboration with the Holocaust and the massacre of the country's ethnic Polish population, because they were seen as useful agents and allies against the Russians. Now that policy is beginning to blow back into domestic American politics. Timberg's other source for his blacklist was the Foreign Policy Research Institute, citing its 'fellow', Clint Watts, and a report Watts wrote on how Russia was trying to destroy America's democracy. The Institute was founded on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania by Robert Strausz-Hupe, who had fled Austria in the 1920s. It was funded by the Vick's chemical company, which sponsored a large number of initiatives devoted to rolling back the New Deal. It was also clandestinely funded by the CIA. Strausz-Hupe's collaborator was another Austrian e'migre', Stefan Possony. Possony had been a member of the Fascist governments of Dollfuss and Schuschnigg, but fled in 1938 after the Nazi annexation. Possony was the co-author of nearly all of the institute's publications until he moved to the Hoover Institute at Stanford in 1961. He also continued publishing in the FPRI's Orbis magazine, and was one of the contributors to Mankind Quarterly. This was one of the leading proponents of pseudoscientific racism and eugenics. Possony also wrote books advocating the same vile policy with another White supremacist, Nathaniel Weyl. Possony claimed that Black Africans, along with the peoples of the Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia, were mentally inferior to Whites. He stated that giving them independence was high dangerous. Instead, they benefited from White rule, which was gradually improving them. Whites dedicated to overthrowing colonialism were derided as 'fashionable dupes' who would be responsible for a 'White genocide'. Possony defended William Shockley's theories on racial eugenics, which argued that spending money on welfare was wasteful, because non-White races were too inferior to improve their conditions. Possony also supported Reagan's Star Wars programme, as he believed it gave America first strike capability, and thus would allow it to win a nuclear war with Russia. Strausz-Hupe believed that America was losing the propaganda war with the Soviet Union, and demanded a series of reforms to strengthen the American propaganda machine and close the gap between Soviet and American propaganda. And when Kubrick's Cold War black comedy, Doctor Strangelove, came out, he accused the great cineaste of either being a conscious Soviet propaganda agent, or a willing dupe. Ames' article concludes Today, the Foreign Policy Research Institute proudly honors its founder Strausz-Hupe, and honors his legacy with blacklists of allegedly treasonous journalists and allegedly all-powerful Russian propaganda threatening our freedoms. This is the world the Washington Post is bringing back to its front pages. And the timing is incredible--as if Bezos' rag has taken upon itself to soften up the American media before Trump moves in for the kill. And it's all being done in the name of fighting "fake news" "and fascism. Washington Post gave a glowing front-page boost to an anonymous online blacklist of hundreds of American websites, from marginal conspiracy sites to flagship libertarian and progressive publications. As Max Blumenthal reported for AlterNet, the anonymous website argued that all of them should be investigated by the federal government and potentially prosecuted under the Espionage Act as Russian spies, for wittingly or unwittingly spreading Russian propaganda. What the Washington Post did in boosting an anonymous blacklist of American journalists accused of criminal treason is one of the sleaziest, and most disturbing (in a very familiar Kremlin way) things I've seen in this country since I fled for home. The WaPo is essentially an arm of the American deep state; its owner, Jeff Bezos, is one of the three richest Americans, worth $67 billion, and his cash cow, Amazon, is a major contractor with the Central Intelligence Agency. In other words, this is as close to an official US government blacklist of journalists as we've seen--a dark ominous warning before they take the next steps.

About Chalupa Crowdstrike's connection to the hackers, dnc, and atlantic council, and this one showing that the investigation is poorly done. Most of what these "breaking articles" are doing is quoting my work, making baby steps forward without attribution. You cannot look up this subject without coming across these articles. Top 10 in search. I am glad the info is going mainstream. It's time to open up more.

I followed this link just to get caught up Clinton paid around $1 million to internet trolls to turn Sanders supporters. How much money went into the Russian hacking story?" The link leads to another which denies the claim. How can I trust a source which uses links which deny it's insinuations? I do not deny Clinton dirty tricks, as a Sanders/Stein supporter but my first loyalty is to the truth. The first claim of the 1 million paid (which the links do not confirm but deny) is used as a premise for the money into the "Russian hacking story" Here is my question: if the evidence for the Russian hack is "false and faked," why did Trump then come out and say "I think it was the Russians?" before tens of millions of viewers? The FBI disclosures first worked to defeat Clinton, and the feud between Trump and the NIA then provided cover. Then Trump, now safely in power, accepts the NIA consensus. I see a web of deceit involving Putin, Assange, Trump, and the intelligence agencies, with the FBI chosen to take down Clinton, for whom they had great hatred. I can find no other explanation to untangle the web of deceit. Trump's admission changes everything....and I have provided at least a plausable explanation which shows all the actors playing their roles in an effort to 1) get Trump elected and 2) provide deniability. This is indeed how the Deep State operates. Cause regime change and then deny under a tangle of complex and confusing counterclaims and even a fake feud to lull the public and media into a false chase. I might be wrong, but all other versions collapse before the fact that Trump has now stated "I think the Russians did it." Why would I believe Trump? That is not the question: the question is why would he say this? Clearly he is part of the conspiracy, since it was he who publically asked Russia to intervene to defeat Clinton. I suggest Russia listened and all the players, from Putin to Assange to Trump to Comey played their roles in a script designed to confuse and deceive the public and the media.

This is the definitive article on this subject to date. Who among us would have thought we'd live to see the day when McCarthyism emanated from the Democrats? Their record of scare tactics and blame shifting is pathetic. Hillary Clinton lost the campaign because she couldn't beat the least popular candidate in recent history - Trump had a disapproval rating in the 60% range most of the campaign. She didn't mention jobs and failed to visit the key states in the midwest. But then again, maybe Putin did a mind control thing with Clinton to make her a bad candidate.

Why else would Trump say "I think the Russians did it?" Having been handed what he asked for and thus winning, he pretended a fake feud with an agency that is "Trumpland" and now, as is his wont, after winning, tells the truth when it no longer matters. The FBI got it both ways: they defeated their hated adversary Clinton and then got scorched by Trump...wink wink. No one really knows among the public but at least the scenarios of a puppet show makes sense and fits the actors and motives involved.

It would take only 51,000 voters to change their minds in the swing states......30% of voters is 40 million who said they were less included to vote for Clinton. It would take less than 1% who actually swung to Trump to defeat Clinton. Mission accomplished as the large Clinton margin quickly collapsed after the Comey disclosures. The Russian contribution was essential, working thru intermediaries to allow Assange to deny any contact with the Russian government; from Russia with love to Donald Trump. The fake feud between Trump and the CIA/FBI was designed to cover up the conspiracy to defeat Clinton, hated by Putin, Assange, Trump, the CIA and the FBI. See my article Hacks/Schmacks for documentation. All the rest is indeed distraction, cover up, a puppet show.

As CES 2017 celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, the mega electronics event was also a record-breaker in hosting more than 600 startups and more than 175,000 industry professionals -- including 55,000 from outside the US. "Our industry is helping the world improve through connectivity and innovation, touching literally every facet of our lives. Today's connected world was on full display at CES 2017 -- our largest, boldest show in history," Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, Consumer Technology Association (CTA), told IANS. The event also showcased the connected future of technology with more than 3,800 exhibiting companies and exhibit space of more than 2.6 million net square feet. "This year's show was all about connectivity -- both in the form of the technologies unveiled and in the valuable face-to-face business connections happening throughout the show," added Karen Chupka, Senior Vice President, CES and corporate business strategy, CTA. In the field of connected cars, Intel showcased a system with Microsoft Hololens (augmented reality headset) that sent signals to the Cloud via 5G and received commands from artificial intelligence (AI) servers, taking decisions for automatic driving. "What you see here is all that needs to come together for automated driving to come a reality. At the Intel automated driving experience, the car has the sensors that are collecting information and processing it to recognise everything in its surroundings," an Intel exhibitor at the booth told IANS. In a perfect vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the car could also connect with the traffic lights which, in turn, gives less traffic congestion and safe automated driving experience with very less or no accidents. "CES 2017 was a global showcase that demonstrated that we are in a new era of innovation where technology is valued not just for the devices it produces but for the experiences it makes possible," Bridget Karlin, Managing Director, IoT, at Intel, told IANS. Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Blackberry and QNX Operating Systems, Mitsubishi and Mercedes also showcased their electric and hybrid cars. The US glass manufacturing company Corning introduced a car with Corning Gorilla Glass that provided toughness with a 30 per cent decrease in the vehicle's weight. Chip manufacturer Qualcomm introduced its newest mobile platform Snapdragon 835 processor with X16 LTE modem, which will provide high performance and enhanced power efficiency. Snapdragon 835 is designed to support next-generation entertainment experiences and connected Cloud services for premium consumer and enterprise devices. The mobile platform is 35 per cent smaller in package size and consumes 25 per cent less power compared to the previous generation flagship processor Snapdragon 821. Expected to revolutionise the connected world, 5G was a major focus throughout CES. "CES 2017 was a coming out party for the future of 5G which, we estimate, will generate a net 20 million new jobs," Jim Mault, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Qualcomm Life, told IANS. Companies like Samsung, TCL and Hisense came up with 8K TVs -- with Samsung and TCL building the new platform on Quantum Dot technology that offers true RGB colour mixing, more durability and is energy efficient. Samsung also unveiled its much-awaited Gear S3 Smartwatch. While companies like Lenovo launched machines dedicated to gaming, the onus was on virtual (VR) games. Several companies launched products that support VR gaming. The show also received a huge social media momentum, including nearly 1.4 million mentions using #CES2017 hashtags.

Alle Posts des Autors Email: US-Korrespondent IDG News Service Alle Posts des Autors Intels neue Storage-Technologie Optane ist spätestens seit der CES 2017 in aller Munde und verspricht für Unternehmen wie Consumer zahlreiche Vorteile. Wir sagen Ihnen, was Sie von Optane erwarten dürfen. Empfehlen Diskutieren Drucken PDF URL Xing LinkedIn Twitter Google+ Facebook Der Halbleiter-Riese Intel hat sich über die Jahre den Ruf des Geschwindigkeits-Treibers erarbeitet. Mit der neuen Speichertechnologie Optane will das Unternehmen nun noch einen Gang höher schalten. "Next big storage thing"? Dabei geht man bei Intel fest davon aus, dass Optane die heutigen SSDs im Storage-Umfeld und Hauptspeicher auf DRAM-Basis ersetzen wird. Eine Vorstellung, die in vielerlei Hinsicht verlockend ist: nicht nur was die Boot-Geschwindigkeit und Produktivität ganz allgemein angeht, sondern auch in Sachen Gaming. All diese Bereiche dürften durch Optane einen wesentlichen Performance-Boost erhalten. Ganz konkret soll Optane circa zehn Mal so schnell sein wie eine konventionelle SSD. Der Beweis für diese Behauptung unter realen Bedingungen steht indes noch aus. Auf der CES 2017 wurden bereits erste Optane-Storage-Lösungen angekündigt, allerdings vorerst nur mit geringen Kapazitäten zwischen 16 GB und 32 GB, die sich lediglich als Cache nutzen lassen. Intel will mit Optane den Storage-Turbocharger zuschalten. Wir sagen Ihnen, was Sie über die neue Technologie wissen müssen. Foto: J. Lekavicius - shutterstock.com Das dürfte sich laut Pat Kannar, Marketing Director bei Dell, mit zunehmender Reife der Technologie ändern: "Höhere Kapazitäten werden in den nächsten Jahren folgen, genauso wie neue Formfaktoren". Bis dahin, so der Experte weiter, böten die ersten Optane-Speicher willkommenen Raum für Tests und Experimente. Auch wenn Intel also seine Technologie auf der CES präsentiert hat - Optane bleibt weiterhin ein bisschen mysteriös. Wir haben für Sie alle uns bekannten Fakten zum (potenziellen) "next big storage thing" zusammengetragen, um ein wenig Licht ins Dunkel zu bringen. Was ist Intel Optane? Optane basiert auf einer Speicherttechnologie namens "3D Xpoint". Diese zeichnet sich dadurch aus, dass die Speicherzellen in eine dreidimensionale Netzstruktur eingebettet sind. Entwickelt wurde die Technologie in Kooperation mit Micron. Die ersten Optane-Produkte (16 GB und 32 GB) werden ausschließlich auf PCs laufen, die Intels neue Chipgeneration Kaby Lake an Bord haben. Skylake, Broadwell oder AMD-Chipsätze fallen in Sachen Optane also grundsätzlich aus. Letztlich wird Intel auch Optane-SSDs mit großen Kapazitäten auf den Markt bringen - mit dem Ziel, die konventionellen Solid State Disks überflüssig zu machen. Darüber hinaus wird Optane auch als DRAM-Ersatz verfügbar sein. Im Gegensatz zum dynamischen RAM ist Optane aufgrund seiner höheren Speicherdichte in der Lage, Daten auch nach dem Ausschalten eines Rechners zu behalten. Wann sind Optane-SSDs verfügbar? Laut Intel sollen erste SSDs mit Optane-Technologie zur zweiten Jahreshälfte 2017 verfügbar sein. Einige PC-Hersteller haben bereits durchblicken lassen, dass Optane-SSDs mit großen Kapazitäten noch eine ganze Weile auf sich warten lassen könnten. Es ist zudem sehr wahrscheinlich, dass diese erst einmal bei Servern zum Einsatz kommen, bevor sie ihren Weg in die Personal Computer dieser Welt finden. Derzeit testen unter anderem Facebook und IBM großvolumige Optane-SSDs in ihren Servern. Eines gleich vorweg: Wie jede neue Technologie wird auch Optane zunächst kein billiges Vergnügen darstellen. Die Optane-Storage-Lösungen entstehen derzeit in begrenzten Stückzahlen in China. Wenn die Produktion hochgefahren wird, dürften auch die Herstellungskosten sinken. SSD-Festplatten mit 480 bis 512 GB im Vergleich SSDs der 500-GB-Klasse bieten genug Platz, um ganz alleine das Betriebssystem, alle Programm und den zentralen Datenbestand zu speichern - und sind zu Preisen ab rund 150 Euro inzwischen auch bezahlbar. Wir haben für Sie die beliebtesten Varianten von 480 bis 512 Gigabyte im Vergleichs-Test. PLATZ 10: Corsair Force LX 512GB Zu den Stärken der Corsair Force LX gehören sehr hohe Datenraten und kurze Zugriffszeiten. Auch bei der Praxisleistung kann die 512-GB-SSD überzeugen. Der Lieferumfang ist hingegen dürftig und auch die Leistungsaufnahme ist durchwachsen, hier schmerzt vor allem der vergleichsweise hohe Verbrauch unter Last. Für das Gebotene ist der Preis zu hoch. PLATZ 9: Crucial MX200 500GB Beim Tempo kann die Crucial MX200 überzeugen, insbesondere die Praxisleistung und die sehr kurzen Zugriffzeiten ragen hier heraus. Weitere Pluspunkte sammelt die 500-GB-SSD durch die gute Ausstattung. Abzüge gibt es hingegen für die zu hohe Leistungsaufnahme. Für die gebotene Leistung ist die SSD preiswert, aber kein Schnäppchen. PLATZ 8: Crucial BX100 500GB Mit der BX100 bietet Crucial eine preisgünstige Solid State Drive an, die beim Tempo voll überzeugt. Positiv zu Buche schlägt auch die vergleichsweise hohe Gesamtschreibleistung von 72 Terabyte. Die Ausstattung ist hingegen durchschnittlich und auch beim Service reist das Crucial-Modell mit 36 Monaten Garantie keine Bäume aus. Minuspunkte gibt es auch für die zu hohe Leistungsaufnahme. Dafür stimmt der Preis. PLATZ 7: Transcend SSD370S 512GB Mit sehr kurzen Zugriffszeiten, einer exzellenten Praxisleistung und hohen Datenraten bietet die Transcend SSD370S durch die Bank hohes Tempo. Die Ausstattung ist gut und der Stromverbrauch niedrig. Den einzigen Schnitzer, den sich das Transcend-Modell erlaubt, ist die vergleichsweise kurze Garantiezeit von 3 Jahren - die Sie aber in Relation zur exzellenten Gesamtschreibleistung sehen sollten. Der Preis geht in Ordnung. PLATZ 6: Sandisk Extreme Pro 480GB Die Sandisk Extreme Pro überzeugt mit sehr gutem Tempo in den Praxistests, konstant hohen Transferraten und flotten Zugriffszeiten. Ein fetter Pluspunkt ist die lange Garantiezeit von 10 Jahren. In Ordnung gehen die Leistungsaufnahme und der Funktionsumfang. Negativ zu Buche schlagen der mäßige Schreibbefehlsdurchsatz und der dünne Lieferumfang. Die 480-GB-Festplatte ist aktuell zu einem Straßenpreis ab 170 Euro erhältlich - das ist noch günstig. PLATZ 5: Kingston HyperX Savage SSD 480GB Die Kingston HyperX Savage 480GB ist sehr schnell, insbesondere die ausgezeichnete Praxisleistung überzeugt. Ausstattung und Lieferumfang liegen über dem Durchschnitt. Negativ zu Buche schlagen die zu hohe Leistungsaufnahme der SSD und die vergleichsweise knickrige Herstellergarantie von nur drei Jahren. Insgesamt ist die Kingston HyperX Savage aber ihr Geld wert. Wer eine flotte SSD sucht, darf zugreifen. PLATZ 4: Crucial MX100 512GB Dank 16-nm-NAND holt sich die Crucial MX100 den Titel "Energieeffizienteste SSD ihrer Klasse". Das gilt allerdings nur für die Leistungsaufnahme unter Last, im Bereitschaftszustand verbraucht die Solid State Drive mehr Energie als die Konkurrenz. Dafür besticht das 512-GB-Modell von Crucial durch schnelle Datenraten, kurze Zugriffszeiten und hohem Befehlsdurchsatz. Ausstattung, Service und Garantiezeit sind hingegen nur Durchschnitt. PLATZ 3: Samsung SSD 850 Evo 500GB Hohe Datenraten, kurze Zugriffszeiten, niedrige Leistungsaufnahme, enorme Ausdauer, Drive-Verschlüsselung und sehr gutes Software-Paket - die Samsung 850 Evo 500GB überzeugt in allen Testkategorien. Bei einem Straßenpreis von rund 135 Euro ist die SSD auch preislich ein sehr attraktives Angebot. PLATZ 2: OCZ Vector 180 480GB Die OCZ Vector 180 480GB besticht durch sehr hohe Geschwindigkeit, Gesamtschreibleistung und Zuverlässigkeit. Hinzu kommen die kundenfreundlichen Service-Leistungen, die sehr gute Ausstattung und der innovative Stromausfall-Schutz. Letzteren erkauft sich OCZ allerdings mit einer vergleichsweise hohen Leistungsaufnahme. Bei einem Straßenpreis von aktuell rund 190 Euro für das ist die OCZ Vector 180 bekommen Sie einen beachtlichen Gegenwert fürs Geld. PLATZ 1: Samsung SSD 850 Pro 512GB Hohes Tempo, niedrige Leistungsaufnahme, enorme Ausdauer, toller Funktionsumfang und satte 10 Jahre Garantie - die Samsung 850 Pro 512GB überzeugt auf der ganzer Linie. Kein Modell im Test bietet eine so ausbalancierte Leistung. Wäre da nicht der vergleichsweise hohe Anschaffungspreis von über 200 Euro und der maue Befehlsdurchsatz bei zufälligen Schreiben - die Solid State Drive von Samsung wäre perfekt. Bei einem aktuellen Straßenpreis von 215 Euro zahlen Sie für Samsung 850 Pro 512GB momentan 45 Cent pro Gigabyte. Ob Ihnen die Samsung-SSD den Aufpreis von rund 50 Prozent wert ist - eine gute 500-GB-SSD bekommen Sie mittlerweile schon für 135 Euro - müssen Sie selber entscheiden. Welche Systeme nutzen Optane? Viele Produkte, die auf der CES 2017 vorgestellt wurden, werden die neue Storage-Technologie an Bord haben. Zunächst wird Optane allerdings erst einmal Motherboards bereichern - in Zukunft dürfen Sie dann irgendwann ihr System mit großvolumigen Optane-SSDs "pimpen". Der erste Laptop, der optional auch Intels Optane-Technologie mitbringt, wird Lenovos ThinkPad T570 sein. Der Grundpreis des Geräts (ca. 900 Dollar) dürfte dadurch allerdings um ein deutliches Maß nach oben schnellen. Auch HPs überarbeiteter Envy Curved All-in-One 34 wird im Frühjahr per Software-Update ebenfalls Optane-fähig gemacht, wie Mike Nash, Vice President of Product Management bei HP, auf Nachfrage verriet. Ein konkretes Release-Datum ließ er sich allerdings nicht entlocken. Auch Dell plant mit der Technologie: Verschiedene Laptops und Desktops sollen zur Jahresmitte 2017 mit Optane-Option zur Verfügung stehen. Acer Predator 21 X Acer zeigt den ersten Laptop mit einem Curved Screen. Das ist allerdings nicht das Einzige Highlight an diesem mobilen Gaming-Monster: Im Inneren werkeln gleich zwei Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 Grafikkarten. Dazu gibt's einen übertaktbaren Intel Core i7-Prozessor, 64 GB DDR4 RAM und bis zu vier 512 GB SSDs. Kostenpunkt: 9000 Dollar. Acer Chromebook 11 N7 Das 11,6-Zoll Chromebook 11 N7 von Acer ist in erster Linie für den Einsatz in Bildungsinstitutionen gedacht. Deswegen ist das Teil auch kompromisslos auf Widerstandsfähigkeit getrimmt. Die Technik im Inneren ist hingegen nicht sonderlich erwähnenswert, weil ziemlich überholt. Dafür gibt’s das Teil ab Februar aber auch schon ab rund 300 Euro. Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 370 Lenovos neuestes 2-in-1-Device lässt sich dank seines 360-Grad-Scharniers jederzeit vom Laptop zum Tablet transformieren. Darüber hinaus bietet das Hybrid-Gerät die neuesten Intel-Prozessoren, bis zu 16 GB RAM und ein 13,3-Zoll-Full-HD-Display. Achja: Eine SSD mit maximal 1 TB Kapazität und einen Thunderbolt 3-Port gibt's obendrauf. HP Sprout Pro Bereits vor zwei Jahren präsentierte HP die erste Version des Sprout – damals war der AR- und VR-Hype allerdings weit weniger ausgeprägt – die Menschen brauchten keinen PC, der 3D-Objekte in digitale 2D- oder 3D-Bilder umwandeln kann. Das hat sich inzwischen grundlegend geändert. Genau der richtige Zeitpunkt also, den Sprout mit aktueller Technik „vollzustopfen“ und in Sachen Abmessungen etwas zu optimieren. Im März sollen die ersten Geräte ausgeliefert werden – zum Preis gibt es noch keine Infos. HP Envy Curved All-in-One 34 Bei vielen All-in-One-PCs werden die Hardware-Komponenten hinter dem Screen verbaut. Das ein oder andere Gerät wirkt dadurch allerdings etwas – naja, nennen wir es mal „ungelenk“. Das war bislang auch bei HPs Envy AiO der Fall. Bislang. Denn in Las Vegas zeigt HP die neue, überarbeitete Version. Die Technik (unter anderem auch die neuen Intel Kaby Lake-Prozessoren) wurde nun im Standfuß des Geräts untergebracht. Die Preise sollen bei rund 1700 Dollar starten. Asus ZenBook 3 Mit dem ZenBook 3 zeigt Asus auf der CES einen Laptop, der die neueste Technik unter der Haube hat: zum Beispiel Kaby Lake-Chips, Gorilla Glass 5 und Thunderbolt 3-Ports. Dabei ist das Gerät lediglich 12,9 Millimeter dick und etwas mehr als ein Kilo schwer. Ab Mai ist das ZenBook 3 zu Preisen ab 1700 Dollar erhältlich. Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom Leidenschaftliche Smartphone-Fotografen bekommen mit dem ZenFone 3 Zoom von Asus ein neues Spielzeug. Die sonst recht unspektakuläre Technik im Inneren des Handys wird ergänzt von einem Dual-Kamerasystem, das aus zwei 12-Megapixel-Kameras besteht. An der Front sorgt eine 13-Megapixel-Kamera für hochqualitative Selfies. Das Smartphone unterstützt auch das .raw-Format und bietet vielschichtige Kamera-Einstellungsmöglichkeiten. TCL Blackberry Auch wenn die meisten Menschen die kanadische Kultmarke Blackberry längst abgeschrieben haben: TCL Communications zeigt auf der CES ein neues Smartphone. Mit mechanischer Tastatur. Die Zielsetzung des chinesischen Unternehmens ist ambitioniert: "Wir werden ein komplettes Portfolio auf die Beine stellen, um Apple und Samsung auf dem Enterprise-Markt herauszufordern", so Steve Cistulli, US-Chef von TCL. Olloclip Add-On für iPhone Die neuen Zusatz-Objektive von Olloclip sollen die fotografischen Skills von iPhone 7 und iPhone 7 Plus verbessern. Das Keyboard 5Q Sie sehen: Die weltweit erste Cloud-Tastatur. Was das bringt? Wenn bestimmte Informationen - etwa eine eingehende E-Mail - beim Keyboard ankommen, wechselt es die Farbe. So könnte man sich mehrere ressourcenfressende Browser-Tabs sparen. Neonode AirBar Bereits 2015 wurde die AirBar von Neonode erstmals angekündigt. Sein Debüt feiert das Peripheriegerät fürs MacBook Air nun auf der CES 2017. Die Airbar wird per USB an das Macbook angeschlossen und sorgt für Touchscreen-Funktionalität. Vorbestellbar ist die Airbar bereits, der Preis soll bei circa 100 Dollar liegen. Fehlt nur noch ein offizieller Termin für die Markteinführung. Armani Exchange Smartwatcheses Dass der Smartwatch-Markt rückläufig ist, scheint man beim Uhren-Giganten Fossil gelassen zu sehen: Nachdem man im letzten Jahr bereits zahlreiche schlaue Uhren namhafter Marken auf den Markt gebracht hat, folgen nun Modelle von Armani Exchange. Casio WSD-F20 Smartwatch In Las Vegas zeigt Casio die erste Smartwatch mit Android Wear 2.0. Die schlaue Uhr ist wasserdicht bis zu einer Tiefe von 50 Metern und soll auch bestens gegen Schläge und Stöße gewappnet sein. Neu ist unter anderem ein integriertes GPS. Ende April 2017 kommt die Casio Smartwatch auf den Markt, der Preis soll bei rund 500 Dollar liegen. ODG R8 & R9 Neue Mixed-Reality-Brillen aus dem Hause Osterhout Design Group wollen der Hololens zeigen, wo es lang geht: Die neuen Smartglass-Modelle R8 und R9 sind ebenfalls eigenständige Computing-Devices und unterstützen sowohl AR-, als auch VR-Apps. Dabei wiegen die smarten Brillen aber lediglich zwischen 128 und 194 Gramm und kosten bis zu 1800 Dollar. LeEco Smart Bikes Das Rad neu erfunden hat LeEco mit seinen neuen, smarten Fahrrädern zwar nicht – dafür hält jede Menge Technologie in den Fahrrädern Einzug: Navigation, Fitness-Tracking- und Kommunikations-Funktionalitäten sowie ein tracking-basierter Diebstahlschutz zeichnen die Smart Bikes aus. Ein Betriebssystem besitzen die Räder folglich auch. Nämlich BikeOS, das auf Android 6.0 basiert. Zum Preisgefüge gibt es noch keine Infos, die ersten Modelle sollen (in den USA) im zweiten Quartal 2017 erhältlich sein. Robo 3D-Drucker Die kompakten 3D-Printer von Robo verfügen über selbstjustierende Druckbetten und intuitive Touchscreens. Der Robo C2 (im Bild) ist die kleinere, leichtere Variante – wer mehr Leistung sucht, darf zum Robo R2 greifen. Reach Robotics Mekamon Die Mekamon Kampfroboter von Reach Robotics eignen sich nicht nur für ausgiebige KI-Kriege, sondern kreieren auch mit Hilfe von Augmented Reality und einem Smartphone ein immersives Single-Player-Erlebnis. Airblock Modulares Drohnenkit Aus diesem modularen Bausatz können ganz verschiedene Arten von Drohnen erstehen – etwa ein Hovercraft. In erster Linie richtet sich das Kit an Schulkinder. "Business-Kinder" dürften daran aber ebenfalls Gefallen finden. Flir Duo Wer immer schon mal eine Wärmebildkamera auf seine Drohne montieren wollte, darf ab sofort zur Flir Duo greifen. Chipolo Sticker Der Chipolo Sticker ist ein Miniatur-Bluetooth-Tracker und ideal für Menschen, die gerne Dinge verlieren. Das Device lässt sich an so gut wie allen Oberflächen anheften. Crosley Radio Vinyl Rocket Jukebox Keine Lust auf digitale Musik? Crosley Radio zeigt auf der CES den Traum aller Plattenfreaks. Die Jukebox lässt bis zu 140 Vinylplatten rotieren. Ganz ohne "moderne" Elemente geht es aber doch nicht: Gesteuert wird das Teil über eine Fernbedienung, im Inneren verrichtet ein digitaler Verstärker sein dezibelhaltiges Werk. Darüber hinaus gibt es natürlich zahllose Optionen für die Erstellung individueller Playlists. Dog & Bone Earmade System Die Wireless Earbuds von Dog & Bone lassen sich vorwärmen - für maximalen Sitz und Komfort. Sensoria Smart Socks Diese sensorbestückten Socken können unter anderem Schrittgeschwindigkeit und -Rhytmus messen und bieten GPS. In Kombination mit smarten Schuhen wird dann alles noch viel besser. HiMirror Plus Anscheinend gibt es für einen smarten Spiegel, der seinen Nutzern schonungslos jede neue Hautunreinheit und sonstige körperliche Verfehlungen unter die Nase reibt, tatsächlich einen Markt. Der Bluetooth- und WiFi-fähige HiMirror Plus tut genau das. Bis zu sechs Benutzerprofile lassen sich abspeichern – außerdem können auch die Verpackungen von Beauty-Produkten eingescannt werden, um weiterführende Informationen zu erhalten. Withings Kérastase Hair Coach Wearable-Spezialist Withings kooperiert mit der L’Oreal-Tochter Kérastase. Das Ergebnis: eine smarte Haarbürste. Das kann wahrscheinlich nur Haar-Fetischisten wirklich begeistern. Der Sinn und Zweck dahinter? Die Bürste verfügt über ein integriertes Mikrofon und zahlreiche Sensoren. Die Daten die hierbei zusammenlaufen, werden per Smartphone-App analysiert und geben Aufschluss über Haarqualität und –Beschaffenheit, die Effektivität des Kämmens und vieles mehr. Am Ende bekommt der Nutzer einen „Hair Quality Score“ und gegebenenfalls Tipps, wie sich dieser in die Höhe treiben lässt. Interessant ist dazu insbesondere die Aussage von Withings-CEO Cedric Hutchings: „Das letzte was wir wollten, war, ein simples Device in ein komplexes zu verwandeln“. Genau. FlexR Bei diesem Gadget handelt es sich um ein Stück Open-Source-Hardware, das Muskelkontraktionen maschinenlesbar macht. Das Ziel: Gamification in die Physiotherapie zu tragen. Man könnte damit aber auch Super Mario mit den Bauchmuskeln spielen. Grush Gamification-Zahnbürste Mundhygiene ist bei Kindern ja oft weniger beliebt. Damit soll nun Schluss sein – dank der smarten Zahnbürste von Grush. Denn mit Hilfe einer Smartphone-App und der Augmented-Reality-Technologie wird das Zähneputzen zum Videospiel. Kingston Data Traveler Ultimate GT Kingston zeigt in Las Vegas den bislang größten USB-Stick aller Zeiten. Die 2TB-Monstrosität besitzt nicht nur die Nomenklatur eines Sportwagens, sie bietet auch Platz für rund 70 Stunden 4K-Videomaterial. Der Preis dürfte bei circa 900 Dollar liegen. Und wer es eine Nummer kleiner mag: Ein 1TB-Modell ist ebenfalls geplant. SanDisk Extreme Pro USB-Stick Dieser USB-Stick aus dem Hause SanDisk bietet 256 GB Speicherkapazität und kommt mit USB 3.1. Damit dürfte er in Sachen Speed auf SSD-Niveau liegen. Fasetto Link Dieser unscheinbare kleine Kasten vereint LTE-Hotspot und NAS. Befeuert wird das Device von einem Samsung Exynos Octacore-Prozessor. Dazu stehen bis zu 2TB SSD-Speicher zur Verfügung. Auch Bluetooth- und USB-C-Support sind an Bord. Smarter Kühlschrank-Kamera Gadgets wie diese Smartcam zur Kühlschranküberwachung von Smarter werden oft belächelt. Aber mal ganz ehrlich: Wissen Sie immer aus dem Stegreif, was sie gerade an Lebensmitteln brauchen beziehungsweise nicht brauchen? Eben. In Zukunft genügt ein Blick aufs Smartphone, um sich Klarheit zu verschaffen. Coros Linx Smart Biking Helmet Musik auf dem Bike hören ohne Ohrstöpsel und Gefahren? Dieser smarte Fahrradhelm von Coros soll es möglich machen. Dazu nutzt das Device die Leitfähigkeit menschlicher Knochen. So bleiben die Ohren trotz Charts-Beschallung frei für Umwelteinflüsse. Gesteuert wird das Teil über eine Fernbedienung, die Augen bleiben also auf der Strasse. Das war es aber noch nicht in Sachen Sicherheit: Ein integriertes Notfall-System sorgt dafür, dass ein Alert an einen Notfallkontakt verschickt wird, sobald die Sensoren einen Aufprall wahrnehmen. Abgerundet wird das smarte Paket für Fahrrad-Freaks von einer Smartphone App mit allerlei Tracking-Möglichkeiten. Aluma Personal Safety Device Dieses Gadget tut was für die persönliche Sicherheit. Das Device von Alumi wird (beispielsweise) auf der Rückseite eines Smartphones befestigt und macht bei Aktivierung Panik bei potenziellen Angreifern, in Form eines Alarmtons der rund 135 Dezibel erreichen soll. Helle Lichtblitze und die automatische Notrufbetätigung gehören ebenfalls zum Funktionsumfang. Samsung QLED Smart TVs Bei den Smart TVs sieht es ganz ähnlich aus wie bei den Smartphones: jedes Jahr kommen unzählige neue Modelle auf den Markt - natürlich mit durchweg revolutionären Neuerungen. Genau so soll es sich laut Samsung nun auch mit der Smart-TV-Modellpalette für 2017 verhalten. Dazu hat man auch ein neues Kunstwort kreiert: QLED. Das Q steht dabei für "Quantum Dot" und soll noch schärfere, farbechtere Bilderlebnisse gewährleisten. LG OLED Smart TVs Wenn es um die OLED-Technologie geht, ist LG ohne Frage Pionier. Auf der CES zeigen die Koreaner nun ihre neue Modellfamilie. Die OLED-TVs der W-Serie zeichnen sich dabei insbesondere durch ihre „skinny“ Gehäuse aus: Das 65-Zoll-Modell ist lediglich 2,57 Millimeter dick. Sony Bravia OLED-TVs Nachdem Sony bereits seit längerem OLED-Geräte für den Profi-Einsatz anbietet, wagt man sich auf der CES erstmals auf die Consumer-Bühne. Das dürfte zwar kein günstiger Spaß werden, aber die Präsentation der neuen Highend-Smart TVs war in Sachen Bildqualität schon mal ziemlich beeindruckend. Nox Smart Sleep Light Das smarte Schlaflicht von Nox wiegt Sie mit Licht- und Musikspielen in den Schlaf. Vorher analysiert es dazu ihre "persönliche Body Clock" und kennt anschließend Ihre Schlafgewohnheiten. Die Aussendung von roten Lichtstrahlen soll die Ausschüttung des Schlafhormons Melatonin begünstigen. Petcube Bites Petcube präsentiert Bites: Eine interaktive Kamera mit Snackspender-Funktion. Für Ihr Haustier versteht sich. Vivint Sky Im Bereich Smart Home werden auf der CES wie gewohnt ebenfalls etliche Neuerungen vorgestellt. Zum Beispiel Vivints Komplettsystem namens Sky. Das soll dank Cloud-Anbindung und künstlicher Intelligenz jeglichen Konfigurationsaufwand im automatisierten Zuhause eliminieren, weil es sich automatisch an Umgebung und Bewohner anpasst. Gesteuert wird über ein iPad-eskes Controlpanel. Im zweiten Quartal 2017 soll das Sky-System verfügbar sein. Geplant sind unter anderem eine Video-Türklingel, eine Security Kamera, Sensoren für Fenster und Türen, ein smartes Thermostat und ein Smartlock. GeniCan Scanner Sogar der Mülleimer wird demnächst smart: Am "Müll-Scanner" von GeniCan können Sie die Barcodes auf den Verpackungen verbrauchter Lebensmittel scannen, um eine Instant-Einkaufsliste zu erzeugen. Samsung Family Hub 2 Auch Samsung sattelt im Bereich Hausautomatisierung weiter auf: Auf der letztjährigen CES präsentierten die Koreaner erstmals ihren smarten Kühlschrank Family Hub. Aktuell gibt es nun den Nachfolger zu sehen. Der Family Hub 2 verfügt nun über Innenkameras, die das smarte Food Management weiter verbessern sollen. Außerdem bietet der schlaue Kühlschrank nun auch Sprachausgabe für die integrierte Rezept-App. Künftig kann man sich also ganz aufs "Machen" konzentrieren. Sprachbefehle nimmt der Family Hub 2 natürlich ebenfalls gerne auf. Samsung Flexwash & Flexdry Wenn Sie eine große Familie und eine Menge Geld haben, könnte Samsungs smartes Wäscheduo Flexwash und Flexdry genau das Richtige sein. Der Clou: beide Geräte nehmen gleich zwei Ladungen Wäsche auf und lassen sich aus der Ferne per Smartphone-App steuern. "Umladen" muss man aber trotzdem noch selbst. Samsung Powerbot VR7000 Einen neuen, superflachen Staubsaugerroboter haben die Koreaner ebenfalls im CES-Gepäck. Der Powerbot VR7000 verspricht dank zahlreicher Sensoren besonders gründliche Reinigung. Gesteuert wird wie üblich per App - zudem kann der Saugroboter auch über Amazons Alexa integriert werden. Ossia Cota Bislang hieß "wireless charging" meist "Ladekissen". Das soll sich nun ändern. Diese smarte Deckenkachel von Ossia soll künftig für kabellose Power-Versorgung sämtlicher Devices sorgen. Lenovo Smart Assistant Zuwachs im Bereich der persönlichen, digitalen Assistenten: Auch Lenovo will nun mitmischen und zeigt auf der CES seinen Smart-Home-Lautsprecher. Der kann beispielsweise im Web nach Infos suchen, Musik abspielen, kalenderbasierte Erinnerungen auslösen oder Listen kreieren. Smart-Home-Geräte von Drittherstellern sollen ebenfalls unterstützt werden. LG Hub Robot Das Trendthema Smart Home hat man auch bei LG verinnerlicht: Der Hub Robot – und sein kleinerer Bruder, der Hub Robot Mini – sind Hausautomatisierungs-Hub, Roboter und persönlicher Assistent in einem. Über das Display können die KI-Genossen sowohl „Emotionen“ als auch Videos abspielen. Fortress Unified Threat Management Endlich scheint Bewegung reinzukommen, wenn es um das Thema Smart-Home-Sicherheit geht. Fortress präsentiert auf der CES sein UTM-System. Das bietet nicht nur einen großen Touchscreen für Steuerung und Konfiguration, sondern auch ein Intrusion Detection und -Prevention-System, eine Firewall und Antivirus-Software für alle über WiFi, LAN und das IoT vernetzten Devices. Außerdem steht den Kunden auch ein 24-Stunden-"Instant-Response-Service" zur Verfügung. TouchLock BLE Nie wieder Schlüssel verlieren. Oder suchen. Das verspricht dieses Smartlock von Bio-key, das via Bluetooth Low Energy mit dem Smartphone gekoppelt wird. Entsperren lässt sich das Schloss nicht nur per Passworteingabe, sondern auch über den Fingerabdruckscanner (falls vorhanden). Securifi Almond 3+ Dieser Wireless Acess Point vereint WiFi- und IoT-Funktionalität. Darüber hinaus bietet der Hersteller einen Service an, mit dem Smart-Home-Geräte vor der berüchtigten Mirai-Malware geschützt sein sollen. Bitdefender Box v2 Im April 2015 stellte Bitdefender die erste Version seiner Box vor. Zweck: Vernetzte Devices vor Hackern schützen. Die auf der CES 2017 gezeigte Box v2 kommt nun mit überarbeitetem Design und neuer Technik: ein Dualcore ARM-Prozessor und 1GB RAM sorgen für Performance. Die Box überprüft mit Hilfe von Machine Learning sämtlichen Traffic im Netzwerk und darüber hinaus, ob die Gerätschaften mit ausreichend starken Passwörtern geschützt sind. Werden Unregelmäßigkeiten bemerkt, bekommen die Nutzer einen Alert per Smartphone-App. Ecovacs Unibot Der Unibot von Ecovacs Robotics ist nicht nur Saugroboter, sondern auch Luftreiniger und -befeuchter. Darüber hinaus bemerkt der Bot dank zahlreicher Sensoren auch, wenn sich (unerwünschte) Personen im Haus aufhalten. eBlocker Um die Sicherheit geht es auch bei diesem Gerät namens eBlocker. Das Teil hängt sich in Ihr Heimnetzwerk, blockt unerwünschte Ads und versteckt die IP-Adressen sämtlicher im Netzwerk befindlicher Geräte. D-Link Smart Home Kameras D-Link zeigt in Las Vegas mehrere neue Security-Kameras fürs vernetzte Zuhause. Die zeichnen sich in erster Linie durch ein erschwingliches Preisgefüge aus und sollen laut Hersteller für eine weitere Vebreitung von vernetzten Sicherheitskameras sorgen. Ring Floodlight Cam Mit dieser Smart-Home-Security-Kamera zeigt Ring auf der CES 2017 sein bislang „aggressivstes“ Produkt in diesem Bereich: Die Kombination aus Bewegungsmelder und Kamera ermöglicht die Kommunikation mit (un)gebetenen Gästen, wirft bei Bedarf 100 Dezibel feinster Sirenenklänge in Richtung Trommelfell. Die Full-HD-Kamera deckt einen Blickwinkel von 270 Grad ab und bietet auch eine Nachtsicht-Funktion. Samsung Wisenet Smartcam A1 Samsungs Wisenet-System besteht aus jeweils einer smarten Kamera für den Innen- und Außenbereich. Maximus Security Kamera Wer etwas mehr Sicherheit benötigt, der darf mit dem "Smart Motion Security Light" von Maximus im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes Licht ins Dunkel bringen. Das Device vereint Security-Kamera und Bewegungsmelder und lässt sich per App oder auch über Amazons Alexa steuern. Das integrierte Flutlicht leistet satte 2400 Lumen - genug um einen ganzen Gefängnishof auszuleuchten. TytoHome Telehealth Kit Künftig muss man wegen einer Erkältung nicht mehr zum Arzt rennen - zumindest wenn es nach TytoCare geht. Das Telehealth-Kit ermöglicht die digitale Übermittlung von Gesundheitsinformationen an den Doktor des Vertrauens. Der bekommt alle Infos in komprimierter Form - die Datenanalyse und -Übertragung übernimmt eine Smartphone-App. Zigbee DotDot Als großer Wurf für das Smart Home könnte sich die Entscheidung der ZigBee-Alliance erweisen, künftig eine einheitliche Sprache für IoT-Gerätschaften etablieren zu wollen. Diese hört auf den Namen DotDot und soll endlich dafür sorgen, dass sich Devices verschiedenster Hersteller endlich einwandfrei "verstehen". Intel Kaby Lake Chips Bereits im August 2016 hatte Intel die ersten Dualcore Kaby Lake-Chips für Notebooks enthüllt. Auf der CES kündigte der Hableiter-Riese nun ganze 40 neue Quadcore-Chips an, die für alle möglichen Zwecke (und Devices) eingesetzt werden können. Darüber hinaus unterstützen die neuen Chips auch Intels Storage-Technologie Optane. HDMI 2.1 Haben Sie gerade einen neuen Smart TV gekauft? Dann sollten Sie sich damit anfreunden, dass der schon wieder zum alten Eisen gehört. Also mehr als sonst. Denn die HDMI Licensing Group hat den neuen HDMI 2.1-Standard enthüllt. Dieser bietet nun Support für HDR, sowie 4K- und 8K-Videomaterial. Auch die neuen Audio-Codecs Dolby Atmos und DTS-X werden unterstützt. Faraday Future FF 91 Natürlich ist auch die Automotive-Branche wieder auf der CES in Las Vegas vertreten. Unter anderem Faraday Future, die einen Prototypen ihres kommenden Elektro-SUV FF 91 zeigen. Der schafft den Spurt von 0 auf 100 km/h schneller als beispielsweise ein Ferrari 458 oder das Tesla Model S. Toyota Concept-i Auch der weltgrößte Autobauer Toyota zeigt auf der CES seine Vision vom autonomen Fahren. Dabei verfolgt Toyota eine etwas andere Strategie: der Mensch soll von einem KI-Assistenten unterstützt werden. Dieser Assistent heißt im futuristischen Toyota-Konzept Yui und kommuniziert mit den Insassen zum Beispiel über Licht- und Audiosignale, aber auch über Touch. Darüber hinaus analysiert die KI auch die Aufmerksamkeit und Stimmung des Fahrers, um anschließend wertvolle Tipps zu geben. Das soll vor allem der Fahrsicherheit zu Gute kommen. Hyundai Ioniq Auch die Koreaner von Hyundai können autonom. Das beweisen sie auf der CES mit dem Ioniq. Das Fahrzeug ist in der Lage, vollständig autonom zu fahren, erkennt Lichtsignale, Kurven, andere Autos und Fußgänger über Laser-Sensoren, die die Umgebung des Autos abtasten. Die so gewonnenen Daten werden mit einer detaillierten 3D-Karte abgeglichen. Fiat Chrysler Portal Concept Fiat Chrysler zeigt auf der CES ein Concept Car namens Portal. Das soll nach Willen des Konzerns in erster Linie Millennials begeistern. Dazu bietet das Concept Car umfassende Konnektivitäts-Optionen, jede Menge flache Bildschirme und ausreichend Platz für bis zu sechs Personen. Wie bei Konzeptstudien in der Autowelt so üblich, kommt auch der Portal mit futuristischen Design-Merkmalen ums Eck. Ob diese dann beim Serienmodell umgesetzt werden können (und ob es überhaupt ein Serienmodell gibt), ist eine andere Frage. Volkswagen ID Volkswagen hat anlässlich der 50. CES eine App programmiert. Die soll den Besuchern des Messestandes ermöglichen, zu erleben "wie Mensch, Auto und Umwelt künftig im Volkswagen Ecosystem über die Volkswagen User-ID intelligent miteinander vernetzt werden." Die VW User-ID ist dabei vergleichbar mit der Apple- oder Windows-ID und ermöglicht die fahrzeugübergreifende Mitnahme persönlicher Einstellungen und Präferenzen. Intel Go Intel kündigte auf der CES seinen neuen Supercomputer für das Connected Car an. Der trägt den simplen Namen "Go", berherbergt bis zu 28 Xeon-Chips. Auch Atom- und 5G-Versionen sind geplant. Zum Einsatz kommen wird Intels Go erstmals im Rahmen eines Testlaufs in diesem Jahr. Sorgt Intel Optane für ein HDD-Revival? Klingt komisch, könnte aber tatsächlich der Fall sein - zumindest in der Anfangszeit. Die Kombination aus Optane und konventioneller HDD könnte sich aus Kostengründen lohnen, wie Pat Kannar von Dell sagt: "Ein PC mit Festplatte und Optane-Cache könnte Betriebssystem und Applikationen schneller laden als ein System, das ausschließlich auf SSDs setzt. Dazu müsste ein Image des OS und der Applikationen im Optane-Cache abgelegt werden. Das dürfte in einigen Fällen vor allen Dingen billiger als ein reines SSD-System sein." Die Kombination aus Optane-Cache und SSD-Hauptspeicher ist im Vergleich natürlich noch einmal wesentlich schneller, aber eben auch wesentlich teurer. 1968 - 2000: U-matic Bevor die VHS-Kassetten ihren Siegeszug antreten, entwickelt Sony bereits Ende der 1960er Jahre das erste Videokassetten-System namens U-Matic. In erster Linie für den Business-Markt gedacht, etablieren Sony, Panasonic und JVC U-Matic ab 1971 auch auf dem Consumer-Markt, wo es zunächst mit dem VCR-System von Grundig und Philips konkurriert. Erhältlich sind die U-Matic-Bänder in einem kompakten (und weit verbreiteten) Format mit 20 Minuten Laufzeit und als Standard-Kassetten mit bis zu 75 Minuten Laufzeit. Auch wenn U-Matic sich aufgrund der fehlenden Consumer-Akzeptanz letztlich nicht gegen VHS durchsetzen kann, bleibt das System vor allem in der Kreativ- und Medienbranche im Einsatz, bevor es Ende der 1980er vielerorts von Betacam SP abgelöst wird. 1970 - 1978: Television Electronic Disc Die beiden deutschen Elektronik-Konzerne Telefunken und Teldec schließen sich Anfang der 1970er zusammen, um dem aufkeimenden Video-Markt den Wind aus den Segeln zu nehmen. Gelingen soll das mit der Bildplatte - oder Television Electronic Disc (TED). Die Scheiben mit einem Durchmesser von etwa 20 Zentimetern fassen zur Markteinführung 1975 maximal zehn Minuten Videomaterial pro Seite. Gegen die VHS-Kassette kann sich die Bildplatte ebensowenig durchsetzen wie VCR oder Betamax. Telefunken selbst versetzt der Television Electronic Disc schließlich den Todesstoß, als man Ende 1978 beginnt, VHS-Geräte herzustellen. 1971 - 1979: VCR-Kassette Die europäische Lösung für den boomenden Videomarkt heißt 1971 VCR. Grundig und Philips entwickeln die Bandtechnologie, die sich unter anderem durch zwei Tonkanäle und eine Laufzeit von zunächst 65 Minuten auszeichnet. Auf dem Consumer-Markt ist das VCR-System durchaus erfolgreich - bis JVC mit seinem VHS-System der Durchbruch gelingt. 1979 - 1986: Video 2000 Um der wachsenden VHS-Konkurrenz Herr zu werden, versuchen Grundig und Philips 1979 mit dem VCR-Nachfolger Video 2000 im Rennen um die Video-Vorherrschaft zu punkten. Neue, beidseitig bespielbare Kassetten ermöglichen Laufzeiten von maximal 16 Stunden. Weil JVC Lizenzen zur Herstellung von VHS-Geräten jedoch deutlich günstiger vergibt, ist der "Krieg der Videoformate" Anfang der 1980er Jahre längst entschieden. 1985 beschließen Grundig und Philips, die Produktion von Video 2000-Geräten und -Datenträgern einzustellen. 1976 - 2016: Betamax Auch Sony mischt im Krieg der Videoformate mit. Mit Betamax wollen die Japaner das Rennen machen. Im Gegensatz zum von vorneherein für professionelle Anwender gedachten U-Matic-Format ist Betamax ausschließlich für den Consumer-Markt konzipiert. Betamax-Kassetten sind mit Laufzeiten von 30 bis 215 Minuten erhältlich. Von allen VHS-Konkurrenz-Formaten kann sich Betamax am längsten halten. Bis 2002 werden Abspielgeräte produziert, Betamax-Bänder sind bis heute erhältlich. Allerdings kündigt Sony Ende 2015 an, die Herstellung der Bänder zum März 2016 einzustellen. 1978 - 2001: Laserdisc Das erste optische Speichermedium für Videos kommt 1978 auf den Markt: Discovision. Die beidseitig bespielbaren Scheiben mit einem Durchmesser von circa 30 Zentimetern bieten Laufzeiten von bis zu 120 Minuten. Die Videoqualität bewegt sich bereits in etwa auf dem Level der wesentlich später eingeführten DVD. Die Firma Pioneer vermarktet die Technologie ab 1981 unter der Bezeichnung Laserdisc. Das mit analogem Video- und digitalem Audiomaterial befüllte Medium ist insbesondere in Japan sehr erfolgreich. In den USA und Europa verhindern unter anderem hohe Preise für Abspielgeräte und die Discs selbst eine hohe Verbreitung. Im Jahr 2001 erscheinen in Japan die letzten Filme auf Laserdisc - bei Cineasten und Sammlern ist das Medium bis heute sehr gefragt. 1987 - 2005: Digital Audio Tape Mit dem Digital Audio Tape (DAT) will Sony ab 1987 den Nachfolger der Audiokassette etablieren. Die Audioqualität eines DAT ist in etwa vergleichbar mit der einer Audio-CD. Als maßgebliches Verbreitungshemmnis gilt der implementierte Kopierschutz, der das einfach Kopieren eines DAT verhindert. Zudem sind DAT-Abspielgeräte im Vergleich zu Minidisc- oder CD-Playern deutlich teurer. Im professionellen Bereich kommt das Digital Audio Tape bis heute zum Einsatz - vor allem in Tonstudios und Radiostationen. 1991 - 1998: CD-i Ende 1991 versucht Philips mit dem CD-i auf dem Markt für Spielkonsolen Fuß zu fassen. Dazu kreiert man nicht nur die Konsole CD-i, sondern - in Kooperation mit Sony - auch das dazu passende Medium: die Compact Disc Interactive. Dieses Format erlaubt die Koexistenz von Audio- und Dateninhalten auf einer Compact Disc. Genutzt wird das Format in erster Linie für Lernprogramme und enorm schlechte Games. Den Massenmarkt erreicht Philips mit dem CD-i-Projekt so nicht und Gamer verschmähen das Gerät geradezu. Auch das Engagement zahlreicher Dritthersteller wie Sony, Panasonic, Grundig, Bang & Olufsen oder Kyocera - die allesamt ebenfalls CD-i-Abspielgeräte anbieten - kann das CD-Derivat nicht retten. Lediglich im Bildungssektor können CD-i-Anwendungen kleine Erfolge verbuchen. Gerüchteweise setzen einige Fahrschulen mit extrem verkrusteten Digitalitäts-Strukturen beim theoretischen Unterricht noch heute auf das CD-i. 1992 - 1996: Digital Compact CAssette Nachdem die Compact Disc die bis dahin verbreiteten Musik-Kassetten weitgehend verdrängt hat, bringen Philips und Panasonic die Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) auf den Markt. Gegenüber ihrer analogen Vorgängerin kann die DCC mit einer deutlich besseren Klangqualität punkten. Im Vergleich zu den damals aktuellen Konkurrenz-Formaten (CD, MP3, Minidisc) ist die Handhabung jedoch deutlich komplizierter. Auch im professionellen Bereich bleibt der DCC der Durchbruch versagt. 1992 - 2011: Minidisc Nachdem Sony mit dem DAT-Format auf dem Consumer-Markt scheitert, versuchen die Japaner mit der magneto-optischen Minidisc den nächsten großen Datenträger-Wurf zu landen. Bis zu 80 Minuten Audiomaterial fasst eine Minidisc, die zudem unempfindlich gegenüber Schmutz und Staub ist. In Europa und den USA kann sich der Datenträger dennoch nicht durchsetzen - zu groß ist die Konkurrenz durch CD und später MP3. In Japan ist die Minidisc hingegen ähnlich populär wie die Compact Disc in Deutschland. Bis Ende des Jahres 2011 vertreibt lediglich Sony noch MD-Abspielgeräte, bevor die Produktion schließlich endgültig eingestellt wird. 1994 - 2016: Zip-Diskette Mitte der 1990er versucht Iomega (heute Lenovo EMC) mit der Zip-Diskette den Nachfolger der Floppy Disk zu etablieren. Das Rezept scheint zunächst aufzugehen: CD-Brenner sind zu dieser Zeit unerschwinglich, die Bandbreiten verhindern die Versendung großer Datenmengen über das Internet. Die Zip-Diskette füllt diese Lücke zunächst sehr gut. Mit bis zu 750 MB Speicherkapazität lassen sich (zu dieser Zeit) astronomische Datenmengen speichern. Leider machen die zugehörigen (internen und externen) Laufwerke durch fatale Hardware-Fehler von sich reden. Günstige CD-Brenner, USB-Sticks und Speicherkarten sorgen ab der Jahrtausendwende schließlich dafür, dass die Zip-Diskette auf dem Massenmarkt keine Rolle mehr spielt. Im Einsatz sind die Datenträger allerdings bis heute: Verschiedene Unternehmen der Luftfahrtbranche nutzen die Datenträger immer noch für ihre Navigations-Datenbanken. 1996 - 2002: Smart Media Card Im Jahr 1996 steckt die Flash-Technologie noch in den Kinderschuhen. Bei Toshiba stellt man zu diesem Zeitpunkt ein neues Flash-Speichermedium vor: die Smart Media Card. Bis zu 128 MB beträgt die Kapazität der Karten, die vor allem wegen ihrer Störanfälligkeit nur eine geringe Verbreitung finden. Im Jahr 2002 bekommt der Datenträger auch noch einen - nicht minder erfolglosen - Nachfolger. 1997 - 2003: Superdisk Bevor sich die CD-ROM zum Leitmedium auf dem PC-Markt aufschwingt, konkurrieren mehrere Formate darum, die Nachfolge der guten alten Diskette anzutreten. Das von Imation und Matsushita entwickelte, Medium Superdisk besitzt eine Speicherkapazität von bis zu 240 MB. Leider sind die ersten Laufwerke fehlerbehaftet, zudem ist das Konkurrenzprodukt - die Zip-Diskette von Iomega - bereits länger auf dem Markt. Als CD-Brenner schließlich für die Massen erschwinglich werden, verschwinden beide designierte Disketten-Nachfolger vom Markt. 1999 - 2003: Clik-Diskette Auch das nächste proprietäre Speichersystem von Iomega kann sich nicht durchsetzen. Clik-Disketten fassen 40 MB Daten und zeichnen sich vor allem durch ihre Größe aus: mit einem Durchmesser von 5 Zentimetern und einem Gewicht von 15 Gramm sind die Magnetspeicher durchaus handlich - den gerade aufkommenden USB-Sticks und Speicherkarten haben sie jedoch nichts entgegenzusetzen. 1999 - 2010: Versatile Multilayer Disc Im Jahr 1999 entwickelt New Medium Enterprises die Versatile Multilayer Disc (VMD). Anfang der 2000er-Jahre soll die VMD sich schließlich gegen Blu-ray Disc und HD-DVD durchsetzen und zum DVD-Nachfolger avancieren. Mit einer Speicherkapazität von maximal 20 GB (theoretisch 100 GB) ist die VMD sowohl HD-DVD als auch Blu-ray deutlich unterlegen. Kurz vor der geplanten Markteinführung im Jahr 2007 wird es dann still um die VMD - und das hat sich bis heute nicht geändert. Seit 2010 sind sämtliche Hersteller-Websites nicht mehr erreichbar. 2002 - 2009: xD-Picture Card Die Foto-Riesen Olympus und Fujifilm tun sich im Jahr 2002 zusammen, um einen Nachfolger der glücklosen Smart Media Card zu etablieren: die xD-Picture Card. Hergestellt werden die bis zu 2 GB fassenden NAND-Flash-Karten von Toshiba und Samsung. Die Abkürzung xD steht im Übrigen für "Extreme Digital". Gegenüber einer SD-Karte ist die xD-Picture Card allerdings deutlich teurer, was wohl der Hauptgrund dafür ist, dass die xD-Karten langsam aber sicher in der Bedeutungslosigkeit versinken. 2005 - 2008: HD-DVD Im Jahr 2005 fechten zwei neue Datenträger den Kampf um die HD-Vorherrschaft und die Nachfolge der DVD aus. Zu den Unterstützern der bis zu 51 GB (Blu-ray Disc: 128 GB) fassenden HD-DVD gehören neben Toshiba, NEC, Intel und IBM auch Microsoft und HP. Als Anfang 2008 mehrere Film-Riesen (darunter Time Warner, Senator Film und das US-Pornostudio Digital Playground) ihre Untersützung für die HD-DVD einstellen, ist das Schicksal des Datenträgers besiegelt: Weitere Händler stellen den Verkauf von HD-DVDs ein, woraufhin Toshiba - das die meisten Abspielgeräte auf den Markt gebracht hatte - die Herstellung und den Vertrieb von HD-DVDs und Abspielgeräten offiziell einstellt. Der Kampf gegen die Blu-ray (forciert unter anderem von Sony, Panasonic, Pioneer, LG und Samsung) ist damit verloren. 2005 - 2011: Universal Media Disc Mit der Universal Media Disc (UMD) schafft Sony 2005 für seine gerade neu entwickelte Handheld-Konsole Playstation Portable ein eigenes Speichermedium. Die UMD erinnert optisch an die Minidisc, fasst maximal 1,8 GB Daten und dient als Medium für Spiele, Filme und Musik. Mit der nächsten Generation der tragbaren Sony-Konsole wird die UMD fallen gelassen wie die sprichwörtliche, heiße Kartoffel. Welche Betriebssysteme unterstützen Optane? Um es mit den Worten von Intel zu sagen: "Software muss angepasst werden, um effektiv mit Optane zu laufen". Die PC-Hersteller wiederum halten es für wahrscheinlich, dass Windows 10 für den Einsatz von Optane bereit ist - nicht zuletzt dank Intel Drivern und Technologien wie RST (Rapid Storage Technology), die eine optimale Nutzung der Storage-Technologie versprechen. Ob Linux und macOS Optane in einem ähnlichen "Plug and Play"-Maß unterstützen werden, bleibt hingegen fraglich. Speziell Linux ist bekannt dafür, Support für neue Technologien erst recht spät zur Verfügung zu stellen. Mit Material von IDG News Service. Uwe Müller, Head of Sales & PreSales Datacenter, ; Cisco "Der Einsatz von immer mehr Applikationen führt verstärkt zu einer dezentralen Datenhaltung, die eine dezentrale Verarbeitung erfordert. Das äußert sich beispielsweise in der Zunahme virtueller Desktops oder durch zunehmende Dezentralität von Infrastruktur-Bestandteilen." Lars Göbel, Leiter Vertrieb & IT-Services, DARZ GmbH „Steigende Anforderungen an Speicherumgebungen erfordern von Storage-Systemen auch zukünftig mehr Leistung als bisher. IT-Verantwortliche sollten daher im nächsten Jahr verstärkt auf das Thema All Flash setzen, das auch durch die zunehmende Verbreitung von SSD-Speichermedien weiter an Bedeutung gewinnt." Hans Schramm Field Product Manager Enterprise Dell bei Dell EMC "Die IT hat begonnen sich zu wandeln: von einem klassischen IT-Stack mit Applikation, Betriebssystem, Hypervisor, Server, Network und Storage hin zu konvergenten oder sogar hyperkonvergenten Strukturen. Server lassen sich als Universallösung nutzen und werden vermehrt auch im Bereich Storage eingesetzt." Stefan Roth, Head of Storage, Category Management Datacentre Central Europe, Fujitsu "Flash-Storage ist weiter auf dem Vormarsch, sowohl All-Flash als auch Hybrid-Flash. Darüber hinaus wird Software Defined Storage aufgrund der höheren Anforderungen an die Skalierbarkeit sowie größerer Komplexität und Kosten immer wichtiger werden." Florian Bettges, Category Manager Storage, Hewlett Packard Enterprise "Fortschrittliche Analytics-Anwendungen werden in immer mehr Unternehmen zu einem wichtigen Teil der Geschäftsstrategie und verändern damit grundlegend die Anforderungen, die an Storage-Lösungen gestellt werden." Jürgen A. Krebs, CTO für die Region EMEA von Hitachi Data Systems "Die wichtigsten Themen sind hier Agilität und Flexibilität. Unternehmen gehen dazu verstärkt den Weg in die (Private) Cloud. Gleichzeitig ändert sich das Kaufverhalten der Kunden. Sie wollen zunehmend klassische Investitionen (Capex) durch laufende Betriebsausgaben (Opex) ersetzen, was im Storage-Bereich verbrauchsabhängige Abrechnungsmodelle erfordert.“ Ralf Colbus, Leading Storage Professional, IBM „Wenn in Zukunft ein Service angefordert wird, wird es unwichtig sein, ob dieser on-premise oder off-premise ausgeführt wird. Ein IT-Verantwortlicher muss sich also auf Hybrid-Services ausrichten. Die Cloud wirkt dann als erweitertes Rechenzentrum." Peter Wüst, Senior Director Emerging Solutions & Innovation Group EMEA, NetApp "Flash ist Standard. Daten werden immer mehr und wichtiger und daher wird die Kompetenz im Datenmanagement wichtiger. Die sichere und einfache Verschiebung von Daten für Cloud-Workloads ist eine Anforderung an moderne Speichersysteme. Objektstorage und skalierbarer Cloudstorage (onpremise/offpremise) werden als weitere Storageklassen eingeführt. Flash ersetzt SAS als Storagetier.“ Joachim Berger, Sales Director DACH bei Nimble Storage „Wir haben in diesem Jahr eine stetig wachsende Anzahl an Unternehmen gesehen, die damit beginnen, Flash- und All-Flash-Technologien in ihre Rechenzentren zu integrieren. Diese Technologien benötigen vorausschauende Analyse-Möglichkeiten, um Ausfallzeiten auf ein Minimum zu reduzieren und für eine optimale Verfügbarkeit von Anwendungen und Daten zu sorgen.“ Thomas Muggendobler, Product Manager Storage, Thomas-Krenn AG „All-Flash-Systeme werden auch bei mittleren und größeren Kapazitäten die mechanischen Festplatten weiter verdrängen. Wir stellen vor allem fest, dass bei den Anwendern neben den stark gefallenen Anschaffungspreisen auch die deutlich niedrigeren Betriebskosten in den Fokus rücken.“ Artikel als PDF kaufen Newsletter 'Produkte+Technologien' bestellen!   comments powered by Disqus Digital Leader Award COMPUTERWOCHE und Dimension Data suchen für den Digital Leader Award die besten Digitalisierungsprojekte im Lande.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Connected Cars, 5G Technology, VR Gaming Dominated CES 2017 Posted: Jan 11 2017, 1:52am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | CES   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Not just smartphones, convertibles or cameras, it was time for ground-breaking products in 5G technology, self-driving vehicles, digital health, Artificial Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), robotics and machine learning to be showcased at the world's biggest annual electronics event here. Don't Miss: Top 100 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 Photos As CES 2017 celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, the mega electronics event was also a record-breaker in hosting more than 600 startups and more than 175,000 industry professionals -- including 55,000 from outside the US. "Our industry is helping the world improve through connectivity and innovation, touching literally every facet of our lives. Today's connected world was on full display at CES 2017 -- our largest, boldest show in history," Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, Consumer Technology Association (CTA), told IANS. The event also showcased the connected future of technology with more than 3,800 exhibiting companies and exhibit space of more than 2.6 million net square feet. "This year's show was all about connectivity -- both in the form of the technologies unveiled and in the valuable face-to-face business connections happening throughout the show," added Karen Chupka, Senior Vice President, CES and corporate business strategy, CTA. In the field of connected cars, Intel showcased a system with Microsoft Hololens (augmented reality headset) that sent signals to the Cloud via 5G and received commands from artificial intelligence (AI) servers, taking decisions for automatic driving. "What you see here is all that needs to come together for automated driving to come a reality. At the Intel automated driving experience, the car has the sensors that are collecting information and processing it to recognise everything in its surroundings," an Intel exhibitor at the booth told IANS. In a perfect vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the car could also connect with the traffic lights which, in turn, gives less traffic congestion and safe automated driving experience with very less or no accidents. "CES 2017 was a global showcase that demonstrated that we are in a new era of innovation where technology is valued not just for the devices it produces but for the experiences it makes possible," Bridget Karlin, Managing Director, IoT, at Intel, told IANS. Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Blackberry and QNX Operating Systems, Mitsubishi and Mercedes also showcased their electric and hybrid cars. The US glass manufacturing company Corning introduced a car with Corning Gorilla Glass that provided toughness with a 30 per cent decrease in the vehicle's weight. Chip manufacturer Qualcomm introduced its newest mobile platform Snapdragon 835 processor with X16 LTE modem, which will provide high performance and enhanced power efficiency. Snapdragon 835 is designed to support next-generation entertainment experiences and connected Cloud services for premium consumer and enterprise devices. The mobile platform is 35 per cent smaller in package size and consumes 25 per cent less power compared to the previous generation flagship processor Snapdragon 821. Expected to revolutionise the connected world, 5G was a major focus throughout CES. "CES 2017 was a coming out party for the future of 5G which, we estimate, will generate a net 20 million new jobs," Jim Mault, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Qualcomm Life, told IANS. Companies like Samsung, TCL and Hisense came up with 8K TVs -- with Samsung and TCL building the new platform on Quantum Dot technology that offers true RGB colour mixing, more durability and is energy efficient. Samsung also unveiled its much-awaited Gear S3 Smartwatch. While companies like Lenovo launched machines dedicated to gaming, the onus was on virtual (VR) games. Several companies launched products that support VR gaming. The show also received a huge social media momentum, including nearly 1.4 million mentions using #CES2017 hashtags.  Comments The Author Luigi Lugmayr Luigi Lugmayr (Google+) is the founding chief Editor of I4U News and brings over 15 years experience in the technology field to the ever evolving and exciting world of gadgets.

As CES 2017 celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, the mega electronics event was also a record-breaker in hosting more than 600 startups and more than 175,000 industry professionals -- including 55,000 from outside the US. "Our industry is helping the world improve through connectivity and innovation, touching literally every facet of our lives. Today's connected world was on full display at CES 2017 -- our largest, boldest show in history," Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, Consumer Technology Association (CTA), told IANS. The event also showcased the connected future of technology with more than 3,800 exhibiting companies and exhibit space of more than 2.6 million net square feet. "This year's show was all about connectivity -- both in the form of the technologies unveiled and in the valuable face-to-face business connections happening throughout the show," added Karen Chupka, Senior Vice President, CES and corporate business strategy, CTA. In the field of connected cars, Intel showcased a system with Microsoft Hololens (augmented reality headset) that sent signals to the Cloud via 5G and received commands from artificial intelligence (AI) servers, taking decisions for automatic driving. "What you see here is all that needs to come together for automated driving to come a reality. At the Intel automated driving experience, the car has the sensors that are collecting information and processing it to recognise everything in its surroundings," an Intel exhibitor at the booth told IANS. In a perfect vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the car could also connect with the traffic lights which, in turn, gives less traffic congestion and safe automated driving experience with very less or no accidents. "CES 2017 was a global showcase that demonstrated that we are in a new era of innovation where technology is valued not just for the devices it produces but for the experiences it makes possible," Bridget Karlin, Managing Director, IoT, at Intel, told IANS. Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Blackberry and QNX Operating Systems, Mitsubishi and Mercedes also showcased their electric and hybrid cars. The US glass manufacturing company Corning introduced a car with Corning Gorilla Glass that provided toughness with a 30 per cent decrease in the vehicle's weight. Chip manufacturer Qualcomm introduced its newest mobile platform Snapdragon 835 processor with X16 LTE modem, which will provide high performance and enhanced power efficiency. Snapdragon 835 is designed to support next-generation entertainment experiences and connected Cloud services for premium consumer and enterprise devices. The mobile platform is 35 per cent smaller in package size and consumes 25 per cent less power compared to the previous generation flagship processor Snapdragon 821. Expected to revolutionise the connected world, 5G was a major focus throughout CES. "CES 2017 was a coming out party for the future of 5G which, we estimate, will generate a net 20 million new jobs," Jim Mault, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Qualcomm Life, told IANS. Companies like Samsung, TCL and Hisense came up with 8K TVs -- with Samsung and TCL building the new platform on Quantum Dot technology that offers true RGB colour mixing, more durability and is energy efficient. Samsung also unveiled its much-awaited Gear S3 Smartwatch. While companies like Lenovo launched machines dedicated to gaming, the onus was on virtual (VR) games. Several companies launched products that support VR gaming. The show also received a huge social media momentum, including nearly 1.4 million mentions using #CES2017 hashtags.

You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. I saw was not here the day after the election. When Donald Trump pulled the major upset was here that night. The election doing Michelle as the night went on he could start to see things were going a certain way over the next morning with Kirk and Jerry and a my Tuesday guy here at WEEI John to mossy you were in the house. And all her wisdom body but not speak how depressed you were one point the reports were that Lenny Clarke came and there's only three microphones and studio. India says Sherry Mike's an LA just take my Mike you into the corner and laid down in. A busy in the fetal position for twenty minutes soup just in the interest of accuracy I was standing in the fetal position which is kinda hard to do when I was Poland and so I was not there that they deceit that side of the spectrum. I feel like what I'm seeing now is a 180 so. This that this report that's come out tonight folks and I'm gonna get to that at some point the problem having is that we have I won producer. It's 35 pages. There is this ridiculous. 35 page report out tonight courtesy of buzz feed. Of the reported it. Intel that Russia has on our president elect Arnold. And some of the pieces of this some of the bullet points. Are freaking. Ridiculous. They are ball urination in beds and gold intact in all the title that I'd be I'd say when I was gonna statement. Urination and beds women paid to urinate. And I've never seen him I think don't say it wages that is probably more grass problem is itself but again. So this thing is come out. And Tomas he's walking around like he's at the lottery for 66 ran out of nowhere like you weren't free money your pocket and our senior. This happy what's his name is it's on in the south that has it to be viewed that was me him but he dude zip and I like a gifted you are nurse you don't smile a lot when your house building apple does final that's very rare to smile. Here at this building but you are. Beside yourself you read these 35 now agent. Aside this was this was late Christmas present for me because I walked in I'd been listening to you guys are my ride NC obviously unit nobody gets I had heard anything. Patio today the producer like to see the latest from thing and of course without those likely know why. And it just feeds just for that people one paragraph that you very PG rated summarize which was well done by you. And I just I am I because I've probably only half true but who cares in the back half of its true. And troubled the nine and whatever and that's it and it'll just be you know more jealousy and sour grapes and whatever. And they spell the name of some company wrong and it's a clearly none of it is is verifiable. Who cares it's it's an amazing Marie well. It's it's the booster crazy details and here in the dates are sort of awfully it's June and July so I don't know. It was a present it is a report that he's presented just the last week or so CNN was the first half something tonight where he was presented with the report trump was and Brock Obama presented with a report that detailed what the Russians have this Intel the compromise the president elect and now we get this from buzz feed. Are against 35 pages the dates are all different it's I I can't possibly read through this right now well you know what there's I don't know Rangers are the summaries of the gist of it is apparently according their reporting there is a British intelligence officer meant on May be is his name involves. I was Lewis who is alleging through you know various channels whenever. That. There are trumps deep ties to Russia which revolves suspected to some level or another I think. Even the anti trump people like me always thought as I guys probably get some business dealings there whatever nothing this is alleging that. The Russian regime has been cultivating supporting and assisting him for at least five years at the direction of of Vladimir Putin. And that he has declined some real estate deals they Erica they're trying to get their hooks into they've got video of him doing salacious things in there hotels. The one that you mentioned was apparently. In the same suite that the Obama stayed in. And then he paid prostitutes to Europe if you I'll beds as a file the bed accordingly based unbearably my dramas so much. In May yet so he's been compromised Tyrus is the is the upshot of it. And map the Russians call elated and gathered all this compromising material on Hillary Clinton. That was passed along to try. Is lots more but that's edges of the gist of it is is that. Basically trump really is the Manchurian candidate and he is under the control of mother Russia. And USA. USA. And the letter dated in America I'm trying to find out exact paragraph of the urination yup that funny I don't have it in the 35 pages here and had a bout was the one that set out to be I mean it's as if that was basically. I heights from hated hates the obamas so much. That he hired women of the night to defile the bad that the obamas have slept and they and the Russians know this because that was a hotel that they had bought gas and fight and I'll tell you an idea. Or if he did needing care. As you probably didn't just gonna be that's how those things generally. So we were I would try to piece through this at some point and and I'm sure it's going to be a major major topic tonight into the overnight hours this is going to dominate the news cycle. Odd going forward I just. I did this 35 pages here so to get a good summary of you have the one thing in mind if you go here are echo though. One of which says says there are other aspects of Trump's engagement with the Russian and authorities. One which had borne fruit. Was to exploit Trump's personal obsessions and sexual perversion of course I'm sorry if we have any young listeners who might wanna turn out tonight I'll show or not it's a nighttime show and and will will global fix that magic it. In order to obtain suitable compromising material on him include the Russian word for that. Attack according to a source. Trump's perverted conduct in Moscow included. Hiring the presidential sweep of the Ritz Carlton where he knew president and mrs. Obama parentheses whom he hated yankees in any doubts. It stayed up they included that and one of their official trips to Russia be even though whom they've they got the vague they got the the word right there not to whom. I had stayed on one of their official trips to Russia. And up filing the bad they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to purple or say that I'm not gonna say it on lawyer had no trouble yet to perform and act. I in front of him. And the hotel was known to be under FSB that's the Russian version of the KGB now control of microphones and concealed cameras to recordable. So this part of a a still unverified. Reported tonight even buzz feed in their summary is calling it. A full but unverified. Yes Ralph how you would verify it is the yen may even make that point what they're saying is this report has apparently circulated. And an end up in the hands of John McCain who passed it along to. You know government officials or whatever awhile ago and they said that they Harding knew about it minority had it but it had not been publicized. I'm sure there's lots of stuff like this about lots of famous people that members he's polite today. But this witnessing lighted bags though. So expect a lot of this going forward and is you'll keep an eye on the news stations here tonight to see if people start to comment and we'll keep an I'm Donald Trump's Twitter because when Merrill Streep calls out the president elect. He fires back Woolsey if five trump is busy on his social media accounts tonight. Are responding to these unverified reports that have some. Crazy crazy details. In again their unverified. I'm 35 pages courtesy abuzz feet 6177797937. The phone number safe to say John to mossy feeling. Better today than he did it the day after with the boys in the morning god trumps. Election and eventually what are we two weeks away from a week for Friday's inauguration right nets like the toy for a it is coming. Quickly whipped like ten days away from the inauguration so yeah see. All of us let me just say this so yes I am I'm laughing about this because I think we all are but once we get past scare initial laugh it's terrify yes terrified so I'm not. I'm not I don't actually want our president QB. You know under the thumb of Russia. I don't. I don't think anyone yeah I think you stay in the job John well the obvious thing and celebrate analytically I'm not I'm not. There are some you are celebrate easy a barrister president elect yet while there are some people who would want so much dirt on the current president that they would want this to all be true about him I don't actually want this feature. Summit to future. You want the your nation board I was maybe the urination umpire but not the like Russia has been feeding him information and working and had no one nobody wants. Well we will see how what the response is from mobile sides of the the aisle here tonight we'll try to read through some of the stuff during the breaks get a better handle. What is a lengthy lengthy document. Was not or is planning on starting misses a big story here tonight which got to keep an eye on these things I wanted to start. Not only with a year column on O'Dell Beckham junior Rob Gronkowski. But to take even further kind of go in sequential order here won't get all your phone calls or promised. Go back to the treaty to mossy show on Saturday which by now you know. People are buzz a buzzing about the show was a snowstorm yet people or locked and loaded. You guys it all the big topics on Saturday I think we really only hit one topic like for four straight hours treatment but. It's a topic that's obviously game a lot of traction we got a lot of states we got spent a lot of time on the ESPN. Race relations depth debate that's gone on here for almost a week was we go tonight where. Gordon Hayward got a eight slightly above average round of applause that turned into in some circles the red carpet for a white player. And led to Bellotti Jones a particular. And it led to Israel Gutierrez and now Janelle hill. I speaking about the state of race relations in Boston and it. There's been a lot of back and forth about this and my for what our place and stuff that you guys talked about on Saturday. My frustration whiff. Some of the reaction about some from you guys on Saturday which this is sort of you know we you're. In Boston where the bad guys because we are firing back at. Amani Jones in Israel Gutierrez and Janelle hail and I'm forgetting his name now something O'Donnell Jacob Lawrence's name does he shouldn't be repeated but he also wrote a ridiculously dumb thing about the city. And I thought we spent a three days talking about it and rightfully so anger about it to the point where this is the lowest low. We're taking phone calls I'm taking phone calls from sports fans in Boston work calling in to defend themselves and say. I'm not racist I rooted for David Ortiz I reprise a top yeah like yes you should. Have to do that like that but money Jones Israel Gutierrez are so. A ridiculous in their take on this were Boston fans Cilic at that would defend themselves. Because he has PM lobs these bombs all frustrated with that and my reaction listen you guys was. On Saturday. Well Boston is racist and there is some there's some truth. My problem with the response to it in your and I understand your point like. Why are we getting killed for the response we didn't start this they did. Is when you like scream I'm not a racist I'm not a racist I'm not a races and that anger and anger and anger builds. It's not a good look you know how about turning the other cheek how about saying all caught guys there is so they can say that and you can now ought to get angry you about angry but maybe not for like five straight days because what happens is you end up real for you even if you don't mean to. In that anger stuff start and you know I mean we get collars all the time where stuff full seep in in your like this is not. This is not how I answer I guess I I'm not thinking of it from this big cultural awareness I'm thinking of it as your big picture. Your theory your body Jones Israel Gutierrez you guys are paid on ESPN you don't live in this area UConn man you carry carry a game you do a show. And you leave and enact gives you the right. Appointed a fan base because they cheered furry white player in a pre game it was crazy hot Boston is racist and don't you asked a defendant John yup on multiple levels not just this radio station but other radio stations other newspapers reach out to them. They would not respond to wit. I think you're allowed to get angry is a fan when you the ESPN guys to save that. And then never are accountable for I can never. Actions that take a step back ever really say they speak a rounded up and they insinuate. That the area is racist and it did not followed up. Should it bull crap to me is that led to the anger in the listen you guys on Saturday. You know almost makes him like it's it's our fault the sports fans because now were angry. It didn't start he hurt did commit what what what claim could they make in the in the 192017. What claimed that they make having not. Lived here that the higher Celtic families are Boston's four experienced it a racist and here's my thing it was it was completely lazy and misinformed like they left out Kevin Durant stuff they cheer for Kevin Durant. Jae Crowder informed us which I wasn't even aware of that they had cheered for DeMarcus Cousins like the same kind of thing because he's another guy who could be a tree target is that how you're doing it to me and I the the idea that wreck itself at ask about sports fans don't cheer for black players by just said the opposite I said the Celtics fans where are your caring for your bringing it up as assorted defending at a if you live here or you grow up you know the area better than anybody yet you know you know that they traded for our cheered for David Ortiz and Kevin Garnett before an idea this and I'm not even talking about that I'm saying in this specific example they were so obviously lazy and misinformed. If we're having a Sports Radio discussion of this. It's one thing I'm gonna tell you just my honest feeling about it a catcher and I know this doesn't play and radio and I understand why we did at the way we did because it's radio. But my thing is those two guys are a couple of lazy idiots in having that. And having it and don't roll your eyes at him I'm not gonna not so they have they have basically he's 8 AM this lazy take that. Nobody even knows about if we don't scream about it but we scream about it and now everybody knows about it and now it brings so this is why do think it's partly follow we bring. All of this attention on you know where not a racist city where not a racist city like. You know this station has and always have the best history when it comes to that stuff and so when we. Are pounding it pounding upon how dare you say that how dare you say that. You'd end up bringing more and more attention to and you bring people out of the woodwork who are not doing. Us or Boston any favors with their takes on it and just go on Twitter to see like go read the money Jones Twitter interactions aback kinda stuff like. This is all reality like. And so like I said I understand that. For what we do we have to react to an end you know listen I write columns for the website so I reacted things all the time I get that. But in this particular case I don't think we're doing the biggest he's got any favors. The difference is that and I give you credit for the as you write things. That. Yunel are gonna go against the fan base at times whether it is sports related race related. You are not there right things I believe Clinton's bottling also not skit there are people in town in in his Twitter culture right not LC and it's not in sports media in general. Okay that are afraid to go certain way because the reaction they might get on social media you are not one of these people. You'll write something and the next day you're on this station on mornings for middays draft and it would be defending what you wrote the agree with or not or talking about what you wrote you about the balls to do that. But money Jones can laugh and say you know and I know why Gordon Hayward got weird it was daddy won't come on to defend it and so. A lot this year I think you're saying we set on Saturday in this I I very rarely. In 2017. Yelled at my radio so congratulations. You got me to yell at my radio when you said this about Boston sports fans and how we should. Handle these blobs of racism here and is now Boston just asked them live with unfortunately this. There or not this is how we are viewed by a large portion of the country and you can fight it fight it fight it all you want. At the end you're not gonna change people's. See that's why I was at. A we're gonna fight it. Because it these are two guys are three guys are three guys and a girl selling a bad CBS sitcom on Monday night's. They have no experience in this city there a lot of lob at the fan base them and that's when you do at the stand up like I'd have more credit. If they came in and said hero my examples and here is why the city is racist state that the not even do that. So when you say at the turn the other cheek because the city at some point has had in your right about this a million years ago when it happens everywhere a history of racism. In 2017. When those guys take those lazy approaches like you take. It's their job to then I think as a columnist radio host you better be able back that up and when they can't you're pissed about it. That's not a Boston problem that is a radio host Bob that is bull crap by those are. I got a burning I the other issue that I think that was gutless of them not to defend themselves and some greater way than to just like talk about in the state space of their own show. But would you not agree that. By like day three of the feeding frenzy but there was no outside personally provide money Jones to come on what is the upside. He's gonna come on come on and I think he has claimed that. And and why. You know what's going to be more and what do you mean get screen when not at races were not races Euro all right you know you'd I mean you know don't act like you don't know. How exactly how to edit who's gonna go we know how Kirk. Tears people apart and he's very good at and that's what he would while I'm up a lot of Jones said doesn't you don't think of money Jones said over the course of 2448 hours. Didn't deserve some sort of push back from the city of Boston like I did I think absolutely it was gutless but there comes a point. Where the more you say and the more you yell about it the more you just reinforce the stereotype whether you mean to or not it's like. The old thing about protest too much I'm not racist I'm not the more you say you're not races the more you sound like you racist. But that's about how were the action is the fan base without saying anything. The action the fan base give people here in this town. Zero reason in Rodham pound I think it's a racist fan base the court here we're gonna cheer because he's white is some sort of idea that OK this is a racist group or that. David Ortiz in each year as much as he could because of the colorized skin. There's no actions here at the probe that now I mean if you wanna say it's old stereo type crabs in her life and about on Saturday crowds like the crowds have been lawyer Barry White you know if you wanna go down those and roads or they light up another crowds in baseball. We know your I thank them into an old cities I don't know much as you do outlook to see with the numbers are between the African American fans and Baltimore. And or Toronto and the city of Boston what's the difference yeah I would say we know more not less in Toronto more definitely warm Baltimore. The guys are so closely say that I and it now numbers to back that up. Like I and that's something that I would hear and nobody tells us that's not like what you're just saying it because are you get tickets and an old at a job or they wait it's on its iPods he greens. Which is something he had the nerve to say brought up that the Red Sox free agency. We're talking about race and there's thousands of money as you know what I mean when I say we just have to sort own it and Wear it like this is part of the deal that you can. Jobs like this is your bleep about it and you can get all pissed about it but this is history that we have inherited. And weaken pretend don't have a hair everything as a sports fan and Boston needed and Eric. That that the busing in Boston. It's not as we did all of that US sport expanded inherit that that happened how many yards on John out of the cities I'm talking about as a citizen of Boston and a native of Boston. This is all stuff I'm not saying that it's necessarily fair. But it's reality the reality is is this is stuff that happened in our city. That yes we had nothing to do it you know I was two years old when Mel busing crisis happened but. All that stuff is in our history and to act like. How can you even bring this up and to be indignant it's like well you know this is our history and this is what I say when I say we after. We you have to accept it after where yes you get angry about it and in your actions you can prove that it is no longer the case. But at the same time it's still there so and Damien Woody comes on a guy who played college football here in Delhi and NFL football earlier and says why nothing but the best year was balls to say always is opinion OK it's that's gonna pay a history at outlets it and because the history of off now isn't it has not won already part of it that's all part but the brown could come in and say. Well ten years before Damien not even ten years. You know. 1989 or whatever it was right before Damien Woody was a PC. I was get in light thrown on my face by the Wellesley cops you know because as a black driver and a nice car so I mean these things there are examples on both sides. I ate their examples on both sides but. He's come back to the idea that we have to turn the other cheek that's where you and I completely disagree on this I Syria coming you know didn't listen you can say the money Jones that was lazy and uninformed and ridiculous and here's why. And then they Yugo you've said your p.'s. Yeah I think it goes beyond that I think you have to because when you allow the money Jones or Israel Gutierrez to say things and it's not. It could save about you know Philadelphia unit and being a bad sports town they booed Santa Claus and they cheered Michael Irvin. It's just this thing that you say to a nation. And you say and I think there was some in certainly. Like those guys did it on purpose because they know a lot of the country feels this way that they had major headache and a I don't have ever defend myself because I'm never gonna go on I'm gonna block everyone on Twitter. Who dares disagree with me and of people wait if the Boston Globe calls and Errol calls adopt the mosque three EI dot com or Chris Curtis on the morning show. I'm not got that from myself to screw it I'll just say what I wanna say all lobbed this accusation not back it up. And ESPN in which has been so protective of their all and doesn't force those guys ever follow up on that issue that's that's frustrating I know we have to go to break let me put the brakes that don't go out and ask you this screwed up breaks in it. Light of the last week and our reaction of the whole thing in the last week. Do you think the national view of Boston in race and all that do you think it's better or worse. Bennett would have been if Rabbani Jones is set him we said the same. I think it's exactly the same I didn't think. Our reaction which has been pretty strident as that as tiny as it should have it should be. You don't think that that has impacted the national view but that is not. You know reaffirmed a lot of people's beliefs about Boston no not at all now I think as a kid in grade I the cities or what what would they say what what what did the city your boss sell these bills say it's not critical army radio host for saying something stupid he couldn't back up yeah. That reaffirms that Boston's race as you start out you start going through though like the Twitter and all that stuff with the social media I'll. I mean this is a real thing I'm sorry in today's damage I think it's every bit as stupid as you do. But it's reality but god like act it out where would he go to social media thing it's like their and I am forgetting now but the reports and Andy did the NHL players scored. An immediate it was Opel Boston fans Bruins fans called up player the Edward ball turns out. They were more or from Boston where around here and it was pretty clear that it can happen always like I have a hard time taking social media. As really being the barometer Ford. When the money Jones it'd initially on a national radio show Gutierrez stated on a TV she ago. They were able how their platform and when they are asked about it on social media the response is not without a back and forth. It was block block block nor not gonna go. So if you don't respond the way the city responded. Then these guys are allowed to say what they wanna say when in 2017. Fanned it starts with fans cheering Gordon Hayward. That is you would would admit is lazy and does not mean that the fan base here in town. Is racist towards their players react and that was right holdings I think the the anger of the response perpetuates this it's. We'll talk about this as you guys are stacked up at 61777979837. As the phone every can text and as well. 379837. UTW. Week yeah I John is here every Tuesday because unlike a money Jones. Unlike Israel Gutierrez when he writes something or is different opinion he's not afraid to commit and talk about so can you talk about this. With your thoughts as well mutt into mossy here on W media.

By Tas Bindi | January 11, 2017 -- 00:55 GMT (16:55 PST) | Topic: Innovation Seattle-based startup Mighty AI, recently rebranded from Spare5, has raised $14 million in a Series A1 round led by Intel Capital, with participation from new investors Google Ventures (GV) and Accenture Ventures. Existing investors Foundry Group, Madrona Venture Group, and New Enterprise Associates also contributed to the round. Founded in 2014, Mighty AI pays subject matter experts to fine-tune artificial intelligence (AI) engines so they can see, hear, talk, and "think" like humans. Businesses that are looking to use AI technology, but don't have the datasets required to set up effective AI software, are able to acquire the right datasets to train and scale their computer vision and natural language models.

CES 2017 recap video: Big trends, top products, and wackiest tech "In the future, we will count on AI to make every aspect of our lives better," said Mighty AI founder and CEO Matt Bencke. "But, for AI models to do all this and more, they need to understand what and how we think. Mighty AI is the critical link between computer and human cognition, putting the right humans in the right learning loops." The new funding, which adds to the $13 million previously raised by the startup, will be used to extend its so called "Training Data as a Service" platform and community of "Fives" -- a network of more than 100,000 individuals who conduct microtasks in their spare time, such as identifying and labelling objects in images or doing sentiment analysis of text. Mighty AI will also use the funding to expand its team of data scientists, engineers, and product, sales, and marketing professionals. In addition, Mighty AI has signed agreements with Intel and Accenture that will see the companies recommend and sell the startup's training data services to their customers globally. The agreement outlines that Intel and Accenture's customers will have access to: Infrastructure such as the chips Intel builds; mathematical algorithms that process large amounts of calculations in parallel to "think"; training data that turns these blank slates into simulations of human knowledge; and the application of the resulting AI models in interfaces that make it easy for people to use. "As our CEO, Brian Krzanich, has said, AI is not only the next big wave in computing; it's the next major turning point in human history," said Doug Fisher, Intel Corporation senior vice president. "Intel is investing in AI, with the goal of driving breakthrough performance while making AI solutions more accessible and easier to deploy for all ... To produce high quality data for training models to deploy, it is essential to obtain clean, accurate human annotations at scale." In addition to artificial intelligence, in November 2016, Intel Capital announced that it would be investing more than $250 million over the next two years to help make fully autonomous vehicles a reality. Krzanich said at the time that data is the new oil and pointed to several ways autonomous cars will collect data, such as cameras, radar, sonar, GPS, and LIDAR. It's projected each vehicle will generate around 4TB of data a day. "You could say oil is the key technology that allowed the automotive world we know today," Krzanich wrote in a blog post at the time. "When it comes to the car of the future and automated driving experiences, however, data is literally the new oil. Data has the potential to radically change the way we think about the driving experience." Accenture has also been increasing its focus on artificial intelligence. In May 2016, it formed a new business unit in partnership with IPsoft focused on spurring adoption of AI in the enterprise. Meanwhile, Google created a new research group dedicated to artificial intelligence in mid-2016 in line with its CEO Sundar Pichai's AI-centric strategy. In April that year, Pichai said he foresees a time when devices will completely vanish, to be replaced by omnipresent artificial intelligence, and that the company's investments in AI are preparing it for such a world.

By Nicole Rojas January 11, 2017 00:19 GMT Close Donald Trump rejects unverified reports that Russia has ‘compromising’ information IBTimesUK/Wochit Russian operatives claim they have compromising personal and financial information about President-elect Donald Trump, intel officials revealed in classified documents presented to Trump and President Barack Obama last week. The allegations partly came from memos collected by a former British intelligence operative. According to CNN, the FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of the allegations, which are based on information from Russian sources. The agency has not confirmed essential details about Trump in the memos. Four senior US intelligence chiefs — Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI DirectorJames Comey, CIA Director John Brennan and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers — presented the classified briefings to Obama and Trump. The allegations were included in a two-page synopsis appended to a report commissioned by Obama on Russia's interference in the election. Officials included the synopsis to make Trump aware that the allegations involving him were circulating around intelligence agencies, CNN reported. The synopsis also proved that Russia had information potentially damaging to both Republicans and Democrats, but chose to only release information harmful to Democrats and their nominee Hillary Clinton. Two national security officials told CNN that the synopsis also included allegations that there was a continuous exchange of information between Trump surrogates and operatives for the Russian government during the campaign. Allegations about communications between Trump's campaign and Russia prompted former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid to write to Comey in October. Earlier on Tuesday (10 January), NPR's Moscow correspondent Lucian Kim tweeted that an exiled Russian politician claimed Russia would blackmail Trump by threatening to publish proof they worked to help him win the election. Trump's transition team has not responded to requests for comments from IBTimes UK. The two-page synopsis is drawn from a 35-page compilation of memos, which have not been confirmed or verified. According to CNN, the memos began as opposition research commissioned first by anti-Trump Republicans and then Democrats. The memos, which were published in full by BuzzFeed News, have circulated as far back as last summer. While many of the memos have made the rounds among government officials, intelligence agencies and journalists for months, the US intelligence community has now found the former British intelligence operative and his source network throughout Europe to be credible enough to include in the briefings with the president and president-elect. A summary of the memos regarding Trump were also given to the top four Congressional leaders, chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees. The summary was considered so classified that it was only distributed to Obama, Trump and the eight Congressional leaders. CNN also reported that Arizona Senator John McCain gave a full copy of the memos - dated through December 2016 - to Comey on 9 December. However, national security officials said the FBI already had a set of memos compiled up to August 2016, when the former MI6 agent gave them to an FBI official in Rome.

Credit: Panasonic More like this The new faces of tablets Battle lines drawn as Chromebooks, Windows PCs renew rivalry at CES Panasonic's 5-inch 'handheld tablet' redefines tough Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Intel is phasing out Atom chips from mobile devices and has scaled back Android development for such devices. But Panasonic has come out with a new tablet with an Atom chip and Android 6.0 anyway. Panasonic's new Toughbook FZ-A2 has a starting price of $2,189, and its Atom x5-Z8550 chip is a big problem. Atom chips are almost disappearing from tablets, especially devices with Android. There are also questions about whether the Toughbook will get upgraded to the newer Android 7.0, code-named Nougat. Panasonic didn't provide a response to the query. Panasonic's release of the new Toughbook with Android is an interesting move, especially as other PC makers abandon Atom and excitement around Android tablets fade. Dell last year stopped selling Android tablets -- which had x86 chips -- and won't be delivering OS upgrades to its existing Venue devices. Last year Lenovo started offering the Atom x5-Z8550 chip in its Yoga Book 2-in-1, which can be purchased with Windows or Android. The Yoga Book is unique as it replaces a hard keyboard with a virtual keypad, much like on tablets. At the time, Lenovo had to turn to Atom as the chip was ready for Android. But now, Intel is focusing on Windows, and promoting low-power Core, Pentium, and Celeron chips for tablets and 2-in-1s. The chipmaker continues to work with Google on Chromebooks and IoT devices using the Brillo OS, which is based on Android. Most Android tablets have chips based on ARM architecture, which dominates the mobile market. Panasonic's Toughbooks are known for their rugged features. The Toughbook FZ-A2 is water resistant and can withstand a 1.2-meter (47-inch) drop. The tablet is not targeted at average users. It's for enterprise users and field workers who use tablets in harsh conditions. Panasonic also offers rugged tablets with Windows. The Toughbook FZ-A2 has a 10.1-inch screen with a 1920 x 1200 pixel resolution. The tablet offers nine hours of battery life. The battery is replaceable. With all its aging technology, the tablet is keeping up, with a USB Type-C port, a USB 3.0 port and Wi-Fi. The tablet can be bought with 4G LTE capabilities. It also has Bluetooth 4.2.  To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

It adds the first touchscreen that any Mac has had, updates to new(er) Intel processors and AMD graphics, and makes a swathe of behind-the-scenes usability changes. It's the sum total of those small changes, though — not the new processing power or the not-exactly-amazing battery life — that make the new MacBook Pro a worthwhile purchase if you're considering one. What Is It? The late-2016-into-2017 Apple MacBook Pro is the first design refresh in four years for the most powerful portable notebook that Apple currently produces. It's thinner and lighter than the now very outdated MacBook Air, aggressively abandons old connection standards in favour of USB Type-C across the board, and upgrades to a brighter and more colourful display and a much, much larger Force Touch trackpad. And, of course, it runs macOS. You're able to buy a MacBook Pro from a starting price of $2199 in Australia for an entry-level 13-inch model, which you can spec up to $2999 for the top 13-inch or as much as $4249 for the best possible 15-inch variant. That $2199 won't get you the new MacBook Pro's most talked-about feature, though; the cheapest Touch Bar-enabled MBP is $2699 in Oz. 13-inch models get a Core i5 CPU and 256GB or 512GB SSD as default, while the 15-inchers have Core i7s; you can spec any machine up to an i7 and larger SSD, though, although the best processors and 2TB SSDs are restricted to 15-inch only. The Touch Bar is an interesting compromise between a touchscreen laptop display — as seen on Apple's direct competitor from Microsoft, the Surface Book — and good ol' fashioned keyboard buttons. It replaces the old row of 12 function keys on the previous MacBook Pro with a fully customisable, touch-sensitive OLED panel with TouchID. It's still an interesting move by Apple not to make the Pro laptop touch-enabled across its entire screen, but that's a move that would require significant work on its macOS operating system as well as on the hardware level. Those USB-C ports are all multipurpose, too — you can use them all for charging, for data, or video, or any other transfer standard that USB-C supports, as long as you have the right cable or a dongle. Apple claims up to 10 hours of battery life from all of the different MacBook Pro 13- and 15-inch models in its regular wireless web browsing tests, but it's worth noting that the new 87-Watt power adapter that connects over USB-C will charge the laptop much faster than its predecessor. I'll go into detail on my varied experiences of the MacBook Pro's off-charger battery life performance later on, but I will say now that when you visit a charger to top up you'll get plenty of battery reserve back very quickly. What's It Good At? The biggest and most important updates to the new MacBook Pro, I think, aren't under the hood: they're on the outside. Most obvious is the noticeable improvement in usability that the new MacBook Pro's keyboard and trackpad bring. It's absolutely true that there's a not-exactly-shallow learning curve to using the Pro's incredibly short-travel keyboard, which it has inherited from the 12-inch retina MacBook, but once you're used to the key positioning, it's a joy to use. I can blast through emails and longer articles — like this review — at a greater speed and with greater accuracy on the MacBook Pro's keyboard than on the Logitech mechanical keyboard that I use on my desktop PC daily. The Touch Bar is an interesting development, and while it definitely feels like a first-generation device — it's not incredibly high resolution, it doesn't have bespoke controls in every app — it's also a very very smart idea. Having a fully customisable panel in front of your fingerprints means keyboard autocomplete and autocorrect is instantly as easy as it is on an iPhone, choosing an emoji from the list that pops up is simple, and apps like Photoshop that have integrated Touch Bar support do it very well. Being able to choose a colour by swiping your finger across the panel is a quantum leap over a keyboard. And the larger trackpad is equally as important. It's massive, and that helps a lot for general navigation around MacOS as well as gestures like pinching and zooming around apps like Maps. The new screen, too, is much brighter, and that's a godsend whenever you're working anywhere that you can't control the lighting within. It's two thirds brighter than the last generation at 500 nits, and that level also means it's one of the brighter easily-portable laptops out there. If you need a notebook that you can work on while you're out in a cafe, while you're sitting outside, while you're travelling on a train or a bus on the way to work in the morning, the MacBook Pro kicks ass. It supports DCI-P3 wide colour and has two thirds more contrast than the last generation, but what you need to know is that it just looks good. Being smaller and thinner and lighter means that the MacBook Pro — and remember this is a Pro, with a full-fat Intel processor and fast storage and discrete graphics on the 15-inch model, not the lightweight Core M of the 12-inch MacBook — is actually portable. It's the first iteration of the MacBook Pro that I'd actually carry to work and back with me every day, in the same way that I've been doing currently with the Surface Pro 4. You don't make the usual sacrifices of thin and light laptops, either — for example, the MacBook Pro has speakers that don't sound terrible. What's It Not Good At? Over the past couple of weeks of road-testing, the battery life of the MacBook Pro has been... mediocre. Not abysmal, but just not particularly impressive. It's understandable, though: the new MacBook Pro has more going on than the old one ever did. A lot of that comes from the extra power required by that massively bright 500-nit screen and the Touch Bar and the better backlighting of the redesigned keyboard, as well as the more powerful processor and new discrete graphics. With the screen at high brightness and wireless working away actively, I've seen battery life in the region of five hours, half of Apple's testing. For what it's worth, recharging that battery with the fast USB-C charger happens quickly. Apple's timing for the update of the MacBook Pro means that it uses Intel's sixth-generation Skylake mobile processors, rather than the seventh-generation Kaby Lake chips that are starting to appear in competitor notebooks post-CES. That's a pity, because the new chips are both more powerful and more energy-efficient. That doesn't make the MacBook Pro any less good, but it does mean that there will be competing machines from the likes of Razer and Dell and Lenovo that may have superior battery life or more outright grunt. The switch to Thunderbolt 34 and USB Type-C is a Good Thing, and I won't hear anyone else say otherwise. I'm not blinkered enough to think that it's not going to be a difficult thing, though, for anyone considering an upgrade that still has a legacy device that they need to plug in regularly. Anything with a standard USB connector will need an adapter, any non Thunderbolt 3-compatible monitor will need a converter on its cable. It's possible to upgrade other components of your setup when you buy a new MacBook, but that's just an extra cost to consider. And it's one small price to pay for the relentless march of technology, but have you noticed that the new MacBook Pro doesn't have that beautiful glowing Apple logo on the top of its lid any more? I miss it. Should You Buy It? The new MacBook Pro is, in so many ways, a huge and quantum improvement over its predecessor. It's smaller and thinner and lighter and has a brighter screen and a better keyboard and a bigger trackpad and more powerful processor and you can unlock it with your fingerprint. If you've used a MacBook Pro from the last generation or two generations ago, every one of these improvements should be useful to you in some way. But the road to the future is paved with difficulties and failures along the way. You have the potential to use the new MacBook Pro's batter faster than you could on the older models. The Touch Bar still feels like a work in progress, and you'll probably have to wait for your favourite Mac app to make the best possible use of it in the months and years to come. You'll need new cables or bulky dongles, for now at least, to use those Thunderbolt 3 ports. It's worth it, but it's not an entirely painless upgrade. This story originally appeared on Gizmodo Comments NegativeZero @negativezero Jan 13, 2017, 6:08am They're very nicely engineered laptops but are still ridiculously expensive for the hardware that's in them, and with more and more companies making well-engineered laptops in the same style that have vastly better hardware for the price, it's really hard to justify unless you're really enamored with OSX. Reply 1 luffy_luck @luffy_luck Jan 13, 2017, 9:12am I agree. The MPB are nice, but I don't have 3k laying around for this hardware. For this price I can buy a decent laptop and build a good desktop... Reply 0 NegativeZero @negativezero Jan 13, 2017, 10:25am $3599 AU for a model that actually has a discrete GPU in it, though what it has is an anemic Radeon 450. At least you don't have to drop 4 grand to get the GPU now, I guess. Reply 0 LadyVile @ladygrace Jan 13, 2017, 11:13am This is an ad not a review. Reply 0 stevothegodamneddevo Guest Jan 13, 2017, 12:53pm sorry, no! I was a long time OSX apple hardware buyer/user but having spent $3.5K on building my own PC (m.2, 1080gtx, acer predator monitor, ssd, water cooling) I will never go back to buying such outrageously priced hardware from Apple ever again. Yes, i bought a desktop, this is a laptop, but nevertheless, it is outrageous! The new un-cool will be those suckers still buying into this crap. Reply 0 stevothegodamneddevo Guest Jan 13, 2017, 1:01pm forgot to mention... if you are reading this Apple, i'll be purchasing a surface book pro... at ~$1300, that's the price point for a decent laptop for the work I do. Reply 0 rammo123 @rammo123 Jan 14, 2017, 1:35pm for anyone considering an upgrade that still has a legacy device By "legacy device" do you mean 99.99% of all devices currently on sale? I'm a long time Apple fan but they've delved waaaay to deep into dongle hell with this one. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Packing a lot of power in a small package, HP has released an updated version of its HP ZBook 15u, a mobile workstation with prices starting at $1,079. While going to a mobile form factor often means sacrificing power versus traditional desktop workstations, the ZBook 15u offers a number of high end performance features. Buyers have a choice of Intel’s Core i5 or i7 processors, up to 32GB of memory, AMD FirePro graphics chips and up to 2TB of storage. The Windows 10 Pro notebook includes a 15.6-inch FHD touch or 4K UHD non-touch display. Mobility traditionally hasn’t been a top request for engineers, designers and others users of high-powered PC workstations. “There are millions of engineers who don’t see the light of the day,” Jon Peddie, president of Peddie Research, told eWEEK. “But there are also still plenty of folks who need to get out and about like architects going to a job site or someone working on an airplane. Even being able to easily move your system from the third floor to the fifth floor for a presentation is useful.” For these users Peddie says mobile workstations like the ZBook 15u are ideal. Traditionally, Peddie says mobile workstations have been underpowered versus their desk-bound systems, or very expensive to match that power. But he says HP and its chief rival Dell now offer powerful mobile workstations at a good price. “When you think about $1,079 for the HP, gosh you can easily pay more for a MacBook,” said Peddie. For users on the go, the system includes HP Fast Charge enabling a quick recharge of up to 50 percent battery life in just 30 minutes. The ZBook 15u also includes a number of security and manageability features including the HP Sure Start Gen3 which monitors in-memory BIOS watching for rootkit malware infections, recovers the platform without intervention, restores the BIOS to a custom state, and, according to HP, and is enterprise-ready for centralized management. The unit’s embedded Trusted Platform Module (TPM), Smart Card Reader and optional Finger Print Reader are designed to help secure data, e-mail and user credentials. The mobile workstation comes preloaded with HP Remote Graphics Software for remote collaboration, HP Performance Advisor for optimal performance and HP Velocity for more reliable and fast network performance. On the reliability front, HP says it put the ZBook 15u Mobile Workstation through 120,000 hours of testing as part of the company’s Total Test Process. HP said the mobile computer is designed to pass MIL-STD 810G standards. MIL-STD 810G is a military specification required for devices to be approved for use by all departments and agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense and is often used to benchmark commercial products as well. For transferring data and connecting to other devices, the ZBook 15u includes a number of ports including a USB 3.1 Gen 1 port and DisplayPort 1.2. Options include the HP Z Turbo Drive G25, which is designed to reduce boot up, calculation, and response times when working with large files.           LATEST PC HARDWARE ARTICLES   HP Unwraps Powerful HP ZBook 15u Mobile Workstation for Professionals HP's Latest PC Lineup Includes All-in-One Model With Curved Screen Dell, HP, Toshiba Roll Out Windows 10 Ultraportable PCs at CES 2017 Windows on ARM Chips Poses New Potential Challenge to Chromebooks RCA Shows New 17-inch Tablet, Smartphones at CES 2017                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

In an interview, Biden said neither he nor Obama asked U.S. intelligence agencies to try to corroborate the unverified claims that Russia had obtained compromising sexual and financial allegations about Trump. "I think it's something that obviously the agency thinks they have to track down," Biden said. He added later, "It surprised me in that it made it to the point where the agency, the FBI thought they had to pursue it." Vice President Joe Biden gestures while speaking at a ceremony honoring 15 Detroit entrepreneurs, Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017, in Detroit. The entrepreneurs earned Motor City Match grants to open or expand their business in the city. Biden joined Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan as Motor City Match awards $600,000 in grants to 15 new & growing Detroit businesses. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) In the hourlong session with The Associated Press and other news outlets, the vice president was sharply critical of Trump for publicly disparaging intelligence officials, saying Trump was damaging U.S. standing and playing into Russia's hands. He also took umbrage at Trump's comments accusing intelligence agencies of allowing the information to leak publicly and drawing a comparison to "living in Nazi Germany." "The one thing you never want to invoke is Nazi Germany, no matter what the circumstances," Biden said. "It's an overwhelming diversion from the point you're trying to make." Biden said that in the briefing he and Obama received from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and others, there were "no conclusions drawn" from the uncorroborated dossier, which was produced in August and then released publicly this week by the media. Biden said it was "totally ancillary" to the purpose of the meeting, which was to brief Obama on a report he ordered documenting Russian interference in the U.S. campaign. "As a matter of fact, the president was like, 'What does this have anything to do with anything?'" Biden said. He said intelligence leaders responded by saying "Well, we feel obliged to tell you, Mr. President, because you may hear about it. We're going to tell him," referring to Trump. Biden said intelligence leaders told him and Obama that they couldn't say whether or not the allegations were true or untrue. He said there was "hardly any discussion" about the allegations in the briefing. "Neither the president nor I asked for any detail," Biden said. But he added of the dossier: "I've read everything." Trump has vehemently denied the allegations included in a dossier about close coordination between Trump's inner circle and Russians. The dossier also included unsubstantiated claims about unusual sexual activities by Trump, attributed to anonymous sources. The Associated Press has not authenticated the claims. Trump has denied them. The FBI has been working to corroborate the details in the dossier, although it's unclear how long that investigation has been running or how many resources are assigned. FBI Director James Comey has declined even to acknowledge the investigation publicly in line with FBI protocol. The dossier was compiled by a former Western intelligence operative and had been circulating among news organizations and intelligence agencies in Washington for months. Its existence became known publicly following reports the intelligence community had briefed Trump on the dossier. In the interview, Biden criticized Trump's rocky relationship with intelligence officials. The president-elect has publicly challenged their assessment about Russia's role in the election and suggested they have skewed evidence. Trump has received the President's Daily Brief, the highest-level intelligence document produced in the United States, a few times but has insisted he doesn't need it daily and suggested he knows more than intelligence leaders. Biden said it would be a "genuine tragedy" if Trump refused the daily intelligence briefing presidents traditionally receive. To illustrate his point, Biden took out the black tablet computer he uses to read his daily briefing and showed it to reporters as he sat next to a crackling fireplace in his office, just steps from the Oval Office. He said it is password-protected and includes a feature he uses to ask questions about the intelligence that are responded to the same day. Biden said at least five foreign leaders have already contacted him expressing concern over Trump's second-guessing of U.S. intelligence agencies. "It is really very damaging in my view to our standing in the world for a president to take one of the crown jewels of our national defense and denigrate it," Biden said. "It plays into, particularly now, the Russian narrative that America doesn't know what it's doing." After nearly half a century in public office, Biden will exit the national stage next Friday, although he plans to stay active in Democratic politics and work on policy issues at a pair of institutes he's developing at the University of Delaware and the University of Pennsylvania. He also plans to continue with the cancer "moonshot" effort he launched after his son died. Biden was full of praise for his successor, Vice President-elect Mike Pence. He said he's been sending Pence memos with his advice on how to handle certain relationships, such as with Iraqi and Ukrainian leaders, and on "the things that could explode most easily." He said Pence had been receptive to his advice but had less time these days to speak to Biden due to the heavy role he's playing in setting up Trump's administration. Biden said he's made his national security adviser, Colin Kahl, available to Pence but hoped Pence would quickly name a national security adviser of his own. "It would be better if they had been in a better position where he actually had somebody that Colin could sit down with every morning," Biden said. ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP In this Jan. 11, 2017, photo, President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. The outgoing president somberly ruminated about the fragility of democracy and earnestly implored Americans to reject corrosive political dialogue. Fourteen hours later, the incoming president staged a defiant and frenetic news conference at his gilded New York City tower, dismissing critics, insulting reporters and likening the country¿s intelligence officers to Nazis.

Eurocom, a developer of upgradable notebooks, has refreshed its Tornado F5 notebook with the latest Intel Core processors. Since it's in the upgrading mood, the company also took the opportunity to add Nvidia's top-end graphics cards to the mix. The new processor options for the Tornado F5 include Intel's Core i7-7700K, Core i7-7700, and Core i5-7600K units. Those two unlocked K-series CPUs might seem like odd choices for a notebook, but Eurocom lets users mess with the overclocking options in the UEFI. For graphics horsepower, buyers can fill the machine's MXM 3.0 graphics slot with Nvidia's GTX 1060, GTX 1070, and GTX 1080 cards, or go retro with the previous-generation GTX 970M or GTX 980M. Those components fit into a 15.6" laptop that's 1.59" (4 cm) thick and weighs 6.5 lbs (or 2.9 kg). The base model of the Tornado F5 comes with a 1920x1080 display, upgradeable to a 4K monitor for an additional $100. Both displays support Nvidia's G-Sync technology. The notebook has four memory slots that can take as much as 64GB of DDR4 clocked as high as 3200 MT/s. For storage, the Tornado F5 has two M.2 slots and room for a 2.5", 9.5-mm-tall drive. Prices for Eurocom's Tornado F5 can vary quite a bit based on its many configuration options, but go as low as $1,330 for a model with a Core i5-7600K and a GTX 970M. A model with a Core I7-7700K and a GTX 1070 can be had for just about $2,000.   Tags: CPUs Graphics Mobile computing User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani will advise President-elect Donald Trump on private-sector cybersecurity, the president-elect’s transition office said Thursday. Giuliani’s appointment comes one day after Trump doubled down on a pledge to launch a 90-day cyber review immediately after he takes office. It’s not clear who will lead that review or if it will be focused solely on government or will include critical infrastructure sectors or the broader private sector. Trump has suggested at various times both the Pentagon and the intelligence community will play a role. » Get the best federal technology news and ideas delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here. The president-elect argued in a press conference Wednesday the U.S. government has “no defense” against cyberattacks and is “run by people that don’t know what they’re doing.” Giuliani “will be sharing his expertise and insight as a trusted friend concerning private-sector cyber security problems and emerging solutions developing in the private sector,” according to a statement from the transition team. Giuliani was an avid supporter of Trump during the campaign. Trump will also be hosting occasional meetings with senior corporate executives to discuss “hacking, intrusions, disruptions, manipulations, theft of data and identities, and securing information technology infrastructure,” according to the release. Those meetings will not result in a formal report or consensus, the transition team said. It’s unclear from the announcement whether Giuliani will be leading the meetings. One goal of Giuliani’s work will be to prioritize cyber vulnerabilities based on input from the private sector and “solve those important ones first, and bring to the president and to his administration the things the private sector are doing,” he told reporters after the announcement. “It’s as if our offense has gotten way ahead of our defense," Giuliani said. “The president-elect is very much aware of this." Giuliani compared the group’s goal as bringing together cancer researchers from various places to work together on a cure. He described Russia’s hacking of Democratic political organizations, which intelligence officials say were aimed at boosting Trump’s electoral chances, as “obviously very notorious,” but part of a wider slate of cyber threats from China, Iran, North Korea and criminal networks. Giuliani is CEO of Giuliani Partners, an international security consulting firm that does cyber work, and is on leave from a position as chair of the cybersecurity, privacy and crisis management practice at the Greenberg Traurig law firm. Giuliani Partners recently announced a deal with BlackBerry to use software developed by the mobile phone company to assess the cybersecurity of government and corporate clients. BlackBerry was long the leader in supplying mobile devices to government, but its popularity has waned in recent years, partly because of concerns about the company’s long-term financial stability. “As the use of modern communications and technology has moved forward at unparalleled speed the necessary defenses have lagged behind,” Trump’s transition team said. “The president-elect recognizes that this needs immediate attention and input from private sector leaders to help the government plan to make us more secure.” recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT Remove Cloud IT “Blind Spots” with Application Visibility Data Analytics Bring Transportation Infrastructure into the Future Agile, OSS and Cloud Strengthen Government’s Mission This Database Can Help Government Transition FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    President-elect Donald Trump was "very happy" to hear from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on Wednesday night, and to hear the Intel chief agrees there should be no leaks occurring, incoming presidential counsel Kellyanne Conway said Thursday. "Why intelligence officials or other people are leaking to the media, rather than making sure that the president-elect and President [Barack] Obama himself, are briefed on sensitive information, I think is really the point here," Conway told NBC's "Today" anchor Matt Lauer, while refusing to comment about whether she herself believes a negative report alleging Trump's ties with Russia came from the intelligence community. "What I believe doesn't matter," Conway said. "Here's what does matter: What matters is that the president-elect had a briefing by the four top intelligence officers in our nation last week. We were very happy to receive them here at Trump Tower and for the president-elect and vice president-elect to get that briefing. No sooner do they have that, people are leaking information." Clapper, she continued, has emphasized the intelligence community is giving "no credibility and voracity to the fake news documents, and that's important here." However, she did not answer directly whether Trump believes Clapper's comments. "You'll have to ask him what he believes," Conway said. "What he believes is we are at a fraught time that we have leaks of sensitive information on political purposes. We agree, as do all Americans, that's dangerous stuff. Our hands are tied because we can't discuss private, sensitive information. And yet, others are doing it." Conway also discussed Trump's plans for his businesses, saying Thursday "legal experts are happy with what he's doing," and he is making "enormous sacrifices. The holdings of this successful businessman, over decades is unprecedented for our presidency." Trump, she said, will step away from all to do with the Trump Organization, but Lauer said Trump is making it sound "like his plan of avoiding conflict of interest is 'trust me.'" "That's not fair at all," she told Lauer. "He had his lawyer up there yesterday. Anybody can pull the information. She read the whole statement publicly. "Why always the presumptive negativity against Mr. Trump when he is trying to comply with the law and satisfy any ethics concerns that people have? He is making an enormous sacrifice here." MSNBC chief legal correspondent Ari Melber, also on the program, said he does not think Conway was being accurate by saying people are being presumptively negative. "I have never as a lawyer or a reporter, heard of a concept you would take something bad like a gift, and say you will accept it, process it, and donate it later," Melber said. "If it's bad, don't take it. "If it's not bad, if that's their argument, this is normal business, fair market value, they shouldn't have to donate it in the first place. We don't know who Donald Trump owes. He comes to Washington owing no one." Trump should release his tax returns and information about all outstanding debts, Melber continued, and he thinks Trump's plan to add an ethics adviser is "meaningless." "This is a person that would be hired and fired by Donald Trump," Melber said. "The Office of Government Ethics does exist as a different layer, and there's lawyers at the Justice Department more independent. We're seeing not any collaboration with them, as past presidential administrations have done."

The Intel Community Has It Rachel Stoltzfoos Reporter 10:44 AM 01/12/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP   Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina November 8, 2016. REUTERS/Chris Keane    5418707 U.S. intelligence officials included a “disinformation” report on the Clinton Foundation in briefing materials prepared for Donald Trump, but unlike the explosive allegations against Trump, that batch of rumors has not made it into the press. Intel briefers included the documents on both Trump and Clinton in the briefing materials they prepared regarding Russian meddling in the election, reports NBC News. Although neither document made it into an oral briefing to Trump, the briefers wanted them available in order to contrast analyzed intelligence with unverified “disinformation” campaigns. While the dossier of explosive rumors regarding Russian dirt on Trump made it into print Wednesday, little is publicly known about the unsubstantiated allegations regarding the Clinton Foundation. News the FBI opened investigations into both the Clinton Foundation and Trump’s alleged ties with Russia came to light during the presidential campaign. The dossier on Trump was compiled by a former British spy who was paid by both Republicans and Democrats to dig up dirt regarding Trump and Russia. The salacious report made the rounds in Washington and was brought to the attention of the U.S. intelligence community, but neither the intel community nor motivated journalists were able to verify any of its claims. Journalists held off on writing about the dossier, since it was totally unsubstantiated, until CNN used news of its inclusion in the briefing materials Tuesday to bring it to public attention. Buzzfeed then published the full document, and a flurry of damaging headlines for Trump followed in The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and other prominent news outlets. Totally lost in the furor over these reports, however, is talk of the Clinton Foundation dossier. Its existence alongside that of the Trump document further derails the narrative first constructed by CNN that the intel community is worried in particular about the explosive allegations against Trump. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper decried leaks to the press from the top secret briefing in a statement Wednesday, and said categorically the intelligence community has not made a judgment as to the veracity of the Trump dossier. “We did not rely upon [the dossier] in any way for our conclusions,” Clapper said, also putting into question CNN’s report that it was used by intel officials to justify their conclusion that Putin wanted Trump to win.

This is the all new ASRock Z270 Gaming K6 Fatal1ty edition with nice black/red looks and an AURA RGB LED system that can be controlled from the EUFI BIOS. ASRock enhanced a thing or two on this motherboard, including an easier to tweak environment, dual M2 slots, enhanced audio and two Gigabit jacks from Intel. Kaby Lake processors for the desktop platform have been released and even though you'd think it is an all new chip, it is however merely a respin seen from Skylake, meaning both series processors are Socket 1151. This also means that IF you are in the market for a new series 7000 processor, your H170 or Z170 motherboard can be compatible with Kaby Lake after a motherboard BIOS upgrade. The new series Kaby Lake processors are fairly energy efficient, still as powerful as they have been for years. If you are interested in new technologies like Intel Optane, you will however need to upgrade to a Z270 and H270 range motherboard. This new Z270 platform offers supports for Optane SSDs and offers supports for slightly faster DDR4 memory.      As you are going to find out, Gaming K6 Fatal1ty edition proper looking motherboard with black and red color elements. The motherboard has been fitted with the latest that technology can house like up-to 3866+ MHZ XMP DDR4 memory, the fastest NVMe PCIe and M.2. storage unit support (two of them) and some really nice looks.  The K6 thus comes with two M.2. slot. The steel armored PCIe slots pop out, and ASRock improved on the Realtek 1220 audio codec by using Nichicon capacitors for this 7.1 channel audio ready setup, as well as a Creative Labs Sound Blaster Cinema 3 software suite bringing a 120 dB SNR to this platform.       Much like pretty much all other motherboard anno 2017, RGB LEDs are here as well. ASrock once again did it clever though, no nagging forced to load up software in windows, no you can control it from the BIOS.

This new lineup of quad-core Ryzen CPUs also has disabled multi-threading. In addition, these AMD Ryzen processors are the company’s entry-level CPUs that aimed to take on Intel’s i3 and i5 CPUs on the desktop. AMD Ryzen CPU: An Affordable Quad-Core, Unlocked, 45W CPU Despite being placed in the entry-level tier of Ryzen processors, these quad-core CPUs are still similar to their high-end brethren. These entry-level CPUs are going have an unlocked multiplier, as well as full support for overclocking using an X370 and B350 chipset. It is important to realize that B350 and X370 chipset are both AM4 motherboards. Hence, these CPU lineup is expected to be the most potent gaming chips in their tier. Intel’s entire i3 and i5 lineups cannot be overclocked due to their locked multiplier. And this is where the entry-level AMD Ryzen CPU comes in. AMD Ryzen CPU Efficiency When it comes to power efficiency, these quad-core Ryzen CPUs are expected to be very efficient at around 45 watts. In addition, these processors will sport a base clock speed of 3.4GHz or even higher. At the present time, it’s not clear whether AMD will offer eight core and six core Ryzen CPUs with simultaneous multi-threading disabled. Furthermore, reports suggest that the company won’t be offering any Ryzen SKU with less than four cores. Hence, this would give the consumer the best value for their money. AMD Ryzen CPU Release Date The said processor lineup is expected to hit the shelves before March 3, according to a report from the website Anandtech. This is a very good news for the people who are looking forward to AMD’s latest processors. Additionally, AMD’s new processors should hopefully bring competition in the CPU market.

Several of these shifts have happened at Las Vegas’ annual CES trade show, offering hints of what we’ll see in the coming year. But at CES 2017, some of the most important VR projects were downright unpleasant — and that may not be a bad thing. In the fall of 2016, Microsoft VP Terry Myerson took a pointed swipe at the year’s freshly released batch of virtual reality headsets, casually dubbing them “less immersive accessories” compared with a new Microsoft project. Why? Because, Myerson claimed, Microsoft had perfected inside-out tracking: a nascent technology that could make VR vastly more convenient and accessible, by getting rid of external tracking systems. Now, inside-out tracking seems set to become the big VR trend of the year, though it might still make you a little dizzy. Inside-out tracking isn’t just a geeky specs bump; in fact, it could be one of virtual reality’s great equalizers. High-end headsets currently use external cameras or sensor setups to let people move around in VR. More affordable mobile systems, meanwhile, have no positional tracking at all. Inside-out tracking inverts the traditional setup: you put sensors on the headset itself, and they read cues like depth and acceleration, translating it into virtual motion. So high-end users wouldn’t need a camera-studded VR room, and mobile users could do far more with their headsets; they might even get less motion-sick in the process. In order to prepare for a big leap forward, VR had to take a step back Unsurprisingly, Microsoft wasn’t the only company interested; Oculus, for example, had already introduced an inside-out prototype called Santa Cruz. And at CES last week, the idea seemed to be taking off in earnest. Chip maker Qualcomm featured inside-out tracking on mobile headsets with a Power Rangers movie tie-in. Intel showcased it in a new version of its “merged reality” headset Project Alloy. Smaller companies like Pico and uSens appeared with everything from algorithms to near-finished hardware. A handful of major manufacturers, including Lenovo and Asus, revealed VR headsets they’d been working on with Microsoft. Many of these products are set for release later this year, making them more than an early experiment. But in order to prepare for a big leap forward, virtual reality had to take a few steps back — to the days of clunky prototypes and rough tech demos. Qualcomm’s tracked mobile headset For all their flaws, existing high-end VR systems are great at creating small worlds you can walk around naturally. But self-tracking headsets often haven’t reached that point. Unfortunately, making a VR headset that works on its own in an ordinary room is tough. It’s one thing for an external camera to find an LED embedded in the Oculus Rift, or for sensors on a headset to pick up on clear external markers. (The Vive actually uses inside-out tracking, but it only works with two carefully placed laser towers in the area, which doesn’t offer much freedom.) It’s another to have a computer look at the world and calculate position based on nebulous signals like depth and acceleration, without a fixed point of reference. “It’s like the invention of the mouse.” Still, for Youssri Helmy, CEO of machine vision company Eonite, inside-out tracking is a non-negotiable part of VR’s future. “It’s got to happen,” he says. “We think it's crucial. It's like the invention of the mouse with the GUI.” At CES, Eonite demonstrated 3D mapping software that headset makers can use to add inside-out tracking, as long as they include a depth sensor and motion-detecting inertial measurement unit (IMU). Helmy thinks that this kind of tracking is almost always preferable to external systems — “We as humans are inside-out only, right?” he quips when I ask about it. Eonite’s CES demo was innovative, but limited. Using sensors taped to an HTC Vive — without the laser tracking boxes — I could walk around a living room with the same rough dimensions and furniture placement as the real hotel suite. If I looked straight ahead at the walls, it felt almost as good as normal Vive tracking. If I looked down at the floor, though, the headset would lose its place and jolt me several meters away. Helmy says the demo was using a narrower-than-usual camera — something with a wider field of view would have solved the problem. But it was part of a running theme at the show: every inside-out, work-anywhere tracking system I tried involved some kind of awkward and revealing compromise. Eonite on an HTC Vive The three companies that seem best poised to crack inside-out tracking are ones that didn’t actually show it off at CES: Oculus, Microsoft, and Google. Oculus’ self-contained headset is the best I’ve ever tried; whether because of technical prowess or just well-controlled demo conditions, I never felt like I was sacrificing performance for freedom. Microsoft put excellent room-mapping capabilities into HoloLens, so it’s in a strong position to do the same for VR. And at CES, Google announced the first phone that includes both Tango depth sensing cameras and Daydream virtual reality, two systems that seem fated to merge. But Microsoft’s partners didn’t let anyone turn on the headsets they showcased, and Oculus sat CES out almost entirely. Google emphasized that its augmented and virtual reality elements “do not overlap or integrate” in current phones. The fact that these companies didn’t demo inside-out tracking last week could suggest that it’s still not ready for the public. And doing VR tracking badly can be worse than not doing it at all. Perhaps the most ambitious and best-performing new headset at CES was Intel’s third-generation Project Alloy, which is supposed to mix real-world elements with virtual ones. We’ve seen some creative proofs of concept on Alloy, going far beyond ordinary VR. At CES, its RealSense cameras also came close to matching the Rift or Vive. The whole thing is wireless, and setup just requires scanning the room with Alloy’s camera beforehand. But in exchange for Alloy’s free movement and lack of unwieldy wires, I had to give up my hands. Instead of fully tracked motion controllers like the Rift or Vive’s, I got a remote that rotated in place, imitating a gun. I could shoot fine, but it destroyed the illusion of having virtual arms. The headset could theoretically do full motion tracking, but only if my hands were in view of the cameras. uSens inside-out tracking at CES Where Intel showed off a wireless high-end VR alternative, Qualcomm was taking VR to the lower end, with mixed results. My first experience with its phone-based prototype was exciting, but fairly bad. I could move around a simple virtual rendering of Zordon’s cave from Power Rangers, but when I leaned forward, the world just spun around me, as if it wasn’t sure what I was trying to do. I’d take a few steps, and the cave would slide to match my position. Nothing was jittery or blurry in the demo, but the world didn’t feel real either, especially compared to the sophisticated Vive experiments I’d been playing at HTC’s booth a few hours earlier. I lost my hand to a wedding ring Qualcomm later said that the problem was low lighting conditions, and it worked better in a show floor demo, not the cocktail party where I initially tried it. But it still had trouble picking up on small movements, which are important for preventing nausea or playing games. The same thing happened with a headset from Pico — the hardware looked great, but its demo made me dodge lasers and spike traps in a virtual body that always felt out of sync with my real one, until I finally gave up, slightly disoriented. And occasionally, a company aims to solve far more tracking problems than it can handle. uSens, creator of the Impression Pi headset, came to CES with a demo that combined augmented reality, inside-out tracking, and hand controls: you could pick up objects in a totally virtual environment, then use a hand gesture to open a portal to the real world, all while walking around with no external trackers. But movement was ponderous, gestures were awkward, and my left hand kept disappearing, apparently because my wedding ring reflection confounded uSens’ sensors. Like Eonite, uSens is primarily selling software. “We want something that is a comprehensive solution that works across the different types of devices that people bring home,” says uSens market strategist Raj Rao, hence the combination of features. Even if it’s far from perfect now, Rao says that machine learning will improve the algorithm as more data points come in — including, presumably, my overly glittery hand. Even if nobody’s created the perfect self-tracking headset, though, it’s one of the most obvious leaps that virtual reality — especially mobile VR — can make this year. The first generation of headsets is already on the shelves, and owners may not want to upgrade just for a higher-resolution screen or slightly better performance. But they might be sold on ditching their external cameras, or getting a mobile device with a major new feature. Meanwhile, people who wrote VR off as either too inconvenient or too limited could give it another look. If CES is any indication, lots of companies will be making that pitch in the coming months. Right now, they just need the hardware and software to back it up.

Published on January 12, 2017. Most Popular Intel Corp. is kicking off its second Super Bowl appearance since 2010 and using Tom Brady to do it. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based technology company will air a 30-second spot starring the Patriots quarterback between the first and second quarters. The ad (above) is the first pre-released Super Bowl spot of the season. The commercial touts Intel's 360 replay technology which offers a full, 360-degree look at key moments in sports, by featuring could-be-epic actions like Mr. Brady yawning, brushing his teeth and eating pancakes off the floor as music swells off-camera. The 360-technology will also be used during Fox's broadcast for the second year in a row. "We're not just marketing to the biggest TV audience, we're marketing and advertising the technology that connects to our brand story and promise," said Steve Fund, senior VP-chief marketing officer at Intel. "Intel makes amazing experiences possible and is directing people to look for that technology in the game itself." Related Stories Jim Parsons Continues to Rave About Intel: It's Last Night's New Ads See the Spot: Intel Enlists Michael Phelps to Sink Slow Computers Intel Taps TBWA/Chiat/Day for Global B-to-B Creative How Intel Is Helping to Solve the Declining Bee Problem The 49-year-old company, which has been rebranding itself to consumers with innovative initiatives like a tech-infused, groundbreaking Grammys performance by Lady Gaga, last advertised in the Super Bowl seven years ago. Mr. Brady follows in the spokesman footsteps of swimmer Michael Phelps who appeared in a campaign last year. The quarterback has also recently appeared in ads from Footlocker and Under Armour. Mr. Fund noted that consumers can expect to see more athletes in Intel's future marketing. "Aligning ourselves with sports and a sports personality is a great way to bring to life this idea of performance," he said. Intel worked with McGarryBowen on the campaign; a social endeavor that compiles user-generated videos will be handled internally and released by video on Feb. 5. A 30-second spot in Super Bowl LI is costing marketers around $5 million this year, according to reports. In 2015, Intel spent $88.9 million on measured media in the U.S., according to Kantar Media.

Using proprietary algorithms to analyze U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data, IFI CLAIMS accurately ranks global patent assignees by number of utility patents received each calendar year. 2016 saw 304,126 utility patent grants, the most on record in a single year, according to IFI CLAIMS. IBM again holds the #1 slot, which it has for 24 consecutive years, with 8,088 patents—up nearly 10 percent over 2015 and the most any company has ever acquired in a calendar year. The other Top 5 recipients remain unchanged from 2015 with Samsung at #2, Canon at #3, Qualcomm at #4, and Google again at #5. All of the patents generated by the IFI CLAIMS Top 50 are attributable to just 11 countries. The U.S. holds 41 percent of those patent counts followed by Japan at 28 percent; South Korea at 15 percent; Taiwan at 4 percent; Germany at 2.6 percent and China at 2.5 percent. At 17 each, the U.S. and Japan are tied for the most assignees in the Top 50. Asian companies, however, now represent 50 percent of the total Top 50 counts and occupy 26 slots. Japan has long been a dominant player in the U.S. ranking, but according to IFI’s 2016 U.S. Patent Trends & Insights, its patent activity appears to be shrinking a bit this year with 12 of its 17 Top 50 firms reporting patent count decreases compared to 2015. IFI data show that Brother, Canon, Denso, FUJIFILM, Honda, Panasonic, Ricoh, SELC, Sharp, Sony, Toshiba and Toyota all saw decreases. Fueled by IBM and a host of West Coast tech companies, the U.S. saw patent increases from 10 of its 17 firms on the list including Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Boeing, Cisco, Ford, IBM, Intel, Microsoft and Texas Instruments. Interestingly, Apple increased counts but remained at #11. Unchanged at 2835 grants, Google still held onto #5 with #6 Intel close on its heels by only 51 patents. “Although it was a bit of a down year for Japan, Asia as a whole continues to make impressive gains with U.S. patents,” said Mike Baycroft, CEO, IFI CLAIMS Patent Services. “American tech companies are similarly motivated but it will be interesting to see how this path plays out in five or ten years. At this rate, South Korea, China and Taiwan will likely capture an even larger share of the U.S. patent market.” Big gainers in 2016 include Nokia, up 74%; Hyundai up 39%; China’s Huawei Technologies, up 50%; Amazon, up 46%; and Intel, up 36% over 2015. The biggest mover, according to Larry Cady, Senior Analyst, IFI CLAIMS Patent Services, is #22 GlobalFoundries, up from #60 with an impressive 131 percent gain over 2015. Registered in the Cayman Islands with operations in Santa Clara, Calif., GlobalFoundries gained patent momentum from recent IBM semiconductor acquisitions to achieve 1,407 utility grants in 2016 compared to 609 in 2015. The company also provides free online access to the IFI CLAIMS Top 1,000 rankings, a multi-year analysis of the global patentees that receive the most U.S. utility grants. One of the oldest and most trusted patent analysis firms, IFI CLAIMS Patent Services is known throughout the world as the gold standard tabulator of U.S. and global patents.

Intel started offering Next Unit of Computing (NUC) mini desktop computers back in 2013 when we got a Sandy Bridge Celeron model using HD Graphics 2000. Things have moved on quite a way since then in terms of performance, connectivity, and even the size of more recent NUCs. But one thing NUCs have always been is a little bit expensive when compared to similar tiny PC offerings from other manufacturers. The latest NUC may change that perception somewhat. As The NUC Blog reports, listings have started appearing for the Intel NUC6CAYS, which is a preconfigured NUC using a 10W Apollo Lake quad-core Celeron processor running at 1.5GHz with HD Graphics 500. It is paired with 2GB of DDR3L-1600 RAM, a 32GB eMMC flash drive, and a copy of Windows 10 Home. The price? Only $232. Considering Windows 10 Home typically costs around $85 when bought separately, that's quite a cheap NUC. Yes, the storage and RAM is lacking, but then both are upgradeable. RAM can be increased to a much more respectable 8GB (a cost of roughly $40), and there's a 2.5-inch drive bay which will hold a 9.5mm hard drive or SSD and connects via SATA (6GB/s). So that's around $60 for a 1TB hard drive or maybe spend $70 and get a 240GB SSD depending on your needs. Related Intel Unveils Kaby Lake Processors for Desktops, Workstations Intel Unveils Kaby Lake Processors for Desktops, Workstations Other key features of this NUC include a Gigabit Ethernet port, 802.11ac dual band wireless, HDMI 2.0 and VGA, four USB 3.0 ports, three USB 2.0 ports, and a stereo microphone/headphone jack. Intel will also be releasing a barebones version of this NUC, which will obviously be cheaper. How much cheaper we don't know ($170 maybe?), but if you plan on running Windows 10 anyway, the preconfigured NUC6CAYS may end up being the cheaper option.

"Made up, phony facts.Too bad!" the president-elect tweeted. James Clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated. Made up, phony facts.Too bad!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017 Clapper said late Wednesday he had spoken with Trump about a unsubstantiated document claiming Russia has compromising information about the president-elect. ADVERTISEMENT “I expressed my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press, and we both agreed that they are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security,” Clapper said in a statement. BuzzFeed late Tuesday published the controversial document, which was allegedly compiled by a former British intelligence officer. It alleges that Russia’s government possesses compromising financial and personal information about Trump. It also claims people close to Trump kept in touch with Moscow during the 2016 presidential race. Clapper on Wednesday said the report had neither been authenticated nor leaked to the media by the U.S. intelligence community. “I emphasized that this document is not a U.S. Intelligence Community product and that I do no believe the leaks came from within the IC,” he said. "The IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we do not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions." The intelligence community released a report last week that concluded Russian President Vladimir Putin called for an influence campaign to help Trump win the 2016 presidential election. Trump has fiercely dismissed similar reports, arguing they are attempts to undermine his victory. — This report was updated at 7:55 a.m. Tags Russia, Donald Trump, national intelligence, spying, Politics, Republicans   View the discussion thread.

OpenGL 4.2 Now Exposed For Intel Haswell On Mesa 17.0 Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 12 January 2017 at 07:39 AM EST. 6 Comments Days ago we mentioned the patches were lining up to get Intel's Haswell to OpenGL 4.2 and this morning those patches have landed in Mesa Git ahead of the branching for the Mesa 17.0 release. ARB_vertex_attrib_64bit and ARB_shader_precision support have landed, clearing the extensions to take Haswell generation graphics hardware from OpenGL 4.0 to OpenGL 4.2 compliance. This comes just days after Haswell finally got OpenGL 4.0 support with the FP64 support landing. Mesa 17.0 will be exciting for those with these older Intel IGPs going form OpenGL 3.3 to OpenGL 4.2, albeit no major boosts in performance. The later OpenGL 4.3~4.5 extensions are also complete for Haswell, but only GL 4.2 is flipped on for now until verifying compliance, passing the OpenGL CTS, etc. But even having OpenGL 4.2 for Haswell is a big step forward and will allow more OpenGL Linux games to run with Haswell, at least in theory, the performance may be another story. This work landed just in time for the Mesa 17.0 branching this weekend and feature freeze while the stable Mesa 17.0 release is expected in February. There's been no changes for the Ivy Bridge support and given the time crunch probably won't see changes for 17.0.

White offers her impression of the Surface Book 2. Sarah K. White (CIO (US)) 12 January, 2017 20:44 - - - - print email Comments When Microsoft held an event last October, everyone thought it was prepping to announce the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 or Surface Book 2. Instead, we got the new Surface Studio, Windows Creative Update and a beefed-up Surface Book i7 with Performance Base. The Performance Base addition brought a redesigned keyboard base to the device, while the tablet display remained the same. With the hope of swaying creative professionals away from Apple, these internal updates include an NVIDIA GPU, a 6th generation Intel Core i7 processor and a 1TB hard drive. I've used the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base regularly for the last month, and there's a lot that I love about the it. Even though it's a device targeted at creative professionals, it's a notebook that will suit anyone that values performance. Unmatched performance This should come as no surprise, but the performance on the updated Surface Book i7 has been consistently impressive. But when I talk about performance, it's important to remember that I'm not an artist, a 3D video editor or even a heavy gamer. Pushing the limits of my notebooks typically means I'm 100 tabs deep in Google Chrome or I'm rehashing my youth by playing The Sims 4. But the Surface Book happily encourages my pathological level of browser tabs without a single complaint. And light gaming was more enjoyable; everything ran faster and smoother than on my HP Spectre x360, which houses a 6th gen Intel i7 processor and integrated graphics. I wouldn't say it's worth spending over $3,000 on a notebook just to browse the internet with wild abandon and occasionally play The Sims 4 on the highest settings, but I can say my experience with the Surface Book this past month has truly spoiled me. If you need that level of performance, the Surface Book i7 is a strong contender and offers best performance you can get in this class of 13-inch notebooks. And, when you consider what it packs under the hood, it's incredibly thin and lightweight. [ Related story: Macbook Pro vs Surface Book i7 ] Portability While Surface Book i7 with Performance Base is a compact device for the performance it delivers, compared to other, less powerful 13-inch notebooks, it is kind of a beast. The display is a bit taller than your average 13-inch display, and with the dual cooling fans to support the improved GPU, it's slightly thicker and heavier than even the original Surface Book. And since I'm not someone who realistically needs that level of performance daily, I'd be more apt to grab the Surface Pro 4 if I'm travelling. The size and form factor are what would prevent the Surface Book from replacing my need for another device. But that's because my average workday consists of a steady Wi-Fi connection, the Microsoft Suite, Slack and, on rare occasion, Adobe Photoshop Elements. For me, carrying this updated Surface Book i7 on a work trip would feel excessive. I just don't need that level of performance on an average day and it would be too expensive to replace if stolen or damaged. If I needed to use 3D software or other high-powered design and editing software as part of my job, I I would be excited to travel with the Surface Book. It's certainly light and compact for someone who needs that level of performance, but for the average business user, or at least in my case, the Surface Pro 4 offers more than enough in a smaller package. [ Related story: 10 most popular hybrid tablet stories of 2016 ] It's not a tablet There's always a caveat to hybrid devices; they promise you both a tablet and notebook experience, but the truth is that they always fit more into one category. With its built-in trackpad and full Windows 10 OS, the Surface Pro 4 feels more like a notebook, while the iPad Pro, running iOS 10 and lacking a track pad, feels more like a tablet. They each fit different needs -- some people need a notebook more often than a tablet and vice versa. While the iPad Pro and Surface Pro 4 share more overlap in each category, the Surface Book is almost entirely a notebook that happens to have a detachable display. Without the keyboard dock, the tablet feels cumbersome and, since it lacks the kickstand on the Surface Pro 4, you can't just prop it up. Personally, I haven't found a need to use the Surface Book display as a tablet, and the same goes for my HP Spectre x360. I rarely find myself using either device in tablet mode, but I do frequently interact with the touch displays. I can see how if you were an artist, designer or worked in the field, the detachable display might be a bonus when combined with the Surface Pen. But for my personal needs, I'd be more inclined to reach for my iPad Air 2 or Surface Pro 4 before the Surface Book display. The little things There are so many minimal, thoughtful features that stand out on the Surface Book. The design is unique -- and love or hate the hinge, it's still a sleek device. Most of all, I appreciate that Microsoft nods to the industrial-chic design popularized by Apple without mimicking it the way other manufacturers have. Beyond the overall design, I also can't say enough good things about the Surface Book keyboard -- an often-overlooked feature on notebooks. It has the perfect key travel and the chiclet keys are spaced out just enough to make it comfortable to type. The Surface Book's trackpad offers just the right amount of responsiveness, especially compared to the hyper-sensitive trackpad on my HP Spectre x360. Battery life on the device is also unmatched -- thanks to the second battery. You can easily get through the day on one charge with light use. With heavier use, or if you're using battery draining peripherals like a wireless mouse, you can still get a solid six to eight hours before looking for an outlet. Buy now or wait it out? With so many hybrid rumors on the horizon for 2017, I can't help but wonder if the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base is just a taste of what we might see in the purported Surface Book 2. The updates in this case were purely internal and focused on packing in as much performance as possible. In the near future, there's the potential for 7th-generation Kaby Lake Processors and possibly even more graphics cards to choose from. Right now, the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base is so close to being the do-it-all notebook that can handle your work, editing, entertainment and gaming needs. But, considering the cost of this device at just over $3,000, I would say it's worth waiting to see what Microsoft has in store for the next Surface Book update. It reminds me of when the first Microsoft Surface was released -- the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base feels more like a taste of what's to come. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Windows Vista reaches the end of its life on 11 April. John wants to buy a new PC to replace his slow 10-year-old Acer Aspire. The Lenovo Ideacentre 510S. Photograph: Lenovo Jack Schofield Thursday 12 January 2017 04.41 EST Last modified on Thursday 12 January 2017 04.42 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close I have a 10-year-old Acer Aspire T660 desktop with 640MB of memory and Windows Vista Premium installed. The whole system is getting slower and slower, including the instruction to print documents and/or photos to my HP printer/copier/scanner. I use the PC for email, online banking, word processing and spreadsheets (Microsoft Office), Skype and some games. Broadband here to the house is poor. Should I get another desktop PC or a laptop? How much do I need to pay for a faster replacement which gives me the facilities I have now? I am retired (I’m 78) so I probably have a limited number of years ahead to enjoy a good replacement. John You must have an enormous amount of patience to run Windows Vista in 640MB or even 2GB of memory, and your best investment would have been to add as much memory as your PC could handle – in this case, 4GB. Sadly, it’s too late for that: it’s not worth spending money on a machine that is at the end of its useful life. On the plus side, almost anything will be a huge improvement. Desktop or laptop? You already have a desktop PC so you have the space, and you might be able to reuse your existing keyboard, mouse and screen. Desktops have more space inside for cooling so they can run hotter, faster, cheaper processors than laptops. They are also much easier to upgrade and to repair. As a result, desktop PCs last up to twice as long as laptops – in my recent experience, eight to 10 years rather than four or five years – so they are much better value. Desktop PCs also have better ergonomics – you can use them without hunching over – and usually have better keyboards and bigger screens. All of those are particularly beneficial to older users like us. Different types of desktop There are many different types of desktop PC. The traditional tower system is the most flexible, but there are dozens of smaller towers, including slimline and small form factor (SFF) versions. There are also lots of mini-and micro-desktops that are not very expandable, and may use the same chips you would find in a laptop. They have their uses, but they sacrifice functionality for what they save in space. Then there are all-in-one PCs, where the computer electronics are behind the screen. With these, again, you may lose the chance to do easy upgrades and repairs. Also, if either the PC or the screen fails, you lose the whole machine. Specification Today’s standard mid-range desktops have 8GB of memory, a 1TB hard drive, a DVD/RW optical drive and Microsoft Windows 10. Many also have built-in card readers and Wi-Fi, though you’ll get much better performance with the Ethernet cable you’re using with your Acer. All mid-range desktops should therefore cost pretty much the same. The biggest variation comes from the price of the processor. Intel has two main designs: Atom and Core. The Core chips are the fastest, and usually, the higher the code number, the better – and the costlier. The Atom chips are variously branded Atom, Celeron and Pentium. The Pentium versions are generally, but not always, better. Other things being equal, go for the fastest CPU, because it will last longer. You can compare speeds by using Notebookcheck’s Comparison of Mobile Processors (CPU Benchmarks). You don’t need to bother with the numbers: the higher up the table, the better. Anything in the top 200 is good. (My own 2011-vintage desktop is still in the top 100.) I’d have doubts about anything that didn’t make the top 500, with the quad-core Pentium N3700 (519th) or J3710 being as low as I’d go. Possible desktops My current cheap recommendation is the Lenovo Ideacentre 510S. This is a traditional tower available in a vast range of specifications, with plenty of useful ports on the front. John Lewis has a version with an Intel Core i3-6100 processor, 8GB of memory, 1TB hard drive and DVD/RW for £299.95. The 3.7GHz Intel Core i3-6100 is remarkably quick for an i3 chip, and can be almost as fast as a Core i5-6200U. (Of course, it runs much hotter, but that doesn’t matter in a desktop.) PC World has the same Ideacentre 510S with 4GB of memory instead of 8GB for £259.99. This has a much cheaper Celeron G3900 processor, which is slower than the Core i3-6100 but still a good performer. Even if it had the same CPU, you’d be giving up £50-worth of memory to save £40. HP’s Slimline 411 range of desktops offers cheaper but much less powerful options. For example, you could get one with a Pentium N3700, 4GB of memory, 1TB hard drive and DVD/RW for £229.95 from John Lewis, or with 8GB for £299.99 from Argos. If you buy direct from HP, you can add 3 years of “pickup and return” service for only £29, which is a bargain. But the Pentium N3700 and (almost identical) J3710 really belong in cheap netbooks and Chromebooks, not in desktops. There are plenty of smartphones with faster processors than the Celeron N3050. You can certainly get fantastic value for money if you spend £180 to £230 on a desktop, but you can get much better performance for £299.99. Screen As mentioned, you could use your existing monitor with your new desktop PC. However, I would strongly recommend buying a new one: screens have improved a lot in the past decade. Look for something in the 22-24in range with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which is Full HD. The 21.5in AOC e2270Swhn would be a good choice if you want something cheap – it’s £79.99 at PC World – or try Amazon UK’s best seller, the BenQ GL2250HM, at £89.99 (21.5in) or £119.99 (24in). Even better, you could get a 22in Samsung S22F350 for £89.95 at John Lewis or £99.99 at Argos. Alternatively, go for the 24in Samsung S24F350 for £116.95 at John Lewis, or the S24F356 for £129.99 at PC World. (You won’t be surprised to hear that John Lewis is currently out of stock of both Samsungs.) Software If you have software on DVD, such as Microsoft Office, you can install it on your new PC. It’s a good idea to uninstall it from your old PC first. Windows 10 PCs also tend to come with a trial version of the current Microsoft Office, so uninstall that before you install your old copy. You can also uninstall whichever anti-virus product comes pre-installed on your new PC. Windows 10’s built-in Defender is good enough for most people, as long as you don’t turn off the SmartScreen filter or the cloud integration. Of course, you can always install a free alternative such as Avast, Avira, BitDefender, Sophos or a similar product. The major worry is your HP printer/copier/scanner. Windows 10 will install basic drivers that should work, but you will probably need to download a model-specific driver from HP’s website. If HP doesn’t provide a “full feature” driver, you will probably lose some scanning features, and possibly copy/fax features as well. If so, Hamrick’s VueScan is a third-party solution that works with a lot of old scanners. It’s not free, but there’s a free trial version. Have you got another question for Jack?

The idea here is that HD mapping will support localisation to within centimetres to help vehicles precisely position themselves on the roadway to enable more reliable autonomous driving. Here and Inter say Here HD Live Map gives vehicles the ability to ‘see’ obstacles beyond their immediate field of vision and receive real-time updates as environments change due to traffic, road conditions and other factors. Here reckons it needs significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms, which is where the Intel muscle comes in. Here is a big booster of driverless cars because of their possible impact on urban development. The company reckons the ability to park and drive more efficiently will lead to a vast amount of space being made available. In the US alone, autonomous vehicles could free up 5.7 billion square metres, it says. “This could be used for parks or, more likely, fast food outlets,” Here adds. “A surprising effect of the emergence of autonomous vehicles is the forecast that house prices will drop. … more space will now be available, with up to 20% more land set to be up for grabs in inner cities, meaning more housing and, in theory, a drop in prices,” says Here.   Tags: innovation, intel, technology, transport « AI in the economic spotlight / On eye on AI ethics » Post Info Search for: Sign up for brand-e.biz direct to your desktop Find out - do brands have the talent for showbiz Error, no Ad ID set!

Hyper-threading allows multiple threads to run on each physical core, increasing the amount of logical operating cores and improving parallel performance. All Kaby Lake Pentium processors will feature four logical cores based on two physical cores, including the low-TDP mobile-class chips. Intel’s 7th-generation Pentium processors feature less power than the Core range, but certain high-end Pentium chips still include Intel HD Graphics 630.

Stock cooler? It won't boost much. AIO cooler? Now we're talking. Custom water cooling? Yeah, baby. LN2? The sky is the limit. Obviously there's a 45W TDP in your way, but I'm sure we should expect a mainstream price on the 4-core Ryzen CPU when it launches in March.

Asus 2017 is the year of gaming. About a week ago, Acer unleashed the preposterous 21-inch Predator 21 X while Razer unveiled its three-headed monster called Project Valerie. It’s only fair and natural that Asus has decided to counter those two by launching its own gaming marvel, the small but powerful ROG GR8 II. The new Asus ROG GR8 II packs a lot of power but occupies very little space. While the GR8 II is slightly larger than its predecessor, the GR8, Republic of Gamers says it’s for the extra muscle. According to Asus, the 4-kilogram GR8 II is “the smallest VR-ready system money can buy.” Asus ROG’s new gaming PC is powered by the latest 7th generation Intel Core i7 or i5 desktop processor with a customised Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card and up to 32 GB of DDR4 RAM. It includes two USB 3.1 ports (Type-A and Type-C) four USB 3.0 ports. Two of the USB 3.0 ports are located at the front for easy connection of game controllers and peripherals. Republic of Gamers promises the GR8 II to be “super silent” at 23dB at idle. Two storage options are included: an expandable slot supporting up to an M.2 PCIe SSD and a 2.5-inch bay for additional drives. Sound quality enhancements are provided by SupremeFX alongside Sonic Studio III software with a new routing feature for streaming. The Asus ROG GR8 II furnishes two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort, which means users can turn it into their own Project Valerie and connect up to three displays for some serious immersive gaming. But unlike the Razer hydra, whose prototypes were reportedly stolen, the ROG GR8 II is an actual product and will go on sale starting the first week of February in the UK with an MSRP of £950 (AU$1,555).

David Shulkin was nominated by President Obama as under secretary of health for the VA in 2015.  “He’s fantastic,” Trump said of Shulkin. “He will do a truly great job.” Trump made the announcement during his first press conference since his election, and his transition team released a formal announcement shortly afterward. “One of the commitments I made is that we’re going to straighten out the whole situation for our veterans,” Trump said Wednesday. “Our veterans have been treated horribly. They’ve been waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in an have a minor early stage form of cancer and they can’t see a doctor and by the time they get to the doctor they’re terminal. ADVERTISEMENT “Not going to happen. It’s not going to happen.” In a statement released by Trump’s transition team, Shulkin said both he and Trump are “eager” to reform to the VA in a “swift, thoughtful and responsible way.” “It is my honor to serve as President-elect Trump’s Secretary of Veterans Affairs,” Shulkin said. “President-elect Trump’s commitment to caring for our veterans is unquestionable, and he is eager to support the best practices for care and provide our Veterans Affairs’ teams with the resources they need to improve health outcomes." The position was one of two Cabinet openings that Trump had yet to fill with just a little more than a week to go before his inauguration. The delay had worried veterans organizations, which were concerned that Trump wouldn’t keep his commitments to veterans made during the campaign. The VA has been plagued by scandal since 2014, when it was revealed that hospitals were keeping secret waitlists that had veterans waiting for care for inordinate amounts of time. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to reform the VA, at one point even promising that he would set up a special White House hotline to personally field complaints about the military healthcare system. He also released a 10-point plan to “make the VA great again” that includes making it easier to fire VA officials involved in wrongdoing and expanding veterans’ choices to use private healthcare.  Trump met with a slew of candidates to head the VA, but a couple leading candidates withdrew their names from consideration in the last few weeks. Prior to Wednesday’s announcement, Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator and former head of the conservative advocacy group Concerned Veterans for America, was seen as the leading contender to be VA secretary. Leading veterans organizations opposed Hegseth, however, saying he supported a plan that would in effect privatize the VA by shifting resources away from the department to allow all veterans to seek private health care. Dozen of organizations urged Trump to retain current VA Secretary Bob McDonald, saying he has overseen a number of reforms. As under secretary of health, Shulkin is the chief executive of Veterans Health Administration and oversees 1,700 care sites serving 8.76 million veterans annually. Prior to joining the VA, Shulkin served in numerous chief executive roles including serving as president at Morristown Medical Center, Goryeb Children’s Hospital and Atlantic Rehabilitation Institute. He also previously served as president and CEO of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. The choice of Shulkin should assuage worries of veterans organizations worried Trump’s reforms would be radical and lead to privatization. Shulkin is not a veteran, however, something veterans groups had recommended. He would be the first non-veteran to lead the department. Paul Rieckhoff, founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of American (IAVA), said his group is optimistic about Shulkin and looks forward to hearing about to what extent he and Trump plan to expand privatization, which he said "veterans nationwide continue to overwhelmingly oppose.” “He is well known to us, a man of character and has been a trusted partner of IAVA at VA," Rieckhoff said in a statement. "However, his selection is unprecedented. Our membership overwhelmingly supported the selection of a veteran for this critical leadership position. Dr. Shulkin’s service as under secretary is respected by the entire veterans community. He is a committed leader and is our best hope among candidates reported in the media to maintain the momentum created by Secretary McDonald to reform the VA." Got Your 6’s executive director, Bill Rausch, said in a statement that his group looks forward to working with Shulkin. "Although Dr. Shulkin does not have military experience, we have worked with him closely in his current role and have seen first-hand his unwavering commitment to our nation’s veterans," he said. "VA’s success is our veterans’ success, and we look forward to working with Dr. Shulkin, his staff and the entire Trump administration to ensure that veterans continue to be put first.” Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said he was pleased with the choice of Shulkin. “I am pleased President-elect Trump has chosen a physician to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, especially one familiar with the integrating of private practitioners into the VA's network of health care providers," he said in a statement. "I’ve long said I would be happy to work with anyone committed to ensuring our heroes have access to the services they have earned, especially quality health care, and I look forward to working with Dr. Shulkin to bring wholesale reform to the Department.” Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.), who was ranking member of the committee last year, called Shulkin the most qualified of Trump’s VA candidates. “After calling the Department of Veterans Affairs ‘the most corrupt agency in the United States’ on the campaign trail, the President-elect’s decision to retain a current VA leader and Obama-appointee is a notable departure from his inflammatory rhetoric,” Takano said in a statement. “I sincerely hope he will leave his promise to move the VA toward privatization on the campaign trail as well.” Sen. Johnny IsaksonJohnny IsaksonTrump picks Obama nominee for VA secretary Five races to watch in 2017 GOP senators wary of nuking filibuster MORE (R-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, congratulated Shulkin and said he understands how to work with Congress for meaningful reform. “There is a tremendous amount of work to be done – by the VA and by Congress – to change the paradigm at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,” Isakson said in a statement. “Dr. Shulkin understands the critical importance of working hand-in-hand with Congress on enacting meaningful, bipartisan reforms to help right the ship at the VA. I congratulate Dr. Shulkin on his nomination, and I look forward to chairing his confirmation hearing and discussing our shared priorities to ensure the VA is putting veterans first.” --This report was updated at 1:09 p.m. Tags Johnny Isakson, Donald Trump   View the discussion thread.

It's Wednesday evening here in Washington where there was a lot happening all at once.  Here's the latest.    THE BIG STORY Empowered by President-elect Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump to continue using @realDonaldTrump account as president Trump’s healthcare plan will offer ‘insurance for everybody’: report Trump on outgoing CIA director: ‘Was this the leaker of Fake News?’ MORE, Republicans lawmakers are moving to gut the vast regulatory powers federal agencies enjoyed during the Obama administration. On Wednesday, the GOP-controlled House passed the Regulatory Accountability Act which puts a ceiling on the regulatory costs coming out of Washington by instructing federal agencies to craft the "least expensive" rules they possibly can. It passed 238-183 on a largely party line vote with five Democrats crossing the aisle. This would give Congress more control over federal agencies. "Some of the most significant decisions in Washington --- those that most affect the lives of the public --- are made by those who don't stand for election," House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said. "What happens when the EPA imposes rules that deprive people of their property rights? Or when the Department of Health and Human Services tries to force nuns to violate their religion? Or when the VA perpetuates a system that lets veterans die while they wait for care?" McCarthy asked. "The people can't vote out the bureaucrats who write rules at the EPA or at the Department of Health and Human Services. They can't vote out bad leaders at the VA," he added. "And these bureaucrats know it." Regulatory reform is a key part of Trump's economic agenda, and Republican lawmakers are working quickly to reshape the way in which regulations are developed before the president-elect takes office next Friday. McCarthy indicated the House would begin repealing specific regulations after the inauguration. Since the beginning of the year, the House has passed three regulatory reform bills that limit the authority of federal agencies.  Last week, lawmakers approved the Midnight Rules Relief Act, which blocks the Obama administration from publishing expensive rules at the last-minute before Trump takes over next Friday. While the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act gives Congress the power to reject rules it dislikes with a simple majority vote. With Trump about to enter the White House, Republicans are hopeful they can shove these regulatory reform bills through Congress. But they may run into resistance in the Senate, where Democrats could filibuster. The other bills passed Wednesday along with the Regulatory Accountability Act, include: --The Require Evaluation before Implementing Executive Wishlists (REVIEW) Act, which prevents federal agencies from issuing expensive regulations while they are facing court challenges. Once the legal battles are resolved, the rules could move forward. --The Separation of Powers Restoration Act, which would prevent courts from deferring to the regulatory interpretations of federal agencies, making it easier for rules to be challenged. Goodlatte said the current law "rubber stamps" regulations. --The All Economic Regulations are Transparent Act (ALERT) Act, which instructs federal agencies to publish costs estimates for rules they are working on while they are still in development. --The Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act, which instructs federal agencies to publish "plain language" summaries of their rules online, so the "public can understand what the agencies are actually proposing to do." --The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, which instructs federal agencies to account for not only the direct costs of their rules, but also the indirect costs and cumulative impacts they will have on small businesses.

Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) to be the director of the Central Intelligence Agency.    TOMORROW'S REGS TODAY Here's a sneak peak at Thursday's edition of the Federal Register. --The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) will propose new protections for giant manta rays. Giant manta rays are a threatened species, the agency said Wednesday. "We have determined that the giant manta ray is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout a significant portion of its range," the agency writes in the Federal Register. But the agency declined to list reef manta rays as endangered or threatened. The protections come in response to a petition from Defenders of Wildlife. The public has 60 days to comment.  While manta rays are getting new protections, the agency decided against new measures to help Alabama shad fish. The agency reviewed a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) to protect these fish, but declined to do so. "We conclude that the Alabama shad is not currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range and is not likely to become so within the foreseeable future," the agency says. The finding goes into effect immediately. --The State Department will propose new rules for foreign exchange students and their host families. The rules would address the summer work travel program. Among other changes, they would limit the number of times foreign students can participate in exchange programs and require them to be placed with a host family before arriving. The public has 45 days to comment.   NEWS RIGHT NOW  Booker testifies against Sessions at confirmation hearing  John Lewis recalls 'bitter fruits of segregation' at Sessions hearing  Sessions would have power to stop FBI investigations, says ex-attorney general  Trump's Labor pick to face protests from own workers  Live coverage: Tillerson's hearing for State  FCC takes aim at AT&T, Verizon over 'zero-rating' services Treasury sanctions top North Korean officials Chamber president urges focus on long-term benefits of tax reform Trump calls for 'new bidding procedures' with drug companies Interior proposes raising royalty rates on federal coal mining Six VW employees indicted in emissions scandal Gay teacher sues over firing from North Carolina high school - AP  Trump announces David Shulkin as pick for secretary of Veterans Affairs - NPR   BY THE NUMBERS 5: Proposed rules 14: Final rules (Source: Federal Register)   QUOTE OF THE DAY "The Federal Register is now the length of 80 King James Bibles," -- House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).

Jan 06, 2017 Law and Public Policy North America Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Supports K@W's Innovation Content Drive the streets of Silicon Valley and you’ll see disproportionate numbers of electric cars gliding around. The wonders of both computer technology and electric vehicle technology appeal to the same brainy, forward-thinking people. But when it comes to making the products more universally accepted, they are anything but similar. “Moore’s Law,” named for Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, postulates that microchip performance doubles every two years without an increase in cost. However, the same law that drives down the price of your iPhone does not apply to the lithium ion batteries that are at the heart of electric vehicle technology. John Paul MacDuffie, professor of management at Wharton, says battery technology has been slower to evolve. While electric cars have made meaningful progress in recent years, they have not yet reached the price point that will put them in most driveways around America. “The moment for a tipping point for electric vehicles is not here — yet again.” But there are also “some developments that make me think it’s not back to zero.” Wharton’s Mack Institute, where MacDuffie is director of the Program on Vehicle and Mobility Innovation, held a forecasting challenge in 2016 to predict when electric vehicles, as well as self-driving vehicles, will reach the point of mainstream adoption. The questions included projections of sales and covered such models as the Nissan Leaf, the all-time best-selling electric vehicle in the world. Relatively speaking, it’s a modestly priced electric vehicle which is benefitting from federal and state subsidies. But Leaf sales are dropping instead of increasing, clearly not at all what Nissan was expecting, MacDuffie notes. Meanwhile, Tesla has had more encouraging news. The company will come close to its projection of 80,000 units sold in 2016, MacDuffie says. Elon Musk’s company has been ambitious, projecting it will make 500,000 cars per year by 2018. “The industry may decide to back away from all the things they’ve been investing in for the last five-to-eight years.” –John Paul MacDuffie Another question in the forecasting challenge was about whether battery prices would drop to a certain level, and another was about policy changes, which largely stalled during a presidential election year, MacDuffie said. It turns out that, generally, for the questions on the challenge, “more of them have been trending toward the ‘no’ end of the answer rather than the yes.” The Mack Institute plans to do the challenge again this year. Three Stumbling Blocks There are three moving but related parts to the electric car purchasing value proposition, says Rahul Kapoor, also a professor of management at Wharton. Kapoor has been collaborating on the forecasting challenge with MacDuffie and Wharton management professor Philip Tetlock. The first is the price of the car itself. With cost-benefit analyses, that price is still high — for instance, the Tesla Model 3 will have a starting price of $35,000 — and gas prices are still relatively low, providing less financial incentive to go electric, Kapoor notes. The second is consumer “range anxiety,” which is the phrase used to capture concerns that drivers would be left stranded by the side of the road because the electrical charge on their car would not be strong enough to get them where they were headed. The Tesla Model 3 will have a range of about 215 miles, much more than models like the 2017 Nissan Leaf, which offers 107 miles of range. “You can solve the range anxiety problem,” Kapoor says. But “that’s raising the price of the car itself.” Sponsored Content: So, a significant development for electric vehicles recently has been the creation of models with longer ranges, says John Voelcker, editor of GreenCarReports.com, who acknowledges that the new Tesla model is a big improvement. The range of most electric cars has been enough to get to and from work and to do some errands, but “if I have to take my kid to the hospital in the middle of the night, I might not have enough battery. That just wipes out consideration.” But a 200-mile range may be enough to eliminate that range anxiety. The Chevy BOLT EV, a 2017 model, has a rated range of 238 miles. It isn’t high technology — it’s a much bigger battery, says Voelcker. The third challenge, according to Kapoor, is the charging infrastructure, which has not emerged as quickly as expected. In an article that Kapoor wrote with Ron Adner for the November edition of Harvard Business Review, “Right Tech, Wrong Time,” they note that it isn’t just the power or price of a technology that determines whether a product catches on. It’s also the “ecosystem.” For instance, while HDTV technology was developed in the 1980s, it took about 30 years to create the infrastructure to support that technology going into homes nationwide, they say. In this case, as good as electric cars have become, charging stations have not become universal, they write. Existing gasoline-powered cars, meanwhile, have shown “robust resilience” as they show better emissions performance, Kapoor says. Thus, the value proposition for electric vehicles is not improving at a high enough rate, at least for the mainstream market, he adds. In Voelcker’s view, a lot of people erroneously treat an electric car like a piece of consumer electronics. Lithium ion batteries are far different from microchips, he said. “You can solve the range anxiety problem. But that’s raising the price of the car itself.” –Rahul Kapoor Nevertheless, they will advance in efficiency much more quickly than gas-powered cars going forward, and there has been notable success in efficiency over the years, even if it so far falls short of sending electric cars into the mainstream. For example, in 2012 a Tesla with a 60 kilowatt-hour battery pack sold for $65,000; today, a 2017 Chevy Bolt EV with the same size battery pack costs about $37,000, before government incentives. “Now you can get the functional equivalent of a Tesla, from Chevy, for the price of a Nissan Leaf six years ago. That’s pretty rapid advance,” Voelcker points out. The most inexpensive electric cars are in the $20,000-$30,000 range, and Voelcker predicts that manufacturers will follow the Tesla model of offering a range of battery sizes. “There are people who think 100-120 miles really is fine.” Odds of Reversals? More generally, the electric vehicle industry has benefitted from government standards pushing for cleaner vehicles, as well as subsidies. Both have had the blessing of President Barack Obama, but observers say President-elect Donald Trump may be unfriendly toward such initiatives. The EPA enacted restrictive fleet mileage requirements during the Obama administration as it emerged from the automakers’ bankruptcy cases, MacDuffie notes. The requirements are that the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks, regardless of their power source, must be 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. If the new EPA administrator decides to back off from those goals, “it won’t happen immediately, but the industry may decide to back away from all the things they’ve been investing in for the last five-to-eight years,” MacDuffie says. Or they may decide they expect the political pendulum to swing back, and to continue those efforts, maybe only in their labs on a long-term basis, but to continue them nevertheless. “It may be more of a slowdown than a wrench in the works, full-stop.” Observers also say electric vehicle sales have benefitted from robust — and often inconsistent — government subsidies, including a federal tax credit of up to $7,500. Although Tesla has come under scrutiny for the subsidies that apply to its sales, the federal subsidy only covers the first 200,000 vehicles sold by any given company, MacDuffie points out. Last year Tesla sold roughly 50,000 vehicles. After this year, it will be getting close to the subsidy cap, he adds. Chevy, too, will be ineligible for subsidies over the limit before too long. Whither Subsidies? MacDuffie also explains that it is unclear what will happen to state subsidies in the Trump era. If a new EPA administrator wants to prevent states from doing anything to promote electric vehicles, “a lot of mischief could be done in that area. But there is a states’-rights logic to some of the opposition to the strong federal government role. It will be very spiky.” State-specific emissions requirements, such as those in California, are a “back-door” way for states to force automakers to innovate, regardless of what the federal government does, says Arthur van Benthem, a Wharton professor of business economics and public policy. Meanwhile, renewable energy in theory should mesh with Trump’s agenda, which includes creating high-skill jobs in the U.S., and rules that support renewable energy have proven popular to voters in states that supported Trump, he adds. What’s more, it would not be easy to cancel President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan and fuel economy standards that favor electric vehicles, according to van Benthem. While Trump’s administration could defund the EPA to make it harder to check compliance, “I don’t think it’s very likely most of these regulations will disappear from the books in the next couple of years,” he adds. “The problem is not that the car companies don’t want to build them, but that people don’t want to buy them.” –Morris Cohen Van Benthem also notes that the government may have been too aggressive in subsidizing electric vehicles, which have been treated as zero-emissions vehicles even though they run on fossil-fueled grid power.  There’s a good rationale for the government to support building up clean energy technology, but “we’ve probably gone a little too far in picking a winner and blindly subsidizing fully electric vehicles.” As far as subsidies go, “it’s more about the option value for the future than rewarding actual zero-emissions vehicles today,” van Benthem says. In the future, wind and solar could make up a larger share of grid power, which would help electric vehicles realize their zero-emission potential. The bottom line, however, seems to be that until the price of electric vehicles come down, people will be reluctant to buy them, since most are unwilling to pay a premium for green technology, according to Morris Cohen, a professor of operations, information and decisions at Wharton. People are driven to buy a car, he says, to get from one place to another. Still, Cohen is guardedly optimistic about the industry as more manufacturers offer electric vehicles, including some high-performance models. “Basically, the problem is not that the car companies don’t want to build them, but that people don’t want to buy them,” Cohen notes. “They’re more expensive for the same function of car.” Supports K@W's Innovation Content Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "When Will Electric Cars Go Mainstream?."

So the break even time should be a lot shorter for heavily used vehicles than for privately owned commuter cars which remain parked 95% of the time. Also, vehicles which always return to a home base every day negate the problems of charging and the need for roadside charging infrastructure. Heavy use and return to a home base every day is basically the description of a large fraction of the vehicles on the road: taxis, buses, delivery vans, car share, Uber, etc. The worlds largest manufacturer of EVs, BYD, seems to be focused on these types of vehicles. I think that EV makers could gain economies of scale with these sorts of fleet vehicles that might hasten the widespread acceptance of EVs. Xriva Zimmerman Ed, One of our cars is a Nissan LEAF, the other is a high end luxury minivan. Based on my experience as a EV owner for the last year, I agree with your points. I think EVs make sense now. But the public just doesn’t realise it yet. Here’s what I think will happen : Due to a bump in gas prices and/or regulatory changes MANY multi-car families will make one of their cars an EV. They will love it like our family does.

A new lab at National Instruments, in Austin, Texas, is bringing some competitors together. The NI Industrial IoT Lab opened on Wednesday and will house testbeds for applications like predictive maintenance, time-synchronized industrial networking and “microgrids” for renewable energy. It will also be a place where companies can show off joint solutions to customers. One of the aims of the lab is to show enterprises that IoT works, said Jamie Smith, director of embedded systems at National Instruments. “One of the barriers we face today is [gaining] wide industry confidence that these distributed industrial internet of things solutions are ready,” Smith said. The opening brought together Cisco Systems and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, known more as archrivals than as partners, as well as Intel, PTC, Real-Time Innovations, Analog Devices and the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC). They’re all sponsoring the lab along with several other players. Vendors will use the lab to showcase their products to customers but also will collaborate with others to make sure all technologies developed for industrial IoT can work together. Those include communications protocols, processing elements, software and more. On Thursday and Friday this week, the lab will host a plugfest where vendors will connect their products using TSN (time-sensitive networking). TSN, based on IEEE standards, is designed for synchronizing the clocks in industrial equipment connected over Ethernet. It should allow enterprises to gradually replace specialized industrial networks with Ethernet, integrating IT with so-called OT (operational technology). Network Instruments makes compact, hardened systems that sit at the edge of an IoT network and collect, digitize, process and transmit information from a wide variety of sensors. The systems can also control equipment at the edge in real time using data collected there, Smith said. The initial testbeds in the National Instruments lab came out of IIC, which was formed in 2014 to help bring together IT and OT systems.

The company Advanced Vector Instructions 2 (AVX2) extension set, which is mainly used for database processing and video editing - so Intel is hoping there is still a market for a slice of consumers who will buy a HT-enabled Pentium processor over the slightly cheaper Core i3.   The pricing is also a little cheaper, with the new Kaby Lake-based Core i3 processors having a $50+ premium over the new Pentium chips, but will the performance be much better? Well, the new Core i3-7100 and Pentium G4620 are only 200MHz apart and with AVX2 being the only difference, why would you pay more?

(I personally have some APL motherboards for desktops in for testing sometime during Q1 as well.) One of these platforms was GIGABYTE’s embedded BRIX line, more focused at commercial deployments than consumer, but interesting nonetheless. The main unit we saw was this: the GB-EAPD-4200 BRIX. Using an Apollo Lake SoC, it looks to be in a passive case and sports three WiFi antenna. The chassis is 0.46L, with support for 2x DDR3L-1866 SO-DIMM memory modules, one M.2 (2280) SSD slot and a mini-PCIe slot for a 3G WLAN module. The WLAN accounts for one antenna, and the other two come via an Intel 802.11ac card inside, most likely the 8265 or 8260 depending on how GBT’s design cycle was in play. Using Apollo Lake means getting HD Graphics 505, although given this system it is more than adequate for video playback or casual office use. This unit has plenty of IO to keep the buyer satisfied – dual gigabit network ports, dual HDMI 1.4 display ports, four USB 3.0 ports and support for a microSD card. VESA support for 75mm and 100mm brackets is included.\ This unit is to be sold as a barebones kit, requiring DRAM and storage, most likely for system integrators to add their own hardware solutions depending on how local customers will want them configured (small DRAM counts and low storage, or something more robust). Interested parties will need to contact their local distribution partners for more information.

The only reason I can see for why they didn't add it to this product, is that they didn't have room for the port.

The professionals in the class of the 2017 — profiled below in no particular order — exemplify the innovation and leadership needed to suceed in today’s fast-changing retail environment. They share a record of success that is worthy of emulation by all their peers. Beth McCormick, VP of applications, PetSmart Beth McCormick worked in retail throughout high school and college — an experience that sparked her initial interest in retailing. However, it was her role as an IT consultant that helped her realize she found her niche and “fell in love with retail technology.” “I learned the distinct challenges retail clients faced and how technology could help meet those challenges head on,” she said. Her consulting experience lead her to join American Eagle Outfitters in 1999, where she was responsible for store systems across the brand and applied technology to push for more superior customer experiences. During her tenure, she held various IT leadership positions, including VP of applications. After 14 years at American Eagle, McCormick joined PetSmart in 2014 as VP of applications. While there, she has built a new IT organization responsible for development, delivery and application operations that support key initiatives across the organization. McCormick is also responsible for bringing PetSmart’s digital platform in-house. The architecture took 10 months to complete — just in time for the 2016 holiday season. She said the project, which also included replacing fulfillment and customer care partners, “was a fast-paced, very challenging project and when PetSmart.com went online it was quickly robust and stable.” McCormick has been fortunate to have significant roles with two large retailers. But she said it’s still challenging at times to be the only woman on the team or in the room. “There are still far too few women executives in IT, and we must work hard to change that,” she added. “While I’ve always had tremendously supportive bosses and leaders, I still find myself in situations where I am treated differently.” McCormick’s success is driven by building trusted, respected partner relationships with business leaders, listening to customers’ needs, keeping up with technological trends and, most importantly, aggressively delivering value to the business. “[Retail IT] is incredibly fast-paced, stimulating and challenging,” she added. “IT has to move fast in order to keep pace, and I wouldn’t want it any other way.” Kristen Williams, Senior director e-commerce, Walmart Even as a student at the University of Arkansas in 1999, Kristen Williams was passionate about IT. After taking a position as a network cable installation tech on campus, she learned technology “from the ground up” — a concept so profound that she changed her major from industrial engineering to computer engineering. The change landed Williams a position as a network analyst at Walmart upon graduation in 2001. She worked her way up, holding a variety of roles and leadership positions — and always using her passion for retail technology as a conduit for new opportunities. “I am attracted to both the tinkering side of technology, and the cognitive side,” she said. “Technology is not only a pathway for executives in the field. It can solve problems, make users’ lives easier, and open more doors for businesses.” Williams is eager to learn new tech trends, drawn to new projects and uses technology as a means of reaching new goals. One accomplishment she is proud of is helping Walmart integrate its online and offline experiences; building and expanding its online grocery and pickup business, as well as driving its omnichannel operation both domestically and abroad. “Driving e-commerce integration was a huge accomplishment and a highlight in my career so far,” Williams said. Yet, of all her accomplishments, Williams said she is most proud of the fact that she has become “a well-rounded player who can help the company solve problems.” “I am always looking to satisfy my next goal,” she said. “Staying abreast of technology trends lets me move toward my potential, and keep moving forward. Working toward new accomplishments is not something I am willing to sacrifice.”   Deb Dixson, Senior VP, global chief information security officer, Best Buy Co. As the breadth of digital technology — and data — continues to expand, information security professionals across the retail industry struggle with how to secure their organizations. This challenge is something that Deb Dixson confronts daily. Dixson’s passion for technology evolved through a sales job where she sold grading, scheduling and testing software and hardware to the education industry The first step in her retail technology journey was as an IT contractor tasked with replacing a homegrown gift card system with a vendor-provided system. “It gave me great exposure and the opportunity to interact with many facets of the business, including the need to constantly morph and change to meet the needs of our customers — and I was hooked,” Dixson recalled. That need for reinvention prompted Dixson to explore what was happening in retail related to information security. With an eye on protecting enterprise data, she created the role of chief information security officer at Best Buy, serving in the position from 2000 to 2009, and then at Delhaize America from 2010 to 2014, where she also served as senior VP and U.S CIO. Dixson rejoined the executive team at Best Buy in 2015 as senior VP, global CISO. As employees and customers have access to so many more solutions that collect data and access networks, “it’s transforming how we need to think and act, as well as the conversations we have to have at all levels,” Dixson said. “The pace of proliferation and the power of these devices are moving far faster than standards and regulations, which has historically been a guidepost helping us articulate and manage risk,” she explained. Forging a path that hadn’t previously existed is a testament to Dixson’s passion for retail IT and speaks to her interest in solving new problems as they arise. “Doing the research and putting the proposal together to create one of the first CISO roles and information security teams in retail, taking teams through major transformations to better serve the business, and helping partners create solutions to address gaps in the industry are the things that I look back on,” Dixson added. “I’m grateful to have been in the right place at the right time to have made an impact.”   Ashlee Aldridge, Senior VP and CIO, DSW Inc. Ashlee Aldridge believes that retail success stems from teamwork and strategic relationships. After spending 1999 to 2003 at Deloitte, where Aldridge worked with a number of retailers and consumer packaged goods companies, she got hooked on retail. Her first role came in 2003 when she joined Zale Corp. as VP of strategic development. A year later, the jewelry retailer named her CIO. Aldridge left Zale in 2006, going on to CIO positions at such national chains as West Marine, Restoration Hardware and Golfsmith International. In 2015, Aldridge joined footwear giant DSW as senior VP and CIO, responsible for the chain’s global technology strategy and transformation programs. She leads the enterprise’s transformation as it moves toward adoption of web-enabled touch points, while keeping a keen eye on how to apply technology to serve the ever-changing needs of the omnichannel consumer. While there will always be an unlimited number of technology problems in the field to solve, Aldridge has set her sights on aligning relationships, and managing organizational change, talent acquisition and retention. “I work daily to connect my peers, team and partners to meet the goal of our mission, support change and encourage talent development, retention and attraction to our business,” she said. “This inspires me to do better on behalf of our customers, our company and our team. I believe executing this approach is one of the most critical skills a retailer needs to win on the way to 2020.”   Rachel Mushahwar, General manager, head of Americas sales: Retail, hospitality, and CPG, Intel Corp. Retail is in Rachel Mushahwar’s blood. Four generations of her family, starting with her great grandfather, operated retail stores, the most recent being a supermarket in Colorado that closed when her parents retired in 2004. Her background gave Mushahwar the opportunity to do nearly every job in retail — and witness the industry’s transformation. “Shoppers’ expectations have continued to rise, and retailers continually have to innovate to delight and amaze their customers,” Mushahwar said. “It’s a challenging, but exciting time when you think about all of the advancements we’ve seen to combine traditional brick-and-mortar stores with their supply chains, enabling stores to become living, breathing websites that deliver amazing customer experiences profitably.” Before joining Intel, Mushahwar spent nearly a decade at PetSmart, joining in 2006 as IT director of backoffice applications/shared services. In 2013, she was appointed as VP of global enterprise applications, responsible for retail technology strategy, development and support for all segments of the company, domestic and international. In 2015, she took a leap to the other side, joining Intel. As Intel’s head of Americas sales for retail, hospitality and CPG, Mushahwar works to help executives realize the value of a smart, connected environment and how they can analyze collected data to improve their company’s bottom line — efforts that “create new and differentiated business capabilities that drive amazing customer experiences, create new products or change how the supply chain operates,” she said. “It’s about people, processes and creating that which has not existed before,” she said. This mantra has underlined Mushahwar’s accomplishments. One of her biggest is not being afraid to take risks and accept the possibility of failure. “Executives have always believed in me and coached me to take some risks in my career, try new roles and new companies,” Mushahwar said. “Only through the right kind of risks, experimentations and failures can you — or an organization — move forward.”   Deepika Pandey, Group VP, customer experience, direct and digital marketing, Walgreens Deepika Pandey always wanted “to be involved with something that would truly change the world.” For Pandey, the opportunity arose with the evolution of e-commerce. While doing research for a professor at Northwestern University, she began exploring multiple areas of retail and marketing and became attracted to “the future of digital.” “I knew that I had found something that was going to completely transform the industry,” she said. She joined McKinsey & Co., where she developed her digital expertise and built core business skills — knowledge that prepared her to take on the role as director of online strategy at Walgreens in 2008, where Pandey championed the redesign of the drug store chain’s website, while managing a 150-person customer experience team. She went on to launch the company’s mobile apps for iPhone, iPad and Android, as well as new digital processes, including the brand’s mobile Refill by Scan pharmacy service and Quick Prints photo functionality. “Mobile is critical for us because we truly believe that is the great connector between the digital and physical worlds,” Pandey explained. Her efforts have translated into a 4.5-star rating on both app stores, proving that “technology is not just about creating functionality. It can also transform the way that consumers think about your brand,” Pandey said. Deanna Steele, Group VP, IT-brands, Ascena Retail Group Retail is often described as a dynamic, constantly changing industry. That’s exactly what attracted Deanna Steele. She got her first taste of retail upon joining Island Pacific in 1993, a position that gave her insight into how technology was becoming a business enabler. She experienced this evolution first-hand when she moved on to Deloitte’s retail practice as a senior manager. “(At Deloitte), I was a ‘student of retail,’” she said. “I learned the importance of integrating technology with business strategies and processes, and witnessed it become a catalyst for organizational change.” This insight jump-started her arrival at Hot Topic in 2004, as director of project management. Her first task: Open a distribution center on the East Coast that was completely integrated to the chain’s planning and allocation systems, purchase order management and complex replenishment processes. During her seven-year tenure at the chain, Steele held different IT roles, including VP of IT, which prepared her for her next position: VP of IT at Express. Almost two years later, in November 2013, she joined Ascena Retail Group as VP of IT for its Lane Bryant division. Steele now holds the title of Group VP, IT – Brands, at Ascena Retail. It’s a role that immerses her in the company’s ongoing transformational changes, and supports unified commerce, including the integration of new retail, business intelligence, financial and point-of-sale systems. Steele often reflects on all she’s learned throughout her career, from being on the ground floor of omnichannel’s introduction at Hot Topic to using digitally driven solutions in her current role to drive growth at one of the nation’s largest specialty apparel companies. “The projects are part of something bigger — it is exciting to know that I was part of teams that made meaningful impacts on the business as well as on the lives of our shoppers,” Steele said.   Lisa Emily, Director, IT e-commerce, customer-facing mobile and order management, Tractor Supply Co. Lisa Emily truly believes she didn’t choose retail technology as a career. Rather, it chose her. Her first retail job was as a store manager at Kirkland’s, and later she worked in the wholesale customer service division at Johnston & Murphy shoe company while completing her degree at night. But she got her first taste of technology at DK Publishing, where she worked on many aspects of the JD Edwards OneWorld enterprise resource planning application. In 2001, Emily joined the ranks of Tractor Supply Co. as a business analyst in merchandising, and by 2004, she joined the IT department as a systems analyst for merchandising systems. Emily worked her way up the IT ladder at Tractor Supply rung by rung, holding various senior positions. By 2014, she transitioned to IT director of e-commerce, order management and customer facing mobile, where her passion for technology helped drive the retailer’s digital evolution. Emily is most proud of her accomplishments that “encompass what I was able to achieve since moving to e-commerce. She added: “I was learning a new technology stack, growing the team, including offshore development for capacity and building new processes, while working on re-platforming TractorSupply.com.” Since the re-platform, the e-commerce team has successfully implemented an agile development process for continuous delivery of enhancements, and also delivered a buy online, pick up in store service. “I have always had a passion for technology driving business value, and I have gotten to see the benefits of that value in a significant way in my role in e-commerce,” Emily said.   Sarah Gelbman, Global technology sales manager, Oracle Whether managing new solutions, an influx of data or evolving processes, technology professionals are constantly juggling “information.” This is exactly what makes Sarah Gelbman thrive. “I like the influence we have as technology professionals,” she said. “We are on the pulse of real, tangible, positive change.” Gelbman began her IT journey in 2001, as manager of technical operations at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where she led a team of specialists in technical management of the studio’s physical and digital assets. She spent five years at MGM, and then moved to the media industry, where she gained sales expertise. Gelbman made the move to retail technology in 2012, as an enterprise technology account manager for Oracle. Among her projects: Working with Cole Haan in its divestiture from Nike. “The project got a lot of visibility, and the success led to Oracle management tapping me for my appointment as global technology sales manager for Walmart [in 2013],” she said. She leads a team of over 30 pillar sales leads and technical specialists in Oracle’s engagement across the huge Walmart enterprise. They cover the entire data platform. Gelbman is especially proud of the work her team is doing on modern data hybrid cloud management. “I lead an extremely talented group of sales specialists, technical engineers and architects, and we’ve authored a solution for a seamlessly integrated hybrid cloud data layer comprised of disparate platforms and sources,” she said. These efforts set the tone to serve the digital, mobile customer. “Our work is not simply conceptual,” Gelbman added. “The business conversations I have every day center on modernizing and evolving the customer experience.”   Liza Landsman, Chief customer officer, Jet.com As chief customer officer of the online marketplace Jet.com, which Wal-Mart Stores acquired in September in a $3.3 billion deal, Liza Landsman has an ambitious mandate: Ensure that Jet.com reaches the broadest possible group of consumers, and that shoppers on the site have a world-class experience. Landsman joined the online startup in March 2015, bringing with her an impressive resume that includes financial services, marketing and data science. Prior to Jet.com, she was chief marketing officer for E*Trade, where she led the firm’s marketing initiatives, including customer engagement, analytics and insights, advertising, and direct online and offline marketing programs and branded campaigns. Landsman also held leadership roles at global investment firm BlackRock, where she was global managing director of digital, and at Citi, as managing director of North American consumer internet and mobile. At Jet.com, Landsman is focused on engaging potential members at a broad level, and making sure the retailer provides a seamless end-to-end customer experience. “It is important to understand — impacting what consumers [will] pay is the direct result of how our platform actually removes costs from the system rather than a focus on price, per se,” Landsman said in a Forrester blog post in 2015. “They are loving the great brands, great value and great consumer experience, and returning to build bigger and smarter baskets over and over.” Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Sears sells top brand, closing more stores Top 10 Women in Retail Tech Closing time for The Limited stores Walmart’s Jet.com acquires Zappos competitor Macy’s details store closings, restructuring amid poor holiday sales Rebecca Minkoff puts virtual mirror into shoppers hands Target axes kids’ shopping carts Unusual deal gives Aeropostale new lease on life — and it just got better Flip-Flop Shops on the move Target first out of the gate with holiday hiring plans Solutions Spotlight Taking Stock of Retail’s Analytics Capabilities When it comes to using data and analytics to drive business results, where does the retail industry stand relative to other industries?

The speech marks Trump's first formal press conference since winning the U.S. presidency in November. "We are 9 days away from the 45th president of the United States of America," vice president-elect Mike Pence said as he announced Trump. "I said that I will be the greatest job producer that god ever created, and I mean that," Trump said Wednesday, pushing that he would bring jobs and heighten the economy.  Trump also announced Wednesday that he appointed David Shulkin as head secretary of the Veteran's Administration. RELATED: Trump picks Obama appointee David Shulkin to lead VA As expected, the topic was brought up regarding recent reports that U.S. Intel chiefs informed Trump of claims Russia was attempting to compromise him. CNN reported that top-ranking U.S. Intelligence chiefs presented President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump with classified documents that contained allegations that "Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump."  RELATED: CNN: US Intel chiefs inform Trump of claims Russia attempting to compromise him Trump, when asked about the reports, said the meetings are confidential and classified. "It's all fake news. It didn't happen," Trump said, calling the reporting "a disgrace." "It was a group of opponents that got together, sick people. And they put that crap together," Trump said. "I think it's an absolute disgrace." Trump said America will form a defense by putting great "computer minds" together. "We are some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we've assembled." "Within 90 days we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense," Trump said. "The United States is hacked by everybody. That includes Russia and China and everybody," Trump continued. "We have no defense."  The president-elect said Russia will respect our country more when he is leading it. "You will see that. Russia will respect our country more." Trump promised citizens will be proud of what is being put forth regarding health care, calling Obamacare "a disaster." Deductibles are so high that people go broke just paying their premiums, Trump said. "We are doing the Democrats a great service," Trump said of removing Obamacare.  "The plan is to repeal and replace, essentially simultaneously," Trump said. "We're going to have a health care that is far less expensive, and far better."  The United States Presidential Inauguration will be the morning of Friday, Jan. 20. Copyright 2017 WBTV.

It was included for a different reason.” “It was included should they feel they needed to explain to Mr. Trump the difference between analyzed intelligence and what they are calling ‘unvetted disinformation,'” she continued. “It was available for that purpose, and it never came up. Importantly, documents were never presented to Mr. Trump or his team.” Donald Trump (Getty Images) McFadden further stated that Trump’s intelligence briefing “was an oral briefing.

The addendum was based on a 35-page memo that includes unconfirmed allegations against Trump. BuzzFeed published the 35-page memo Tuesday without confirming whether any of the allegations were true.

MUST WATCH Russia: We have no compromising information 01:39 Story highlights Trump's comments following CNN reporting released Tuesday night The reporting involved Intel community claims about Donald Trump's ties to Russia (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump lashed out at new reporting on allegations about his ties to Russia in a series of tweets Wednesday, accusing the intelligence community of leaking information to the public and asking, "are we living in Nazi Germany?" "I win an election easily, a great "movement" is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state!," Trump wrote on Twitter. I win an election easily, a great "movement" is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 "Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to "leak" into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?" he added. Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to "leak" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 Trump's tweets came in response to a major development on Tuesday night, when CNN reported that last week, classified documents presented to President Barack Obama and Trump that included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Trump, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings. RELATED: Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him Read More After Russia denied having any such information -- Putin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday called the charges "a clear attempt to harm our bilateral relationship" and a "witch hunt" -- Trump took to social media to insist that Russia had no undue influence over him. Trump wrote on Twitter, "Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is "A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE." Very unfair!" Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is "A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE." Very unfair!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 "Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!" Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 The allegations regarding Trump and Russia were presented in a two-page synopsis that was appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, reported on last Friday. The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible. The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Mr. Trump. The two-page synopsis also included allegations that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government, according to two national security officials. The classified briefings last week were presented by four of the senior-most US intelligence chiefs -- Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers. Trump is holding a pre-scheduled news conference at 11 a.m. ET Wednesday.

And we weren't totally wrong - Amazon's Alexa assistant was baked into gadgets everywhere, even in cars! But looking back at all of our coverage, there was plenty we had no idea about. This is the best stuff we saw at CES 2o17. TVs that seem to disappear  TVs are always a big draw at CES, and this year was no exception. Mercifully, the curved TV gimmick finally looks like it's on its way out. In the biggest trend to emerge, Sony, LG and Samsung all moved the core components of their flagship TV sets to outside hardware. In the case of Samsung, all of the ports and brains of its new models are housed in an outside box. Sony built the guts for its top TV into a subwoofer that doubles as a TV stand. But for my money, the most impressive TV was the new W7 from LG. This OLED TV is just 2.5mm thick — literally thinner than my finger. Everything that actually powers the TV is jammed into a futuristic-looking Dolby Atmos soundbar. I want it. LG also had a prototype OLED TV that is 40 per cent translucent. I'm not sure if I see the use case quite yet, but anything that brings us closer to Minority Report is good with me. Honda's self-balancing motorcycle Honda showed off its new Riding Assistant technology that keeps your bike balanced when it's moving at speeds less than 5km/h (like when you're pulling out of the garage or stopping at a traffic light). The tech will even work when the rider isn't on board, meaning you never have to worry about your bike falling over on its side ever again. This is still a concept, so we might never the tech in actual bikes, but it sure does look cool. Razer's insane three monitor laptop Razer showed off a lot of cool gadgets at CES, but the coolest was definitely its prototype of a gaming laptop with THREE 4K displays. That's right, this beastly laptop has three 17.3-inch displays pushing millions of pixels. It's one of the coolest things we've seen. Dubbed Project Valerie, the laptop is powered by an Intel Kaby Lake processor and Nvidia's 1080 graphics card. We just saw a prototype, but Razer says the final version will have the two side monitors slide out of the main monitor, for easy storage. If this thing does come to market — and that's a big if — prepare for it to be expensive. But price, weight and the fact that it will inevitably be hot enough to cook food doesn't even matter. It's a 12K gaming laptop. Hell yeah. Razer's futuristic Project Ariana Image: Razer Speaking of Razer, the gaming company's conceptual gaming projector promises to deliver VR-like experience without needing a VR headset. When pointed at the screen, Project Ariana's depth-sensing cameras can expand the edges of the TV onto the wall, making your game world more immersive. It can also work with the other lighting products in the room to alter colours across devices, so if a character goes into rage mode, not only does the screen go red, all the lights in your setup go red too. We won't see Project Ariana until at LEAST very late 2017, but if it can hit the market, it could be a cool alternative to VR headsets for gamers that want truly immersive experiences. Unfortunately, my Brooklyn living room isn't big enough for VR, let alone something like this, but I love it anyway. Super Game Boy is back The massive success of the NES Classic Edition proves that all of us ageing millennials are obsessed with classic gaming. And what gets more classic than Nintendo's original Game Boy? The team at Retro-Bit showed off a brand new, souped-up Game Boy that shares the same form-factor as the original, but packs in so much more. It will play original Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance cartridges. It also has a 10-hour battery life and a shatter-resistant display. The best part? This little guy is only $US80 ($109)! We can't wait to get our hands on one and relive playing the original Tetris, Super Mario Land 2 and Link's Awakening. LEGO's new robots LEGO has had robotic kits for years, but the problem is that the builds always involved a lot of work and some mild coding skills. Granted, it's a nice way to learn something new, but sometimes you just want to quickly build a robot buddy. With LEGO Boost, the lazy amongst us can finally build robotic toys. Using a companion app, you just drag and drop different actions to control the robot, rather than having to tediously code in commands. The kit comes with five different projects, including a cat, a robot, a guitar, a bulldozer and a LEGO stacking machine. Intel's Compute Card is so tiny A few years ago at CES, Intel introduced its Compute Stick, its tiny-arse computer that fits into something about the size of a Chromecast. Now Intel has something even tinier — and potentially more useful — its new Compute Card. The size and thickness of a few stacked credit cards, the Compute Card packs in a ton of power into the svelte package. You get a Kaby Lake processor, Wi-Fi, memory and storage. The idea is that you can then insert this card into a dumb monitor or other type of dock, and voila, instant computer system. Intel is hoping it can get a lot of manufacturers on board to support the Compute Card — think everything from kiosks, smart TVs and smart appliances. For TVs especially, this could provide a smart upgrade path for new kinds of apps and processes. Just swap your old Compute Card out with another. It will be a while before this hits the market. Intel's first partnership is with the Foxconn-owned Sharp, for giant displays at shopping centres and hotels. But maybe if we're lucky, one day we'll be able to just carry our computers with us in our wallets. Sony's crazy thin E Ink watch Despite being a pretty blah year for wearables — mostly because no one is buying smartwatches — Sony still showed an amazing concept for an E Ink smartwatch at CES. The concept, which was shown under glass, can change design and colour — meaning you can switch up your fashion statement depending on what you're wearing or your mood. Strikingly, the E Ink display is thinner than a credit card. If this thing ever does come to market, it might be Japanese only — but it's such a cool idea, we can't help but hope the tech makes its way into a proper product eventually.

The federation of seven sheikhdoms, founded in 1971 on the Arabian Peninsula, said it would immediately fly the nation's flag at half-staff for three days in honor of the dead from the attack Tuesday in Kandahar, which killed at least 11 people. Meanwhile, the Taliban denied planting the bomb in the Kandahar attack, which also wounded the UAE ambassador to Afghanistan. Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE prime minister and vice president, said on Twitter that "there is no human, moral or religious justification for the bombing and killing of people trying to help" others.   Abu Dhabi's powerful crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, said the attack wouldn't stop UAE's humanitarian efforts. "We will not be discouraged by despicable terrorist acts carried out by the forces of evil and darkness," he said on Twitter. The Kandahar attack targeted a guesthouse of provincial Gov Homayun Azizi, who was also wounded in the assault, along with UAE Ambassador Juma Mohammed Abdullah al-Kaabi. The attack killed 11 people and wounded 18, said Gen Abdul Razeq, Kandahar's police chief who was praying nearby at the time of the blast. Razeq said investigators believe someone hid the bomb inside a sofa at the guesthouse. He said an ongoing construction project at the guesthouse may have allowed militants to plant the bomb. "Right now we cannot say anything that who is behind this attack," he told The Associated Press, while adding that several suspects had been arrested. The attack inside the heavily guarded compound represents a major breach of security, even in Afghanistan, a country long torn by war. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Wednesday condemned the attack and ordered a probe into the incident.

A total of 64 percent of respondents said that Trump should delete the social network account, while only 32 percent of those polled said he should maintain it. The strongest negative response came from respondents aged 18 to 34, of whom over 70 percent were against the account, the poll released on Tuesday revealed. The survey, in which 899 voters participated, was conducted by telephone on January 5-9 throughout the country. The margin of error is about 3.3 percent. Trump used the social media platform during his campaign to criticize rivals and media coverage and has continued to use it to comment on foreign and economic policy, including issues such as US relations with China and Russia.

Reply Erik Trete 12:42 11.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete More whining by the loosing class. I don't answer telephone polls/surveys. I doubt I am alone. 20 Million people follow Trump's twitter. That is about 35% of the registered voters in the US. Sure, some of his followers are not US citizens, but I doubt that many people outside the US care enough to follow him. I doubt even more that people who don't vote, bother to follow Trump and even more that even half of the people who don't follow him care enough to want him to stop.Show new comments (0) Сomment Reply in reply to(Show commentHide comment) | | Edit | Delete Save Thank you!

Citing "multiple" unnamed US officials with direct knowledge of the meeting, CNN said the intelligence chiefs presented a two-page synopsis on the potential embarrassment for the incoming president along with their classified briefing on Friday on alleged Russian interference in the presidential election. President Barack Obama was also briefed on the issue on Thursday. CNN gave no details of what the so-called compromising information is, but said knowledge of its existence in Russian hands originally came from a former British MI-6 intelligence operative hired by other US presidential contenders to do political "opposition research" on Trump in the middle of last year. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had been given the information in August, more than two months before the November 8 election, according to CNN. "What has changed since then is that US intelligence agencies have now checked out the former British intelligence operative and his vast network throughout Europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough to include some of the information in the presentations" to Trump, CNN said. The existence of the information on Trump in Russian hands has been rumored since before the election.  The rumors gained support when the then Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, said in a letter to FBI Director James Comey a week before the vote: "It has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government -– a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information." In the Friday briefing Trump was also told by the intelligence officials -- the heads of the Directorate of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency -- of allegations that supporters of his White House campaign had a "continuing exchange of information" with intermediaries for the Russian government during the election. Asked about this in a Senate hearing Tuesday, Comey refused to confirm or deny that his agency was investigating such links. US intelligence has concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an operation to meddle in the US election to hurt the campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton with embarrassing hacked emails, and then to boost Trump when they thought he had a chance to win. Trump has repeatedly dismissed the conclusion that Moscow influenced the election while expressing the need to smooth over bilateral relations deeply strained during the Obama presidency.   Related russia CNN fbi donald trump Legal Notice: Copyright, trade marks and other intellectual property rights in this website can not be reproduced without the prior permission.

It’s Americans I Hate. “A vote cast for Trump is kind of like … FEMINISM: Madonna: Trump Presidency Is Like A Bad Breakup…. » January 10, 2017 HMM: Yikes: Intel chiefs told Trump Russia claims to have compromising personal and financial information on him; Update: CNN video added; Update: Memos leaked to BuzzFeed. Meanwhile, people on Twitter are claiming the original source is actually a 4Chan prank, which ordinarily would be absurd, but these days, well, who knows? Meanwhile, of course, Trump has survived so many scandals that it’s hard to imagine what would count as “compromising.” But stay tuned. This may well be “Fake News,” but it’s not as if Trump and Putin haven’t been friendly. However, every time we’ve had word of the big pending scandal that will definitely kill off Trump’s presidency this time, it’s been a bust. And if it by some chance does work out that way? Enjoy President Pence, Dems! UPDATE: 4Chan Claims To Have Fabricated Anti-Trump Report As A Hoax. Related: Fake News: BuzzFeed Runs ‘Unverifiable’ Trump-Russia Claims. “BuzzFeed acknowledges that it has not verified the accusations and even notes that the document contains a number of basic factual errors. Yet it published the full document.” Question: Did they run the question of publishing claims that they admit are “unverifiable” by libel counsel? Because while Trump is probably the world’s ultimate “public figure,” well . . . . Most damning: “Even Mother Jones declined to publish the full details and dossier.” If this collapses, as it likely will, it will have the effect of making Trump pretty much scandal-proof. Related: Maybe the whole thing is a Trump “False Flag” operation! The truth is out there! ANOTHER UPDATE: The Lawfare Blog: Take A Deep Breath. “First, we have no idea if any of these allegations are true. Yes, they are explosive; they are also entirely unsubstantiated, at least to our knowledge, at this stage. For this reason, even now, we are not going to discuss the specific allegations within the document. Second, while unproven, the allegations are being taken quite seriously.” MORE: From the comments: “A friend pointed this out: In this ‘report,’ British intelligence describes events surrounding the ‘World Cup Soccer tournament.’ Soccer. Let’s repeat that… Soccer!! What self-respecting Brit would call the biggest sporting event in the world a ‘soccer tournament?'” A rational one that recognizes that Third World Kickball is barely even a sport? But yeah, point taken.

It adds the first touchscreen that any Mac has had, updates to new(er) Intel processors and AMD graphics, and makes a swathe of behind-the-scenes usability changes. It's the sum total of those small changes, though — not the new processing power or the not-exactly-amazing battery life — that make the new MacBook Pro a worthwhile purchase if you're considering one. What Is It? The late-2016-into-2017 Apple MacBook Pro is the first design refresh in four years for the most powerful portable notebook that Apple currently produces. It's thinner and lighter than the now very outdated MacBook Air, aggressively abandons old connection standards in favour of USB Type-C across the board, and upgrades to a brighter and more colourful display and a much, much larger Force Touch trackpad. And, of course, it runs macOS. You're able to buy a MacBook Pro from a starting price of $2199 in Australia for an entry-level 13-inch model, which you can spec up to $2999 for the top 13-inch or as much as $4249 for the best possible 15-inch variant. That $2199 won't get you the new MacBook Pro's most talked-about feature, though; the cheapest Touch Bar-enabled MBP is $2699 in Oz. 13-inch models get a Core i5 CPU and 256GB or 512GB SSD as default, while the 15-inchers have Core i7s; you can spec any machine up to an i7 and larger SSD, though, although the best processors and 2TB SSDs are restricted to 15-inch only. The Touch Bar is an interesting compromise between a touchscreen laptop display — as seen on Apple's direct competitor from Microsoft, the Surface Book — and good ol' fashioned keyboard buttons. It replaces the old row of 12 function keys on the previous MacBook Pro with a fully customisable, touch-sensitive OLED panel with TouchID. It's still an interesting move by Apple not to make the Pro laptop touch-enabled across its entire screen, but that's a move that would require significant work on its macOS operating system as well as on the hardware level. Those USB-C ports are all multipurpose, too — you can use them all for charging, for data, or video, or any other transfer standard that USB-C supports, as long as you have the right cable or a dongle. Apple claims up to 10 hours of battery life from all of the different MacBook Pro 13- and 15-inch models in its regular wireless web browsing tests, but it's worth noting that the new 87-Watt power adapter that connects over USB-C will charge the laptop much faster than its predecessor. I'll go into detail on my varied experiences of the MacBook Pro's off-charger battery life performance later on, but I will say now that when you visit a charger to top up you'll get plenty of battery reserve back very quickly. What's It Good At? The biggest and most important updates to the new MacBook Pro, I think, aren't under the hood: they're on the outside. Most obvious is the noticeable improvement in usability that the new MacBook Pro's keyboard and trackpad bring. It's absolutely true that there's a not-exactly-shallow learning curve to using the Pro's incredibly short-travel keyboard, which it has inherited from the 12-inch retina MacBook, but once you're used to the key positioning, it's a joy to use. I can blast through emails and longer articles — like this review — at a greater speed and with greater accuracy on the MacBook Pro's keyboard than on the Logitech mechanical keyboard that I use on my desktop PC daily. The Touch Bar is an interesting development, and while it definitely feels like a first-generation device — it's not incredibly high resolution, it doesn't have bespoke controls in every app — it's also a very very smart idea. Having a fully customisable panel in front of your fingerprints means keyboard autocomplete and autocorrect is instantly as easy as it is on an iPhone, choosing an emoji from the list that pops up is simple, and apps like Photoshop that have integrated Touch Bar support do it very well. Being able to choose a colour by swiping your finger across the panel is a quantum leap over a keyboard. And the larger trackpad is equally as important. It's massive, and that helps a lot for general navigation around MacOS as well as gestures like pinching and zooming around apps like Maps. The new screen, too, is much brighter, and that's a godsend whenever you're working anywhere that you can't control the lighting within. It's two thirds brighter than the last generation at 500 nits, and that level also means it's one of the brighter easily-portable laptops out there. If you need a notebook that you can work on while you're out in a cafe, while you're sitting outside, while you're travelling on a train or a bus on the way to work in the morning, the MacBook Pro kicks ass. It supports DCI-P3 wide colour and has two thirds more contrast than the last generation, but what you need to know is that it just looks good. Being smaller and thinner and lighter means that the MacBook Pro — and remember this is a Pro, with a full-fat Intel processor and fast storage and discrete graphics on the 15-inch model, not the lightweight Core M of the 12-inch MacBook — is actually portable. It's the first iteration of the MacBook Pro that I'd actually carry to work and back with me every day, in the same way that I've been doing currently with the Surface Pro 4. You don't make the usual sacrifices of thin and light laptops, either — for example, the MacBook Pro has speakers that don't sound terrible. What's It Not Good At? Over the past couple of weeks of road-testing, the battery life of the MacBook Pro has been... mediocre. Not abysmal, but just not particularly impressive. It's understandable, though: the new MacBook Pro has more going on than the old one ever did. A lot of that comes from the extra power required by that massively bright 500-nit screen and the Touch Bar and the better backlighting of the redesigned keyboard, as well as the more powerful processor and new discrete graphics. With the screen at high brightness and wireless working away actively, I've seen battery life in the region of five hours, half of Apple's testing. For what it's worth, recharging that battery with the fast USB-C charger happens quickly. Apple's timing for the update of the MacBook Pro means that it uses Intel's sixth-generation Skylake mobile processors, rather than the seventh-generation Kaby Lake chips that are starting to appear in competitor notebooks post-CES. That's a pity, because the new chips are both more powerful and more energy-efficient. That doesn't make the MacBook Pro any less good, but it does mean that there will be competing machines from the likes of Razer and Dell and Lenovo that may have superior battery life or more outright grunt. The switch to Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C is a Good Thing, and I won't hear anyone else say otherwise. I'm not blinkered enough to think that it's not going to be a difficult thing, though, for anyone considering an upgrade that still has a legacy device that they need to plug in regularly. Anything with a standard USB connector will need an adapter, any non Thunderbolt 3-compatible monitor will need a converter on its cable. It's possible to upgrade other components of your setup when you buy a new MacBook, but that's just an extra cost to consider. And it's one small price to pay for the relentless march of technology, but have you noticed that the new MacBook Pro doesn't have that beautiful glowing Apple logo on the top of its lid any more? I miss it. Should You Buy It? The new MacBook Pro is, in so many ways, a huge and quantum improvement over its predecessor. It's smaller and thinner and lighter and has a brighter screen and a better keyboard and a bigger trackpad and more powerful processor and you can unlock it with your fingerprint. If you've used a MacBook Pro from the last generation or two generations ago, every one of these improvements should be useful to you in some way. But the road to the future is paved with difficulties and failures along the way. You have the potential to use the new MacBook Pro's batter faster than you could on the older models. The Touch Bar still feels like a work in progress, and you'll probably have to wait for your favourite Mac app to make the best possible use of it in the months and years to come. You'll need new cables or bulky dongles, for now at least, to use those Thunderbolt 3 ports. It's worth it, but it's not an entirely painless upgrade.

When new versions of laptops are released they will have better hardware so I'm confused how you can say this will make it better when every company that design a laptop does the same, HP, Dell, Microsoft and so many other companies.

Your defence of it doesn't exactly make sense, either, as newer CPUs and GPUs are far more power-efficient than older models and the OLED used in the Touch Bar should be very power-efficient, too. When Microsoft can release a new Surface Book with 14 hour battery life, Apple should be able to at least come close with this if they hope to remain relevant. And, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Samsung have a Series 9 laptop with a 500 nit screen four or five years ago?

Would you care to elaborate on exactly how this works, Campbell? If this is true, then Apple's marketing is missing a big trick because there must be something truly magical in keys that feel like buttons, that nobody but you has discovered. Seriously, the best keyboard in the universe is not going to magically make me type faster or more accurately than the keyboard I use every day, assuming that keyboard doesn't have some fatal flaw. I just can't see how it's possible without some level of revolutionary design or some incredible innovation. One of my colleagues, who is a touch typist and complete Mac fanboi, told me the problem he has with the new keyboard is that it is too sensitive, so his touch-typing method results in too many unintended key presses. This is from a guy who has never previously said anything even midly critical of anything Apple have ever done and has drunk th eKool-Aid like it is going out of fashion - iPhone, iPad Air, iPad Pro, MacBook Pro and iMac. "The switch to Thunderbolt 34 and USB Type-C is a Good Thing, and I won't hear anyone else say otherwise." Then you are simply refusing to listen to reason and commn sense. What makes infinitely more sense is to do what Dell have done with their XPS machines - offer both the new Thunderbolt/Type C port and standard USB 3 ports to allow users transition to the new standard in their own time. e.g. I am not ditching my Samsung T1 drive just because a laptop manufacturer can't be arsed to put in USB 3 and adding a dongle to it would make it unreasonably awkward for zero benefit. Last edited January 11, 2017 2:49 pm Reply 0 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson AUTHOR Jan 11, 2017, 4:14pm For the kind of typing that I do -- bottoming out, full power, blast away at the keys touch typing -- keys with shorter travel work really well, as long as they have a strongly tactile feel. And because the MBP's keyboard is both really tactile and has short travel, I can type quickly on it. I don't have to lift my fingers so much when I'm moving between keys, for example, which I have to when I'm typing on a traditional keyboard to avoid accidentally striking the wrong keys. Reply 1 MotorMouth @motormouth Jan 12, 2017, 10:18am I also tend to hit the keys very hard, as I learned to type on a mechanical typewriter, and what would worry me about using the new keyboard is that my fingertips would get very sore from the lack of travel. It is little different to banging on a plank of wood. I found that I could feel it even after just typing a paragraph in a shop. I can't imagine how my fingers would feel after a full day of using it.

Apart from the money its bad for the environment. Also I assume you were using a full spect 15" model. Is battery life better with one of the more basic 13" models? Reply 0 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson AUTHOR Jan 11, 2017, 4:11pm I was on a mid-spec 13in. By my estimation the 15-inch would be worse due to the larger (relative) screen to battery ratio and the discrete graphics. Reply 0 klaw @klaw Jan 11, 2017, 5:18pm Not to mention the 15" models are the only ones with a quad-core CPU, which would alsouse more battery power. And if I recall correctly, the GPU in the 15" model is not switchable, so it runs full-time rather than using integrated GPU for low-power tasks. Reply 0 mitemoii @mitemoii Jan 11, 2017, 3:40pm Compared to the last MacBook Pro and even competitors such as the XPS, I really do not see this as an improvement at all (coming from a current Mac user). "Thinner and brighter" are not sufficient replacements for such a major decrease in battery life compared to the last model, I don't know many people who use their MacBooks at max brightness so an increased brightness does not mean much. The Touch Bar seems like a waste of space for anyone who actually knows what they're doing with programs such as photoshop or illustrator as the keyboard shortcuts for actions will already be much faster to use for them than reaching to the top of the screen to swipe or scroll on a touch bar. The keyboard is horrible and while it is an improvement over the "MacBook" keyboard, it is nothing compared to their last generation Pro keyboard. Lack of ports is also horrible, I understand and agree with moving forward with ports but to completely just cut out support is bad. Most current windows laptops include at least a usb 3.0 port with usb-c or a free dongle, this laptop has neither of these and would rather charge a premium. A horrible product and a seemingly bias review. Reply 2 dazzler @dazzler3622 Jan 12, 2017, 8:11am A horrible product and a seemingly bias review. Recently I've noticed pretty much every Gizmodo review of apple products barely mentions competitors, it only compares it to the previous model. Agree on the ports, USB-C is nowhere near mainstream in our market, the laptop might be thinner and look nice on its own but once you add all the cables, adapters, dongles etc to make it a functional piece of equipment it looks awful and is a nightmare to transport. Each to their own I guess! Reply 1 ionchef @ionchef Jan 12, 2017, 9:39am It's hard to compare when you don't have a 5 year old laptop lying around to compare it too. Reply 0 mitemoii @mitemoii Jan 12, 2017, 12:40pm Seeing that I'm reading a Technology focused blog that have continuously published comparisons between 13-inch laptops for the past few months, I would expect that it is well within their ability to compare it to similar laptops such as the XPS or Razer Blade Stealth (Even though the use of last generation's processor in the MacBook makes it a bit harder). When the last paragraph of the review is "Should you buy it?", if they are trying to help customers make an informed opinion of a product, they should be informing customers about superior products that exist at a lower price. Reply 0 ionchef @ionchef Jan 12, 2017, 2:08pm I agree completely, but honestly unless you are desperate to use OSX or hang with the cool kids why would you even bother with reading a Mac review. They are always slightly better/worse than the last one and not as functionally or economically good as the competition so best not mention them. Reply 0 mitemoii @mitemoii Jan 12, 2017, 3:27pm I can see your point and agree, I'm just someone who currently owns two MacBooks, one for personal use and one required by my workplace. It was interesting to read about what Gizmodo thought about the new models. I love my 2015 pro which was only $1500 when I bought it new compared to the $2200 for the non-touch bar model and $2700 for the touch bar model. That's $1200 more to get the full improvements of the new models, it just doesn't look like there is anything in it worthy of upgrading to compared to the current windows ultrabooks. Reply 1 jaded @jaded Jan 12, 2017, 10:06am The Touch Bar seems like a waste of space for anyone who actually knows what they're doing with programs such as photoshop or illustrator as the keyboard shortcuts for actions will already be much faster to use for them than reaching to the top of the screen to swipe or scroll on a touch bar. Lol. Man making adjustments in PS / Lightroom is a treat with the touch bar. Much nicer to slide a slider than clicking and dragging with a mouse... and without having to cover the screen with your hand... awesom! Reply 0 MotorMouth @motormouth Jan 12, 2017, 10:25am Why? It seems like two very similar ways of achieving the exact same thing, except that using your mouse doesn't require you to look away from your screen, where locating a slider on the Touch Bar definitely does. It's an interruption to your workflow, not an enhancement. Reply 1 jaded @jaded Jan 12, 2017, 10:36am Okay. Thanks for telling me how much worse my workflow is now that I have a new MacBook.

Reply 1 felicitous_blue @felicitous_blue Jan 12, 2017, 10:20am Issues of OS and brand loyalty aside, why would you buy this over something like the Razer Blade? Similar price and form factor, much better performance in the competitor. Wasn't there an article to that effect recently here on Gizmondo? Seriously curious, when I was looking myself (back in late 2015) my initial impulse and reason for looking was I wanted a MacBook but ended up going with a Blade as it gave so much more bang-for-buck. Reply 1 tjv82c @tjv82c Jan 12, 2017, 1:03pm For me it is because of OSX. The Blade with it's external GPU enclosure would be perfect for me, fixing a lot of shortcomings the Apple lineup has... but I enjoy using OSX for my personal tasks. I have plenty of Win 10 machines available to me, but my MacBook is the machine I use the most, it just works the best for what I need it for. I haven't really had a chance to use the keyboard on the new MBP's just yet, but I love the keyboard on the 12" MBP... I can type a lot faster than I can on most other keyboards I have previously owned. Reply 0 thefong @thefong Jan 12, 2017, 1:48pm I'm curious why anyone wanting to spend idiotic amounts on a skinny metal laptop would buy this over a Razer Blade. If you really need Apple software, dual boot it, or bootcamp it, would take 20min max to do. Better price, better specs by a mile. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Linux Kernel 4.9.2 Improves Support for AMD Radeon HD 8000 Series, Dell XPS 17 GO Adds force_native quirk for Dell XPS 17 L702X laptop Jan 11, 2017 00:08 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  The Linux kernel is seeing a lot of improvements lately, yes again, and the newest stable Linux 4.9 series has already received its second point release, two days after Greg Kroah-Hartman's announcement for Linux kernel 4.9.1. With the availability of Linux kernel 4.9.1, users are now finally able to migrate from other kernel series to Linux 4.9, which is the most advanced version available on the market. But do not bother to attempt a compilation of Linux kernel 4.9.1 because Linux kernel 4.9.2 is already here, bringing lots of improvements. From the appended shortlog, we can't help but notice that there's now better support for AMD Radeon HD 8000 series of graphics cards, and it just happens that we have a laptop with hybrid AMD/Intel GPUs running an AMD Radeon HD 8750 discrete card. So, like many of you out there, this comes as good news to us. There are a total of 141 files changed in the Linux 4.9.2 kernel, with 1031 insertions and 438 deletions, so you can imagine that there are quite a few improvements, in particular to the AMDGPU, Nouveau, Intel i915, InfiniBand, DVB, MMC, wireless (many Atheros and Realtek fixes), SCSI (s390 too), thermal, staging, and TTY drivers. "I'm announcing the release of the 4.9.2 kernel. All users of the 4.9 kernel series must upgrade. The updated 4.9.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-4.9.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=summary," said Greg Kroah-Hartman. It's already in Arch Linux Testing, and it's coming soon to other rolling distros Some ACPI improvements are there as well in Linux kernel 4.9.2, bringing better support for the Dell XPS 17 L702X and HP Pavilion dv6 notebooks, and there's also improved support for the NFS file system, and the ARC, ARM64/AArch64, PowerPC (PPC), s390, and x86 hardware architectures. Other than that, it looks like the networking stack was updated with small mac80211, Ceph, SunRPC, vmw_vsock, and wireless enhancements. Linux kernel 4.9.2 is available for download right now, either via our web portal or directly from kernel.org, if you fancy compiling your own kernel from sources. If not, it should soon be available in the stable repositories of various rolling distributions, including Arch Linux (now in testing) and Solus (also in testing). And considering the fact that the Linux 4.8 series reached end of life, we recommend switching to Linux 4.9 as soon as possible. #Linux kernel 4.9.2#AMD Radeon HD 8000#Linux 4.9.2#Dell XPS 17#AMDGPU subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news GitHub Unveils Atom 1.13 Hackable Text Editor, Makes It Easy to Reopen Projects Wine-Staging 2.0 RC4 Improves FlipToGDISurface DirectDraw Handling, Adds Fixes Security OS Kodachi Linux 3.7 Released with Anonymous Wallpapers, Improvements User Asks Canonical to Backport Mesa 13.0.2 Stable for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS HWE It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Debian GNU/Linux 8.7 "Jessie" Live & Installable ISOs Now Available for Download - Exclusive Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs    Linux kernel 4.9.2 released New Linux Apps Q4OS: A Linux desktop operating system that features a minimal desktop environment and package selection Debian GNU/Linux: The Debian GNU Linux operating system, one of the oldest and influential Linux OSes Debian Live: Create your own Debian GNU/Linux system with this standard Live edition of the operating system Debian Live Xfce: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution with the Xfce desktop environment Debian Live MATE: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution built around the MATE desktop environment Debian Live LXDE: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux operating system, using the LXDE desktop environment Debian Live KDE: A Live flavor of Debian GNU/Linux, featuring the popular KDE desktop environment Reader comments It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It more on: openSUSE Leap 42.2 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

According to CNN, the synopsis was partially based on memos assembled by an ex-British intelligence operative. The media, however, noted, that the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) is still examining the accuracy of these allegations. Last week, US Intelligence Community released a public version of a comprehensive intelligence report assessing Russian activities and intentions related to the 2016 US presidential election. The report accused Russia of trying to influence the election. After being briefed on the report, Trump said the DNC hack did not have an impact on the election outcome. Russia has repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues. ...

Self-driving cars are emerging as the Next Big Thing in tech, but striking out on your own can be difficult, meaning you'll probably need a gig at Google, Uber, or a major auto maker to really dig in and make progress—until now. The DeepDrive project came up with a unique way to let tech-savvy types tinker with autonomous driving tech—it repurposed popular video game Grand Theft Auto V as a self-driving car simulator. Companies like Intel have been playing around with it, but now it's open source thanks to an integration with Universe, which emerged last month as "a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites and other applications." The Universe integration with GTA V comes courtesy of OpenAI, a non-profit research company launched in 2015 by Elon Musk and others. "To use it, you'll just need a purchased copy of GTA V, and then your Universe agent will be able to start driving a car around the streets of a high-fidelity virtual world," OpenAI said in a blog post. That "agent" was "trained via imitation learning on 21 hours (about 600,000 images) on the game's AI driving," according to OpenAI. "The baseline agent can drive in a variety of different weather conditions, react to traffic, and keep to its lane. This agent is a start, which we invite the community to improve upon!" Related 5 Killer Features in Grand Theft Auto V 5 Killer Features in Grand Theft Auto V Those familiar with the game might wonder if the simulation will stumble upon prostitutes and gang members looking for a fight. Sorry, adrenaline junkes, the "integration modifies the behavior of people within GTA V to be non-violent," said OpenAI. Not to worry; there's still plenty to explore minus the gun battles. "GTA V gives researchers access to a rich, diverse world for testing and developing AI. Its island setting is almost one fifth the size of Los Angeles, giving access to a broad range of scenarios to test systems," OpenAI said. "Add to that the 257 different vehicles, 7 types of bicycles, and 14 weather types, and its possible to explore a huge number of permutations using a single simulator."

Chesto means business Spotlight on Boston’s income inequality: His colleagues on the City Council came to talk about a helipad proposal in South Boston. But Tito Jackson’s eyes were on something bigger. Jackson criticized the helipad, a priority of Mayor Marty Walsh’s and a promise made to General Electric. Who will pay for it, Jackson asked during that November meeting, and how does it help the “regular people of Boston” struggling with their bills? Using public money for the project, he added, makes no sense in such a hot real estate market. He declared that it was time to spread the love through all corners of the city. Advertisement Although the city councilor waited until this week to announce his candidacy for mayor, it was clear to many people on that November night that he was ready to run. Walsh has a huge war chest and the advantage of being the incumbent. But Jackson’s focus on the maddening gap between the haves and have-nots could give him his own edge. He took aim at the helipad, and the other incentives used to attract GE, during his formal announcement on Thursday. Landing GE should go in Walsh’s win column, even after the $25 million in tax breaks. The 800 headquarters jobs. The millions for schools. The boost in prestige. That’s all good. But Jackson’s ambitions underscore one of Boston’s biggest unresolved problems -- how poverty and its crippling byproducts continue in the shadows of luxury condo towers.

Sign up for more newsletters here Trump puts the spotlight on Maine: Linda Bean appeared on the Fox Business Network complaining about how her family’s business, L.L. Bean, was being mistreated because of her support for Donald Trump. The president-elect didn’t waste much time trying to show Bean some love. On Twitter, of course. View Story Tito Jackson makes run for mayor official The 41-year-old Jackson made the announcement at a Thursday news conference. The Globe’s Adam Vaccaro and Nicole Hernandez wrote how Trump tweeted his support for Bean, urging his followers to ignore calls to boycott the iconic Maine retailer. In his tweet, he used Bean’s handle for her personal business, Linda Bean’s Perfect Maine. That’s a separate company that includes at least one restaurant and an art gallery, and promotes the ‘lobsticle,’ a marinated lobster tail on a stick. Trump’s pro-L.L. Bean tweet means Globe columnist Yvonne Abraham actually agrees with the Donald on one thing: She penned a column in today’s Globe calling the L.L. Bean boycott a silly idea. Advertisement Boston’s towering ambitions: As if the developers behind the Winthrop Square skyscraper didn’t have enough to worry about dealing with shadows over the Common. Now, the Massachusetts Port Authority is raising an alarm about the building’s proposed 775-foot height, saying it could interfere with Logan Airport’s flight paths. The Globe’s Tim Logan writes about how Massport will oppose any height above 710 feet for that site. Developer Millennium Partners certainly was aware of both issues when it bid on the job. Concerns about shadows and flight paths also came up when Steve Belkin and Tom Menino tried a decade ago to build a 1,000-foot tall tower on the site, home to a now-shuttered city-owned garage that once offered the best parking deals in the downtown. Cutting the Millennium tower down to 710 feet would lop four or five stories off the top, not a deal killer for the $1 billion project. But it could reduce the size of the city’s $150 million-plus payday. The accidental media mogul?: Few Massachusetts executives have ended up in the middle of a boardroom saga as dramatic as the one Shari Redstone is navigating right now. Michael Wolff of the Hollywood Reporter gets readers up to speed as Redstone plots separate paths for Viacom and CBS, two companies controlled by her family. Wolff paints a picture of a daughter who has risen to the challenge left by her ailing father, Sumner Redstone. Initially, the two Redstones had hoped to combine CBS and Viacom, the weaker of the two companies. The article delves into the details about why that merger isn’t going to happen, and how Redstone might just be the manager Viacom needs to ensure it can go it alone successfully. Room for new taxes: Airbnb has been begging state officials to tax the company for months. Sounds crazy, but it makes perfect sense. The home rental startup wants to head off potentially more onerous rules here that it has seen crop up elsewhere. Turns out, Governor Charlie Baker is ready to oblige. The Globe’s Curt Woodward reports about how the Baker administration is backing a plan that would impose the state’s 5.7 percent hotel tax on landlords who rent out their homes for more than five months each year. (Cities and towns could then impose local hotel taxes as well.) This is aimed at people who have turned their rentals into a viable business, and leaves second-home owners who rent out their Cape places for the summer unscathed. Of course, this is just the first salvo in this legislative session’s debate. We still need to hear from the House and the Senate. But by including the idea in his upcoming budget proposal, Baker increases the likelihood that this issue will be resolved by the start of the new fiscal year in July. From throwing to pitching: Tom Brady took advantage of his mandatory time off last year to work on ads for Foot Locker and Shields Health Care. Silicon Valley Business Journal reporter Jennifer Elias reports that No. 12 has added another sponsor to his playbook: chip maker Intel. The Intel ad shows Brady getting ready in the morning. The real goal, though, is to show off Intel’s 360 replay technology, presumably for watching football players do more exciting things than brushing their teeth or flipping pancakes. Meanwhile, intrepid Globe reporter Dugan Arnett tries out Under Armour’s Athlete Recovery Sleepwear that Brady endorses, to see if the Brady magic wears off on him. Unsurprisingly, Brady’s agent declined to put Brady on the phone when Arnett rang him up about the stunt. Trending pick Fiat Chrysler may have a VW problem: In one of its last big actions under President Barack Obama’s leadership, the Environmental Protection Agency accused the automaker of using software that enabled some of its diesel trucks to cheat on emissions tests. The Washington Post reports that Fiat Chrysler denies the accusations, but the company’s shares still took a tumble.

The dreams of an Internet of Things-enabled home, a place where devices talk to you and each other, are now becoming a reality. Something like 5 percent of US homes contain a product that uses Amazon’s Alexa speech recognition system. Amazon says it’s not recording what’s happening in your home - just what you ask Alexa. But Bray points out that the emergence of smart devices throughout the home will bring us a new array of things that keep tabs on us: what we watch, when we drive, when we run the shower. And this evolution of technology represents a new threat to our privacy. This Talking Points newsletter was edited by Jon Chesto, filling in for the unflappable George Brennan.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues New MacBook Pros stop Apple’s skid in worldwide PC shipments Agam Shah 13 January, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Apple’s new MacBook Pros have put the brakes on a free-fall of Mac shipments globally, though they haven’t provided the significant boost the company was looking for. The company’s Mac shipments totalled 5.3 million units during the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline of just 0.9 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015. That compares favourably to overall Mac shipments in 2016, which totalled 18.4 million units, a decline of 9.8 percent compared to 2015, according to IDC. Apple launched the new MacBook Pros in late October, and it was considered a significant upgrade. Had the new MacBook Pros shipped for all three months, the quarterly growth may have jumped up to flat or positive territory. But that’s still not an encouraging sign for MacBook Pros, which haven’t provided an overwhelming boost to worldwide Mac shipments. Apple will share its Mac shipment numbers during an earnings call on 31 January. Apple’s shipment numbers haven’t always agreed with figures from research firms like IDC and Gartner. The MacBook Pros were met with mixed reviews. They had new features like the Touch Bar, which received a lukewarm reaction. The Macs were also criticised for including Intel’s older Skylake chips and not the newer Kaby Lake chips. Windows PCs and Chromebooks are performing better. Apple was the fourth-largest PC maker in the world behind Lenovo, HP and Dell, all of which recorded positive shipment growth during the fourth quarter of 2016. Nevertheless, Apple’s Mac shipments are recovering, and it comes at a time when PC shipments are also stabilising. PC shipments in the fourth quarter totalled 70.2 million, declining by just 1.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015, according to IDC. The numbers include traditional PCs and not devices with detachable keyboards, which are considered tablets. Competing analyst firm Gartner has predicted PC shipments will go through minor quarterly declines until returning to positive growth in 2017. One reason for the recovery was a clear delineation of product categories. Tablets aren’t considered competition anymore, and many customers are returning to laptops and desktops for their primary computing needs. Gaming PCs have thrived in the last year as interest in virtual reality and eSports grows. Holiday deals boosted PC sales in the US and Europe, and the consumer PC market is recovering, IDC said. Shipments also were robust in China as buyers moved to thin and light devices. Lenovo’s PC shipments totalled 15.7 million, growing by 1.7 percent and maintaining a 22.4 percent market share. HP’s shipments totalled 15.27 million, growing by 6.6 percent, a 21.7 percent market share. Dell recorded the biggest quarterly gain with its shipments growing by 8.6 percent to 11 million units. Asus was the fifth largest PC maker behind Apple, and its shipments declined by 11.3 percent to 5.1 million units. In 2016, shipments of PCs totalled 260 million units, declining by 5.7 percent compared to 2015.

Remember the story about the car-chasing dog who finally caught one and didn't know what to do with it after he caught it? That may well define the plight of the Republicans. After years of lamenting and lambasting Obamacare, they are now in a position to do something about it -- but what? Why not do something that allows both Democrats and Republicans to claim a moral victory? Here are some thoughts based on over 40 years of health care experience: Ditch the name Obamacare. It's a lighting rod to most Republicans, as well as many insurance companies, physicians/providers and patients. Rename it. After all, it is the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Call it U.S. Care or something else. There are some features of the ACA that are very worthwhile; identify and keep them. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. This is a time to swallow pride and put citizens first. Study successful health care models that have persevered in spite of their faults. There are good reasons why far-from-perfect Medicare has been around for over 50 years. It merits being studied. Make meaningful changes slowly and incrementally, being careful to get buy-in along the way. No one likes overnight changes. Allow for critical feedback for proposed changes. This is a rare opportunity to do some good. Keep campaign promises and put partisan politics aside. As Rocky Balboa said, "Go for it!" Harold Whittington, Garland Regulation vs. protection Re: "Let's protect our resources," by Judy Welch, Sunday Letters. Welch wants regulation to be called protection, which I think is an excellent idea. After all, the definition of regulate is to make regular and orderly, but regulations tend to function as roadblocks. Government is supposed to operate with the consent of the governed. I don't recall agreeing to any of those rules. Most were written by lobbyists for special interests. My freedom is restricted, and someone else is protected. In my opinion, Obamacare protects insurance company profits by requiring us to buy unwanted coverages from a select few providers within one state. Dodd-Frank protects Wall Street by forcing out smaller banks and making larger ones too big to fail. Business and labor regulations often protect established firms from new competitors. Regulations on charter schools and vouchers protect public school monopolies. A generation ago, regulations protected major airlines, three broadcast networks, one phone company and the post office. Using the word protection brings up an important question: Just who is being protected? In most cases, it isn't we the people. Ken Ashby, Dallas Appalled at front page pick Re: "Sources: Trump in spy report -- Officials: Intel briefing included unverified reports that Russia had compromising information on him," Wednesday news story. My husband and I were appalled at this front page story that The Dallas Morning News chose to pick up from The New York Times. Frankly, what we feel is fake news does not belong anywhere in a newspaper. By The Times'own admission in the article, they were not able to confirm what they wrote. And they admitted that even the intelligence officials who released it could not confirm any of it. And yet, The News chose this as what you wanted to feature on your front page? Do you realize how low you have sunk? Your politics continue to show and this is why we feel the mainstream media cannot be trusted anymore. Pat and Ron Justice, Prosper Set three-term limit Re: "Cruz is right about term limits," by Adrian Raymer, Tuesday Letters. I, too, am no Ted Cruz fan, but I agree that we need term limits. In fact, I thought we would have them by now, because that was one of the top items on the tea party agenda several years ago as they were elected to Congress in droves. But, alas, they got one look at that six-figure salary, and at those unique, generous benefits, and at those seemingly endless perks, and they snuggled down into those comfy seats to stay. Members of Congress will give you reasons against term limits that range from serious to LOL ridiculous. Indeed, there have been many Republican and Democratic members who have served nearly lifetime terms, which have benefited their constituents and the country at large. But today, we the people would have more faith in our governing bodies if there was a healthy turnover of members. Terms should not be too short because that destroys continuity. Three terms for any member of Congress should work. That also goes for state legislatures, city councils and any other public governing body. Kay de Wit, North Dallas Standing with Obama over Syria Re: "Syria is a stain on Obama legacy -- David Greenberg: Historians rarely overlook the loss of U.S. influence," Sunday Points. Professor Greenberg of Rutgers University is a presidential historian. He believes that future generations will judge President Barack Obama poorly because he failed to stop the carnage associated with the fall of Aleppo. American warplanes did intervene on behalf of rebels attempting to depose the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. Russian warplanes countered by intervening in support of Assad. I suppose the good professor would rank Obama more highly if we had actually gone to war with Russia. Many see the United States as the world's policeman. They see it as our job to prevent humanitarian disasters around the globe even if we have to start a war to do it. Presidential historians, in particular, seem to like wartime presidents. George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt come to mind. Truly, these were great presidents by any measure. They fought good wars and won. Greenberg complains of "the loss of American influence around the world" due to "Obama's ineffectuality." I must stand with Obama on this one. Loss of influence be hanged. No war with Russia would be a good war. Jesse David Wall, Lewisville Risk of death is 100 percent Re: "Any exercise cuts risk of death -- 1-2 workouts a week are nearly as good as daily routine, report shows," Tuesday news story. I suppose these sorts of things sometimes happen because one is trying to be succinct, but also because one is not thinking clearly. In this front page article headline, I think the writer meant to say that exercise may cut the risk of what we call premature or early death. As far as I know, no amount of exercise will cut the risk of death for anyone on the planet, which I believe to still be 100 percent, despite medical advances and increased understanding of diet and exercise.

Tornado F5 pairs Kaby Lake CPUs with NVIDIA's latest 16nm Pascal-based GeForce GTX 10-series video cards including the potent GeForce GTX 1080 with 8GB GDDR5X VRAM, the GeForce GTX 1070 with 8GB GDDR5 VRAM, and the GeForce GTX 1060 video card with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM.   What sets the Tornado F5 apart from other builds is that Eurocom has put emphasis on user upgradeability, making it easy for everyday consumers to replace or upgrade the laptop's internal hardware.   Other specs of Eurocom's high-end gaming laptop include up to 64GB of G.Skill TridentZ DDR4-3200 RAM, up to three storage drives in RAID 0 or RAID 1 including SSHDs, HDDs, and SSDs as well as two M.2 PCIe options. Inputs include three USB 3.0 ports, a USB Type-C port, one DisplaPort 1.2 port, and one HDMI 2.0 port. The laptop's 15-inch Full-HD display can also be upgraded to support 4K resolution.   Interestingly enough, the Tornado F5 doesn't come pre-installed with Windows 64-bit; you have to add $141 for a Windows 10 Home 64-bit license.   The Tornado F5 starts at $1,666 for the base model, and its hardware can be configured in a myriad of different ways to suit the needs of consumers and gamers.   Check below for full specifications of the Tornado F5 gaming laptop, and click here for a price list.   For more information on the Tornado F5, be sure to check the official press release.   EUROCOM Tornado F5 Specifications   Display: 15.6-inch FHD 1920-by-1080 pixels or 4K Ultra HD 3840-by-2160 pixels; eDP   Chassis: Aluminum Alloy (Back Cover and Top Case) and German manufactured resins (Front Cover and Bottom Case)   Chipset: High Performance Intel Z170 Express Chipset   Processor: Socket based; LGA1151; up to 91W TDP; choice of Core i7, i5, i3 up to 6700K/7700K.   VGA Technology: upgradeable MXM 3.0; NVIDIA GeForce: GTX 1080, 1070, 1060, 980M, 970M or 965M; up to 150W TDP; discrete GPU only (no Optimus)   Memory: Four 260-pin SO-DIMM sockets; DDR4-2133/2400/3000/3200; up to 64GB   Storage: up to 3 physical drives: 2x M.2 2280 PCIe x2/x4 or SATA SSD and 1x HDD/SSD (9.5mm) SATA3 6Gb/s; RAID 0/1 with 2x NVMe SSDs.   Card Reader: 6-in-1: UHS-II interface; MMC/RSMMC/SD/mini SD/SDHC/SDXC; Push-Push   Keyboard and Touchpad: Anti-ghosting backlit multi-colour 7-colour keyboard with seperate numeric keypad; TouchPad with multi-gesture and scrolling; W/A/S/D Gaming key   Ports: 3x USB 3.0; 1x USB 3.1 Type-C (Thunderbolt 3); 1x DP 1.2; 1x HDMI 2.0; 1x Headphone; 1x Microphone-in; 1x S/PDIF (digital); 1x Line-in; 1x RJ-45 LAN; 1x DC-in   Audio: High Definition Audio; S/PDIF Digital Output; Built in microphone; Built in two 2W speakers; Sound Blaster X-FI MB3; External 7.1CH output (headphone, mic, line-in and S/PDIF).   Display Support: Supports up to 4 active displays including internal LCD; up to 3840x2160 @ 60Hz   Battery: 8cells; 14.4V 5225mAh/75.24Wh Li-Ion; up to 130 minutes   Weight: 2.92kg / 6.45 lbs w/ battery   Dimensions: 390x266x39.8mm / 15.6x10.64x1.59-inch   About Eurocom:   Eurocom is the leading developer of long lifespan, fully upgradable notebooks, as well as, high-performance mobile workstations and servers since 1989.

X.Org Server 1.19 Gets First Point Release, Fixes XWayland and RandR Issues GO xorg-server 1.19.1 is coming soon to a distro near you Jan 12, 2017 22:43 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  X.Org Foundation's Adam Jackson was happy to announce the other day the release of the first maintenance update to the X.Org Server 1.19 display server series for Linux-based operating systems. X.Org Server 1.19.0 launched almost two months ago, on November 15, 2016, and we still haven't seen a GNU/Linux distribution making the switch to the most advanced X.Org Server version to date, which brings many improvements for AMD Radeon (AMDGPU/Radeon) and Intel graphics cards. And now, two months later, X.Org Server 1.19.1 is already here as the first point release, bringing a lot of changes. From the release notes, it looks like a total of 20 fixes are implemented in this maintenance version, addressing some Randr and Glamor issues, as well as adding improvements to XWayland, XFree86, Xinerama, and EDID. Looking closer, we can see that "damage: Make damageRegionProcessPending take a damage not a drawable" was reverted, and the new update also patches a segfault that occurred when the xorg.conf.d directory was not present, adds a quirk for the ADA 1024x600 7-inch display, and restores vfunc handlers on init failure for Glamor. Coming soon to a distro near you While OS vendors have to take care of all of their users, offering them the latest Nvidia, AMD, and Intel graphics drivers, both open-source and proprietary, sometimes they need to take sides. For example, Arch Linux is already shipping with X.Org Server 1.19.1, while Solus has reverted to X.Org Server 1.18.4 due to AMD hybrid issues. Ubuntu 16.10 is also "still" using X.Org Server 1.18.4, and we don't think that Canonical has any plans to switch to X.Org Server 1.19 anytime soon. That being said, you should choose what's best for you and use an operating system that offers the best software and drivers for your hardware. On the other hand, those of you who fancy compiling software from sources can now download the X.Org Server 1.19.1 tarball from our website. Below, we've attached the complete changelog if you're curious to know what exactly was fixed in this new maintenance release. #X.Org Server 1.19.1#xorg-server 1.19.1#AMD Radeon#XWayland#Xinerama subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Linux Kernel 4.9.3 Rolls Out with over 200 Changes, Lots of XFS Improvements You Can Now Have a Single ISO Image with All the Essential Ubuntu 16.10 Flavors - Exclusive KDE Applications 16.12 Gets Its First Point Release, over 40 Recorded Bugs Fixed KDE Kicks Off 2017 in Style with KDE Plasma 5.9 Beta, Brings Back Global Menus It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Debian GNU/Linux 8.7 "Jessie" Live & Installable ISOs Now Available for Download - Exclusive Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs    X.Org Server 1.19.1 released New Linux Apps Q4OS: A Linux desktop operating system that features a minimal desktop environment and package selection Debian GNU/Linux: The Debian GNU Linux operating system, one of the oldest and influential Linux OSes Debian Live: Create your own Debian GNU/Linux system with this standard Live edition of the operating system Debian Live Xfce: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution with the Xfce desktop environment Debian Live MATE: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution built around the MATE desktop environment Debian Live LXDE: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux operating system, using the LXDE desktop environment Debian Live KDE: A Live flavor of Debian GNU/Linux, featuring the popular KDE desktop environment Reader comments Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now more on: Linux 4.10-rc4 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

(Ron Sachs/CNP/MediaPunch/IPX) Share Written by Max de Haldevang Obsession 2016 January 12, 2017 Almost as soon as it started, the Jan. 12 Senate confirmation hearing of Mike Pompeo was hit by a blackout. Not a news blackout—that would come later, in a closed-door hearing where US president-elect Donald Trump’s pick for CIA director presumably could speak more freely to the panel of senators questioning him. This was an honest-to-god electricity blackout. Inauspiciously, the power went just as the Senate Intelligence Committee’s ranking Democrat, senator Mark Warner of Virginia, mentioned Russian hacking as part of his opening remarks. Lights out @ Senate Intel hearing for @CIA nominee Pompeo just as @markwarner talks on #Russia hacking. Coincidence? pic.twitter.com/d7cFmWG1vc — Kim Dozier (@KimDozier) January 12, 2017 Unable to find out the source of the outage, the whole group moved to another hearing room, where committee chairman Richard Burr joked it was “a conspiracy on the part of senator [Susan] Collins” to draw attention to the country’s critical infrastructure weaknesses. His gag about Russia’s possible role was less convincing: “We have ruled [it] out,” he laughed. As for the actual questioning, well, all the juicy info on Russian hacking and we-know-not-what-else was left to the closed hearing going on in the afternoon. A couple of senators, like Tom Cotton of Arkansas, didn’t bother with any questions altogether during the public session. A Tea Party darling, Kansas congressman Pompeo went into the hearing with a reputation as perhaps the most hardline, most political nominee for the Langley hot seat in history. He was the lead haranguer of Hillary Clinton over Benghazi (at one point saying the affair was “in some ways” worse than Watergate), defended the use of waterboarding, and backed the suggestion that Obama has conveyed “an affinity” for ISIL’s cause, if not its methods. Today, he had a clear strategy for handling all of that, which was simply to punt on any questions about his strident past views. The job of the CIA director, he said repeatedly, is simply to execute the policy made by elected officials, and to make sure senators “have all the information you need” from America’s spies. The Democratic senators didn’t bring up Benghazi, but tensions did start to show when Pompeo was hit with questions on sanctions, climate change, and WikiLeaks. Here are some highlights. Pompeo potentially would defy Trump on torture Pompeo said he would “absolutely not” go outside intelligence agencies’ legal remit on “enhanced interrogation” (i.e. waterboarding and other forms of torture) if ordered by Trump, when asked by California senator Dianne Feinstein if this were a possibility. “I can’t imagine that I would be asked that by the president-elect,” he added, despite Trump’s campaign promise to bring back “much worse” than waterboarding. No comment on where mass surveillance should be limited Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon referenced a Pompeo op-ed from 2016, calling for the repeal of limits to mass-surveillance collections—which were stopped in the wake of Edward Snowden’s revelations. In the piece, Pompeo argued: “Congress should pass a law re-establishing collection of all metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database.” Asked what he thought the limits were to such a scheme, Pompeo tried to step back from his previous views. “There are of course boundaries to this,” he said. “First and foremost they begin with legal boundaries.” When it was pointed out that Pompeo’s op-ed had called for those boundaries to change, Pompeo went on the attack, saying it would be “grossly negligent” to ignore publicly available “lifestyle” information. “Congressman, I don’t take a backseat to anyone when it comes to protecting this country,” was Wyden’s testy response. He insisted Pompeo give a written response regarding those limits. A broadside for Rex Tillerson on Russia Unlike Trump and US secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson, Pompeo is a famed Russia hawk. And senator Marco Rubio teased out a broadside from him on it. In a heated exchange with Rubio at his own confirmation hearing on Jan. 11, Tillerson repeatedly refused to say that Russian president Vladimir Putin had committed war crimes in Syria. Pompeo, however, agreed with Rubio that Russia seemed to have targeted civilians, that doing so was a “violation of the laws of war,” and that it was “intensely unlikely” soldiers could have done so without Putin’s consent. The line will no doubt have pleased his hardline colleagues in Congress, but opens up early divisions within the incoming administration. The climate change question A longtime climate skeptic and a major recipient of campaign donations from the climate-science-denying billionaire Koch brothers, Pompeo didn’t seem too fussed by the national security implications of climate change. When repeatedly asked by California senator Kamala Harris whether he acknowledges NASA’s conclusion that 97% of actively peer-reviewed academics believe in climate change, Pompeo attempted some clumsy dodges. He “would prefer today not to get into the details of climate debate and science.” He hadn’t “spent enough time” to look at NASA’s findings.

Linux Kernel 4.9.3 Rolls Out with over 200 Changes, Lots of XFS Improvements GO Users of the Linux 4.9 kernel series are urged to update Jan 12, 2017 22:24 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  You won't believe this, but Greg Kroah-Hartman announced today, January 12, 2017, the release of the third maintenance update to the Linux 4.9 kernel stable series, just three days after the release of Linux kernel 4.9.2. From the appended shortlog, it looks like there are a total of 201 files changed in this third point release of Linux kernel 4.9, with 1929 insertions and 945 deletions, so we can only think that all these patches were out for a while now, but they didn't make it into the mainline kernel because of the Christmas and New Year's holidays. However, they are more than welcome and are really great work. "I'm announcing the release of the 4.9.3 kernel. All users of the 4.9 kernel series must upgrade. The updated 4.9.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-4.9.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=summary," said Greg Kroah-Hartman. Lots of XFS improvements, numerous updated drivers As the headline suggests, a big part of the Linux kernel 4.9.3 patch are various improvements for the XFS file system, but as expected, the biggest part is represented by updated drivers, this time for USB, wireless (ath10k, rtlwifi), IOMMU, iiO, hwmon, Intel i915, CLK, and a little bit of MMC, PINCTRL, PCI, SCSI, and IRQ Chip. Architecture changes are also present, for ARM, ARM64/AArch64, MIPS, x86, CRIS, s390, and PA-RISC. Besides the usual mm and core kernel noise, the Linux 4.9.3 kernel also updates the sound and networking stacks with mac80211, wireless (nl80211), Intel Skylake, Intel HDA, and Samsung I2S changes. It's a really big one, the biggest so far since the release of Linux kernel 4.9 on December 11, 2016, and if you've already managed to migrate your systems to this new stable branch, we recommend upgrading immediately. The Linux kernel 4.9.3 source archive is available for download right now from kernel.org or via our web portal if you fancy compiling your own kernel, and it should soon land in the stable software repositories of your favorite GNU/Linux distribution. We urge OS vendors to update to Linux 4.9 as soon as possible, especially if they're still using Linux 4.8, which reached end of life last week. #Linux kernel 4.9.3#Linux 4.9.3#Linux kernel#Linux#Linux kernel 4.9 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news You Can Now Have a Single ISO Image with All the Essential Ubuntu 16.10 Flavors - Exclusive KDE Applications 16.12 Gets Its First Point Release, over 40 Recorded Bugs Fixed KDE Kicks Off 2017 in Style with KDE Plasma 5.9 Beta, Brings Back Global Menus Canonical Will Soon Make It Easier to Enable Unity 7 Low Graphics Mode in Ubuntu It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Debian GNU/Linux 8.7 "Jessie" Live & Installable ISOs Now Available for Download - Exclusive Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs    Linux kernel 4.9.3 released New Linux Apps Q4OS: A Linux desktop operating system that features a minimal desktop environment and package selection Debian GNU/Linux: The Debian GNU Linux operating system, one of the oldest and influential Linux OSes Debian Live: Create your own Debian GNU/Linux system with this standard Live edition of the operating system Debian Live Xfce: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution with the Xfce desktop environment Debian Live MATE: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution built around the MATE desktop environment Debian Live LXDE: A Live edition of the Debian GNU/Linux operating system, using the LXDE desktop environment Debian Live KDE: A Live flavor of Debian GNU/Linux, featuring the popular KDE desktop environment Reader comments KDE Kicks Off 2017 in Style with KDE Plasma 5.9 Beta, Brings Back Global Menus more on: KDE Plasma 5.9 Beta i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Go Phones Laptops Cameras TV Gaming Wearables Forum MORE All articles Best picks Drones Car Tech Smart Home Gift Ideas Downloads Login Follow Us Follow Us Subscribe Antivirus Review McAfee 2017 Review by Brian Nadel Jan 12, 2017, 10:46 AM McAfee 2017 The good Inexpensively covers unlimited number of devices Moderate system-performance impact True Key password manager Rapid scans The bad Poor detection rates of zero-day malware Lacks some useful features offered by other brands Users can't schedule scans or opt out of viral collection Verdict McAfee products are a bargain, but their malware protection can't compare to that of other top brands. 6/10 Worth considering $49.99 McAfee McAfee's five Windows antivirus products — AntiVirus, AntiVirus Plus, Internet Security, LiveSafe and Total Protection — run the gamut from basic to full-featured, and can protect PCs against most widespread malware with a moderate system-performance impact. All but the cheapest product include licenses for Mac, Android and iOS security software, which can be installed on an unlimited number of devices. That's one of the best bargains in the antivirus industry. Unfortunately, McAfee is not very good at stopping new Windows malware, and its feature set for its premium products is sparse compared to that of some other brands. The company is implementing a new scanning engine, but until we see those results, we'll have to recommend Bitdefender or Kaspersky products instead. Costs and What's Covered The AntiVirus program (list price $40 per year for a single PC) has the basics covered, stopping malware, phishing scams and spyware. It's also got a two-way firewall, a system optimizer and file shredder, plus a few other features not always found in basic antivirus virus software. McAfee Antivirus $39.99 Amazon AntiVirus Plus is the same, but its license ($60 for an unlimited number of devices) adds software for Macs as well as Android and iOS devices, including both platforms' smartwatches. This is a bargain for anyone seeking basic protection for a lot of machines. The package lets you manage all your McAfee-protected devices from a web-based account. McAfee Antivirus Plus $59.99 Amazon McAfee Internet Security ($60 for one device, $80 for an unlimited number) adds peace of mind with anti-spam protection and parental controls. You'll also get one license for Intel's excellent True Key password manager. McAfee Internet Security $69.99 Amazon McAfee has a pair of very similar top-shelf programs, Total Protection and LiveSafe, each of which costs $90 for an unlimited number of devices, and each of which includes five True Key licenses. While LiveSafe offers 1GB of encrypted online storage, Total Protection can encrypt files. McAfee Total Protection $89.99 Amazon McAfee LiveSafe $33.70 Amazon All five products support Windows 7 through Windows 10. (No current McAfee product supports XP or Vista.) The multiplatform bundles include software for OS X 10.10 Yosemite and later, Android 4.1 and later and iOS 9 and later, as well as Apple and Android watches. We'll be focusing on the Windows software in this review. Graphic: N. Bush/Tom's Guide McAfee promises that if its software or support technicians can't remove a piece of malware from your computer, you'll get a full refund on the software's purchase price. The catch is that to qualify for this money-back guarantee, you'll have to agree to automatic annual renewals of your paid subscription. As is commonplace with antivirus software, it pays to shop around. Steep discounts on McAfee products are often found online, including on McAfee's own website. MORE: Best Antivirus - Top Software for PC, Mac and Android Antivirus Protection McAfee's three-tiered defense starts with the company's scanning technology, which matches suspect items against known malware signatures. This is backed up with heuristic analysis, which brings together behavioral monitoring and code inspection to stop new malware that doesn't have a signature. Any piece of suspicious code is uploaded to McAfee's Global Threat Intelligence lab for analysis. If necessary, a quick fix is pushed out to the company's 200 million users. But while most antivirus brands let customers with privacy concerns opt out of such code-collection programs, McAfee doesn't let you leave. The software doesn't block executable files on USB thumb drives or SD cards from running as soon as the storage drives are inserted, but the Real-Time Scanner keeps an eye on things 24/7. To examine a single file or folder, right-click it in File Explorer and select Scan; you can also shred files that way. Web browsers are protected by McAfee's Web Advisor software, which adds browser extensions that block known malicious websites. Email attachments are scanned, and the user can whitelist certain pieces of software so that they won't be blocked. A two-way firewall checks outgoing and incoming network and internet traffic. A game mode suspends scanning if the user is playing a PC game or watching a movie. None of the McAfee products have anything like Trend Micro's Cloud Scanner for finding rogue files in your online file repositories. Ransomware exploits are treated as just another infectious agent to be detected and thwarted. Unfortunately, the current versions of McAfee antivirus software don't allow you to schedule recurring daily, weekly or monthly scans. McAfee says its engineers plan to restore this ability in the spring of 2017. Antivirus Performance McAfee's malware scanner is shared among its five Windows products. In recent evaluations conducted by independent labs AV-TEST and AV Comparatives, the scanner's detection rates ranged from mediocre to excellent, with persistent weakness against zero-day malware. McAfee says it is overhauling its malware-detection technology for 2017; when lab results for those editions come in, we will update this review. In AV-TEST's fall 2016 Windows 10 evaluations, McAfee Internet Security did pretty well, stopping 98.8 percent of zero-day malware (found through heuristic detection) in September and 98.7 percent in October. It caught 99.9 percent of widespread malware (detected with signature matching) in September, and a clean 100 percent in October — excellent results. Yet 13 of the 22 brands AV-TEST evaluated in the fall Windows 10 evaluations did better than McAfee, especially against zero-day malware. And that showing by McAfee was an improvement over the previous Windows 10 round, in which McAfee found a dismal 90.1 percent of zero-day malware and finished third from the bottom. When what matters isn't how much you stop, but how much gets through, 90 percent isn't an A but a D-minus. McAfee Internet Security also fell short in AV-TEST's spring 2016 rounds of Windows 8.1 tests. It identified only 95.5 percent of zero-day attacks in May, although the rate rose to 100 percent in June. McAfee's widespread-malware rates were more impressive, at 99.1 percent in May and 99.6 percent in June, but once again, it was pretty far down AV-TEST's rankings overall. In AV-TEST's summer 2016 Windows 7 tests, McAfee's heuristic detection technology caught only 96.4 percent of zero-day malware in July and 94.9 percent in August. Only Microsoft Security Essentials, a free program that we recommend as a last resort, did worse. McAfee did much better against widespread malware, catching 99.7 percent and 99.9 percent in July and August, respectively. AV-Comparatives did have a chance to test McAfee's new malware engine in November 2016, but the detection results weren't terribly different from those for McAfee's older engine. The new engine caught 97.3 percent of "real-world" malware, a sample of all the prevalent online bugs, both zero-day and widespread. The old engine caught 97.6 percent of real-world malware in October and 98.8 percent in both September and August. About half of the other products tested did better. However, McAfee's false-positive detections, in which harmless software is misidentified as malicious code, skyrocketed to 23 in October and 29 in November after having been between zero and three for several months. (AV-TEST saw few false positives with McAfee's 2016 engine.) Overall, McAfee's results were a couple of notches below those of its chief competitors Bitdefender, Kaspersky, Norton and Trend Micro. All of those routinely scored between 99.8 and 100 percent against zero-day, real-world and widespread malware in lab tests. MORE: Best Free Antivirus Software for Windows PCs Security and Privacy Features McAfee AntiVirus is well stocked with extra features for an entry-level product. Its extras include file shredding, with the choice of four settings; a system vulnerability scanner to make sure you have the most recent versions of all software on your PC; and a QuickClean feature to optimize your system by getting rid of old files. Some other brands save such features for their midrange products. AntiVirus Plus has the same extra features as AntiVirus, but adds the Mac, Android and iOS licenses and the web-management interface. Internet Security adds an anti-spam filter to keep your email inbox clean, a single True Key password-manager license and parental controls to manage internet access for young users. At the pinnacle, McAfee's Total Protection and LiveSafe each include five licenses for True Key. (A stand-alone True Key subscription is $20 per year.) LiveSafe is often preinstalled on new PCs, while Total Protection is sold boxed on retail shelves, but both can be downloaded from McAfee's website or from online retailers. The only substantial difference between the two top-tier products is that LiveSafe includes 1GB of secure online storage (including photo storage) whereas Total Protection offers file encryption. Still, none of McAfee's products has a hardened browser for online commerce or an on-screen keyboard to block keyloggers, both of which we consider very useful, There's also nothing like Kaspersky's dedicated webcam protection or VPN service. Oddly, McAfee doesn’t have a rescue disk. This is the free system-cleaning software most antivirus companies offer for use when a Windows system is hopelessly clogged with malware and needs to be booted from a CD or USB drive. Performance and System Impact McAfee's scanning engine had a moderate impact on system performance. To test its load, we used our OpenOffice-based performance test, which matches 20,000 names and addresses on a spreadsheet. We noted the OpenOffice test's completion time in four scenarios: with no antivirus software installed, with McAfee LiveSafe installed but not actively scanning, during full scans and during quick scans. Our test machine was an ASUS X555LA notebook with a 2-GHz Core i3 processor, 6GB of RAM and a 500GB hard drive (36GB of which was filled). The system used Windows 10 with the latest updates. Prior to installing McAfee software, but with Microsoft's built-in Windows Defender unavoidably running in the background, the system had a baseline OpenOffice completion time of 7 minutes flat. With McAfee Live Safe installed but not scanning, the completion time lengthened to 7:30, indicating a passive performance loss of 4.8 percent, similar to that of Panda Gold Security. Neither result can compare to Kaspersky Total Security's zero passive impact, though. While performing scans and running our Open-Office benchmark, McAfee software scored a 9:07 for a Full Scan and 7:50 for a Quick Scan. These indicate performance slowdowns of 30 percent and 11 percent from the baseline, respectively, and put McAfee in the middle of the pack in terms of system impact. McAfee does offer some of the fastest full-disk scanning round, once the program has gotten a bead on your hard drive's contents. The software took 1 hour, 4 minutes and 53 seconds to complete its initial full scan of 49,185 items. During this scan, all the files were indexed and categorized. Subsequent full scans took an average of 5:47 to look at 49,190 files, a very rapid yet thorough examination. McAfee took 2 minutes and 3 seconds to run a Quick Scan that looked at 3,387 files. That's not bad, but some other programs get through quick scans in a matter of seconds. MORE: Best Antivirus Software for Mac Interface McAfee's white-and-gray interface hasn't changed much for 2017. As usual, there's a green checkmark on the main page to show that the computer is protected. Many of the subsidiary windows have handy go-back links, and there's a Home button to get to the main window. The main page includes links to details about virus protection, web and email protection as well as updates and subscription status. There are also buttons to add more devices to the coverage circle and search the local network for unprotected devices. Most pages include a right-hand navigation bar with links to Home, the True Key password manager and Help, plus a Navigation link with a list of features that get you to any feature quickly. That list is so extensive that you'll need to scroll up and down to see it all.  You can manually start an on-demand quick or full scan, but doing so requires drilling down four clicks from the main screen. Setup, Installation and Support Installing LiveSafe on our test PC took 13 minutes and 27 seconds. We started by inputting an activation code, then downloaded a 33MB beachhead installer from McAfee's site. Although the installer wants you to agree to auto-renew the subscription next year, it's easy to avoid, but you won't get the company's money-back guarantee. After the beachhead installer did its thing, we had to copy and paste a serial number from the McAfee website to the full program's installer. You'll need to do that again if you install the True Key password manager. If you encounter a problem with the installation process or the installed program, McAfee offers free 24/7 support via email, online chat or a toll-free phone number for users of all five paid programs. There's also a way to connect with tech support directly from the McAfee user interface. Bottom Line McAfee's inexpensive, unlimited AntiVirus Plus multiplatform license can be a big money-saver for families that have many PCs, Macs and mobile devices. That's especially true when many other antivirus companies reserve such universal coverage for only their top-tier products. The midprice Internet Security sits in the sweet spot in McAfee's lineup, offering the best tradeoff of features and price. It might not be worth upgrading to the top-shelf LiveSafe and Total Security just to get more password-manager licenses or a small amount of cloud storage or file encryption.  On the downside, even McAfee's pricier products lack some features we've come to expect from paid antivirus software, such as a hardened web browser or the ability to schedule scans. More dismaying is McAfee's middling ability to stop previously unseen malware, which drags down the programs' very good widespread-malware detection rate. It's a shame, because McAfee's affordable unlimited plans are among the best bargains in the antivirus industry We hope McAfee's next-generation scanning engine performs better against new malware. Until then, we'll have to recommend Bitdefender or Kaspersky products, which offer superior protection and even more useful features.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Intel chiefs inform Trump of Russian claims Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Intel chiefs inform Trump of Russian claims 11:30 Story highlights Ex-officials: Material provided by retired intelligence operative may or may not be true But it deserves to be taken seriously, they say Nick Dowling is a former director on the National Security Council staff during the Clinton administration and is president of IDS International, a government services firm with business in research, training, expeditionary services and cybersecurity. David Handley is a former senior British government official and expert on intelligence and national security. He is an appointed member of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George. Handley was a colleague of Chris Steele's in service with the British government and has known him for more than 20 years. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors. (CNN)CNN has not until now named the former intelligence officer who compiled the memos about Russia, President-elect Donald Trump and the US election. But many news organizations in the United States and the UK have named him and provided considerable detail about him and his business. Other former intelligence officials are speaking up in his defense, as the following piece shows. For this reason, CNN is now publishing his name. Retired British intelligence officer Chris Steele, whose dossier takes to a new level the investigation of whether Russia attempted to influence the US election for the benefit of Donald Trump, learned his spycraft from the best. As in the American intelligence community, the selection, vetting, training, education and seasoning of the veteran operative in British intelligence is the result of an extraordinary filtering process. Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him It begins with strict and high educational standards, moves through a series of interviews to a day of high-pressure competitive scenario work and psychometric, literacy, numeracy and analytical testing against several other candidates. There is a final individual assessment and judgment hurdle to pass before a lengthy vetting process, conducted by the intelligence agencies themselves. While no system is flawless, this does produce a stream of very bright, highly motivated people determined to act with integrity to solve modern intelligence problems. A key point is that this selection and subsequent training not only involve learning investigative tradecraft equal to the best in the world but also impart a fundamental critical mindset about sources and information: Doubt sources, but protect them. Question new information. Validate reports with independent sources. Always seek collateral. Consider alternative explanations. And maintain an objective and independent perspective. Above all, never let politics or bias color your analysis. Read More Having known Chris Steele professionally for more than 20 years, we know that one should not question his integrity, excellence and diligence in intelligence work. He knows Russia exceptionally well and has relationships and experience in the country to support this type of analysis. For obvious reasons we assume that he cannot name his sources, but we do not doubt that he will have brought the same professional rigor to this study as he did to his work in the intelligence service. Does this mean that everything in Chris' dossier is true? No. Intelligence collection and analysis are always subject to error and a range of opinion, including among seasoned colleagues. Aspects of the report may prove to be wrong upon further investigation. Rather the only conclusion we should draw at this point is that the dossier contains serious allegations, was made by a serious and credible intelligence professional, and that the US intelligence community reviewed the material and deemed it worthy of further investigation and chose to include it in the information submitted to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump. But there are causes for concern. The first is that the allegations in the dossier are quite serious. Should they be corroborated, it would indicate that Russia's reach and influence over American politics is not only deeper than suspected, but potentially active in the form of leverage against the President-elect and other elected officials. JUST WATCHED CNN: Why Trump's 'fake news' claim is wrong Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN: Why Trump's 'fake news' claim is wrong 02:48 Second and perhaps indicative of Trump's own concern, we have witnessed a hypersensitive and aggressive reaction from the Trump camp since reports of the dossier emerged. Rather than downplaying the report and simply expressing confidence that the intelligence community investigation will prove it all false, the first reaction of the Trump team has been to attack the news organization that broke the story (CNN), the media site that published the full dossier (BuzzFeed), and the intelligence community decision to include a portion of the material in the presidential briefing. The President-elect went so far as to call CNN "fake news" and to taunt the CNN reporter in Wednesday's press briefing trying to ask him a question. This kind of all-out political attack on respected media that publish something critical of Trump is a troubling autocratic response. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook Equally so, the implication from Trump that his own intelligence community leaders will dismiss such allegations and reports against him indicates a willingness to politicize the intelligence community to serve the interests of the next president. The conclusion that Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian influence operation on the US election is not the invention of leaders but the conclusion of the rank-and-file analysts across the different agencies. Yet Trump has singled out the leaders and said if the president does not agree with the intelligence, intelligence heads will roll. That is a recipe for disaster in terms of creating distrust between the intelligence community and the Trump administration. It also risks distorting intelligence community assessments to avoid the wrath of political disfavor. All of these are the weaknesses found in unprofessional intelligence services typically found in dictatorships, not the United States. The media and the intelligence community must not bow to the immense political pressure and threats of retribution coming from the Trump camp. The integrity and independence of both are key to protecting our democracy.

Spying and politics in America Trump bashes the spooks With his relentless criticism, Donald Trump is destroying trust in the intelligence agencies Jan 14th 2017 Add this article to your reading list by clicking this button Tweet DONALD TRUMP doesn’t give many press conferences. But when he does, as on January 11th—for the first time since July—they are utterly unlike the press conferences of any other American president-to-be. Speaking without notes, Mr Trump threatened and cajoled Mexico and the pharma industry (its shares tumbled). He boasted about his genius for business (and went some way to reduce his own conflicts of interest—see article). He poured scorn on a shocking report that Russian intelligence had dirt on him and had worked with his people during the election (he shouted down a reporter from the news channel that revealed the report’s existence). And that was just the highlights. It was such a spectacle (see article) and pointed in so many directions at once that you could fail to catch a drumbeat which, for the safety and security of the United States, Mr Trump needs to silence immediately: his continuing hostility towards America’s intelligence agencies. Intel outside In this section Equipping people to stay ahead of technological change Trump bashes the spooks How Mexico should handle Trump China’s embrace of a new electricity-transmission technology holds lessons for others Too many parties can spoil politics Reprints Related topics Russia Arts, entertainment and media Media Government and politics Espionage and intelligence Relations were already rocky. Before the election the agencies let it be known that they had concluded Russia hacked, stole and leaked documents which damaged Hillary Clinton, Mr Trump’s opponent. Most of the agencies (but not all) think that Russia’s intention was to help Mr Trump win. He responded by mocking them for being wrong before the invasion of Iraq in 2003 about weapons of mass destruction. This week things got uglier, when it was leaked that the agencies had supplied Mr Trump with a summary of the report, whose claims remain unverified, despite plenty of effort by plenty of people. In a tweet, Mr Trump complained that enduring such leaks was like “living in Nazi Germany”. And in his press conference he repeatedly suggested that the agencies had done the leaking, casting doubt on their conduct and loyalty. Mr Trump would hardly be the first president to have scratchy relations with the intelligence services (see article). Career officers mutter about Barack Obama’s reluctance to stand up to China and Russia and what they saw as his soft line on spy-catching. However, Mr Trump’s disputes are in a different class, because they eat away at trust. The agencies’ job is to tell the president about threats and opportunities facing the United States. Even though America’s intelligence machine is the world’s most formidable, it deals mostly in judgments and informed speculation, not certainties. In speaking truth to power, intelligence officers will sometimes have to bear bad news. They take that risk and the president listens to what they have to say because it makes the United States better prepared for whatever is coming its way. By ridiculing the agencies for their findings, Mr Trump has signalled that he does not want to hear their bad news. By saying he cannot be bothered with the president’s daily briefing, he suggests their work is of little value. By claiming that the agencies have a political agenda, his people are themselves politicising intelligence work. By impugning their motives, he is undermining public confidence, which was already damaged by Edward Snowden (see article), and which, as with any institution, is essential if they are to go about their duties. If he wants America to be safe, Mr Trump must make amends. He took a first step by criticising Russia for the Democratic hack (albeit reluctantly and mildly). Unlike his national security adviser, his nominees as directors of the CIA and of national intelligence enjoy support among spooks. In 90 days, he has said, they will produce a report on hacking: he should follow its advice. As president, he needs to stop criticising the agencies and demonstrate they have his backing. None of that is hard. Except that it is a test of Mr Trump’s self-control.

Organised by Rotterdam Ahoy, Europort is the highlight of the maritime exhibition calendar in 2017, with a finely crafted programme expected to attract an estimated 30,000 visitors and 1,100 exhibitors. The Europort exhibition team has chosen three highly topical themes for the event this year. These are: Big Data; The New Environmental Age; and The Human Factor. Raymond Siliakus, Exhibition Manager, says: “Each of these themes is very different, but all three come together to drive forward the event’s overarching aim – to help maximise vessel performance – and as such will have an increasingly important role in shaping the world of shipping and shipbuilding over the months and years ahead. We have selected these three very current themes to ensure that attending Europort will be a hugely rewarding and valuable experience, with benefits extending well into the future for those visiting and exhibiting.” Many leading technology suppliers, shipbuilders and shipping companies are exploring the scope of using Big Data methodologies to develop ‘smart ships’ that will be safer, more efficient and cost effective. As an illustration of the trend, last year the world’s biggest shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries, joined forces with tech giants Microsoft and Intel to develop smart shipping software solutions that are expected to yield benefits in terms of crew wellbeing, technical inspections, equipment maintenance and voyage information recording. Furthermore, Rolls-Royce, whose subsidiary MTU will be exhibiting at Europort, recently formed a strategic alliance with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland to develop the first generation of remote and autonomous ships, while another exhibitor, Lloyd’s Register, acquired Big Data company Real Time Adaptive Maintenance Optimisation (RTAMO) and plans to roll out its software to commercial shipping. Europort will provide a showcase for new generation IT and system integration tools, ultra-sensitive monitoring, condition-based maintenance, fleet performance management and other types of data analysis needed to help owners and operators enhance cost efficiency and reliability. “If you are involved in Big Data and are targeting the maritime sector, then Europort 2017 is the place to be,” adds Siliakus. The popular Europort Masterclasses will be returning this year and there will be daily Masterclasses specifically targeted at this theme. International regulations continue to drive the development of environmentally friendly technology. The entry into force later this year of IMO’s Ballast Water Convention will require major investment in ballast water technology, both in new ships and as retrofits. The IMO cap on fuel sulphur content is also due to enter force in 2020. Both developments will require the evaluation of available technologies to ensure compliance. Europort’s focus this year will not simply be the solutions aimed at compliance, but those providing a competitive advantage, with exhibits to include alternative fuels, high tech coatings and solar cell systems. As Siliakus points out: “The underlying message will be clear. Clean and efficient shipping is central to a profitable and sustainable business model.” A special conference on Alternative Ship Power & Propulsion Systems, organised by the Royal Institution of Naval Architects (RINA), will be held on November 8th. This will examine the current use of alternative fuels in shipping and how to embrace the challenges of designing cleaner, lower carbon emission vessels. Remaining competitive today in the maritime industry also relies on having a skilled and motivated workforce, able to innovate and operate efficiently. Europort will provide a forum for a well-timed discussion on the importance of investing in human capital, with the opportunity to engage with academic institutions and training bodies on how to attract and retain the younger generation. Many believe the maritime industry is facing a workforce crisis, with a lack of younger seafarers to fill the gaps left by the retirement of an ageing workforce, putting marine companies under renewed pressure. The U.K. Department for Transport (DFT) predicts a shortfall of around 3,500 deck and engineering officers by 2021 in the UK alone, while the BIMCO / ICS Manpower Report suggests there could be a worldwide global shortfall of 147,500 officers by 2025. This shortfall in human resources is evident not just in the deep-sea segment, but across the maritime industry, where specialists and technical staff with very specific areas of expertise are required, as shipping moves to embrace robot technology, automation and advanced data capture tools, among other advanced technologies.

Biden told the AP that intelligence officials worried the allegations might become public, and that he and Obama were startled by the alleged information about the president-elect. ADVERTISEMENT “[I’m surprised it] made it to the point where the agency, the FBI thought they had to pursue it," said Biden, who endorsed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonSchumer puts GOP on notice over ObamaCare repeal Priebus to ethics chief: 'Be careful' Feinstein: Russia's interference affected outcome of election MORE over Trump. Biden noted neither he nor Obama sought more details about the report, which has dominated global news this week. In an interview with NBC's Andrea Mitchell, Biden said the Intelligence Community felt obligated to include a two-page summary of the dossier's claims in its classified report on Russian attempts to interfere with the election.  When asked if it was a mistake to include the addendum, which claims that Moscow has compromising information about Trump and that Trump aides and Russian intermediaries have been in contact, Biden responded:  “We asked that question, and their argument was that this is something that the press already had, not just here in the United States, but other places, that … it was their job to inform not only us but the president-elect that this was out there so it didn’t come out of the blue.” Tags Russia, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, national intelligence, spying, Politics, Democrats   View the discussion thread.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Midday Report: Fiat Slumps on EPA Charges; Nasdaq Pulls Back From Records The Nasdaq pulled back on Thursday from a run that saw record closes for five consecutive trading days. Keris Alison Lahiff Jan 12, 2017 12:08 PM EST The Nasdaq pulled back on Thursday from a run that saw record closes for five consecutive trading days. Tech names including Microsoft  (MSFT) and Intel  (INTC) were the biggest drag, while biotech stocks remained under pressure for their second day in a row. KB Home  (KBH)  beat profit and sales estimates over its fourth quarter. Revenue jumped 21%, while its backlog increased 11%. Boeing  (BA) fell after RBC Capital rated its stock as underperform. The firm pointed to eroding profit margins in its commercial airplane units and potential protectionist policies from a Trump administration that could prove a headwind to the industry. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) slumped as the EPA lobbed accusations against the automaker of using software that spewed excess diesel emissions. The software reportedly affected 100,000 vehicles.

addressing Los Angeles' food deserts Multidisciplinary student teams asked to find innovative solutions to critical urban issues News provided by AECOM Jan 12, 2017, 12:00 ET Share this article LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- AECOM and Van Alen Institute, with 100 Resilient Cities — Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, today announced the winner of the Urban SOS: Fair Share student competition, which challenged multidisciplinary student teams around the world to explore the nexus of the sharing economy and urban infrastructure to solve our cities' most urgent issues. The winning team, students at Washington University in St. Louis, proposed reusing United States Postal Service (USPS) post offices slated for closure and their underutilized distribution network to help collect, store, and redistribute surplus food to neighborhoods with limited food access. Team members included Irum Javed, Anu Samarajiva and Lanxi Zhang, students in public health, architecture/urban design and landscape architecture/urban design. The team will receive a cash prize in addition to implementation support from AECOM. "The caliber of this year's entries was exemplary, and we were challenged to select a single winner," said Stephen Engblom, senior vice president and global director of AECOM Cities. "We were inspired to see how these student teams merged the shared economy with urban infrastructure to respond to some of the most challenging issues in the world today. The winning team, First Class Meal, addressed the food desert issue, which is so critical to many of our cities and really resonated with our jury members based in Los Angeles, who are keenly interested in helping to implement the team's concept." The student teams pitched their proposals to a live audience and a jury of 10 leading professionals from the design, government, business, and tech sectors at AECOM's office in downtown Los Angeles, including Bill Hanway, executive vice president/global sports leader, AECOM; David van der Leer, executive director, Van Alen Institute; Josh Emig, head of research & development, WeWork; Greg Lindsay, senior fellow, New Cities Foundation; Leah Hanes, executive director, Two Bit Circus; Marissa Aho, chief resilience officer, City of Los Angeles, and 100 Resilient Cities representative; Shahram Mehraban, marketing director, Intel; Skylar Olsen, senior economist, Zillow; Stephen Engblom, senior vice president/global director of Cities, AECOM; and Vince Bertoni, director of planning, City of Los Angeles. The jury also selected the following teams to receive honors: 2nd place: En Común(a) — Quito, Ecuador: creates a website in partnership with residents in dozens of Quito's communes to map needs and resources, and develop a new cooperative to promote local farmers in one of the city's main public markets. 3rd place: WELP (Waste-Help System) — Durban, South Africa: connects households that want to dispose of bulk waste with waste collectors who earn income and gain access to temporary housing for removing the waste. Honorable mention: The Living City — Athens, Greece: brings together refugees, long-time residents and tourists to activate abandoned buildings and vacant lots with pop-up restaurants and markets. Urban SOS: Fair Share invited students to combine physical design with the tools and technologies of the sharing economy to create more equitable access to resources, envision more sustainable built environments, and enrich the lives of urban residents. AECOM, a premier, fully integrated global infrastructure firm, launched Urban SOS in 2009 to address significant urban challenges, and for the last two years has partnered with Van Alen Institute, a design nonprofit with a 120-plus-year history of organizing design competitions. "Cities today face opportunities and challenges that require holistic, interdisciplinary solutions," said David van der Leer, executive director of Van Alen Institute. "We were proud to guide some of tomorrow's thought leaders to imagine such creative visions for the future of urban life and public space." "This year's finalist teams addressed some of the most pressing resilience challenges facing cities today, including mitigating economic and social impacts of the global refugee crisis, creating access to housing and jobs, providing healthy food to neighborhoods with limited food access deserts, and fostering connectivity to critical social and economic resources," said Michael Berkowitz, president of 100 Resilient Cities. "The students' ideas have real potential to change how cities address these issues in the years ahead." Student teams from 31 countries worldwide submitted proposals. Qualified submittals were vigorously reviewed by prestigious panels of global experts from academia, urban planning, design, technology and architecture from public and private sectors through juries held in Hong Kong, Sydney, New York and London, as well as the final jury held in Los Angeles.  About AECOM AECOM is built to deliver a better world.

Kellyanne Conway clashed with Cooper Wednesday evening over his network’s coverage of unverified but potentially damaging claims that Russia has compromising financial and personal information about the president-elect.  Hours after Trump's first post-election press conference — in which he called out CNN — they tangled over how the cable network and other news outlets have handled claims about Trump’s ties with Russia. After watching this painful-as-hell exchange, I'm gonna right Pope Francis and suggest he canonize @andersoncooper. https://t.co/AXqVd3jq4y— Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) January 12, 2017 ADVERTISEMENT Navarro, who was a vocal critic of Trump’s presidential bid, ultimately backed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonSchumer puts GOP on notice over ObamaCare repeal Priebus to ethics chief: 'Be careful' Feinstein: Russia's interference affected outcome of election MORE. In a tweet Thursday, she suggested Pope Francis "canonize" Cooper after the "painful-as-hell exchange." “I know CNN must be feeling the heat today of having a headline yesterday at around 6:30 p.m. that said, quote, ‘Intel chiefs presented Trump with information that Russia had information to compromise him,’” Conway said on CNN’s “360." "That is just false.” Cooper then proposed that Conway was confusing CNN’s coverage with BuzzFeed’s, which published a 35-page dossier of unverified Trump allegations in full. While CNN reported that Trump and President Barack ObamaBarack ObamaObama on '60 Minutes': A president needs 'thick skin,' 'stamina' Trump should’ve Googled John Lewis before he Tweeted Sharpton: 'Thank God we lived in the age of Obama' MORE were briefed on the issue, it did not detail any of the allegations from the dossier.  “I think you guys are feeling the heat,” he told Conway, who is one of Trump’s incoming top counselors. "[Our report] was actually backed up by not only multiple sources, but other news agencies.” Conway retorted by dismissing the credibility of uncorroborated accounts linking Trump and Russia. “What heat do we feel?” she asked. "That you’ve got this raw information, this complete ridiculous fake news? It’s not been backed up by credible news sources. Actually, it’s just fake, it’s not even news. I can’t even use ‘news’ for it.” CNN reported late Tuesday that top intelligence officials presented Trump with a two-page synopsis of an unverified dossier about him last week. The document alleges Russia’s government possesses compromising financial and personal information about Trump. It also claims people close to Trump kept in touch with Moscow during last year’s presidential race. U.S. intelligence officials have not verified the dossier’s details, however, and it remains unclear how reliable they are. Trump and his transition team have fiercely criticized both BuzzFeed and CNN for reporting on the unsubstantiated document.

Now, that work has taken tangible form, and a tangible form shoppers will be able to buy starting in June in the form of the Latitude 7285. The Latitude 7285 is a 12 inch tablet with a detachable keyboard, making it a two-in-one laptop. Powered by Kaby Lake processors, and offering a Sharp IGZO display that can display in up to 3K resolution, the company plans to offer several different dock options to use a keyboard with the system. Yet the true winning point of this system is its wireless charging capabilities. It will boast a wireless receiving coil using a magnetic resonance technology created by WiTricity. This system is itself compliant with the AirFuel wireless charging specifications, making it potentially even suitable in some IoT applications. It's also slated to be the first Dell product that works with the company's WiGig wireless dock system, as it will also sell a WiTricity charging pad that makes the entire system cordless. AirFuel was, as of early 2016, one of the two biggest standards in wireless charging. The second major standard was the Qi alliance, but reports note that Intel, which was supposed to announce charging technology related to the alliance sometime in 2016, instead canceled work on the concept back in spring, leaving AirFuel to forge ahead. With IHS projecting that wireless charging would make $8.5 billion in annual revenue by 2018—it was only generating around $216 million in 2013—that could mean a major windfall for the AirFuel group. Dell's vice president of product strategy and innovation, Neil Hand, told TMC specifically, “Given that Dell tools help the world's brightest minds do their absolute best work, we are committed to driving innovation that brings revolutionary gains in productivity to the enterprise. Innovative IT teams see a future with no wires including wireless power as a key step toward improvements in mobility and convenience. WiTricity's wireless charging technology makes it possible to integrate magnetic resonance in today's thin, iconic computing products. Dell’s collaboration with WiTricity enabled creation of a charging solution that can power a Latitude 7285 at close-to wired charging speed.” At any rate, wireless charging systems are likely to address one major point of IoT systems: getting power to remote operations. While some have gone to solar systems or other more natural power generation strategies, wireless charging—especially over any distance—can make a huge difference in providing power to remote systems. That makes the IoT's full power felt, and the Latitude 7285 serves as a means to show off what this technology can do. It's a great start to a wireless future—I've certainly wished my Dell laptop would recharge itself without needing a power outlet around—and the farther along we go, the more likely our devices won't need that final cable after all.

It is important to note that semiconductor trends are considered to be leading indicators of technology and broader electronics demand. A strong rally in the tech sector largely pushed many of these companies to new highs, as the Dow and S&P are both trading near all-time highs. The December 30 short interest data have been compared with the previous report. Short interest moves were down in most of these selected semiconductor stocks. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) saw its short interest increase to 79.38 million shares. The previous level was 78.62 million. Shares were last seen trading at $36.63, in a 52-week trading range of $27.68 to $38.36. The number of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) shares short increased to 86.62 million shares from the previous level of 82.81 million. Shares were recently trading at $10.94, in a 52-week range of $1.75 to $12.42. Note that like Intel and Micron, AMD is one of the most shorted Nasdaq stocks. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) saw the number of its shares short decrease to 14.34 million, compared to the 18.23 million reported in the previous period. Shares were changing hands at $65.60, in a 52-week range of $42.24 to $71.62. Short interest in Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) dropped to 13.94 million shares. The previous reading was 14.51 million. Shares were trading at $33.20, in a 52-week range of $15.44 to $33.68. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) saw its short interest decrease to 55.14 million shares from the previous reading of 57.00 million. Shares were trading at $22.31, in a 52-week range of $9.31 to $23.64. The short interest in Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) fell to 3.22 million shares in the period, from the previous 4.68 million. Shares were last seen at $177.34, in a 52-week range of $114.25 to $183.99.

This is the real meaning of the “Russia hacking” story which, as yet, has not produced any hard evidence of Russian complicity. Last week’s 25-page report, that was released by the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, illustrates to what extent intelligence is being “fixed around the policy”.  Just as the CIA generated false information related to Weapons of Mass Destruction to soften public resistance to war with Iraq, so too, the spurious allegations in the DNI’s politically-motivated report are designed to depict Russia as a growing threat to US national security. The timing of the report has less to do with the election of Donald Trump as President than it does with critical developments in Syria where the Russian military has defeated US-proxies in Syria’s industrial hub, Aleppo, rolling back Washington’s 15-year War of Terror and derailing the imperialist plan to control vital resources and pipeline corridors across the Middle East and Central Asia. Russia has become the main obstacle to Washington achieving its strategic vision of pivoting to Asia and maintaining its dominant role into the next century. The Intelligence Community has been coerced into compromising its credibility to incite fear of Russia and to advance the geopolitical ambitions of deep state powerbrokers. The “Russia hacking” flap shows how far the Intel agencies have veered from their original mandate, which is to impartially gather and analyze information that may be vital to US national security. As we have seen in the last two weeks, the leaders of these organizations feel free to offer opinions on  issues that clearly conflict with those of the new President-elect. Trump has stated repeatedly that he wants to reduce tensions and reset relations with Russia, but that policy is being sabotaged by members of the intelligence community, particularly CIA Director John Brennan who appeared just last week on PBS Newshour with Judy Woodruff. Here’s an excerpt from the interview: We see that there are still a lot of actions that Russia is undertaking that undermine the principles of democracy in so many countries. What has happened in our recent election is not new. The Russians have engaged in trying to manipulate elections in Europe for a number of years… the Russians tried to interfere in our electoral process recently, and were actively involved in that. And that is something that we can’t countenance. (“Interview with CIA Director John Brennan”,  PBS Newshour) Brennan, of course, provided no evidence for his claims nor did he mention the hundreds of CIA interventions around the world. But Brennan’s accusations are less important than the fact that his appearance on a nationwide broadcast identifies him as a political advocate for policies that conflict with those of the new president. Do we really want unelected intelligence officials — whose job it is to provide the president with sensitive information related to national security– to assume a partisan role in shaping policy? And why would Brennan –whose is supposed to “serve at the pleasure of the president”– accept an invitation to offer his views on Russia when he knew they would be damaging to the new administration? Powerful people behind the scenes are obviously pushing the heads of these intelligence agencies to stick to their ‘anti-Moscow’ narrative to force Trump to abandon his plan for peaceful relations with Moscow.  Brennan isn’t calling the shots and neither are Clapper or Comey. They’re all merely agents serving the interests of establishment plutocrats whose geopolitical agenda doesn’t jibe with that of the incoming administration. If that wasn’t the case, then why would the Intelligence Community stake its reputation on such thin gruel as this Russian hacking gibberish? It doesn’t make any sense. The people who launched this campaign are either supremely arrogant or extremely desperate. Which is it?  Here’s an excerpt from an article by veteran journalist Robert Parry sums it up like this in an article at Consortium News: The DNI report amounted to a compendium of reasons to suspect that Russia was the source of the information – built largely on the argument that Russia had a motive for doing so because of its disdain for Democratic nominee Clinton and the potential for friendlier relations with Republican nominee Trump. But the case, as presented, is one-sided and lacks any actual proof. Further, the continued use of the word “assesses” – as in the U.S. intelligence community “assesses” that Russia is guilty – suggests that the underlying classified information also may be less than conclusive because, in intelligence-world-speak, “assesses” often means “guesses.” (“US Report Still Lacks Proof on Russia ‘Hack’”, Robert Parry, Consortium News) Bottom line: Brennan and his fellow spooks have nothing. The report is little more than a catalogue of unfounded assumptions, baseless speculation and uncorroborated conjecture. In colloquial parlance, it’s bullshit, 100 percent, unalloyed Russophobic horse-manure. In fact, the authors admit as much in the transcript itself when they say:  Judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact. Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation, and precedents. What kind of kooky admission is that?  So the entire report could be BS but we’re supposed to believe that Putin flipped the election? Is that it??? What’s really going on here?  Why have the Intelligence agencies savaged their credibility just to convince people that Russia is up to no good? The Russia hacking story has more to do with recent developments in Syria than it does with delegitimizing Donald Trump. Aleppo was a real wake up call for the US foreign policy establishment which is beginning to realize that their plans for the next century have been gravely undermined by Russia’s military involvement in Syria. Aleppo represents the first time that an armed coalition of allied states (Russia, Iran, Syria, Hezbollah) have actively engaged US jihadist-proxies and soundly beat them to a pulp. The stunning triumph in Aleppo has spurred hope among the vassal states that Washington’s bloody military juggernaut can be repelled, rolled back and defeated. And if Washington’s CIA-armed, trained and funded jihadists can be repelled, then the elitist plan to project US power into Central Asia to dominate the world’s most populous and prosperous region, will probably fail. In other words, the outcome in Aleppo has cast doubts on Uncle Sam’s ability to successfully execute its pivot to Asia. That’s why the Intel agencies have been employed to shape public perceptions on Russia.  Their job is to prepare the American people for an escalation of hostilities between the two nuclear-armed superpowers. US powerbrokers are determined to intensify the conflict and reverse facts on the ground. (Recent articles by elites at the Council on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institute reveal that they are as committed to partitioning Syria as ever.)  Washington wants to  reassert its exceptional role as the uncontested steward of global security and the lone ‘unipolar’ world power. That’s what this whole “hacking” fiasco is about. The big shots who run the country are trying to strong-arm ‘the Donald’ into carrying their water so the depredations can continue and Central Asia can be transformed into a gigantic Washington-dominated corporate free trade zone where the Big Money calls the shots and Capital reigns supreme. That’s their dreamstate, Capitalist Valhalla. They just need Trump to get-with-the-program so the bloodletting can continue apace. Mike Whitney lives in Washington state.
