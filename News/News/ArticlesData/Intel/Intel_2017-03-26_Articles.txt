This means sectors like manufacturing, education, and tech will soon be relying on machine intelligence to get the job done. Like always, Intel is following in the footsteps of other tech giants like Apple and Google to stay ahead in the AI game. Intel recently acquired Nervana, which focuses solely on AI. According to the press release, the company will be aligning its AI efforts under a single cross-Intel organization: the Artificial Intelligence Products Group (AIPG). “I am personally very energized about the opportunities before us as an industry. As CEO of Nervana, an AI company that Intel acquired last year, I saw what could be done. Now, after six months here, I see how the world can change when a company like Intel focuses on an effort. I believe this new organization will have a huge impact, not only for Intel, but upon the entire evolving AI space,” said Naveen Rao, who is now the vice president and general manager of the Artificial Intelligence Products Group at Intel. According to analysts from Technavio, the global artificial intelligence market in the industrial sector to grow at a CAGR of 52.65 percent during 2017-2021. The artificial intelligence (AI) market in the United States education sector is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 47.5 percent during 2017-2021, according to a new report by market research firm Research and Markets. As part of this AI initiative, Intel will be exploring novel architectural and algorithmic approaches to inform future generations of AI. “This includes a range of solutions from the data center to edge devices, and from training to inference – all designed to enable Intel and its customers to innovate faster. This will be the home for AI innovation at Intel,” said Rao. As always, Intel aims to be a trend setter. The company has earlier made its presence felt in computational trends, such as personal and cloud computing. “Intel intends to rally the industry around a set of standards for AI that ultimately brings down costs and makes AI more accessible to more people – not only institutions, governments and large companies, as it is today,” he said. “Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the world around us and will bring new capabilities to everything from smart factories to drones to sports to health care and to driverless cars. Data is the common thread across all these applications, and our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across every industry,” he added.

Before its launch, Apple’s most ardent supporters were looking forward to a robust device that could actually carry the esteemed MacBook Pro moniker. While the unveiled device turned out to be a physically stunning machine with a lot of neat tricks, it was nonetheless limited in a number of ways. Critics of the 2016 MacBook Pro took issue with the machine’s limitations, including its severe lack of ports and unavoidable reliance on external dongles and ports. Its incapability for RAM upgrades was also heavily criticized, with some even stating that the Apple had all but removed what made the laptop a “Pro” level device in the first place. If recent rumors prove right, however, it appears that Apple might have an ace up its sleeve this year. According to a podcast from CultofMac, there is a pretty good chance that Apple might finally unveil a worthy MacBook Pro this 2017. Here are three notable things that users could expect to see in the upcoming powerhouse laptop. #Мнение: обновление линейки MacBook Pro – https://t.co/43MlnSdoDa#обновление #линейки #MacBookPro #Apple #TouchBar #USBC #ноутбуки #новинки pic.twitter.com/6bgdrbhkcM — R-Ht.ru Гаджеты (@r_ht_gadgets) March 16, 2017 Kaby Lake/Ryzen 7 Chips One of the most significant drawbacks of the 2016 MacBook Pro was found in its processors. While the device’s Intel Core i5 and Core i7 Skylake processors were capable enough, they were nonetheless underpowered compared to the chipmaker’s current flagship chips, the Kaby Lake processors. Back in January, notable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the MacBook Pro 2017 lineup would finally be equipped with Intel’s latest processors, which would effectively increase the productivity capabilities of the Cupertino-based tech giant’s professional-grade laptop, according to a MacWorld report. Other rumors suggest that the MacBook Pro 2017 would run on AMD’s Ryzen 7 chips instead. AMD’s current flagship processors have been making waves in the tech world lately, with critics noting that the performance of AMD Ryzen 7 chips is comparable to Intel Kaby Lake processors. Regardless of whether Apple opts for Intel’s Kaby Lake or AMD’s Ryzen 7 chips, however, one thing remains sure – the MacBook Pro 2017 would boast truly formidable specs. 32GB RAM One huge limitation of Skylake chips in the MacBook Pro 2016 was the fact that they could only support up to 16GB of laptop-grade RAM. Apple stated that while a 2016 MacBook Pro with 32GB of memory would have been possible, the tech giant would have been forced to utilize a desktop-grade and battery-draining RAM unit. With this in mind, Apple has opted to cap the 2016 MacBook Pro with a 16GB RAM unit instead. While 16GB of memory is adequate for most tasks, heavy users lamented that the 2016 MacBook Pro’s RAM was simply far too limited for intensive computing. Fortunately, rumors state that the upcoming flagship laptop would feature 32GB of laptop-grade memory, allowing users of the machine to perform intensive tasks seamlessly. Got a new toy today #MacBookPro pic.twitter.com/pQcH6sf3Jn — Scott Dougherty (@BmxDougherty) March 26, 2017 Better Radeon Graphics Apple’s most powerful iteration of the 2016 MacBook Pro was designed with dual-graphics, equipped with an Intel HD Graphics chip and an AMD Radeon Pro 455 unit. Unsurprisingly, this particular configuration was only available in Apple’s high-end 15-inch MacBook Pro, which is the most expensive variant of the device. Fortunately, rumors are high that the 2017 MacBook Pro would utilize a more powerful GPU, such as the Radeon RX 500 unit. If these rumors prove true, the upcoming flagship laptop would be able to perform graphics-intensive tasks without a hitch, further establishing the machine as a professional-grade laptop. The release date for the MacBook Pro 2017 has not been revealed as of date, though speculations are high that the device would be released sometime in October this year. Pricing for the devices remain unknown, but rumors are high that the powerhouse laptop would be priced at a premium.

By Federico Grandesso Italian Editor, Journalist Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn + Intel and Deutsche Messe joined forces to produce an unparalleled live demo showcase at CeBIT 2017 to highlight the diverse commercial applications of the latest drone systems. The Intel CeBIT Drone Park at the Hannover Exhibition Center providaed a unique insight into the entire UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) value chain, with visitors being able to see drone demonstrations in a variety of applications. Visitors also experienced how the comprehensive data gathered by the drones are converted into usable information at a central control station by means of special analysis and visualization tools. The results and 3D graphics generated from the drone’s raw data are then used to provide information for decisions – for instance, the drone surveys an array of solar collectors and the gathered information will tell you when the solar plant is next up for maintenance. New Europe : Can you give some examples of how you can use the new drones you’re presenting here in Hannover?  Matthias Beldzik : All the cases we present here are about area-imaging from up in the air, the first case is about one of Europe’s largest chemical parks, ChemPark, which is located in Leverkusen and which was inspected in just a day and a half. We flew over the area taking pictures, after which we processed the data and received more detailed information. For a second project, we had a collaboration with Bauhaus University, which is specialized in structural inspections, virtual reality and data processing. With our systems, we flew over and beside constructions to create highly accurate 3D modelling in order to be able to detect damages and cracks just from the data.  This is a very cost efficient way and you can do it with bridges and any kind of constructions, including heritage monuments. Another extremely important use is for oil inspections in platforms, for example the drones are very stable and safe; you can fly these objects very efficiently – compared to conventional methods, you are up to 90% safer. Here you can do live inspections which result in live images on your desk, you can process the data, you can do RGB imaging, and you are able to create 3D modelling as well in order to detect cracks, damages and hot spots very quickly. You don’t have to shut down anything; you can keep it running, make your money and keep the production going. The last case is about an inspection of a solar park over which we flew over and took images and stills in order to identify hot ports and defects of the modules. NE : Are these drones efficient for security missions too?    MB : They are not specialized for security but depending on the kind of security, you can use them as well. However, we have other systems like the Intel Aero Platform which allows you to put a map on the drone and tell the drone how to fly indoors or even outdoors. NE : How do you see the future of drones and growth possibilities? MB : Intel’s approach is to lead the market and bring innovative technology into it, aiming to shape the complete eco-system. During the Super Ball show, at half time throughout Lady Gaga’s performance, we displayed a lot of drones (Swarming Drones) up in air, lighting up the sky night. Another approach, for instance, is the Aero Platform for researchers which help them develop their own drone solutions, so I see a lot potential for the future. I think that the major growth will take place in industrial inspections and construction – in the US, for example, they have many uninspected constructions they need to inspect, so if you can do it frequently and efficiently, there will be a real benefit. NE : How can we use drones in emergencies? Do we have any cases to exemplify it?  MB : Firemen and the police are our customers as well. During the Italian earthquake in Amatrice we had a research project together with an Italian university and we were there to inspect whatever evidence the ruins showed and check for safety issues. The police can do further inspections for some rescuing as well –  we have first aid operators, charity organizations and NGOs going to areas hit by disasters to help.  If you go in a war zone, it is almost impossible to get help from the authorities, but you need to know where you can set up your base.  In this case, rescue teams use this system as well to search for survivors.  NE : Can you tell me about some new technologies we are going to see soon in the market? MB : For the future, we would like to implement on-board processing power and collision avoidance system, meaning that the drone would stop before hitting an obstacle or fly around it automatically – it is a smart system. NE : How can a drone producer like Intel still be competitive in this complex and innovative market? MB : The great difference is the holistic approach. In the end, it is about the data and the data centres and about the data needing to be processed, meaning you need an increased processing power. After that, the drone needs to be connected because there are more and more drones up in the air and you need to be safe and have them on your radar. The 5G will be a great opportunity to implement more drones in the airspace; the drone is just like any smart technological phenomenon, such as autonomous driving – you need an innovative system behind.         Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn + Load next: Jeroen Dijsselbloem: (euro)zoning out Related News News Scottish Parliament backs call for second independence referendum By Irene Kostaki News Fico says Slovakia’s place is in EU By Beata Stur News EU makes progress in renewable energy market By New Europe Online/KG News Exclusive: 13 member states sign for enhanced cooperation on EPPO launch By Ariti-Marina Alamanou COPYRIGHT 2016 NEW EUROPE.

John Hickenlooper names former Intel VP Tony Neal-Graves to lead the state's broadband efforts. by News Staff / March 21, 2017 Tony Neal-Graves, the new executive director of the Colorado Broadband Office. Colorado Governor's Office Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper has tapped Tony Neal-Graves, a former vice president of Intel Corp., to lead the state’s broadband expansion and enhancement efforts, according to a release from the governor’s office. Neal-Graves, who started work Wednesday, March 15, serves as executive director in charge of Colorado’s broadband office, and his experience with Intel is expected to be an asset as he uses public-private partnerships to drive the state’s broadband strategy and expand high-speed access for its residents. Only 70 percent of Colorado’s rural residents currently have access to broadband, a number the state plans to raise to 85 percent by the end of 2018, and 100 percent by the end of 2020. “We are working tirelessly to make sure every county throughout the state has the tools needed for economic development — especially in rural areas,” Hickenlooper said in the release. “Tony’s leadership will help move the needle so that all Coloradans have improved access to broadband services sooner rather than later.” RELATED Colorado Seeks Marijuana Users for First-Ever Online Health Survey Colorado Municipalities Vote to Take Back Control of Broadband Colorado Jurisdictions to Probe Potential of Municipal Broadband Neal-Graves' experience in the telecommunications arena extends past Intel, where he worked for 15 years. Before Intel, Neal-Graves spent 20 years working with industry giants such as AT&T, Bell Laboratories and Lucent Technologies. The broadband office that Neal-Graves is heading up will be housed in the Governor’s Office of Information Technology, where officials say it will work closely with the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, the Department of Local Affairs and other agencies. Colorado Digital Transformation Officer Brandon Williams has emphasized how critical broadband is to the state, citing plans involving the Broadband Office that Neal-Graves is now spearheading.

Year to date on Phoronix there have already been 842 original news articles and 91 featured articles and Linux hardware reviews. This year we've seen the launch of AMD's Ryzen processors that dominated much of the talk in our forums over the past month. There's also been more progress by Valve on Linux drivers, Mesa becoming much more mature for both OpenGL and Vulkan implementations, Vulkan continuing to make progress by the day, and the Linux kernel Git continuing to pick up more and more features. Below is a look at the most-viewed news articles and featured articles/reviews. As always, if you appreciate all of the original content and benchmarks carried out on Phoronix seven days per week, 365 days per year, please consider joining Phoronix Premium to benefit from ad-free viewing, multi-page articles on a single page, and helping to support more Linux hardware benchmarks in the future. PayPal tips are also graciously accepted. Thanks for your support. AMD's Ryzen Will Really Like A Newer Linux Kernel AMD's Ryzen CPU is finally shipping in a few days! If you are planning to be an early adopter of AMD Ryzen processors, you will really want to be running a newer Linux kernel release for proper support and performance. DRM Updates Submitted For Linux 4.11, Torvalds Explodes Over Code Quality David Airlie submitted the main DRM driver updates for the Linux 4.11 kernel, but Linus Torvalds isn't happy about the code quality of a new addition and is considering not accepting the DRM changes for this next kernel release. Ten Exciting Features Of The Linux 4.10 Kernel The Linux 4.10 kernel didn't end up being released today, but was pushed back by an extra week. However, in looking forward to next weekend, here are ten of the features that excite us about Linux 4.10. Ten Features You Will Not Find In The Mainline Linux 4.10 Kernel With last weekend mentioning ten exciting features of Linux 4.10, the tables have turned and now we are looking at ten features not found in the mainline Richard Stallman: Goodbye to GNU Libreboot The drama over Libreboot, a downstream of Coreboot, wanting to leave the GNU has come to an end. It's Now Possible To Disable & Strip Down Intel's ME Blob Many free software advocates have been concerned by Intel's binary-only Management Engine (ME) built into the motherboards on newer generations of Intel motherboards. The good news is there is now a working, third-party approach for disabling the ME and reducing the risk of its binary blobs. Valve Developer Posts New AMD GPU Debugging Tool, Part Of Improving Linux Driver Another Valve developer has begun contributing to the open-source AMD Linux graphics driver stack. Besides posting some RADV Vulkan patches last week, today he's announced a new GPU debugging tool he's been working on for AMD's driver/hardware. NVIDIA Makes Huge Code Contribution To Qt, New Qt 3D Studio The Qt Company today announced Qt 3D Studio, a new 3D UI authoring system, thanks to NVIDIA providing Qt with hundreds of thousands of lines of source code making up this application. Valve Has Another Linux Graphics Driver Developer Working On Open-Source AMD You may have noticed recently that Timothy Arceri has been working on AMD Mesa/Gallium3D improvements while previously he mostly focused on the Intel driver stack at Collabora. It turns out this change-over is due to Arceri having joined Valve to work on the open-source AMD Linux driver stack. Valve Hires X11 Veteran Keith Packard To Work On The Linux Display Stack Valve's latest high-profile hire is adding Keith Packard to their roster of Linux graphics driver developers. And the most viewed featured articles: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X Linux Benchmarks The day many of you have been waiting for is finally here: AMD Zen (Ryzen) processors are shipping! Thanks to AMD coming around at the last minute, I received a Ryzen 7 1800X yesterday evening and have been putting it through its paces. Here is my walkthrough of the Linux experience for the AMD Ryzen and new motherboard and a number of the initial Linux benchmarks for this high-end Zen CPU while much more coverage is coming in the hours and days ahead. Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu Linux Gaming Performance With NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060/1080 It's been a while since last testing Windows 10 vs. Linux on different, newer Linux game ports with a variety of GPUs, but that changed this week. As mentioned this weekend, I've been working on a large, fresh Windows vs. Linux gaming performance comparison. The results available today are for NVIDIA with testing a GeForce GTX 1060 and GTX 1080 on Windows 10 Pro x64 and Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 with the latest drivers and using a variety of newer Direct3D 11/12 / OpenGL / Vulkan games. AMD Ryzen 7 1700 Linux Benchmarks: Great Multi-Core Performance For $329 Yesterday we posted launch-day Ryzen 7 1800X Linux benchmarks that were particularly appealing for multi-core / heavily-threaded workloads like code compilation. Given all the code compilation done by Linux users in particular, if you were intrigued by the Ryzen 7 1800X performance but find the $499 USD price-tag to be too higher, today I have my initial benchmark figures on the Ryzen 7 1700. The Ryzen 7 1700 is still eight cores and sixteen threads but will only set you back $329 USD as the current low-end Ryzen processor for what's currently available.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Reviews Ryzen 7 1700 and 1700X review: better than the 1800X? AMD's cheaper eight-core CPUs cut little and offer big value. By Richard Leadbetter Published 26/03/2017 The beauty of building a PC is that a diversity of parts allows users to construct a computer specifically designed to best serve their particular needs. AMD's Ryzen 7 1800X may not have taken Intel's crown for gaming, but the price vs performance ratio for just about everything else propels the fledgling line of processors well into contention. The Ryzen 7 1800X we recently reviewed isn't the only new AMD eight-core chip you can buy: cheaper 1700X and 1700 processors are available, and that is where the value really becomes difficult to ignore. Fundamentally, not much separates the three Ryzen 7s except clock-speeds. The 1700X drops a couple of hundred megahertz, but saves you £130/$100. Meanwhile, the entry-level 1700 sees a 3.0GHz base clock - some way off the top-tier model's 3.6GHz - but offers exceptional value at £299/$330. It's cheaper than the i7 7700K here, but offers twice as many cores and threads and absolutely monsters it in most - but not all - multithreaded tasks. All the Ryzen chips are can overclock, and all have the maximum L3 cache. Provided they OC to approximately the same level, it must be said that the entry-level 1700 looks particularly compelling. Going into this review, we were considering the kind of processor that we would choose if we were building one of our office PCs, now dominated by enthusiast-level i7s and older, ten-core Xeons (amazingly cheap, and tend to slot into older Sandy Bridge-E boards). Our systems need to accommodate gaming, but just as important, if not more so, is multi-threaded performance for video editing and encoding. Ryzen 7 1800X offers great value against the eight-core i7s, but we suspect that the fight would be closer, up against an overclocked six-core enthusiast chip (our very own John Linneman runs an i7 5820K at a rock-solid 4.5GHz). However, the Ryzen line is cheaper, and processors can be run on cheaper motherboards - all of which overclock the processor if required. Our test system, featuring the Asus Crosshair 6 Hero AMD provided motherboards, coolers, processors and memory to the majority of the specialist press, including Digital Foundry. Different outlets received different boards paired with different processors - with Asus, Gigabyte and MSI represented as partners for the Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X and 1700. We received the 1700X and 1700 a few days after the 1800X, and chose to use the Asus Crosshair 6 Hero motherboard for testing. This board sits at the higher-end of the Asus spectrum, based on the firm's ROG (Republic of Gaming) branding. It's based on AMD's top-tier X370 chipset, which offers all of the required overclocking features along with more PCI Express lanes for support of the latest high-speed storage formats. You can't ignore the surfeit of USB ports on the rear along with high-end connectivity including USB 3.1 in both Type-C and Type-A configurations, M.2 support plus Intel gigabit Ethernet, LANGuard and GameFirst technologies. And yes, in common with most higher-end boards these days, the Crosshair 6 Hero glows however you want it to via 'Aura' RGB lighting. It has the required 3200MHz DDR4 compatibility, watercooler headers and eight SATA-6G ports. Suffice to say, this is one of the most strongly specced AM4 boards you can buy right now. To ensure optimal Ryzen performance, we used low latency 14-14-14-34 GSkill Flare-X memory running at 3200MHz and validated for use with AMD's new line. To hit this level of performance, you will need to update the motherboard BIOS - be sure to do that before selecting a higher speed. We compared the Ryzen 7s to Intel system's using legacy data from our previous Kaby Lake reviews. Here we used four sticks of Corsair Vengeance LPX RAM rated at 3000MHz with 15-17-17-35 latency. This same memory was used to benchmark the Core i7 6900K and i7 5960X, which uses a quad-channel memory set-up. However, here, the XMP profile boosted base clock to 125MHz, overclocking processors. We dropped the base clock based to its standard 100MHz, necessitated an overclock here to 3200MHz. Because we used four modules, the X99 platform defaulted to quad-channel memory mode, potentially offering a significant bandwidth advantage over both the 7700K and the Ryzen system. The bottom line is that for a more versatile PC build, AMD's new Ryzen line has much to commend it, and as we shall see, if you're willing to spend a little extra on memory and a decent cooling solution, the Ryzen 7 1700 effectively makes its more expensive counterparts somewhat redundant. And while benchmarks and hardcore multithreaded apps do see a performance differential between the three Ryzen offerings in line with clock-speeds, the fact is that you really do pay a premium for just a little extra, which becomes even more of a non-issue in gaming tests. Ironically, while the 1800X does indeed compare favourably with Intel's $1050 Core i7 6900K, it does look over-priced compared to the 1700X and 1700. Which is the best Ryzen and just how much value do you get? Rich offers his insight. Ryzen 7 1800X Ryzen 7 1700X Ryzen 7 1700 Cores/Threads 8/16 8/16 8/16 Base Clock 3.6GHz 3.4GHz 3.0GHz Boost Clock 4.0GHz 3.8GHz 3.7GHz Cache 16MB 16MB 16MB TDP 95W 95W 65W Launch Pricing £499/$499 £370/$399 £299/$329 Buy the Ryzen 7 line from Amazon with free shipping: AMD Ryzen 7 1700 Eight-Core CPU [?] AMD Ryzen 7 1700X Eight-Core CPU [?] AMD Ryzen 7 1800X Eight-Core CPU [?] Initial benchmarks throw up some fascinating comparisons. Cinebench R15 is often used as a basic barometer for single and multi-thread performance. The top-tier Ryzen compares favourably with the last two generations of Intel's eight-core chips in terms of single-thread performance, but even the 1700X beats the 6900K in the multi-threaded benchmark, while the base 1700 takes point over Intel's last-gen eight-thread beast - the Core i7 5960X. The mainstream Intel quad-core i7 7700K falls behind in multi-thread performance, as expected, but it remains king of the hill in single-thread power owing to faster clocks and the latest Intel architecture. The video encoding benchmarks are fascinating though. Handbrake uses the open source x264 video encoder for its h.264 support - a piece of code massively optimised for multi-threaded CPUs. It's fascinating to see the eight-core chips jostle for position in a hardcore 4K encoding challenge based on the settings we use for our video download site, DigitalFoundry.net, and indeed our YouTube uploads. The Ryzen 7 1800X is faster than the 6900K, while the 1700X is only a touch slower than the older 5960X. The entry-level Ryzen 7 1700 is slower, but should be on par or better than the Intel six-core processors, while easily besting the quad-core 7700K. Thus far, what's clear is that AMD has taken a significant lead over Intel in terms of price vs performance, but even though there is a clear division between the Ryzens, the cheaper you go, the more value you gain. In terms of 'fps for the money', the Ryzen 7 1700 is the clear winner, with a 14 per cent lead over the 1700X, rising to 25 per cent over the 1800X. Effectively, losing five per cent performance compared to the top-tier chip saves prospective 1700X owners $100, while 1700 buyers lose 15 per cent in processing grunt but only pay around two thirds of the price. However, the x265 HEVC encoding challenge sees all the challengers group up somewhat, and Intel starts to stage a stronger comeback. This 'next-gen' video codec is extremely challenging and takes an age to encode, but offers approximately the same image quality as h.264 for half the bandwidth. We introduced support for this on DigitalFoundry.net early this year, and it takes an age to complete with 4K content - even on our eight and ten-core Intel chips. Ryzen is still fast, but loses ground because HEVC encoding uses AVX2 instructions - an area where AMD's new architecture is weak. It's interesting to note that the sheer frequency offered by the 7700K sees it putting in a great showing overall, stealing a lead over the Ryzen 7 1700 with twice the cores. It's a sign that while Ryzen can command a great lead over its competition at similar price-points, it's not just gaming where it can fall a little short. Core i7 7700K Core i7 5960X Core i7 6900K Ryzen 7 1700 Ryzen 7 1700X Ryzen 7 1800X Cinebench R15 Single-Core 187 133 167 153 144 162 Cinebench R15 Multi-Core 963 1310 1460 1390 1491 1605 Handbrake 0.10.5 x264 13.1fps 17.5fps 18.5fps 16.2fps 17.2fps 19.6fps Handbrake 0.10.5 x265/HEVC 6.2fps 6.9fps 7.2fps 5.7fps 6.0fps 6.5fps However, overall, our tests show that the less expensive Ryzens still compete well overall, and if you're looking for a balanced build capable of fast performance on many different workloads, they demand attention. But as good as productivity and video encoding performance may be, gaming is still an important part of what we want from a PC so the question is this - to what extent do the frequency drops on the cheaper parts impact gaming performance? We paired each Ryzen with low latency C14 3200MHz Flare-X DDR4 supplied by GSkill, and ran each processor on an Asus motherboard based on the X370 chipset - the Crosshair 6 Hero, specifically. As always, our gaming tests are carried out using an overclocked Titan X Pascal processor operating at 1080p. The objective here is to shift the primary limiting factor in gaming performance away from the GPU and squarely towards CPU and memory bandwidth. In short, we test raw processor power here to judge relative performance and to measure how much 'extra' each chip may have in the tank compared to one another. By extension, this is a pretty good measure of the longevity of the CPU in an age where we should realistically expect a processor to have a good four to five-year lifespan. Suffice to say that the Intel processors dominate in key benchmarks here, but CPU-heavy titles like Assassin's Creed Unity and Crysis 3 still see AMD remaining competitive. Performance isn't bad per se on any of the titles (the cheapest Ryzen offering 107fps in one of The Witcher 3's most challenging areas is still quite a feat!) but it's clear to see that even some heavily multithreaded games where Ryzen should do well sees Intel push ahead. Rise of the Tomb Raider and Ashes of the Singularity's hardcore CPU test stand out here. Far Cry Primal's reliance on single-thread performance also sees a big Intel win, though this is one of the titles where disabling SMT (AMD's hyper-threading if you like), brings Ryzen back into contention - against the 6900K at least. But the point is that assuming you're set on a Ryzen build for non-gaming reasons, you lose even less performance going for a cheaper AMD eight-core chip than you do in video encoding benchmarks. It's unlikely that you're going to notice much of a difference between the three chips running at stock frequencies based on the results we see here, especially in the here and now on less capable GPUs than the overclocked Titan X Pascal we're using here. Ryzen 7 1800X was a decent enough gaming CPU in our review, and the paltry differences with the cheaper chips make them much more compelling. All three Ryzens put through their paces in our gaming test suite, with the Core i7 7700K tossed in for good measure. 1080p/Titan X OC Ryzen 7 1700 Ryzen 7 1700X Ryzen 7 1800X Core i7 7700K Core i7 6900K Memory Frequency 3200MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 3000MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 116.1 118.3 119.4 132.2 122.1 Ashes of the Singularity, DX12, CPU Test 33.5 34.6 35.3 41.9 46.6 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 127.1 132.4 137.5 138.2 150.8 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 127.4 127.1 129.3 133.8 131.4 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 85.2 89.3 91.1 137.9 105.6 Rise of the Tomb Raider DX12, Very High, SMAA 80.8 84.0 85.8 126.5 129.0 The Witcher 3, Ultra, No Hairworks 107.9 113.3 118.8 139.4 134.3 As we researched further into Ryzen performance, the wafer-thin differential between each of the three offerings became even more evident. All of them support the same level of memory bandwidth. Similar to Intel processors, gaming performance scales according to the frequency of the DDR4 you have, and the first three entries on the table below are somewhat eye-opening. We ran our GSkill Flare-X modules at a slow 2133MHz to emulate cheaper, less performant DDR4 and then re-benched. The bottom line is that the difference between 2133MHz and 3200MHz DDR4 is more impactful on gaming performance than the reductions in core-clock frequencies as we travel down the Ryzen 7 stack. Remarkably, a Ryzen 7 1700 paired with 3200MHz outperforms the much more expensive 1800X paired with 2133MHz memory on all but one game (Crysis 3 - and even there, it's a margin of error stuff). It should be stressed that we didn't see anything like this in video encoding benchmarks but the difference is profound enough that if gaming has more importance for you, it makes more sense to spend money on faster memory as opposed to a faster Ryzen. But the big news based on our testing is that all the Ryzen 7 processors effectively hit their overclocking limits in 4.0GHz to 4.1GHz territory. Pushing higher requires voltages AMD doesn't recommend for the longevity of the processor, so we didn't push further. We benched all of them, and found results entirely within margin of error - so effectively, with a reasonable overclock in place, there is nothing to separate a cheap Ryzen 7 1700 with the top-of-the-line 1800X running at the same 4.0GHz all-core frequency. All things being equal, you can buy the 1700, pair it with fast memory and a decent cooler and still have cash left over. The result is a system that beats the Ryzen 7 1800X at stock frequencies and effectively a match when overclocked. However, we should stress that this is just a test based on one chip and with the silicon lottery, there is the chance that you may receive a less capable chip. All the Ryzens comfortably overclock to 4.0GHz, but not too much beyond. The result is that the Ryzen 7 1700 offers the biggest boost from overclocking and beats 1800X performance. 1080p/Titan X OC Ryzen 7 1700 Ryzen 7 1800X Ryzen 7 1800X Ryzen 7 1800X 4.0GHz Ryzen 7 1700X 4.0GHz Ryzen 7 1700 4.0GHz Memory Frequency 3200MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 2133MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 116.1 119.4 112.2 120.8 119.5 121.3 Ashes of the Singularity, DX12, CPU Test 33.5 35.3 31.6 36.8 37.0 36.9 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 127.1 137.5 128.6 143.8 143.5 144.1 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 127.4 129.3 125.5 128.4 129.4 128.3 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 85.2 91.1 79.2 97.2 96.9 97.2 Rise of the Tomb Raider DX12, Very High, SMAA 80.8 85.8 76.8 89.9 88.9 90.0 The Witcher 3, Ultra, No Hairworks 107.9 118.8 98.9 121.3 120.8 120.4 They say that there's no such thing as a free lunch but on the face of it, the Ryzen 7 1700 may beg to differ - given the right coaxing, it's just as good as an 1800X in virtually every measurable criterion. There is only one caveat: the lower binned chip requires more voltage to run at higher frequencies and in our tests, this resulted in about 45W extra under extreme load when compared to the 1800X performing the same task (more effort in voltage tweaking in the BIOS could address this, depending on how good your chip is). And of course, this translates into excess heat, meaning the supplied cooler really isn't up to the task - but it should be stated that overclocking any of the Ryzens requires a fairly meaty thermal solution. There's diminishing returns in overclocking the 1800X and to a lesser extent, the 1700X. However, with a top-end 25 per cent boost to throughput on all eight cores and 16 threads with all under load, clearly the entry-level Ryzen offers the best deal here - and in gaming frame-rate terms, that overclock adds around 10 to 14 per cent of extra juice. And if you check out the h.264 encoding 'performance for the money' metrics below, you'll see just how stark the value proposition is. Even with the 7700K clocked to 4.8GHz, the entry-level Ryzen is still well ahead. It's a fascinating result overall, and with at least one of our workstations here at Digital Foundry due for renewal, replacing it with an overclocked Ryzen 7 1700 seems like the best bet overall - alternatives would be a six-core 6800K Intel system, or an overclocked 7700K. For the kinds of workloads we have, Ryzen seems to be the best bet. But obviously, if your skew is more towards gaming, we still feel that the i7 7700K offers more longevity. That situation may change when Ryzen makes an appearance in future consoles: at that point, we can safely assume that the game optimisations AMD is promising will become commonplace. However, in the here and now, those who stream their video games and prefer higher quality software encoding results to the efforts of GPU solutions like Nvidia's Shadowplay may also consider Ryzen - hiving off a couple of cores for video is something you'd need a six-core CPU to achieve without impacting on gameplay frame-rates. Our h.264 video benchmark is a challenging 4K encode of this Rise of the Tomb Raider comparison, based on the settings we use for our downloads at DigitalFoundry.net. For our 'fps for the money' metric below, we used more stable US pricing. Ranked by Value 4K h.264 Encoding Price FPS per $100 USD Ryzen 1700 4.0GHz OC 20.2fps $329 6.13 Ryzen 1700 16.2fps $329 4.92 Ryzen 1700X 17.2fps $399 4.31 Core i7 7700K 4.8GHz OC 14.8fps $349 4.24 Ryzen 1800X 19.6fps $499 3.92 Core i7 7700K 13.1fps $349 3.75 Core i7 6900K 4.4GHz OC 22.8fps $1050 2.17 Core i7 6900K 18.5fps $1050 1.76 AMD Ryzen 7 1700/1700X: the Digital Foundry verdict There's a range of advice we can offer to any prospective Ryzen owners. First, the more expensive 1800X is only recommended if you want the fastest possible stock processor, no matter what the cost. Highly clocked out of the box, there's not a huge amount more you can squeeze out of it via overclocking. Compared to a $1050 Intel chip, it's a raging bargain but not a great deal when stacked up against its siblings. That said, it follows the grand PC hardware tradition of the top-end offering yielding diminishing returns in exchange for a large price premium. Shadow of the surrealists Investigating The Last Guardian's architecture. Not only that, but based on our memory bandwidth testing, an 1800X should be matched with fast memory, or its advantages can swiftly diminish into nothingness compared to slower Ryzens running faster RAM (on gaming, at least). The 1700X is clearly the better buy out of the two X processors, offering around 95 per cent of the performance of the top-tier offering while saving you a hefty amount of cash - money better spent elsewhere in your PC system. If you're not so interested in overclocking and want a potent Ryzen system with the minimum of tweaking, the 1700X is our recommendation. But in our opinion, it's the entry-level Ryzen 7 1700 that is perhaps the most appealing chip for the PC enthusiast. Its lower base clocks see the processor drop to a much lower TDP, meaning a good cut to energy consumption. And while it is obviously slower in CPU-heavy tasks at stock clocks, it remains surprisingly competitive in gaming - even before you start to overclock it. But it's when you do indeed start to ramp up the frequency that the chip hits the height of its appeal - with all the silicon lottery caveats in place, you do stand a good chance of getting 1800X performance or perhaps better with a third lopped off the price. As good as that is, it's still not going to challenge Intel in the gaming stakes, but you're effectively getting the best that the new Ryzen 7 line offers, and all at a highly reasonable price-point.

Digital Trends Home > Wearables > Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45: Our first take Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45: Our first take Tag Heuer's Connected Modular 45 is a Swiss timepiece first, smartwatch second By Andy Boxall — March 25, 2017 3:00 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Astonishing attention to detail, superb build quality, and the latest tech inside: This is a true Swiss smartwatch for the connoisseur If you want the real deal, by which we mean a smartwatch with true Swiss-made credentials, there is only one choice: the new Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. It’s the second smartwatch from Tag Heuer, following the Carrera Connected last year, and once again Intel has been heavily involved with the device’s creation. But the partnership goes much deeper than simply stuffing one of Intel’s chips inside a Tag Heuer designed body. The two companies collaborated so closely, the end result combines Intel’s technical know-how and Tag Heuer’s passion for watches in a way that truly makes it stand apart from the rest. It’s easy to pass Android Wear watches off as the same experience in a slightly different body, but don’t make that mistake with the Connected Modular 45. Intel’s Jerry Bautista, vice president of New Technology, sat down with Digital Trends at the Baselworld 2017 trade show to give us a peek at the watch in detail, share how the relationship between the two companies worked, and the lengths both went to in order to produce it. Swiss build, Intel tech The Connected Modular 45 is an evolution of the Carrera Connected. For example, to ensure a round screen was used on the first model — a Tag Heuer requirement — Intel had to build the electronics that were hidden by the flat-tire screen design into the section with the “Swiss Made” inscription on the body. Tag Heuer was opposed at first, but grew to like the look, and has turned it into a design feature on the Connected Modular 45 by mirroring it at the opposite end of the body. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends While a plastic rear panel on the Carrera Connected allowed the antennas to work, the new model’s body is made entirely of titanium. The watch still has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, plus the addition of GPS and NFC; but titanium doesn’t play well with antennas, so how do they talk to the world? Look closely at the side of the screen and you’ll see two sections sandwiched together. The lower piece contains all the antennas. It was a huge technical challenge to make this work, but it not only improves the design, but also the efficiency: There’s a 70 percent improvement in Wi-Fi performance because of it. Wondering where the ambient light sensor is? The watch collects light data through the watch face, and channels it down into Intel’s sensor, which adjusts the display accordingly. A clever alternative to an ugly sensor. The end result combines Intel’s technical know-how and Tag Heuer’s passion. Tag Heuer wanted to have the same depth to the digital screen that it does on its analog watches. To do this, a 2.5mm thick piece of sapphire crystal is placed over the top of the screen, sinking the display down into the body. This was where Intel began to use its skill. Tag Heuer also wanted to build the connected watch in the same way as its traditional watches, using gaskets clamped together to hold everything in place, rather than glue and screws used in electronics. Hand-built Swiss components like the glass and the body are never the same twice, something Intel needed to change if it was to meet the requirements. So it introduced laser measurements to the process, reducing waste, and making it possible to build the Connected Modular 45 in an identical way to every other Tag Heuer watch. Wearing the Connected Modular 45 Now we’ve explained why this is a true Swiss smartwatch, let’s talk about what it’s like to wear. We’ll get the size out of the way first. It’s big. The horns extend way over my wrist, and the flat underside of the watch accentuates the overall size, making it quite unsuitable for small wrists. Once it’s on, though, it’s not uncomfortable, and it’ll fit under a loose shirt cuff. More: Our first take review of the Guess Connect Touch The titanium body keeps it light, and the sapphire crystal over the display looks superb, creating that beautiful 3D look Tag Heuer wanted with the familiar sapphire sheen to catch the eye. The build quality, as you’d expect, is superb. It’s solid as a rock, and obviously made to last. Metal, leather, and rubber straps are all options, and we really liked the blue rubber version with the blue bezel around the screen. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends The design has been refined from the Carrera Connected, and more colors have been added to the range. There’s also now the chance to strip down many of the components to build a custom version, which is where the modular aspect comes in. It’s easy to do — just unclip the horns from the body, using buttons similar to those used to secure the Apple Watch’s strap in place, pull them away from the strap, and that’s it. Tag Heuer will sell you a mechanical Connected Modular 45 body, that uses the same horns and strap, for when you don’t want to wear the digital version. The super rich can even buy a version with a fancy tourbillon movement, which costs $17,000. In total, there are more than 500 possible combinations to personalize the watch using the modular components. Software and future updates Tag Heuer and Intel worked closely with Google to use Android Wear 2.0 on the Connected Modular 45, right down to striking an agreement so the Tag Heuer brand name and logo shows up when you turn the watch on. Intel uses an Atom processor inside the watch, and the software experience is smooth and slick. There are many different official Tag Heuer watch faces included. Tag Heuer and Intel are working on a very special app that will arrive on the Connected Modular 45 in early summer. It’s a time management app made specially for smartwatches, that despite living on a watch, ironically shifts away from relying on time to set and manage our schedules. Bautista gave us an example of how it will work. Say you want to remember to pick up milk on the way home from work, and set a reminder for 6pm. When the alarm sounds, you’re caught up in a meeting and dismiss it. Normally, that would be the end of it, and the milk would inevitably be forgotten. Not so with the new app and the watch. It will understand you’re caught up at work and delay the alarm. It’ll also know when you’re travelling home, and where a grocery store is, then alert you when you’re close by. Because the alert will arrive on your watch, it’s easier to spot even when you’re driving. Naturally it requires location access, but the benefits here are substantial. Conclusion There’s little doubt the Connected Modular 45 is aimed at a niche audience, but that’s not stopping demand outstripping supply. It’s not the abomination some watchmakers would like to believe it is either. It’s proof watchmakers and technology firms really can collaborate successfully, and produce a timepiece that’s true to the industry and the brand’s own ideals, while appealing to the tech fan with strong features and excellent software. It’s what scares and holds back many traditional watch firms from introducing a smartwatch. More: Our first take review of the Montblanc Summit If and when other watches arrive from big-name Swiss firms, they’re going to need partnerships as strong and effective as Tag Heuer’s, Google’s, and Intel’s, if the final product is going to meet the standard set here. Luxury smartwatches are uncharted territory, but when they’re done right, they work. The one thing we want from the next model is a better name. We’d have taken the Carrera Connected 2 over the Connected Modular 45. While we appreciate the Connected Modular 45 as a groundbreaking piece of wearable technology, it’s not the perfect device. It’s still too big and too thick, the design won’t appeal to everyone, and the $1,600 price is a lot of money to pay out for a smartwatch. However, most premium analog Swiss watches also cost a lot of money, and as we’ve learned, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 deserves to stand alongside them as a true representation of the breed. Highs Amazing attention to detail Latest Android Wear 2.0 software Time management app is intriguing and useful Stunning build quality and materials Lows Too big Expensive

Gowdy Defends Nunes' Wacky White House Excursion By John Amato Share Share on facebook Share Share on twitter Share Share on reddit Share Share on sharethis 3/26/17 9:25am 2 days ago by John Amato up Click here for reuse options! Rep. Trey Gowdy told CBS' Face the Nation host John Dickerson that he hadn't seen any of the intelligence Rep. Devin Nunes says he has, but defended the House Intel Committee chairman's highly unusual actions because Trump is the president. Republicans, including Trey Gowdy, went nuts when former president Bill Clinton had an impromptu meeting on an airline runway with then-AG Loretta Lynch, blaming that meeting for shielding Hillary Clinton from being prosecuted for something, when there was no evidence of that at all. Dickerson asked, "Has he shown you any of what caused him to suggest that Obama officials are doing surveillance, captured some Trump campaign associates and then unmasked them in the process of investigating?" Gowdy replied, "He has not shown it to me...I am vaguely familiar with it, no more, no less familiar with it than Adam Schiff is." Rep. Gowdy has no information, though presumably, as the ranking Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff does. The only thing Gowdy has is Nunes' word about why he had to break protocol, and dashed away without even alerting his fellow Republicans on the Intelligence Committee to brief Trump on intel he didn't possess in hand. Gowdy continued with his sophomoric defense, saying, "I will just tell you this. My understanding is Chairman Nunes briefed the Commander-in-Chief on matters unrelated to the Russian investigation, so if that is big deal in Washington, then we have sunk to a new low." Say, what? How does questioning Chairman Nunes' bizarre actions last week mean we've "sunk to a new low?" Gowdy knows from lows. After seven separate committees were formed by Republicans to investigate Benghazi, coming up with nothing, Rep. Gowdy chaired another committee to investigate the same thing. The House Intelligence committee is in the middle of a highly sensitive investigation and Rep. Nunes, uncharacteristically runs to the media and then to Trump, after mysteriously ditching his staff and disappearing the night before and that's not surprising to Rep. Gowdy? Dickerson replied, "I guess Congressman Schiff would say, but the president is the one that is a part of this investigation being done by the committee, so the chairman shouldn't be talking to him." ↓ Story continues below ↓ That is correct. Rep. Nunes acted like a Trump surrogate and not an independent representative chairing an impartial investigation. Gowdy repeated what he said about Nunes not discussing Russia with the president and then said, "So if the Commander-in-Chief cannot be briefed by the chairperson of the House Intel Committee on a matter that has nothing to do with the FBI investigation, then I don't know what they can talk about, John." We have no verification of that at all and Chairman Nunes went to the media in the middle of a very bad week for the Trump administration to try and justify Trump's wacko claims that President Obama wiretapped him. Just like a Trump transition teammate would do. Gowdy then shot down the idea of an independent prosecutor even though Chairman Nunes has destroyed his reputation by mixing all the different aspects of what is being investigated and said, "Independent commission, thank goodness we have one. It's called the FBI. The FBI has counterintelligence jurisdiction and they have criminal jurisdiction." "And what we learned on Monday, and it's about the only thing we learned on Monday, was that the FBI is investigating both." Rep.

Right now, AMD Ryzen rumors are circling about how their processor would only get better with time as BIOS drivers and Windows 10 Scheduler Service updates are released. According to some other rumors, Ryzen would not have new driver support for Windows 7/8.1 and this comes as a disappointing news for people who were not planning to upgrade from Windows 7. Advertisement However, the biggest AMD Ryzen rumor is that Apple has decided to go for an AMD Ryzen APU for their MacBook Pro 2017. This might be possible with Raven Ridge, an AMD APU with Zen core architecture. Raven Ridge is all set to sail through the seas that have been dominated by Intel APU's.  Some Apple rumors suggest that the Cupertino company has decided to use AMD Ryzen because of its superior single thread and multi-thread performance at a lower power draw. The CPU's also run Linux base better than Intel i7. The lower TDP might have led Apple to opt for AMD Ryzen, which ensures maximum productivity at the lower expense of battery cost. AMD Ryzen as of now as been proved to be very effective processors for heavy processing tasks like graphics and editing. Therefore Apple, whose MacBook is a productivity-oriented laptop, would benefit greatly from the AMD Ryzen and Radeon Vega combination in Raven Ridge APUs. AMD Ryzen and Radeon Vega would allow MacBook users to do punchy graphical tasks. As such, AMD Ryzen rumors to be very versatile over a number of Zen architectures. The Raven Ridge would be having DDR4 capable memory, up to 4 Zen CPU cores, Vega architecture GPU, and a 14-nm process node.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai Ex-CIA chief: Flynn's firm discussed removing cleric from US CHAD DAY Associated PressMarch 25, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share WASHINGTON (AP) — Former CIA Director James Woolsey has accused the Trump administration's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, of participating in a discussion with Turkish officials about possibly subverting the U.S. extradition process to remove a Turkish cleric from the United States. The Wall Street Journal first reported Woolsey's comments and posted a video interview with him late Friday . A Flynn spokesman said Friday that Woolsey's claims are "false" and that "no such discussion occurred." In the Journal interview, Woolsey says he walked into the middle of a discussion between Turkish officials and members of Flynn's firm, Flynn Intel Group, late in the evening of Sept. 19 at Essex House hotel in New York City. Woolsey said the discussion generally involved removing cleric Fethullah Gulen from the U.S. without going through the lengthy extradition process, though he said it stopped short of outlining a specific plan to sweep the cleric out of the country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought Gulen's extradition from the U.S. after accusing the cleric of directing a failed coup last summer. The U.S. government has rebuffed that request, and Gulen, who has a green card and lives in Pennsylvania, has denied involvement. Woolsey described the discussion as "brainstorming, but it was brainstorming about a very serious matter that would pretty clearly be a violation of law." Though, Woolsey noted that the discussion "did not rise to the level of being a specific plan to undertake a felonious act." Flynn spokesman Price Floyd told The Associated Press that Flynn Intel Group's work never involved discussing removing Gulen from the United States by any means other than the extradition process. He confirmed that Woolsey attended the meeting but denied that it involved subverting the legal process. "The claim made by Mr. Woolsey that General Flynn or anyone else in attendance discussed physical removal of Mr. Gulen from the United States during a meeting with Turkish officials in New York is false," Floyd said. "No such discussion occurred, nor did Mr. Woolsey ever inform General Flynn that he had any concerns whatsoever regarding the meeting, either before he chose to attend and afterward." The meeting was part of lobbying work Flynn's firm was conducting on behalf of a company, Inovo BV, which is owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. Earlier this month, Flynn and his firm registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents for the work for Alptekin, saying that it could have benefited the Turkish government. Flynn's firm was paid $530,000 over the course of the contract, which ran from August through November while Flynn was a top Trump campaign adviser. Alptekin has told the AP that Flynn's firm registered as a foreign agent under pressure from the Justice Department. As the AP reported earlier this month , Flynn's attorneys twice disclosed to advisers to President Donald Trump after the election that it was likely Flynn would need to register as a foreign agent for the work. The first discussion was with the Trump transition team while Flynn was being considered for the top national security post. After Flynn joined the Trump administration, his attorneys then informed the White House counsel's office that Flynn's foreign agent registration was imminent. The White House has confirmed both contacts. In the video interview, Woolsey said he didn't know if he missed a caveat to the discussion because he arrived late to the September meeting. In addition to Woolsey and Flynn, others present included Alptekin, Flynn's business partner, Bijan Rafiekian, and two Turkish officials: Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is Erdogan's son-in-law. Alptekin has told the AP that he arranged the meeting. Woolsey said he doesn't remember if Flynn actively participated in the discussion. "I don't recall who said what," Woolsey said in the Journal interview. Though in an interview with CNN, he said there "was at least some strong suggestion by one or more of the Americans present at the meeting to the Turks" that the U.S. would be able to get ahold of Gulen. "It was suspicious. It was concerning, and I felt I needed to say something about it to someone, but was it a clear plot that they were going to seize him? No," Woolsey said during the CNN interview . Woolsey has said he informed then-Vice President Joe Biden about the meeting through a mutual friend. Representatives for Biden declined to comment. Woolsey, who served as CIA director under President Bill Clinton and briefly was a member of the Trump transition team, said he served on an advisory board for Flynn Intel Group but never did any work for the firm or received any payment from it. Flynn, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, was fired by Trump last month after Trump said Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are part of House and Senate committee investigations into contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians. ___ Associated Press writer Josh Lederman contributed to this report. ___ Submit reporting tips to The Associated Press: https://www.ap.org/tips Reblog Share Tweet Share Popular in the Community Star athlete → injury → opioids → addiction → death 1230 reactions4%50%46% Clashes in Kashmir: Civilians killed in protests against Indian rule 35 reactions2%77%21% White House plan to help pay for border wall is a long shot 8763 reactions5%65%30% Lawyer says Trump administration moved to squelch testimony 2045 reactions2%64%34% On the brink of famine: Worst humanitarian crisis hits as Trump slashes foreign aid 439 reactions3%68%29% Rep.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif.,, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” “I think the chairman has to make a decision, whether to act as a surrogate of the White House, as he did during the campaign and the transition, or to lead a independent and credible investigation. I hope he chooses the latter.” Nunes and Schiff have been openly fighting since last week, after Nunes told reporters and the White House Wednesday that President Trump’s personal communications might have been picked up by the intelligence community through “incidental collection.” He made the remarks before he had briefed his colleagues on the committee, Republicans and Democrats alike.    Play Video Face The Nation Gowdy defends Nunes' briefing of Trump on communications collection Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, says he believes Chairman Nunes briefed the commander-in-chief on matters unrelated to the Russia investigatio... It’s still the case that none of the members of the committee have been briefed on what Nunes was talking about last week, Schiff said -- “we’re all quite in the dark on this,” he told “Face the Nation” host John Dickerson.  Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, confirmed that he has also not been briefed on the information that Nunes has. He, however, holds a different view of the chairman’s information-sharing with the president. “The chairman of House Intel briefed the commander-in-chief on something that has nothing to do with the Russia investigation,” Gowdy said on “Face the Nation.” “So if the commander-in-chief cannot be briefed by the chairperson of the House Intel Committee on a matter that has nothing to do with the F.B.I. investigation, then I don’t know what they can talk about, John.” Last week, Nunes said of the “incidental collection,” which apparently occurred during the transition, from November to January, that “none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or of the Trump team.”    Schiff also accused Nunes of attempting to “camouflage” the cancellation of an open hearing Tuesday with former top intellegence and Justice Department officials with another hearing -- he has recalled FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers. The California Democrat hypothesized that the hearing with Comey on Monday caused the White House to resist another open hearing involving administration officials.  “I think that hearing went so poorly for the White House that there was a lot of pushback in doing a second open hearing honestly, John, because the other explanations simply don’t make sense,” Schiff said. In that Monday hearing, Comey said there’s no information indicating Obama wiretapped Mr. Trump, and he also confirmed an FBI investigation into possible collusion between Trump associates and Russia.  “We could always have directors Comey and Rogers come back at any time. There’s no necessity of having them come back before the open hearing,” Schiff said. “I think that was merely an effort to camouflage the true object here, which was the closure or the cancellation of the hearing with Sally Yates.”  Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates were to testify in the open hearing Tuesday.   Yates in particular, Schiff thought, “would have shed light on that Flynn chapter” -- a reference to the end of Michael  Flynn’s short tenure as national security adviser, when information surfaced that he had misinformed the vice president about his contacts with Russian envoy, Sergey Kislyak. Flynn had told Pence that he hadn’t discussed President Obama’s sanctions against Russia over its meddling in the election. Yates, who was acting attorney general during this time, told White House officials that she believed Flynn had misled them about the Kislyak conversations.   © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Intel was he was linked to the terror group GAOAEBMIA – Global Attacks on Absolutely Anywhere But Mainly in America. The mission was to just keep track of him. But then I saw he had “bomb” written on the side of his car. And he was heading for San Francisco airport. Time to break the rules and intervene. J panicked and blew himself up. “Well done,” said my boss. “You’ve just stopped a major attack by GAOAEBMIA.” Two months later, I was having dinner with my husband Joe. It was the first time we’d been together since he told me he was working for the CIA and had had to sleep with another woman in the service of his country. My trust levels were low, but I was working on them. Over dessert, we heard a giant explosion. Sci-Tron had just been blown up. We ran to the scene. I noticed a man standing around looking suspicious. “Hi,” he said. “My name is Connor Grant and I’ve just blown up the Sci-Tron centre killing 25 people.” “Then I’m arresting you,” I replied. As I was speaking, Joe ran into the building to try to save someone but got badly injured in a secondary explosion. The medics took an age to pull him out. “Do you think he will be OK?” I asked when we reached the hospital in an ambulance. “It’s touch and go,” they said. Joe pulled through. I could breathe a bit easier. Though not for long. After finding a babysitter for my daughter, whose name I had forgotten and was turning out to be getting in the way of the plot, I went to talk to my old friend Claire who worked in the medical examiner’s office. “Hi Lindsay,” she said. “There’s something strange going on. I’ve just had my fourth person die of an apparent heart attack when the autopsy revealed their hearts were all completely normal.” “That can only mean...” “Yes. We have a serial killer lurking on the streets of San Francisco.” Down at the Hyde Medical Center, a patient called Eddie Lamborghini – spelt like the car of the same name – grinned to himself. He was enjoying pretending to be mad and then spending his evenings going through the tunnels of San Francisco that only he knew about in order to murder random people by injecting them with a muscle relaxant. It was time for Connor Grant’s trial. My close friend Yuki was prosecuting and another close friend Cindy was reporting for the Chronicle. I got to the court to find we were all in for a surprise. Grant had sacked his attorney and had chosen to defend himself. “I’m pleading not guilty,” Grant announced. I knew I was in for a tough time in the witness box when Grant cross-examined me. “Why did you accuse me of being the GAOAEBMIA bomber?” he asked. “Because you admitted it,” I replied. “I was only having a laugh,” he said. “No more questions.” It was a low point in my career when Grant was acquitted and I was put under investigation for trying to frame him. I felt like I needed some me time with my close friends Claire, Yuki and Cindy – who, along with me, were all members of the Women’s Murder Club. “We’ve solved 15 other cases together,” said Cindy encouragingly. “So I’m sure we will solve this one.” “I don’t know,” I replied. “We haven’t even bothered to meet up till page 200. I just feel we’re all getting a bit lazy and are just going through the motions.” 16th Seduction (Women’s Murder Club 16) by James Patterson and Maxine Paetro (Century, £20) “That’s just not fair,” Yuki cried. “This book has taken at least 10 days, 17 hours and 38 minutes to write. Which is a good hour and a half longer than the last one.” Claire then remembered that a phial of a toxic muscle relaxant had been found close to one of the murders. “Maybe if we could find someone walking round with a syringe, we could catch the killer,” she said. Later that evening, I spotted Eddie Lamborghini with a syringe and my partner shot him dead. One crime solved, one to go. Connor Grant felt it was time to change identities for a fourth time before blowing up something else and leaving San Francisco. Just one more thing to do before he left. Email Haight the mastermind behind GAOAEBMIA, who was nicknamed Haight because he lived in the Haight district. That email was the breakthrough I needed and I raced across the city to catch Grant before he blew somewhere else up. But before I could get to him, I discovered someone else had already killed him so I went home to work on my trust issues with Joe. Digested read, digested: Not so sweet sixteen.

This is not in reference to the House and Senate Intel Committees’ investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, though. Instead, several Republican senators and congressmen are inquiring about a partnership in Macedonia between the U.S. government and a foundation started by liberal mega-donor George Soros. Letters have been sent by lawmakers to the Government Accountability Office, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and the U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia Jess Baily. In a January letter to Baily, Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee wrote: “I have received credible reports that, over the past few years, the US Mission to Macedonia has actively intervened in the party politics of Macedonia, as well as in the shaping of its media environment and civil society, often favoring groups of one political persuasion over another.” This past Monday, Baily — a career diplomat — visited Washington and met with Sen. Lee and his staff, a spokeswoman told The Daily Caller. Lee’s office did not elaborate on what occurred during the meeting. While Lee just referenced “credible reports” in his January letter, he and five other Republican senators, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Georgia Sen. David Perdue, got into more specifics in their March letter to Tillerson. There they referenced the direct grants given by USAID to George Soros’ Open Society Foundations. While many of the claims of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election rely on alleged hacking operations, the American campaign in Macedonia is out there in the open. USAID, which is responsible for doling out civilian foreign aid, has officially partnered with the Open Society Foundations. Since 2012, the government agency has given $1.5 million in grants to organizations chosen by the Foundation Open Society – Macedonia (FOSM) and $4.8 million to launch a “Civil Society Project” implemented by FOSM. Just last August, USAID announced a nearly $9.5 million program that would last until 2021 and would be administered in partnership with FOSM, Metamorphosis, the Association for Democratic Initiatives (ADI), and the National Youth Council of Macedonia. Metamorphosis was launched in 1999 by the Open Society Foundations and has since become independent. These millions of dollars are being spent in a small southern European nation with a little over 2 million citizens and a GDP per capita 11 times smaller than the U.S. The report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in January regarding Russian interference in the U.S. election contained about a page of content on the hacking of Democratic Party institutions and individuals, and seven pages on the Kremlin-funded Russia Today news network. Then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said during a senate hearing that, “RT was very active in promoting a particular point of view, disparaging our system, our alleged hypocrisy about human rights, etc. Whatever crack, fissure they could find in our tapestry, they would exploit it.” In that same hearing Clapper called for the U.S. to have a state media program “on steroids” overseas to fight against this. It turns out that much of the money given in grants in Macedonia ended up supporting news outlets which promoted a political stance, thus equaling the U.S.’ standard for political interference in another country’s election. Four outlets in Macedonia — A1on, Plusinfo, Potalb and Okno — are directly tied to FOSM, according to the group’s own annual report which stated these outlets receive millions of pageviews. In addition, FOSM and USAID are “partners” with Macedonia’s Media Development Centre. A 2012 call for grants for the USAID’s “Civil Society Project,” also mentions “use of new media.” The opposition to Soros’ influence in Macedonia is led by the conservative ruling party VMRO-DPMNE. A VMRO member of parliament told The American Spectator that Soros’ foundation was behind protests that broke out in spring of 2016. “It was a nightmare. The Soros army threw rocks at police guarding VMRO headquarters. Meanwhile, they were handing scissors out on the border to help people cut fences. Chaos,” the member of parliament said. This reference to a “Soros Army” is quite literal as protesters wore shirts that read “Soros Army.” A Feb. 24 letter sent to the Government Accountability Office and signed by six Republican congressmen asked about U.S. funding of media in Macedonia and whether funds supported violence. The GAO has not responded back to the congressmen’s inquiry. VMRO won a plurality of the votes in Macedonia’s 2016 parliamentary elections, however, the liberal SDSM party formed a coalition with the ethnic Albanian DUI party to gain a majority of parliament. This deal with the Albanian party would mean making Albanian an official language and possibly changing the nation’s flag, coat of arms, and national anthem. The Macedonian member of parliament told the American Spectator, “They are destroying my country!” The VMRO party and its supporters have protested against these proposed actions, with the current President Gjorge Ivanov refusing to give the opposition leader a mandate to form a government.     Tags: George Soros, Jess Baily, Macedonia, State Department Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller
Armenian News Network / Groong [Next Article][Previous Article][Main Index] Armenia: A Silicon Valley in the Former Soviet Union From: M K <freecilicia@gmail.com> Date: Sun, 26 Mar 2017 12:24:28 +0100 Armenia: A Silicon Valley in the Former Soviet Union Armenia was the center of Information Technology at the time of the USSR. A troubled story broke the economy, but things are starting to take shape in the Caucasian Republic. A labor force of post-Soviet engineers, highly skilled in recent technology, and a diaspora that supports it, combined with government initiatives, are boosting the information technology sector. These activities create new techniques - from the award-winning applications in the mobile sector to the tools introduced for the first time in this sector - recognized around the world and on which many startups are making their way to the USA. The annual growth rate of Armenian high-tech industries reached 20%, well above the 2% rate of economic growth. The high-tech annual turnover of some 400 IT companies reaches $ 475 million, and by 2018 it is expected that this industry will be the dominant sector, bringing prosperity New for the economy. Young startups, global growth and initiatives from some of the big names in technology - from Intel to Microsoft - are creating a great momentum. The technology sector in Armenia is at a turning point. This silicon valley of the previous regime is reborn as a world-renowned hub for new startups. How does the Armenian technical framework evolve? What is the country doing to attract international investment and which startups create the most waves on the world's technical scene? Stimulating innovation in Information Technology In the days of the Soviet Union, Armenia was designing and manufacturing 40% of the central computer units for the army. The Institute for Computer Studies in Yerevan, a secret building in the capital, employed 5,000 highly specialized people, but it eventually fell into ruins. But this was, according to the Union of Enterprises for Innovation Techniques in Yerevan, only a small fraction of the "hundreds of thousands of specialists" working in the shadows at the time of Innovations in the field of information technology. This historical past, combined with the true veneration that Soviet society had for the sciences and Armenian great determination, made the basis of a resurgence of technological innovation. While the turnover of the sector continues to grow, the sectors where foreign investment is the largest, according to the Armenian government, are those of "telecommunications, mining, energy, air transport And finance ". The online gaming and sports betting company BetConstruct, a financial subsidiary of my ucraft company, started in Yerevan in 2003 and now has offices all over the world. The founder and CEO of BetConstruct Vahe Baloulian told me: "When we started, Armenia's high-tech sector consisted essentially of software supplies for emerging industries, government and for some bridgeheads Foreign technology companies on the lookout for cheaper resources. The successes of these companies have given ideas to local entrepreneurs; They started to create development firms to attract subcontracting work. " He described how improvements in infrastructure now make it much easier to start new activities. "The former monopoly in communications has been removed, and competition between suppliers; The Internet is therefore much more economically affordable and accessible ". Many of the largest information technology companies operating in Armenia, such as Microsoft, Google and Oracle, have set up international development teams in these countries. The government encourages the expansion of these companies through its "open house" policy, designed to promote the activity and investments of foreign companies, and legislation that protects foreign capital has been introduced. In 2012, at the ArmTech conference, Intel announced the launch of a new research center. The US ambassador to Armenia, John Heffern, spoke of the potential for the development of Information Technology: "Inventive spirit is the key to the future for Armenia. The US Department of Commerce reported data from Unesco that Armenia is the first of the CIS member countries for inventions per capita, "he said. Names of global multinationals, Synopsis, D-Link and the "virtualization giant" VMWare, after its acquisition of the start-up in Information Technology Integrien - each have activities in the country and acting to generate technical innovation . Synopsis, the world's largest automation electronics design company (EDA), with an annual turnover in excess of $ 2 billion, opened offices in Armenia in 2004. Today, it is one of the largest Information Technology companies in the country, with more than 650 employees. She is also involved in emerging talent support programs. Synopsis collaborates with the Polytechnic University of Armenia to deliver programs for students and hire many graduates. These initiatives help support Armenian youth through education and increase the competence of Armenian specialists. But large corporations are not the only option, a government-imposed tax reduction program for budding startups is changing the global perception of Yerevan by drawing attention to Armenia. New legislation for entrepreneurs in Yerevan Yerevan is one of the oldest cities in the world. This old turning point finds new energy, being at the center of the middle of the startups of Armenia. Recent laws have greatly simplified the preparation, start-up and expansion of a new tech startup. After lobbying by the Union of Information Technology Enterprises (UITE), startups with headquarters in Armenia, technical centers, incubators and accelerators with fewer than 30 employees now enjoy tax benefits. Yerevan is also a reception site in two economic zones (FEZ) in which startups that meet certain conditions are exempted from the payment of VAT, profit tax, property taxes and income, as well as Than customs duties. One of them is located near the company ROA Mars (a joint-stock company whose number of shareholders is limited by the statutes) and the Yerevan Research Institute on Mathematical Machines, which is designed to develop , Manufacturing and exporting new technologies. Nowadays, a startup can be launched at little cost - resulting in the emergence of an ecosystem of startups and a bubbling of ideas. Armenian activities are gaining fame and enjoying worldwide recognition. Companies such as PicsArt, Triada Studios, Plexonic and BetConstruct are making a big difference in technology, demonstrating the enormous potential of Armenia, a center of innovation. Triada Studio, headquartered in Yerevan, the creator of the Shadowmatic app puzzle, is the recipient of the prestigious Apple Design Award and App Store Best in 2015. Triada Studio was launched in 1993 as a computer studio for graphic design and animation. Co-founder and CEO Ara Aghamyan speaks of "enormous intellectual potential" in Armenia. Aghamyan argues that the biggest challenge facing the technical sphere today is the flight of talent, with a large number of startups finally moving to the US to find capital and gain audience. "We can only overcome this by creating an ecosystem that will not only hold people back home, but that will attract the world's intelligences," he said. Moving to Silicon Valley Nigel Sharp is the former technical director of the TUMO Center for Creative Technologies in Armenia and founder of the Armenian-based startup Lionsharp, creator of Voiceboard, "the world's first solution for gestural and vocal presentation". Sharp told PSFK [a New York-based creativity platform] that insufficient monitoring of foreign investment, "a plague of corruption and loss," is a barrier to foreign investment. This mistrust combined with the challenges of networking, common to any platform of emerging startups, discourages many businesses from announcing their creation to a global audience. This is further complicated by limiting access to entrepreneurial knowledge, differences in language, and the need to travel. As a result, Armenian startups are going to the US to be more supported, funded and to improve their growth prospects. In April, the PicsArt photo editing application added $ 20 million to the VC [Venture Capital Venture Capital] investment, bringing the total invested to $ 45 million and enabling the Armenian-born startup to increase its China and Japan. In 2015, PicsArt CEO Hovhannes Avoyan decided to relocate to San Francisco to join the CFO, saying PicsArt's presence on the US technical scene. PicsArt was subsequently entered in the Forbes list of "the most promising startups of 2015". Those who have influence in the technological world strive to strengthen the ties between Armenia and the USA. In March, Ara Aghayan of Triada Studio wrote to President Obama explaining the role of the tech community in the development of US-Armenia trade. He drew attention to the question of double taxation which hampers foreign investment and hinders the development of activities that are based in Armenia. Shadowmatic is not the last one. PicsArt, Microsoft, FedEx, NASDAQ, Marriott, Grant Thorton and others have signaled themselves to move towards new economic relationships to boost growth in the country. The US in favor of the growth of Armenian Tech The importance of the Armenian diaspora is such that there are more Armenians living outside the country than in Armenia: from seven to ten million Armenians live mainly in Russia, the USA and France, Less than three million in the country. The successive generations of Armenians now join this global network and actively support the future growth of Armenia. The co-founder of Inet Technologies, Sam Simonian and his wife Sylvia, created the TUMO Center for Creative Technologies, a private digital training center in Yerevan, which provides training to nearly 5,000 young people aged 12 to 18 from the new technologies sector . Armenia welcomes the presence of a number of innovation centers such as TUMO, which have been developed thanks to the insistence of international supporters and major partners. The former vice president of Twitter and director of Uber Raffi Krikorian, sits on the board of TUMO, and is actively supporting the new startups: "honestly, if you are Armenian, I will probably want to help you" "He said in an interview with Repat Armenia. In 2011 ; Microsoft launched the Microsoft Innovation Center Armenia in partnership with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and Enterprise Incubator Foundation (EIF). The center aims to enable the growth of information technologies by supporting students and startups. It offers programs such as bootcamps coding, training courses and workshops, as well as methods of accelerating startups such as seed funding, contributing to creating a favorable ecosystem To the success of startups. Entrepreneurs also benefit from a new creation of companies such as the Center for Entrepreneurship and Executive Development (CEED), which launched this year the Armenia - US IT Acceleration Program With the EIF, the Armenian Government and the World Bank, designed to introduce new startups to the global market. Like any emerging industry, Armenian startups are struggling with limited cash flow and must respond quickly to technical changes. New activities such as virtual networking and start-up, HIVE [a data analysis program] and the first venture capitalist company in Armenia, Granatus Ventures, help take-off startups . However, in order to compete on a larger scale, these activities must attract a wider audience and investors around the world. But the mechanics are launched, it's much easier today than before. While more business leaders are drawing attention not only to the barriers that Armenia must overcome, but also to the potential of its emerging industry, we can expect continued growth from this old center of innovation.

Nunes announced that prior-scheduled testimony slated for next week from FBI Director James Comey and Admiral Mike Rogers, Director of the National Security Agency, would be given behind closed doors, cutting out the public. Nunes went on to announce that Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's campaign manager who worked for Trump for six months, had offered to testify before the House Intelligence Committee. That, too, would be held behind closed doors and not available to the public. Schiff publicly blasted Chairman Nunes, saying, as CNN reports, he had just cancelled an open Intelligence Committee hearing with former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan and former deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, in an "attempt to choke off public info." Rep. Schiff blasted Nunes for his "dead of night excursion" earlier this week when he reviewed documents that led him to hold two press conferences and run to the White House – which is under counterintelligence investigation for possible collusion with the Russians, Schiff noted– to share his findings. He called Nunes' running to Trump an "effort to defend the indefensible" which "has led us down this terrible rabbit hole and threatens the only investigation that is authorized in the House." Schiff, himself a former federal prosecutor, called Nunes' actions "wholly inappropriate" and "cast grave doubts" about his ability to chair an investigation. Schiff says Nunes didn't share info with committee Republicans or Democrats: "All of us are essentially in the dark" https://t.co/medIVEYewt — NBC News (@NBCNews) March 24, 2017 While looking forward to Paul Manafort testifying before the Intelligence Committee, Schiff was angered that testimony would be blocked from the public. "We welcome his testimony before the committee," Schiff told reporters, urging "that testimony be done in open session, so the public may be informed of what he has to say." Schiff says Paul Manafort should testify in open session: "We welcome his testimony before the committee" https://t.co/LEc8sig3xq — NBC News (@NBCNews) March 24, 2017 To comment on this article and other NCRM content, visit our Facebook page.      Advertisement Become a patron of breaking LGBTQ news Chip in $4 go tags: News, Politics, Law, Russia, Donald Trump, wiretapping, Devin Nunes, Adam Schiff Advertisement Become a patron of breaking LGBTQ news Chip in $4 go Advertisement David Recommends NCRM's Official Statement on Donald Trump The best of NCRM, delivered straight to your inbox Optional email code More from around the web Be part of the movement.

It’s none other than the Dell XPS 15 (2017), released in January this year. Facebook/Dell While the world eagerly awaits the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, there is another laptop that has become quite a rage. It’s none other than the Dell XPS 15 (2017), released in January this year. The dell laptop runs on Windows 10 operating system and has a 16GB RAM. It is powered by a 2.8GHZ Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU and 4GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050. The internal storage is of 512GB. This year’s XPS 15 models incorporate 7th-generation Core i3, i5 or i7 processors. The dual-core i3 model with an HD non-touch screen comes with integrated graphics, and starts at US$999 (AU$1,310 approx). It is available only in the US. In Australia, one only has the i7 option. The XPS display is extremely accurate and has a wide colour gamut. According to CNET, Dell XPS 15 (2017) models with 1050 GPU have prices ranging from US$1,250 (AU$2,500 approx) to US$2,550 (AU$3,700). A 4K UHD Display would cost AU$3,000. Dell Australia is offering a further discount of AU$450 on the 4K model. The laptop has a 15.6-inch display with a screen resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 pixels. The display is touch-enabled. The NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics processor uses the latest Pascal architecture. This provides an exceptional gaming performance. Pascal also has improved battery optimisation over its predecessor. The XPS 15 (2017) has a terrific screen, svelte design, premium build and comes with a full feature set. It has the latest processors from Intel and NVIDIA. Many experts have found the laptop to be much more sedate than multipurpose hybrids. However, it has all the power and features that cannot be packed into hybrids. Be it photo-editing, graphics work or gaming, the Dell laptop, according to many, surpasses even Apple MacBook Pro 2016 and HP Spectre x360. The Dell XPS 15 (2017) laptop is also less-expensive than the Apple one. The seventh generation core processor contributes a lot towards the battery life of the device. However, the graphics processor is not VR-ready. Many have found the touch pad to be hyper-sensitive. The backlit keyboard is also a great addition. Set of connections include two USB 3.0, one USB-C which supports external monitors, HDMI out and a headphone jack. The speakers sound pretty cool. Meanwhile, the highly-advanced hybrid, Microsoft Surface Pro 5, could be the fastest from the Redmond tech giant. It is believed to be coming with the all-new AMD Ryzen chip. Moreover, the hybrid will be the right platform to show off the power of Windows 10. It is also possible that the Surface Pro 5 will go with the Intel Kaby Lake architecture, or release both processors via two variants. It is expected to come in 4K UltraHD display. The screen could be the same 12.3 inches. Other rumoured specs include 16GB RAM, 512GB internal storage, highly-upgraded Surface Pen and wireless charging. While the device is expected in October, Microsoft may surprise fans by releasing it right after the Windows 10 Creators Update in April. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Dell XPS 15 (2017) and Microsoft Surface Pro 5.

Training Certification Events Webinars Community Participate Q&A Forums Blogs Resources Newsletter Distributions Publications Infographics Photos Videos Jobs Eric Brown March 23, 2017 Latest Linux Maker Boards Gamble on Diversity beaglebone-blue.png The BeagleBone Blue is a robotics-focused collaboration with the University of California San Diego Robotics Lab, which is using the board for robotics education. Used with permission BeagleBone As usual, last week’s Embedded World show in Nuremberg, Germany was primarily focused on commercial embedded single board computers (SBCs), computer-on-modules, and rugged industrial systems for the OEM market. Yet, we also saw a growing number of community-backed maker boards, which, like most of the commercial boards, run Linux. The new crop shows the growing diversity of hacker SBCs, which range from completely open source models to proprietary prototyping boards that nevertheless offer low prices and community services such as forums and open source Linux distributions. The latest hacker SBCs include: BeagleBone Blue -- A robotics-focused spin of the BeagleBone Black Chameleon96 -- The first FPGA-enabled and first ARMv7 96Boards entry NanoPi Neo2 -- A headless, $15 boardlet that is the smallest quad-core ARMv8 SBC yet Up Core -- One of the smallest and most ARM-like x86-based hacker boards to date In recent years, we’ve seen amazing price reductions and performance improvements on community-backed boards, as well as rampant imitation. The prime source of reflection is the Raspberry Pi, which recently spawned a wireless enabled, $10 Raspberry Pi Zero W.  Cumulatively, the Raspberry Pi models are now said to be the third best-selling computer in history, beating out the Commodore 64 with 12.5 million units sold. Because Raspberry Pi Trading has an exclusive deal with Broadcom on the boards’ BCM2836 and BCM2837 SoCs, there are no absolute clones of the RPi. However, the dimensions, the 40-pin expansion header, and in many cases the port layout and selection are imitated in dozens of SBCs. None of the four boards covered here offer full RPi expansion compatibility, and they bravely head off in new directions. We’re seeing similar diversity in the latest COM/carrier board combinations. Nvidia’s third-generation, Linux-driven Jetson TX2 module launched earlier this month with a proprietary COM design, but with an open carrier board schematic, thereby enabling third-party participation. Connect Tech responded with three carriers for the TX2, which features a high-end new Tegra Parker SoC designed for graphics and AI. These include a basic $99 Sprocket, a Spaceley board designed to work with Pixhawk drone autopilots, and a Cogswell carrier aimed at Gigabit Ethernet vision camera (GigE Vision) applications. Auvidea is also working on a carrier, and Connect Tech’s original three TX1-compatible carriers work on the TX2 as well as the TX1. The new SBCs detailed below offer even more choices. Staking out new territory without RPi add-on compatibility is a risky choice, but so is introducing yet another me-too board that may struggle to differentiate. The following four Linux-friendly boards show some interesting new directions for hacker SBCs beyond DIY media players and home automation prototyping. BeagleBone Blue Over the past two years, BeagleBoard.org has worked with a variety of partners to produce certified pseudo-clones of the popular TI Sitara AM335x based BeagleBone Black. These include Seeed’s Grove compatible BeagleBone Green and BeagleBone Green Wireless and its own BeagleBone Black Wireless, which includes a SiP packaged core computer built by Octavo Systems. The new BeagleBone Blue is a robotics-focused collaboration with the University of California San Diego Robotics Lab, which is using the board for robotics education. Like the BB Black Wireless, the $80 BeagleBone Blue has built-in wireless and an Octavo SiP package that pre-integrates the 1GHz, Cortex-A9 Sitara AM3358, 512MB RAM, and 4GB eMMC flash. The board also adds a battery connector, IMU, barometer, and motor control features like servos, encoder inputs, and motor outputs. While robotics has always been a strength of the BB Black, the BB Blue gives you most of the basic tools without requiring additional cape add-ons. Chameleon96 Linaro’s open source 96Boards spec was adopted by some of the first 64-bit ARMv8 SBCs, including Arrow’s Qualcomm-backed DragonBoard 410C. Now Arrow has announced the first ARMv7 96Boards entry -- and the first FPGA-enabled 96Boards SBC -- with the Chameleon96. The SBC runs Debian Linux on a Cyclone V SE SoC from Intel PSG (Programmable Solutions Group), the new post-acquisition name for Intel’s Altera FPGA unit. The Cyclone V combines dual 800MHz Cortex-A9 cores with a modest FPGA subsystem with 110K LE performance. Among other duties, the FPGA handles the video subsystem, which decodes and encodes 60fps 1080p streams via HDMI and MIPI-CSI interfaces, respectively. By applying FPGA to video, the board enables development of “custom IPU/GPU/VPU solutions,” says Arrow. The Chameleon96, which like other 96Boards CE SBCs expresses most of its interfaces via 40-pin low- and 60-pin high-speed expansion connectors, is also notable for its integration of SecureRF’s quantum resistant cryptography technology. SecureRF’s Ironwood Key Agreement Protocol and Walnut DSA Digital Signature Algorithm are designed for securing reduced footprint, low-energy IoT devices. NanoPi Neo2 The NanoPi Neo2 is the third iteration of the minimalist 40x40mm NanoPi Neo designs from FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM), following the NanoPi Neo and wireless-ready NanoPi Neo Air. The Ubuntu Core and Armbian Linux supported Neo2 advances to an ARMv8 quad-core, Cortex-A53 Allwinner H5, making it the world’s smallest 64-bit ARM hacker board. At $15, it’s also one of the most affordable. The IoT-oriented NanoPi Neo2 is headless, without a real-world display port, so it’s not for your casual weekend hacker. The board offers 512MB of RAM, but storage is dependent on the microSD slot. Coastline ports include Gigabit Ethernet, USB 2.0 host, and micro-USB OTG. Onboard interfaces include an expansion interface that is said to be compatible with the first 24 pins of the Raspberry Pi. UP Core Unlike the above three boards, the UP Core is not a fully open source design, but Aaeon is otherwise striving to serve hobbyist makers as well as small-run commercial vendors. For example, the company has opened up the spec for its 100-pin expansion connector so third party developers can create their own boards that extend the SBC’s capabilities. At 66x56.5mm, this community-backed board is smaller than the similarly quad-core Intel “Cherry Trail” Atom driven UP board. That’s only slightly petite by ARM standards, but the it’s one of the smallest x86 based hacker SBCs around. It will soon launch on Kickstarter for a price starting at $69. Once again, this is nothing special for ARM boards, but it’s cheap compared to most community-backed x86 SBCs. The UP Core replaces the GbE port with WiFi and Bluetooth, but is otherwise a scaled back version of the original UP board. The SBC supports up to 4GB DDR3L RAM and up to 64GB eMMC, and coastline ports include HDMI and USB 3.0 ports. Additional interfaces include MIPI-CSI, USB 2.0, I2S, and eDP. Aaeon’s parent company Asus has received even more attention for its quasi-open, maker-oriented Tinker Board. Launched in Europe in January, the $68 SBC runs Debian or Kodi on a quad-core Cortex-A17 Rockchip RK3288. The board features 2GB RAM, GbE, 4K video, and yes, that tried and true RPi-compatible 40-pin connector. Connect with the Linux community at Open Source Summit North America on September 11-13.

Paul Gilbert with the original computer that he built for Traf-O-Data, the company that Bill Gates and Paul Allen started before they founded Microsoft. (Photo Courtesy George Sammit) Microsoft is one of the most successful and influential companies in the world, but did you know that Bill Gates and Paul Allen launched an earlier venture as high school students in Seattle? It was called Traf-O-Data, a startup in the 1970s that developed a computer system to count traffic.  If it hadn’t been for our Traf-O-Data venture … you could argue that Microsoft might not have happened. Their partner in Traf-O-Data was Paul Gilbert, who was a University of Washington electrical engineering student when Gates and Allen were using UW computer labs at night, to hone their programming skills and develop their new business. Gilbert, now 65, recalls seeing Gates and Allen walking down a University of Washington hallway. They asked him, “Can you build us a microcomputer?” After thinking about it, he agreed to join them, and he became a partner in the business. “I got access to the Intel information, and we bought the chip and built it from the ground up,” he recalled, speaking with GeekWire recently after Allen gave him a special shout-out from stage during an event at the UW’s newly christened Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. Paul Allen speaks at the University of Washington on March 9, 2017. (GeekWire photo) Wrote Paul Allen in a LinkedIn post, “While Bill Gates and I handled the software side of (Traf-O-Data), the machine itself was built on campus by a UW student named Paul Gilbert, a partner Bill Gates and I recruited into our high school business venture. Paul did an amazing job turning the first 8-bit microprocessor in Seattle into a real computer.” Allen went on to explain why Traf-O-Data was such an important venture: Objectively speaking, Traf-O-Data was a failure as a company. Right as our business started to pick up, states began to provide their own traffic-counting services to local governments for free. As quickly as it started, our business model evaporated. But while Traf-O-Data was technically a business failure, the understanding of microprocessors we absorbed was crucial to our future success. And the emulator I wrote to program it gave us a huge head start over anyone else writing code at the time. If it hadn’t been for our Traf-O-Data venture, and if it hadn’t been for all that time spent on UW computers, you could argue that Microsoft might not have happened. As their first partner, Gilbert got lots of experience working with Allen and Gates in their early years. As he recalled, “Bill was just hyperactive, his foot was always shaking and he had short patience. Very, very limited patience. And Paul was so laid-back. … Paul would say, ‘Oh, it’s OK.’ We’ll get over it.’ He’d always be the companion. And I’d say, ‘At least I haven’t been kicked off the job.’ ” RELATED: A conversation with Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen: ‘It really is a golden age of what’s possible’ So did Gilbert ever think that Gates and Allen would go on to become some of the most successful technology entrepreneurs in the world? “No, in fact that whole concept of having a big clunky PC in your house that just used up room, I thought that was totally dumb,” he said. “I did not have any foresight into what was really going on. I just kinda fought it in my mind, and said, ‘Nah, this is not going to work.’ ” Gilbert went on to become a software engineer at Boeing, and today lives in Palm Bay, Fla.

Deep learning, the most widely used type of AI, is already enhancing cloud services by Tencent’s American and Chinese competitors, cloud giants like Google, Microsoft, Baidu, and Alibaba. The company has been ramping up investment in AI in a big way; Ma Huateng, its founder and chairman, views AI innovation as a matter of life and death for the business. In the data center, Nvidia’s Tesla GPUs, based on the chipmaker’s Pascal architecture, are currently state-of-the-art hardware for deep learning. Cloud giants pack as many as eight of these high-power units onto a server motherboard along with Intel CPUs, using them to teach computers to do things like predicting search results, identifying objects in photos, and serving targeted ads. See also: This Data Center is Designed for Machine Learning The amount of resources cloud giants have been investing in AI are driving a surge in demand for hardware like Nvidia’s. “We’ve been working with a lot of the hyper-scales – really all of the hyper-scales – in the large data centers,” Rob Ober, Tesla chief platform architect at Nvidia, told Data Center Knowledge in an interview earlier this month. These companies are also using GPUs to provide AI-enhanced cloud services to their enterprise customers, and some of them let customers rent “bare-metal” GPUs the same way they rent virtual machines in the cloud to run their own deep learning workloads. “Tencent Cloud GPU offerings with Nvidia’s deep learning platform will help companies in China rapidly integrate AI capabilities into their products and services,” Tencent Cloud VP Sam Xie said in a statement. Tencent’s deployment of Tesla P100 and P40 GPUs and Nvidia’s deep learning software is focused primarily on such enterprise cloud services. The Chinese company has been offering cloud services running on earlier-generation Tesla M40 GPUs since December. It expects to integrate cloud servers with up to eight GPUs each by mid-year.

In the case of the Dell Inspiron 7000, you get a beefy gaming computer that can take whatever game designers throw at it. Unfortunately, its physical design is rife with trade-offs. Indeed, you get a pretty great machine when you spend that $2000 on Dell's budget gaming laptop, but you're never gonna forget it's cheap. And $2000 is pretty cheap for a 15-inch gaming laptop with a 7th-generation Intel i5 processor, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti video card, and a 256GB SSD. (The base $1900 model gives you a slightly slower GTX 1050 video card and a traditional 1TB hard drive.) And for those unfamiliar with specs let me be totally clear: This thing flies. I easily squeaked out a little more than 30 frames per second when I played Rise of the Tomb Raider on High settings. On WebXPRT, a popular synthetic benchmark that tests for browser-based activities like spreadsheets, photo editing, and web page loading, the Inspiron 7000 scored a 412, which is nearly identical to the score notched by the zippy new 33cm Macbook Pro. And it's much faster than the gaming-focused Razer Stealth Blade. The Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming laptop is a device meant to fly despite its price. Nerds will note that it won't give you 60 frames per second on a graphically intensive game like Battlefield 1 or Rise of the Tomb Raider, but 30fps is more than enough for normal mortals. The cheap machine also gives you a really nice full keyboard with keys backlit by red LEDs. Though the red isn't just reserved for the keys. The vents are covered in a fine red mesh, and the top and sides of the laptop are covered in a pleasant soft touch red. "That's gross," a co-worker opined. "I love it," I responded, clutching the giant laptop to my chest. While most budget laptops are thirteen inches or smaller, the Dell Inspiron 7000 is a 15-inch machine. And it's bulky in more than one way, weighing a solid 2.65kg and measuring an inch thick when closed. It's hefty because to keep the price cheap, Dell is using effective — but space consuming — measures to handle the heat put out by the discrete graphics card and processor. (If you want thin, you'll need to spend a lot more money for something like the 2017 Razer Blade, which starts at $2800, or the MSI GT62VR, which starts at around $2300. To manage heat cheaply and efficiently, Dell uses a set of fans which roar to life when playing games. Running a game as simple as Civilisation VI immediately kicked them into high gear and forced me to turn up the volume of the TV I was watching in the background while I played. But the fans definitely kept the laptop cool, too. A few rounds of Overwatch can make some laptops so hot you don't want to touch them, but I had zero issues keeping the Inspiron 7000 on my lap. To get this laptop to such a cheap price Dell also had to skimp on physical build quality and aesthetics. The 15-inch 1080p display is...not good. It just has awful viewing angles. Stoop forward or lean back and you instant get a completely different visual experience. Which is deeply frustrating. Just like the sharp corners of the chassis that dig into your forearms when you type. Ouch. In the end, the roaring fans and a bad screen are constant reminders that you saved a lot of cash to get this laptop. And you did! There are very few laptops in the $1900-$2000 price range that are as efficient and fast as this one. But when you're saving money, you can't get everything you want. If all you care about is playing some games on a PC, then get the Dell Inspiron 7000 Gaming. If you want something beautifully engineered, then keep saving your money. README It's a $2000 laptop that lets you play the newest games on high settings. The display leaves a lot to be desired, but a full-sized HDMI port means you can always plug it into a nice display. A full-size keyboard is welcome for gamers who rely on a number pad. Sharp corners near the palm rests will bite into your forearms. This thing is f**king huge. And its whirling fans are crazy loud. Comments zell71 @zell71 Mar 27, 2017, 1:41pm totally agree with the review. i bought one of these - i sent it back just because the screen is appalling. the machine flies, but its a bulky piece of equipment. if it wasn't for the screen i would have kept it but i couldn't live with the screen. i spent an extra $600 and got an XPS 15 2017 (dell had a discount on the XPS range) and i couldn't be happier. Reply 0 soldant @soldant Mar 27, 2017, 3:12pm My Asus ROG laptop comes with a 1070 and only cost about $500 more - so I don't know how anybody could recommend this thing with a 1050. If you're going to buy a gaming laptop you're probably going to suffer portability issues, there's simply no way around it - so you might as well get something with a powerful GPU for extra cash, as opposed to a compromise like this. At $2k there are probably better options... hell I'd even be tempted to look at an Alienware 13 - similar sort of base specs (except smaller), plus you could use their external GPU solution if you're going to dock it. Reply 0 That_Dan_Guy @that_dan_person Mar 27, 2017, 3:36pm I've been eyeing off that laptop a few weeks ago. But after seeing one in store that screen is just a deal breaker. Last edited March 27, 2017 4:07 pm Reply 0 Tanner Guest Mar 27, 2017, 4:17pm $2000 is a complete ripoff for this, try almost anything from MSI and you'll find superior or equal specs for $1500 or less. I7 vs i5, 1Tb + 256Gb, and a 1050 ti, same size, much better screen, rgb keyboard, same thickness, same weight, brushed aluminum black instead of that god awful red, newegg has it right now for $1430. Who in their right mind would buy an overpriced turd like this inspiron? Reply 0 anon @anon Mar 27, 2017, 4:48pm Wow! So much hate. I'm not a gamer but rather a video editor and need the quad i7 processing power that this model offers. And to be honest I couldn't be happier for the price which was around $1600 on sale. Granted it's the 1050 model, but again it's the price and processor that interests me more. And I'm sure it'll play WoT just fine when I free up some time. Reply 0 pawel04 @pawel04 Mar 27, 2017, 6:41pm "And it's much faster than the gaming-focused Razer Stealth Blade." Not bashing the entire article but this is bit of an unfair comparison. Of course the Inspirion 7000 will be quicker as the Blade only comes with integrated graphics, however what makes the Razer Stealth 'gaming-focused' is its ability to couple a desktop card with its base specs in which case any card over a 1050ti will be faster.. *Note: I realise that the Stealth along with the core is much more expensive, im only challenging the above claim. Reply 0 Arsay Guest Mar 28, 2017, 12:45am I've had an Inspiron 7000 for about a month and I absolutely love it! I was worried about the screen after reading numerous reviews and while it does look washed out sometimes I honestly feel like the criticisms are overblown. I bought mine for 1200 and that was with an i7 and 1050ti and I am more than happy with its performance. I am a gamer and it does everything I could ask of it. But I suppose If you're a hardcore gamer with 2500 dollars lying around you should probably look elsewhere. Reply 0 nizmo_man @nizmo_man Mar 28, 2017, 1:52pm $1,200 is a fair bit cheaper than $2,000 eh? Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

The Wall Street bank, which has already banked a cool $1 billion profit with its early stage investment in Israeli car tech company Mobileye, lost out on nearly doubling that gain when it sold off its stake in the company to comply with the Volcker Rule, sources said. Goldman Sachs will get to earn a little of that “lost” profit back now that it has been hired by Mobileye to act as an adviser on its $15 billion sale to Intel, The Post has learned. The hiring was made in recent days, sources said. Previously, Mobileye was working only with investment bank Raymond James. Goldman made most of its $1 billion profit soon after it helped take Mobileye public in 2014 at $25 a share — then the largest US initial public offering of an Israeli company. A the time of the IPO, Goldman owned roughly 17.5 percent of the company, whose computer chips and cameras alert cars to brake to avoid hitting other cars and pedestrians, thanks to an early $130 million investment in the company — and a followup 2013 investment. The first investment came in 2007, just as Mobileye’s technology was getting into cars and when it needed the cash to survive. But the firm had to sell its shares, owned through Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, its private-equity fund, to comply with 2013’s Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from making speculative bets with its own money. Partly as a result of the Volcker Rule, Goldman, around 2015, sold all its Mobileye shares, netting a roughly $1 billion profit, two sources said. If it didn’t have to sell the stake, Mobileye’s fast-rising stock price would have handed Goldman another nearly $1 billion profit when it agreed to be bought this month by Intel, sources said. “They were the only institution that funded them in the financial crisis,” a source said. At the time, Mobileye had a reported $600 million valuation. It is now worth $13.5 billion. Mobileye shares at the end of 2015 traded at $35.98 a share. Intel is paying $63.54 per share for the company. Mobileye is coveted because of the role it is likely to play not only in today’s cars — as it helps drivers to avoid accidents — but in driverless cars. The company has retained Goldman for the Intel sale even though it has already signed a deal because it wants to reward the bank for its help over the years, a source said. Goldman declined to comment.

Trump-Russia collusion is being investigated by FBI, Comey confirms https://t.co/pKvStJDuNV — The Guardian (@guardian) March 20, 2017 “Other than allowing routine governmental functions, there must be a total and complete shutdown of any agenda item being pushed by the Trump Administration. Congress cannot continue regular order and must stop voting on any Trump-backed agenda item until the FBI completes its Trump-Russia collusion investigation,” Lieu wrote in a press release. "President" @realDonaldTrump: You truly are an evil man. Your job is to help Americans. Not intentionally try to destroy their lives. https://t.co/2M94E1g39b — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 25, 2017 In the scathing report, Lieu appears to suggest that President Trump may have committed treason and cited a report which claimed that several U.S. officials believe the FBI has information about coordinated effort between members of Trump’s team and suspected Russian operatives to release hacked information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton, the Independent wrote. President Donald Trump denied that his campaign had allied with Russia to interfere with last November’s elections, ahead of the first public hearing in Congress on alleged Kremlin interference in those elections. Trump tweets ahead of Intel hearing: Russia collusion is "FAKE NEWS" https://t.co/ZZwLe0Ewdu pic.twitter.com/nJlaiARnER — The Hill (@thehill) March 21, 2017 In his personal Twitter account, Trump said that James Clapper, who was national director of intelligence in the government of former President Barack Obama, and “others” have said there is no evidence that he “conspired with Russia.” James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 For the FBI, counterintelligence investigations are one of the most complicated and time-consuming cases, and the case could possibly go on for years. In January, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered a covert job to undermine Hillary Clinton’s opportunities and help Trump. The House Intelligence Committee is charged with investigating the alleged interference by the Russian government in the November elections, an investigation in which Trump requested to also include alleged practices of illegal listening against him. In the report, Lieu states that “the bombshell revelation that U.S. officials have information that suggests Trump associates may have colluded with the Russians means we must pause the entire Trump agenda. We may have an illegitimate President of the United States currently occupying the White House.” As a report from Common Dreams pointed out, Lieu is not alone in his call to halt the president’s agenda. Noted filmmaker and activist Michael Moore urged the Democratic Party to declare a national emergency after the FBI said it was investigating Donald Trump’s team and he posted the following message on his Instagram account. “The Democratic Party needs to declare a National Emergency. For the first time in our history, the President of the United States and his staff are under investigation for espionage. This announcement, by the head of the Trump-friendly FBI, is a shock to our democracy.” the left-wing author wrote. “The Democratic leadership in the House and Senate needs to bring a halt to all business being done in the name of this potential felony suspect, Donald J. Trump. No bill he supports, no Supreme Court nominee he has named, can be decided while he is under a criminal investigation.” Furthermore, a petition hosted by MoveOn.org says that Congress must pause all Trump-related legislation and appointments and it asked the below question. “How can Congress, in good conscience, agree to further Trump’s agenda amid such serious allegations regarding possible illegal collusion with Russia? The answer is simple: It can’t.” FBI director James Comey noted that the agency is investigating the origin of any link between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any kind of coordination between the campaign and the meddling of Russia. U.S. officials said that so far they have found no evidence of the above. However, there are ex-officials and a few others who remain in office claiming to have discovered evidence that there were people associated with Trump who had repeated contact with Russian officials, including people linked to Russian intelligence.

If these were really any more qualified than the next board, I would assume they would have an auxiliary molex/sata/6- or 8-pin to ensure adequate power delivery over PCIe. In fact, considering all the fancy detailing, I'm pretty sure a designer wouldn't care diddly-squat what a computer looks like on the inside.

These would be intended for the CPUs like we mentioned earlier today, the 16-core / 32-threaded parts. Much like the X99 platform from Intel. Now first off a massive disclaimer, I cannot confirm that these diagrams are real hence this might be speculation. Then again, the detail in the diagrams is pretty deep, much more then you'd expect from a bit of a hobby job. The motherboard diagrams appears to be coming from ASUS, you can tell as there is an AURA ASIC on-board and that would be the AURA LED controller of course, proprietary to ASUS. Now this is an interesting fact, as we all assumed that the 16-core part might be a server processes series. However a server motherboard with RGB AURA connectivity, naah this is an enthusiast class consumer motherboard alright. The processor socket is designated as AM44, sounds a bit weird bit it definitely is bigger. Next to that you can spot eight DIMM slots.   AMD X399/X390 Then there are two more diagrams showing the X399 chipset for dual-CPU motherboards and X390 for single-CPU motherboard. The first diagram might be the workstation/server platform for Naples CPUs as it has ECC memory support. X390 corresponds to earlier rumors about Ryzen HEDT, which is meant for 16-core 32-thread Ryzen processors. So if you look at the info and those diagrams are a real thing then X390 chipset would support up to 44 PCI-Express lanes. That would be even more than Intel’s flagship Core i7 6950X on X99 platform (40 lanes). Interesting to see is that the dual-socket board is listing the processors as RZ4700, and the single socket version as RZ 2700.     Now there is no frickin way we can confirm the validity of these block diagrams, but they certainly are very interesting.

Now there is something new for PC enthusiast gamers and this time before Intel. Waiting for X99 successor to compare to this chipset and decide my new mobo and CPU for a MGPU setup. Can this X390 chipset provide X16/X16 for SLI or CFX? If there is no Quad channel memory support in the single CPU mobo chipset... No good.

You are pro. I would never buy a cpu @~999 EUR and a mobo at @~299 price range with only dual channel support for the single cpu system. (X390) Intel is much better at this. They've won. Only they have to improve their prices. I cant believe AMD forces you buying dual cpu chipset(X399) with double the cost on both cpu and mobo 2000+plus EUR altogether to have quad channel support. I will not build my true gaming rig with AMD this time. I am gonna keep my cheap "red" athlon for surfing only. RIP red team, you will not have HEDT users like that except fanatics and fanboys who will choose the "red" pill, others like me will choose the "blue" pill.

Unless Intel won't come up with something sensible, but I doubt they can make such a big step quickly.Anyway if x390/399 will come this year then Intel just got attacked on every front. This is just fantastic for us consumers.Wish GPUs will follow this trend. ruthan Member Guru Posts: 65 Joined: 2016-05-24 #5412128 Posted on: 03/25/2017 12:23 AM Im afraid of TDP -200W+, i would prefer some dual CPU socket board. 3 pages 1 2 3 Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum.

Top News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Wednesday March 29, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us World Africa Middle East Europe Americas US Election 2016 Ex-CIA chief: Flynn's firm discussed removing cleric from US CHAD DAY, AP  Monday, March 27, 2017, 3:59 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ 中文 WASHINGTON -- Former CIA Director James Woolsey has accused the Trump administration's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, of participating in a discussion with Turkish officials about possibly subverting the U.S. extradition process to remove a Turkish cleric from the United States. The Wall Street Journal first reported Woolsey's comments and posted a video interview with him late Friday . A Flynn spokesman said Friday that Woolsey's claims are "false" and that "no such discussion occurred." In the Journal interview, Woolsey says he walked into the middle of a discussion between Turkish officials and members of Flynn's firm, Flynn Intel Group, late in the evening of Sept. 19 at Essex House hotel in New York City. Woolsey said the discussion generally involved removing cleric Fethullah Gulen from the U.S. without going through the lengthy extradition process, though he said it stopped short of outlining a specific plan to sweep the cleric out of the country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought Gulen's extradition from the U.S. after accusing the cleric of directing a failed coup last summer. The U.S. government has rebuffed that request, and Gulen, who has a green card and lives in Pennsylvania, has denied involvement. Woolsey described the discussion as "brainstorming, but it was brainstorming about a very serious matter that would pretty clearly be a violation of law." Though, Woolsey noted that the discussion "did not rise to the level of being a specific plan to undertake a felonious act." Flynn spokesman Price Floyd told The Associated Press that Flynn Intel Group's work never involved discussing removing Gulen from the United States by any means other than the extradition process. He confirmed that Woolsey attended the meeting but denied that it involved subverting the legal process. "The claim made by Mr. Woolsey that General Flynn or anyone else in attendance discussed physical removal of Mr. Gulen from the United States during a meeting with Turkish officials in New York is false," Floyd said. "No such discussion occurred, nor did Mr. Woolsey ever inform General Flynn that he had any concerns whatsoever regarding the meeting, either before he chose to attend and afterward." The meeting was part of lobbying work Flynn's firm was conducting on behalf of a company, Inovo BV, which is owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. Earlier this month, Flynn and his firm registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents for the work for Alptekin, saying that it could have benefited the Turkish government. Flynn's firm was paid $530,000 over the course of the contract, which ran from August through November while Flynn was a top Trump campaign adviser. Alptekin has told the AP that Flynn's firm registered as a foreign agent under pressure from the Justice Department. 1|2|Next Page>> PREVIOUS ARTICLE Snipers target jihadists using human shields NEXT ARTICLE Ellison says Democrats must fight Republicans at all levels Facebook Twitter Google+ Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 Titanic' actor Bill Paxton has died: family representatives 2 Philippines protests 'Madam Secretary' portrayal of leader 3 Accountants in Oscar mistake off the show 4 New highs for US stocks; Dow win streak longest since 1987 5 Historic drama 'Underground' reflects on state of the union 6 Russia gives new 'Beauty and the Beast' film a 16+ rating 7 Japan and Russia hold talks on security, territorial dispute 8 Iconic rock arch from 'Game of Thrones' falls into Malta sea 9 US to sell 'more and better' weapons to Taiwan: report 10 U.S. reaffirms its one-China policy ahead of Tillerson's China visit Subscribe  |   Advertise  |   RSS Feed  |   About Us  |   Career  |   Contact Us Sitemap  |   Top Stories  |   Taiwan  |   China  |   Business  |   Asia  |   World  |   Sports  |   Life  |   Arts & Leisure  |   Health  |   Editorial  |   Commentary Travel  |   Movies  |   TV Listings  |   Classifieds  |   Bookstore  |   Getting Around  |   Weather  |   Guide Post  |   Student Post  |   Terms of Use  |   Sitemap   Copyright © 1999 – 2017 The China Post.

Zesty Zapus covers Ubuntu desktop, server and cloud editions, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Gnome, MATE, Studio and Xubuntu flavours. It's not a huge feature boost, but the release is using the Linux 4.10 kernel, useful if your iron runs Intel Kaby Lake or AMD Ryzen silicon. If configuring the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) is on your hate-list, there's good news: the release includes support for driverless printing. Either Apple AirPrint or IPP Everywhere printers can be installed without printer-specific drivers – and if it Works As Expected® discovery should happen automatically when the printer is connected to the USB or the LAN. HP printer/scanner users are warned not to run it in driverless mode, because it won't scan. Such devices can, however, be installed using the HPLIP driver. Other changes in the desktop version include LibreOffice, updated to version 5.3; most GNOME apps updated to version 3.24; and a Week view on the calendar. For sysadmins, the Ubuntu Server now uses qemu 2.8, the libvirt virtualisation library is version 2.5, and for white-box networking nerds, there's version 16.11.1 of the data plane development kit. The team is confident that there aren't any “showstopper CD build or installer bugs”, so they don't expect much to change between now and official release date on April 13. ® Tips and corrections 21 Comments More from The Register Wintel part deux?

Unless you use a Chromebook 12 Android Apps You Need to Install on Chromebook 12 Android Apps You Need to Install on Chromebook With the Google Play store about to come to our fingertips, the power of an incredible number of apps is about to reach Chrome OS. So what will we install first? Let's see. Read More . But what if you use a Mac? It is possible to run Android apps on macOS. You’ll need some third-party software, and you’ll need to be willing to spend a few moments setting it up. Once you’re done, you’ll even have access to the Google Play Store. In this guide, we’ll take a look at the best solution — VirtualBox — along with a few other methods you might want to explore. VirtualBox The best way to run Android apps on your Mac is to install a full version of the Android operating system itself. You can do this using the free VirtualBox software 3 Websites To Download Virtual Disk Images For VirtualBox 3 Websites To Download Virtual Disk Images For VirtualBox Virtual machines are more useful than just for fun and games, and they've helped me a huge deal in work-related areas of my life. Using a virtual machine offers a great sandbox if you're ever... Read More and a build of Android that has been developed for computers with Intel processors. Before you get started, then, download VirtualBox and the x86 build of Android. The most recent version supported is Marshmallow. Download: VirtualBox (Free) Download: x86 build of Android (Free) The process is straightforward, but there are quite a few steps involved. If you aren’t fully up to speed with virtual machines, partitions, file systems and the like, don’t worry. We’ll skip the technical explanations — just follow the instructions to get up and running. Set Up VirtualBox Install VirtualBox and then launch it. From the main screen, click New and enter a name for your virtual machine (you can just call it Android). Under Type, select Linux, and for Version, choose Other Linux (64-bit). Then click Continue. You can keep the defaults for the next few screens. Click Continue to accept them for the Memory Size, Hard Disk, and Hard Disk File Type settings. Under Storage on Physical Hard Disk select Fixed Size, which can give you a small speed boost, and click Continue. The next screen is File Location and Size. Click the folder icon to choose where you want to save your new virtual hard disk — or just keep the default option. Stick with the recommended size for the disk as well, then click Create. Your virtual machine is now set up, and you need to install Android on it. Back in the main window select the Android VM and click Start. Next select the Android ISO file that you downloaded earlier and click Start. You’re now ready to install the operating system, or you can run it without installing. This is slower and doesn’t enable you to save your setup. If you plan to use the operating system more than once, it’s best to install it. The mouse doesn’t work for the next few options, so use the cursor keys on your keyboard to highlight your chosen option and hit Enter to select it. Install Android The first part of the process is to create a virtual partition on your hard drive. This is where Android will be installed. On the next screen, choose Create/Modify Partitions, followed by No. Next, select New to create a new partition, then Primary, then hit Enter to accept the size. Finally, highlight Bootable and hit Enter again. The word Boot should have appeared under Flag in the table above. Once this is done, use the cursor keys to scroll over to Write and press Enter. You can ignore the warning about the partition destroying data on your disk — you aren’t creating an actual partition, just a large file that will function as one. Type “yes” to get started. Once that is complete scroll over to Quit and hit Enter. You’ll now see the Choose Partition screen, with your newly created virtual partition listed at the top. The next step is to install Android on this partition. Select the partition and choose OK to begin. On the next screen, select ext4 under Choose File System, then hit Yes to confirm on the next screen. The partition will then be formatted. Next, you’ll be asked if you want to install the boot loader. Choose Yes, then select Skip on the next screen. When prompted to install the /system directory as read/write, choose Yes. Android will now begin installing. When it has finished, you’ll be prompted to run Android. Hit Enter, and it will boot in its own window on your desktop.

Typically available for between $60 and $100,... Read More . You can control it with your mouse — you may need to go to Input > Mouse Integration (and deselect it) to get it working — but multi-touch controls are off limits. Hit Cmd + F to go full screen. Enter the details for your Google account, and you’ll have full access to the Play Store. You can also download apps through the browser and sideload them. Not every app will work, and not all of them will work perfectly, but you should hopefully be able to get most of your favorites up and running. A Few Other Methods VirtualBox is the best way to get Android apps working on macOS. There are a few other options you can look into, although they’re less effective and, in some cases, no longer supported. Android Studio The Android SDK How to Set Up Android Studio on Your Mac (And Why You'd Want to) How to Set Up Android Studio on Your Mac (And Why You'd Want to) You might need a Mac in order to create your own iOS apps, but if you're more of a green alien sort of guy, Android Studio is also available. Read More comes with a full emulator for the Android operating system, and it comes with the main benefit of always being fully up to date. However, it’s not intended as a method for running any app on your desktop — it’s for quickly testing apps you’ve built yourself. As such, installing apps is not easy, and the performance is far from great — the emulator is notoriously slow. Plus, installing the full Studio software is probably overkill for what most users are looking to achieve. BlueStacks BlueStacks is the best way to run Android apps on Windows Bluestacks: Run Android Apps On Windows PC Bluestacks: Run Android Apps On Windows PC Read More . The BlueStacks AppPlayer is free, fast, and very easy to set up. It also works with a large array of apps and games. If you visit bluestacks.com from your Mac, you’ll be prompted to download and install a version of this software for MacOS computers. Unfortunately, the software is not currently supported and no longer works. If you want to explore this option, and you have a legal copy of Windows on hand, you will need to use Bootcamp to set up your Mac to dual boot into Windows Run Windows 10 Natively On Your Mac: The Good, Bad & Ugly Run Windows 10 Natively On Your Mac: The Good, Bad & Ugly While Mac OS X works well for most tasks, there are times when it just can't do what you want it to. More often than not this means running Windows on your Mac. Read More . You’ll then be able to install and test out the Windows version. ARC Welder Chrome apps are also no longer officially supported outside of Chrome OS. However, you can still download them. ARC Welder is an old app that runs in the Chrome browser on a Mac that enables you to run Android apps within. It’s still worth testing, but it’s slow and support for apps seems to be very hit or miss. It isn’t a long term solution either, since the lack of support means it’s likely to eventually stop working altogether. Did You Get Android Running on Your Mac? For most users, VirtualBox is the way to go. Although the instructions might seem complex, it only takes a few minutes to get working. And the integration with the Play Store makes it easy to get your favorite apps on your Mac. Do you run Android apps on macOS? How have you found the experience?

By using this method, do you have access to the Imac hardware/functions so that you can use an Android app to send a file via Bluetooth? Reply Nicolas October 5, 2012 at 12:53 pm Great tutorial... i was able do test both ways (Virtualbox and SDK) and they run... But i tried do add some new apps from the play.google-store and created a google-account but was not able to download new apps... how can i add other apps? Reply Rich September 18, 2012 at 3:24 am Simon, this is a great tutorial. I wasn't clear on one thing though. Are these 2 types of solutions independent of each other? (Virtualbox vs AndroidSDK?) So if I want to download Android Apps I'd go with OPtion 2 only right? Reply Rahul Kapoor September 16, 2012 at 7:38 am can u tell me how can i run android app from my pc hard drive on virtual box,as i have to test them before publishing them,i will be grateful if u'd give a detail explainition?

VirtualBox: - Download and install VirtualBox. - Download and extract the Android VirtualBox image from this page. - Open the extracted 'Android-v4.vbox' in VirtualBox. - In VirtualBox, press 'Start'. The necessary configuration of the Android SDK should be already covered in the article, but feel free to ask for help if you're stuck anywhere. BlueStacks can just be installed, and used out of the box. Hope that helps you along. If not, let me know. :-) Reply Sohel Zaman July 16, 2012 at 6:29 pm Absolutely helpful..!! It's some material that i've been searching for a while to play my favorite apps in mac. Thanks for posting this. Reply Simon Slangen July 20, 2012 at 7:21 pm Glad to help! Which particular solution did you end up choosing? Reply Choon Khai July 11, 2012 at 6:47 pm I wondered if there's iPhone version? Windows one maybe? I only used iPhone 3G so far, and some apps painfully hard to use because it uses a lot of memory which my iPhone can't accommodate. Reply Simon Slangen July 20, 2012 at 7:04 pm I don't think there's any decent way to do this on iOS right now, but Chris Hoffman did write similar article for Windows. Hope that helps. Reply Choon Khai July 31, 2012 at 8:08 am Thanks! It helps :) Reply gpvprasad July 10, 2012 at 10:11 am Please also tell me how you created the virtual box image. Reply Simon Slangen July 20, 2012 at 7:00 pm I didn't create the virtualbox image myself, but used a prebuilt one. I actually linked to it in the article, but here it is again for reference. :-) Reply Tom Sobieski July 10, 2012 at 1:58 am I would want to do this because? Reply Sylwia July 10, 2012 at 9:20 am Because an app might not have a desktop version, not even web version, and sometimes it is easier to use keyboard to enter a lot of data.

The clr-boot-manager is responsible for solid kernel and boot-loader management. Solus' Joshua Strobl described of the effort, "clr-boot-manager, from the Clear Linux Project For Intel Architecture, enables a more bulletproof update experience by handling the maintenance and garbage collection of kernels, as well as configuration of the bootloader itself (i.e. GRUB2 for Legacy Boot, goofiboot for UEFI boot on Solus). Furthermore, it enables us to retain older, known-working kernels, so in the event a kernel upgrade results in the inability to boot, you’ll still be able to roll back to the last good kernel."

Mark Warner and Rep. Adam Schiff, two high-ranking Democratic members of congressional intelligence committees, suggested Sunday an independent commission should take over a probe looking into possible ties between Donald Trump's campaign and Russia. "Listen, if we could get an independent commission, I'm open to that," Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said on NBC's Meet the Press. "That means you've got to pass a bill, [and] the president's got to sign it." Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called for an independent investigation on Twitter Saturday and elaborated on the issue Sunday on the CBS show Face the Nation. "We, I think, suffered really two serious blows to the integrity of the investigation this week: one with that unilateral trip to the White House but the other with the cancellation of an open hearing that was scheduled for Tuesday," Schiff said, referring to actions by Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., last week. Schiff accused the committee chairman of acting as a "surrogate of the White House" after announcing that Trump transition officials were put under inadvertent surveillance after November's election and then briefed Trump about it. He didn't first notify Democrats on the committee. "The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he is going to act as a surrogate of the White House, because he cannot do both," Schiff said. Warner, of Virginia, had similar views "I am totally mystified by what Mr. Nunes has said," Warner said. "And I've talked to my chairman, Richard Burr. He doesn't know. I've talked to Democrats, Republicans on the committee. I think it's fairly mystifying, if not outrageous, that he'd make these claims, then goes down and briefs the White House." But Republican House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said Nunes had every right to brief the president on the surveillance intelligence. "The chairman of House Intel briefed the commander-in-chief on something that has nothing to do with the Russia investigation," Gowdy said on Face the Nation. "So if the commander-in-chief cannot be briefed by the chairperson of the House Intel Committee on a matter that has nothing to do with the FBI investigation, then I don't know what they can talk about. Last month, Warner said he had "grave concerns" about the independence of the investigation. "We've had some bumps," Warner said Sunday. "But I am working very closely with him right now," adding, "I trust him that we will get this done. And we have a list of witnesses that I think you will see that is comprehensive. And we're going to talk to everybody involved." The Senate will conduct its first hearing this week. "I've said before: This is the most important thing that I've ever done in my public life," Warner said. "And what I know now as I get more and more into this, I am going to double down on that statement cause it's extraordinary." FBI Director James Comey said at Monday's House Intelligence Committee hearing that the bureau is investigating Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election as well as the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia. "We know that the Russians both massively interfered in our elections with both hacking [and] they had a thousand paid Internet trolls that managed to take over and flood the zone with fake news," said Warner. "And we have a series of people that are very closely affiliated with the president who have had extensive ties with Russia -- including 60 days into the administration where you've got the NSA, our national security adviser who had to resign, and the attorney general had to recuse himself because of those ties."

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes briefed President Donald Trump on matters that were not related to the probe concerning Russia, Rep. Trey Gowdy said Sunday, while defending his fellow Republican congressman. "If that's a big deal in Washington, then we've sunk to a new low," the South Carolina lawmaker told CBS' "Face the Nation." "If the commander in chief cannot be briefed by the chairperson of the House Intel Committee on a matter that has nothing to do with the FBI investigation, then I don't know what they can talk about." Nunes has said he spoke with the president after learning that the U.S. intelligence community had incidentally collected Trump's transition team while conducting surveillance, and then "widely disseminated" the information among its agencies. "The felonious dissemination of classified information is the only thing we know for sure is a crime, and it would be nice if we showed the same level of interest in that," he said. Nunes came under fire from both sides of the aisle for speaking with Trump before fellow committee members, including the top Democrat on the committee, California Rep. Adam Schiff, bringing criticism from both sides of the aisle. Gowdy also on Sunday said he does not agree with people such as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who have called for an independent commission to investigate Russian interference. "Thank goodness we have one," said Gowdy. "It's called the FBI. The FBI has counterintelligence jurisdiction and they have criminal jurisdiction, and what we learned on Monday, and it's about the only thing we learned on Monday, was that the FBI is investigating both." The investigation, though, is important, said Gowdy. "Russia is not our friend," he said. "They attacked our democracy. I want to investigate every fact that is related there too, but the felonious dissemination of classified information is the only thing we know for sure is a crime, and it would be nice if we showed the same level of interest in that."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 March 2017 by Military News Artificial Intelligence – is it about to change my industry? iCrowdNewswire – Mar 26, 2017 A couple of months ago, 60 minutes ran a segment on IBM Watson’s healthcare initiative and more specifically, the initiative on oncology. The segment was eye opening and the realization that the next huge influence on major industries is left the dock and on its way to major disruption in fields such as Healthcare, Law, Finance and more is much more advanced than most people know. I now bring up AI as Artificial Intelligence is known to those involved from time to time only to find a puzzled look on many faces. My best guess is that to a lot of people this is a “smart” thing to claim to understand when they have no idea of what is really happening. I went to a trusted pal, LinkedIn, to do some very superficial research: a search for IBM Artificial Intelligence returns over 10,000 contacts; Google 6,500 contacts; Intel 3,000 contacts; Microsoft 9,000 contacts; Apple 1,900 contacts; and just plain Artificial Intelligence over 270,000 contacts. Google recently announced a breakthrough with state-of-the art breast cancer detection and at the same time made this statement: “What we’ve trained is just a little sliver of software that helps with one part of a very complex series of tasks,” said Lily Peng, the project manager behind Google’s work. “There will hopefully be more and more of these tools that help doctors [who] have to go through an enormous amount of information all the time.” The bottom line is that even experts in the field achieving astonishing developments realize they are barely scratching the surface. The ABA Journal recently published an article on how AI will transform the legal industry. “Artificial intelligence is more than legal technology. It is the next great hope that will revolutionize the legal profession.” Goldman Sachs published the AI Age and talks about healthcare and retail. In short, a Google search for “how AI will affect……..” will yield you a handful of choices and dozens of articles for each industry category. Still seem that AI is all about 500,000 geeks toying with technology? AI may be the best kept secret we have ever had but chances are it is already influencing your life and that of countless millions with more to come at an ever increasing pace.

Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 26 March 2017 at 09:56 AM EDT. 80 Comments Every year or so it comes up how some users believe that at Phoronix we should be benchmarking with Antergos/Arch, Debian, or [insert here any other distribution] instead of mostly using Ubuntu for our Linux benchmarking. That discussion has come back up in recent days. In our forums and Twitter the past few days, that discussion seems to have come up by some users requesting I use a different Linux distribution than Ubuntu as the main test platform for all of our benchmarking. As I've said before, Ubuntu is used given it's the most popular when it comes to Linux desktop usage as well as significant usage of it on servers / workstations / cloud. But I have no tie to it beyond focusing upon using the Linux distribution that's used by the most folks for obtaining the maximum relevance to users, gamers, and enthusiasts reading said articles. And for allowing easy comparisons / out-of-the-box expectations. On my main production system I still use Fedora Workstation as my personal favorite and in the basement server room there are a variety of operating systems -- both BSDs and Linux and from Antergos to openSUSE and Debian. I have no plans to switch away from using Ubuntu for most of our benchmarks in the near future. As many of our cross-distribution performance comparisons have shown, when at similar package versions, Antergos, openSUSE, Debian, and others generally don't perform vastly different from Ubuntu. The only exception to that rule is Clear Linux and we already test that a lot on Intel x86 hardware as probably our second-most benchmarked distribution around here. That will continue to be the case especially as Intel continues investing in more Linux optimizations, kernel-level improvements, etc. Clear Linux is doing interesting technical work, especially in regards to performance, compared to most other Linux distributions. When Unity 8 and Mir (and more Snaps) roll-out by default on Ubuntu, I may re-evaluate my decision of using it as the basis for most Linux benchmarks on Phoronix. Especially as no other Linux distribution is actively looking at using Mir, the Ubuntu-generated results particularly for graphics tests may begin to differ more from other Linux distributions. But anyhow for the annual "why don't you test with XYZ Linux distribution?", there's been a user poll and unofficial discussion in this forum thread. Of course, in Phoronix discussions like this, more weight is given to the feedback of premium members who have more of a stake in future article requests. You can also share your two cents by commenting on this article in the forums. On Twitter there is also an informal poll. 80 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

But to get the packaged Vulkan drivers, simply sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers. When running some tests on Ubuntu 17.04 this weekend, I was a bit surprised to see that Mesa's Intel ANV and Radeon RADV drivers aren't present by default -- since it's been one year since the Vulkan 1.0 debut and the ANV/RADV drivers have matured a lot during this time. There's also more and more software becoming available that can make use of Vulkan while personally wishing for more Linux desktops to push Vulkan. But it's easy to install the Vulkan drivers as mentioned. Similarly, vulkan-utils isn't installed by default. Understandably, this is probably because nothing in Ubuntu main is requiring Vulkan support at this time. With GTK4 bringing a Vulkan renderer, Vulkan support coming in Qt 5.10, it will probably only be a matter of time before seeing the Vulkan loader and drivers shipped by default in Ubuntu as we are seeing this low-level, performance-oriented graphics API reach beyond just games. With Mir 1.0 they will also be bringing Vulkan support for allowing Vulkan software to run atop their new display server. Running some Mesa 17.0 Ubuntu 17.04 tests and will have that data to share shortly. 2 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Ro Khanna, who came to eastern Kentucky to see what the tech industry and Appalachia can offer each other. By Nancy Scola 03/26/17 07:19 AM EDT Updated 03/27/17 10:50 AM EDT Rep. Ro Khanna and Appalachian Regional Commission Co-Chairman Earl Gohl chat as they head from the Big Sandy Community and Technical College main building in Paintsville, Ky., to the Interapt coding bootcamp across the street. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print PAINTSVILLE, Kentucky — President Donald Trump won this state by a landslide after promising to reopen Appalachia’s coal mines and put its miners back to work. But here, along the banks of Paint Creek in eastern Kentucky’s legendary coal fields, some displaced workers are pinning their hopes instead on Silicon Valley. And the celebrity of the moment is California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who came from the Valley’s deep-blue heart last week to see what this emptying corner of coal country might have to offer the technology industry — and how Appalachia can reap its benefits in the form of jobs and tech training. Story Continued Below "It's just exciting for them to think what we're doing is interesting enough to make the trip," former coal worker and budding app developer Steve Bowling said in a cinder-block classroom in Paintsville — referring to Khanna and, by extension, the tech industry itself. "That means a whole lot to us." The 40-year-old freshman congressman and son of Indian immigrants might seem an unlikely ambassador to a conservative region: He supports what he calls “common-sense” gun laws, not to mention the Obama-era energy regulations that the coal industry blames for shuttering dozens of coal plants in the past decade. But he hopes that by expounding upon the Silicon Valley success story across the U.S., he might help boost the economic prospects of places like Paintsville. And if he can convey the woes of non-coastal regions to leaders back home, the tech industry might find a way to steer where the country goes from here. “The election was a wakeup call about how much discontent there is from technological progress and globalization, that it’s not just all a clear good thing,” Khanna said in his still-bare Capitol Hill office just before his trip, where he visited a training program for mobile app developers at Big Sandy Community & Technical College. And it’s time, he said, for an industry that has played a role in shedding American jobs — by advancing artificial intelligence, among other things — to invest in helping communities like this one share in the upside. “There’s got to be greater empathy among those in Silicon Valley for some of the pain that has been caused,” he said. At the same time, he’s looking to spread Silicon Valley’s aspirational spirit around a country in need of big thinking. “It's just getting people to dream that they can go try to be like Elon Musk or Steve Jobs,” Khanna said. The 43-room mansion of John C. Mayo, a teacher-turned-entrepreneur regarded as the father of the eastern Kentucky coal industry, is now the home of Our Lady of the Mountains School. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Khanna came here at the invitation Kentucky Rep. Hal Rogers¸ a 79-year-old Republican who joined Congress the year Ronald Reagan moved into the White House. Rogers' sprawling district is among the poorest in the country — ranked 432nd out of 435 in median per-capita income according to the Almanac of American Politics — and the setting for the best-selling guide-to-Trump-country "Hillbilly Elegy." By contrast, companies including Apple, Intel, eBay, Yahoo, LinkedIn and Tesla are all stuffed within Khanna’s overwhelmingly Democratic, wealthy and compact district; Google, while headquartered in nearby Mountain View, has offices there, too. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and Megan Smith, the Google executive who served as Barack Obama’s U.S. chief technology officer, also came to the event, giving speeches and chatting over foam-containered chicken salad sandwiches and potato chips. But for the crowd of about 150 people, Khanna's attention was what they craved. Rogers was eager to have him in what he calls “Silicon Holler,” because Khanna has quickly become a one-man proxy for a swath of glitteringly brand-name and geographically concentrated Silicon Valley companies. “It’s a chance for us to sell him, and therefore them, that this is a place to look at," said Rogers. That he's actually come, joked Earl Gohl, co-chairman of the Appalachian Regional Commission — founded in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy — makes Khanna his “new best friend.” Still, shortly after he stepped off stage with Khanna, Rogers fielded a question on whether he holds any bad feelings over the tech industry’s growing disdain for coal, such as Facebook’s new hydropowered data center in Luleå, Sweden. His answer? If the goal is keeping Appalachian people in the rolling hills of Paintsville and Pikesville and Harlan County, not fleeing to places like Ypsilanti and Cincinnati, America’s tech boom might be the last best hope. “We can't afford to be too resentful," said the Republican. “We'd rather sleep here.” Republican Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), former U.S. CTO Megan Smith, Rep. Ro Khanna and Appalachian Regional Commission Co-Chairman Earl Gohl chat March 13 before a round table luncheon on developing Eastern Kentucky from a coal based economy to a "Silicon Holler." | John Shinkle/POLITICO Khanna, a lawyer and former official in the Obama-era Commerce Department, came to the tan-bricked, 1950s-built community college, where every other car in the parking lot is a hulking, mud-spattered American-made pickup truck. Founded in 1790 as Paint Lick Station, this is a town that honors its coal history. The bricked-and-columned 43-room mansion built on the cusp of World War I by John C. Mayo, the teacher-turned-entrepreneur regarded as the father of the eastern Kentucky coal industry, stands a block over. It’s now Our Lady of the Mountains School. But gone are the days where you could get a $70,000 job in the mines with a ninth-grade education and buy one of the lovely homes dotting the hills here. Since 2008, coal jobs in eastern Kentucky have dropped from more than 14,000 to fewer than 4,000. And even the jobs still available don't look like a smart long-term bet, making scraping out a living underground even less attractive than it's ever been. The event on display here, convened more or less in Khanna's honor, amounted to speeches, a roundtable discussion and demonstrations about a program called TechHire Eastern Kentucky, or TEKY — pronounced, conveniently, "techie." The program, backed by $2.75 million in federal funds, trains a crop of would-be mobile app developers for four months and puts them in a four-month paid internship with a Louisville software company called Interapt. (That money flowed through the Appalachian Regional Commission, which Trump, in his first budget, included on the list of agencies he’d completely defund. Rogers called those cuts “draconian, careless and counterproductive.”) TechHire, begun as a federal program in the Obama White House in 2015, was inspired by the tech industry's complaint that it has 600,000 job openings it can't fill, a major drag on its bottom line and ambitions, and part of its justification for seeking more visas for specialized workers from overseas. But the people who have brought Khanna argue that this crunch exists partly because the industry simply doesn’t hirethe sort of people sitting in cinder-block classrooms in eastern Kentucky. The former coal worker Bowling, 41, said his wife found out about TEKY on Facebook after he’d beenlaid off from a job in a coal mine filling blasting holes with ammonium nitrate. He chose the Android app training track over the more structured Apple iOS trackbecause his instructors "described it as, 'It's the Wild Wild West.'" Others have come to the program to avoid coal. Sean Crowl, 29, says he lost his job when the Kmart in town closed. Crowl sat at a roundtable of young men — the class of 35 trainees, from a pool of 800 applicants, is overwhelming male and white — who came from a bank, a school, a restaurant or unemployment to build apps like one for a local nonprofit that helps track elementary school students' reading progress. The $400 a week was appealing, as a two-bedroom apartment can be had here at that price. (One trainee says it was so good he thought it was a "scam" until he heard about the paycheck.) All six said four months was plenty of time to learn how to build apps good enough for the Google Play marketplace or Apple's App Store. Interapt CEO Ankur Gopal and Rep. Ro Khanna speak with trainees in the TechHire Eastern Kentucky coding program at the local campus of Big Sandy Community and Technical College on March 13. | John Shinkle/POLITICO The pitch Rogers and others are making here is that Silicon Valley hiring managers would be smart to open their eyes to places beyond San Francisco and New York — and they’re pitchingeastern Kentucky as the type of undervalued investment that venture capitalists love to go on about. They argue that the internet erases some of the region's traditional limitations, such as a dearth of well-maintained roads in many places, as well as of flat ground for building factories. The people say they are hard-working and open to low wages. And unlike, say, Bangalore, it's in a reasonable time zone. But for all the tech industry’s talk of meritocracy, "when employers say they can't hire people with skills, what they're really saying is that they can't find people with a certain pedigree," said Byron Auguste, a former deputy director of the White House National Economic Council who helped create TechHire. Auguste is now president of Opportunity@Work, the non-profit group administering the program. The result, he said, is that people from places like Paintsville don't get access to the enormous sums that companies like those in Khanna's district invest in training. "People are on the outside looking in, forever," Augustesaid. “People say, ‘How many former coal miners can learn to code?’ And my answer is, it’s too early to tell. Only a handful have been given an opportunity, and they’ve done pretty damn well.” Of Khanna, Auguste said: “We want him to be able to go back to Silicon Valley and his constituent companies and say, ‘No joke, there’s really a lot of talent here.’" Being taken seriously is, in fact, a recurring theme. Interapt CEO Ankur Gopal wants Khanna to see that what's going on here isn't some “cute thing.” Jared Arnett, executive director of Shaping Our Appalachian Region, quotes a colleague saying he wants to prove “we're not just a dancing bear.” Khanna said he's listening. "The tech companies and tech industry have an incentive to rethink their own labor practices so that they aren't just hiring in Stanford and Santa Clara, but are broader about what their hiring practices are and the skills they need," he said. That said, Khanna told the crowd in Paintsville, "it has to be a partnership. I don't think it's an act of Silicon Valley's charity. It's in their interest to harness the talent, the energy and the spirit here. That's going to make their companies better. That's going to make our country better." And that, says Khanna, is what he's going to go back and tell the tech industry. The event includedno talk of Trump, his campaign pledge to “bring those miners back” or the attackshe's heaped on the tech industry for everything from manufacturing its products abroad to refusing to open up its consumer products to law enforcement. But Auguste said the warm feelings for the tech industry evident at Big Sandy Community College aren't widely distributed across the U.S. “The country should love Silicon Valley. It’s a gem and a treasure,” he said. “But when push comes to shove, in a lot of parts of the country, it’s difficult to find people who’d say, ‘Silicon Valley has done much for me.’” Khanna said he also wants to help his own home-district industry expand its thinking on Silicon Valley’s role in society. “What I want to do is to help shape the thinking of the Valley to start caring more and engaging more in policy that's not narrow,” Khanna said. “You get almost the same talking points about [tax] repatriation, encryption, patent trolls. I say, ‘What an impoverished vision for a place that literally believes it wants to change human civilization.'"

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement ECS Liva ZE is a compact, fanless PC for business, industrial applications 03/23/2017 at 12:18 PM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment The ECS Liva line of computers are tiny desktop PCs with low-power processors and fanless designs. Like most computers in this category, you could use them in the home, office, or for digital signage or other commercial applications. Now ECS has unveiled a new model that’s clearly designed for the business and enterprise markets. The ECS Liva ZE is a computer with an Intel Apollo Lake processor, multiple storage options, support for Windows or Linux… and 4 Serial RS232 COM ports. While those COM ports might not be all that useful if you’re building a home theater PC, they’re still pretty commonly found in PCs designed for use as cash registers/point-of-sale systems, digital signage, kiosks, and other business applications. That doesn’t mean you couldn’t use the Liva ZE in a home or office setting though. The computer measures about 5″ x 4.6″ x 1″ and supports up to 64GB of eMMC flash storage as well as a 2.5 inch hard drive or SSD and an M.2 SSD. ECS will offer models with a choice of Celeron N3350, Celeron N3450, or Pentium N4200 Apollo Lake processors, and each model support up to 8GB of RAM thanks to 2 SODIMM slots. There’s a USB 3.0 Type-C port, three USB 3.1 ports, an HDMI 1.4 port, a mini DisplayPort, dual Gigiabit Ethernet jacks, a headset jack, a built-in mic, and 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0. ECS says the computer supports Windows 10 or Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, although the company only provides official support for Windows. via @FanlessTech   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

By: Anthony Garreffa | CPU, APU & Chipsets News | Posted: 2 days, 14 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Intel is going to have a hard time on its hands with this current rumor of the purported Core i7-7740K processor, a new CPU based on the Kaby Lake X architecture - on the HEDT platform.     The new Core i7-7740K won't be a slight bump on the current Kaby Lake (non-X) processor is a 4C/8T offering on the LGA 1151 socket, while the Core i7-7740K is on the LGA 2066 socket powered by the X299 chipset. The X299 chipset will be ready for the high-end Core i7-7740K, which will rock 4C/8T of Kaby Lake X at 4.3/4.5GHz for base/boost clocks.   But, the new Core i7-7740K will not include an integrated GPU for on-board graphics, like the 7700K does now - and will bump the TDP up to 112W, from 91W on 7700K. 20 more watts, for the same Turbo Boost clock of 4.5GHz, and 4C/8T - without integrated graphics, hmm.   Will people think the 7740K is a slightly faster 7700K, even though its a completely different architecture and motherboard? Confusing naming here if the rumors turn out to be true... maybe Intel needs to introduce a new family of CPUs between its current Core and Xeon lines, to deal with the multi-threaded CPU threat from AMD with Ryzen.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Asus Transformer Pro T304 is a Surface Pro 4… Asus Transformer Pro T304 is a Surface Pro 4 look-alike that can be ordered today By Mark Coppock — March 24, 2017 11:38 AM Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you've been waiting for a Windows 10 2-in-1 that adds seventh-generation Intel CPUs and USB Type-C to the Surface Pro 4, then Asus has the machine for you. Microsoft has demonstrated in a number of ways that its Surface line of innovative Windows 10 PCs is meant to lead its OEM partners to make better machines. There’s no OEM that has embraced this more than Asus, which with its Transformer Pro line has created nearly identical copies of Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4. The latest model is the Asus Transformer Pro T304, which from a distance is nearly indistinguishable from Microsoft’s version. Asus announced the machine some time ago, and it’s now available for ordering, as Liliputing reports. More: The Asus Transformer 3 Pro is a slightly bigger, slightly better Surface Pro The Transformer Pro T304 is a Windows 10 2-in-1 that follows Microsoft’s “tablet that can replace your notebook” tagline. That is, it’s a tablet PC first and foremost, with a 12.6-inch IPS display running at 2,160 x 1,440 resolution that’s the same 3:2 aspect ratio as the Surface Pro 4. Like all good tablets, the Transformer Pro is also a light machine at 1.8 pounds, it’s quite thin at 0.34 inches, and it utilizes a very Surface Pro-like built-in kickstand to let it stand upright or angle down to a 155-degree stance. The device transforms into a notebook-like PC when you snap on the detachable keyboard, which offers 1.4mm of travel, and so it’s close to the sweet spot for touch typists of 1.5mm, and it also includes a decently sized multitouch touchpad supporting Windows 10 gestures. In terms of specifications, the Transformer Pro can be configured with seventh-generation Core i5 and i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to a 1TB PCIe x4 SSD. Connectivity is provided by a single USB 3.1 Type-C port, a USB 3.0 port, a full-size HDMI connection, and an audio jack. In this respect, at least, it’s superior to the Surface Pro 4 with its single USB 3.0 port. Windows 10 Hello support is provided by a fingerprint scanner, while an array microphone provides for Cortana voice input. Finally, the Asus Pen is the final piece of the puzzle, offering up support for Windows 10 Ink. One area where Asus hasn’t followed Microsoft’s lead lately is with pricing. While the Surface line is usually a price leader on the high end, Asus has actually priced the Transformer Pro T304 a bit closer to the stratosphere. The model with an Intel Core i5-7200U CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is priced by retailer NCIX at $1,450. That’s more expensive than the Surface Pro 4’s retail price and even more so than the discounted prices Microsoft has been offering lately. Note that Asus includes the keyboard and pen. You can order the Asus Transformer Pro T304 from a few vendors and get it in a week or two. Note that Microsoft could be announcing its own Surface Pro 5 sometime soon, which could offer seventh-generation Intel processors, a higher-resolution screen, and its own USB Type-C connection, if rumors hold true. If you’re not willing to wait, then the Transformer Pro might offer some of the same advantages.

Most Indian parents want their children to become doctors, but not her parents. Das, who calls herself a "rebel", recalled to IANS that her parents had told her: "Whatever you do, don't be a doctor. Don't become a doctor, it's long and expensive." "So I decided I wanted to be a doctor," she said. And that rebellious ambition led her to her medical-oriented science project. Her parents Bidyut and Tanima Das, who are from Kolkata and now live in Oradell, New Jersey, are bankers by profession. The 17-year-old, who is in the final year of high school at the Academy for Medical Science Technology in Hackensack, said she wants to become a doctor who simultaneously does scientific research. "I want to be physician-scientist," she said. "I would like to see patients, but I would also like to do research." Her project on finding ways to treat damage to the brain from injuries or disease won her the top prize earlier this month in the nation's foremost science contest sponsored by Regeneron and conducted by Society for Science and the Public (SSP). Nicknamed the "Junior Nobel Prize", the Science Talent Search competition was originally sponsored by Westinghouse in 1942 and Intel took it up from 1998 till last year. Twelve of the contest alumni have won Nobel Prizes. Indian American teens took five of the top ten awards in this year's competition in which 1,700 high school students participated. SSP President Maya Ajmera said Das's "dedication to making the world a better place through science -- whether through her research on treating brain damage or volunteer work in her community -- is truly inspiring". Explaining her research, Das said that when Alzheimer, Parkinson's, stroke or a traumatic injury affects the brain, the neurons, which are the main signal cells of the brain, are killed. Next the supporting cells -- astrocytes -- that are supposed to nurture and protect the neurons, go awry and create a toxic chemical environment, poisoning the neurons. "My work concentrates on getting these supporting cells to behave correctly," Das said. "I found one way it can be made better, essentially by increasing one protein at the membrane of these supporting cells." "It pushes these supporting cells with treatment to create a chemical environment that is safer and cleaner for neurons to grow in" after a damage to the brain, she said. There are several steps before a medical treatment based on her research can become available to patients. "First thing I will need to do is use my treatment in animal models," Das said. "So I will have to work on increasing the complexity of my models." She said that she wants to find out where and how exactly the treatment is effective. "Finding how it works will will help me back-track and understand this whole injury condition better, which is something nobody really understands," she said. Her school is equipped with a cell culture facility for her research. Her mentor, Donna Leonardi, was her biology teacher. She is a former lab director at New York Presbyterian, a major medical facility affiliated with Columbia and Cornell universities. In preparation for a medical career, Das got certified as an emergency medical technician (EMT) last year. As a volunteer EMT she goes out on ambulances to attend to emergencies as a first responder. Besides her studies and research, she manages to find time for non-medical activities too. "I play the trumpet," she said. "I enjoy skeet-shooting, weightlifting." And one of her ambitions for college? " I hope to play rugby in college," she said. "I told you I was a rebel."

In a Wall Street Journal interview posted Friday, March 24, 2017, former CIA Director James Woolsey accused Flynn of participating in a discussion with Turkish officials in which the possibility of subverting the U.S. extradition process to remove a Turkish cleric from the U.S. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. WASHINGTON — Former CIA Director James Woolsey has accused the Trump administration's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, of participating in a discussion with Turkish officials about possibly subverting the U.S. extradition process to remove a Turkish cleric from the United States. The Wall Street Journal first reported Woolsey's comments and posted a video interview with him late Friday. A Flynn spokesman said Friday that Woolsey's claims are “false” and that “no such discussion occurred.” In the Journal interview, Woolsey says he walked into the middle of a discussion between Turkish officials and members of Flynn's firm, Flynn Intel Group, late in the evening of Sept. 19 at Essex House hotel in New York City. Woolsey said the discussion generally involved removing cleric Fethullah Gulen from the United States without going through the lengthy extradition process, though he said it stopped short of outlining a specific plan to sweep the cleric out of the country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought Gulen's extradition from the U.S. after accusing the cleric of directing a failed coup last summer. The U.S. government has rebuffed that request, and Gulen, who has a green card and lives in Pennsylvania, has denied involvement. Woolsey described the discussion as “brainstorming, but it was brainstorming about a very serious matter that would pretty clearly be a violation of law.” Though, Woolsey noted that the discussion “did not rise to the level of being a specific plan to undertake a felonious act.” Flynn spokesman Price Floyd told The Associated Press that Flynn Intel Group's work never involved discussing removing Gulen from the United States by any means other than the extradition process. He confirmed that Woolsey attended the meeting but denied that it involved subverting the legal process. Flynn, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, was fired by Trump last month after Trump said Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the United States. Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are part of House and Senate committee investigations into contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians.

Most Indian parents want their children to become doctors, but not her parents. By: IANS | New York | Published: March 26, 2017 10:03 AM Das, who calls herself a “rebel”, recalled to IANS that her parents had told her: “Whatever you do, don’t be a doctor. Don’t become a doctor, it’s long and expensive.” (Twitter) A rebellion began Indian-American teen Indrani Das on her way to the brain research that got her the quarter-million-dollar Regeneron Science Talent Search award for high school students. Most Indian parents want their children to become doctors, but not her parents. Das, who calls herself a “rebel”, recalled to IANS that her parents had told her: “Whatever you do, don’t be a doctor. Don’t become a doctor, it’s long and expensive.” “So I decided I wanted to be a doctor,” she said. And that rebellious ambition led her to her medical-oriented science project. Her parents Bidyut and Tanima Das, who are from Kolkata and now live in Oradell, New Jersey, are bankers by profession. The 17-year-old, who is in the final year of high school at the Academy for Medical Science Technology in Hackensack, said she wants to become a doctor who simultaneously does scientific research. “I want to be physician-scientist,” she said. “I would like to see patients, but I would also like to do research.” Also watch: Her project on finding ways to treat damage to the brain from injuries or disease won her the top prize earlier this month in the nation’s foremost science contest sponsored by Regeneron and conducted by Society for Science and the Public (SSP). Nicknamed the “Junior Nobel Prize”, the Science Talent Search competition was originally sponsored by Westinghouse in 1942 and Intel took it up from 1998 till last year. Twelve of the contest alumni have won Nobel Prizes. Indian American teens took five of the top ten awards in this year’s competition in which 1,700 high school students participated. SSP President Maya Ajmera said Das’s “dedication to making the world a better place through science — whether through her research on treating brain damage or volunteer work in her community — is truly inspiring”. Explaining her research, Das said that when Alzheimer, Parkinson’s, stroke or a traumatic injury affects the brain, the neurons, which are the main signal cells of the brain, are killed. Next the supporting cells — astrocytes — that are supposed to nurture and protect the neurons, go awry and create a toxic chemical environment, poisoning the neurons. “My work concentrates on getting these supporting cells to behave correctly,” Das said. “I found one way it can be made better, essentially by increasing one protein at the membrane of these supporting cells.” “It pushes these supporting cells with treatment to create a chemical environment that is safer and cleaner for neurons to grow in” after a damage to the brain, she said. There are several steps before a medical treatment based on her research can become available to patients. “First thing I will need to do is use my treatment in animal models,” Das said. “So I will have to work on increasing the complexity of my models.” She said that she wants to find out where and how exactly the treatment is effective. “Finding how it works will will help me back-track and understand this whole injury condition better, which is something nobody really understands,” she said. Her school is equipped with a cell culture facility for her research. Her mentor, Donna Leonardi, was her biology teacher. She is a former lab director at New York Presbyterian, a major medical facility affiliated with Columbia and Cornell universities. In preparation for a medical career, Das got certified as an emergency medical technician (EMT) last year. As a volunteer EMT she goes out on ambulances to attend to emergencies as a first responder. Besides her studies and research, she manages to find time for non-medical activities too. “I play the trumpet,” she said. “I enjoy skeet-shooting, weightlifting.” And one of her ambitions for college? ” I hope to play rugby in college,” she said. “I told you I was a rebel.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

It's not quite Blu-ray versus HD-DVD; even if one does pull ahead with developers, the other won't suddenly vanish. A lot of factors can decide the battle, with one of the more interesting being support for mixed hardware, multi-GPU setups. On this front, Microsoft scored points with DirectX 12, but Vulkan has done one better by supporting multi-GPU on all the important platforms, not just Windows 10. An announcement by the Khronos, the working group that oversees OpenGL and Vulkan and comprised of industry heavyweights including AMD, Valve, Google, Intel and NVIDIA, among many others, has made it clear that the API's multi-GPU functionality will play nice with Windows 7, 8.1 and 10, as well as Linux. Apparently, the question was a popular one at this year's GDC, so Khronos thought it best to clarify the situation in writing: The good news is that the Vulkan multi-GPU specification is very definitely NOT tied to Windows 10. It is possible to implement the Vulkan multi-GPU extension on any desktop OS including Windows 7, 8.X and 10 and Linux ... Khronos always strives to make its specifications as cross platform as possible. Of course, what products ship on which OS is up to the implementers of each specification, but Khronos is already aware of vendor plans to ship multi-GPU functionality on platforms other than Windows 10, including Linux. The rest of the statement is mostly technical, but the gist is that there's nothing really stopping Vulkan's multi-GPU support from working, well, anywhere. Sure, certain operating system features can make it easier to implement, but there are no hard locks in the way. Putting aside technical limitations, there's no mystery behind Microsoft's decision to restrict DirectX 12 and hence, mixed-vendor multi-GPU support, to Windows 10. But if a developer was on the fence about which API to go with, Khronos has made Vulkan just that much more appealing. Vulkan Multi-GPU Support — Not Just for Windows 10 [Khronos] WATCH MORE: PC Gaming News Comments welbot @welbot Mar 26, 2017, 1:23pm I'm certainly keen to see some more games get in on the Vulkan action. Given I can run Doom at 2160p @ 120fps using Vulkan certainly makes it appealing to have more games use it :) Reply 1 justachap @justachap Mar 26, 2017, 2:19pm Gotta see more games have Vulkan as an option. Many of the games that have included DirectX 12 however have not had very good impressions. Reply 0 g-man @g-man Mar 26, 2017, 2:38pm Is multi gpu still popular? With quite powerful cards these days I'd say this would affect the majority of people. If you don't multi gpu this hardly would make up your mind. But that said Vulcan had been quite impressive so far and I do have limited use of dx12 to my knowledge. Reply 0 welbot @welbot Mar 26, 2017, 3:29pm It's popular among enthusiasts who can afford it, but I think this will open it up to a lot more people. Last I checked, you could only use multi card setups for SLI/Xfire if they were from the same generation (like a 980GTX and a 960GTX would work together) but if one of your cards was a different gen (say a 980GTX and an 880GTX) you couldn't use them for SLI. You could use the 880 as a dedicated Physx processor though, which does have its advantages, but only of course, if the game actually uses Physx. Given they haven't released all the details of what they're doing, it's hard to say for sure, but by the sounds of it, this may open up multi GPU setups to cross generation cards, or maybe even a mix of AMD/nVidia cards. If that's the case, a lot of people who've previously upgraded their GPU's, may well have a second card lying around, and be able to use it for more than just Physx. Reply 0 James @jamesh Mar 26, 2017, 6:54pm It might provide a less hackish way of handling laptops with both an integrated Intel GPU and discrete Nvidia/AMD GPU. Depending on the workload, you might even benefit from using both at once. Reply 0 Daaaaamm,I'mLookin'Good @skinja Mar 27, 2017, 8:47am I thought this was talking about multi gpu as in one amd and one nvidia. But reading back. It doesnt specify that. I know the new direct x was allowing that sort of configuration and had some stunning results. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

New realities are upon us Posted on March 27, 2017March 27, 2017 by GS Early Views: 754 23 Shares I’m not talking about economic realities or political realities… I’m talking about two of the most transformative technologies that are beginning to flow into our markets as we speak: virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). These are not just for gamers, young hipsters or spoiled millennials. AR and VR are already involved in some very real world efforts that illustrate the value underneath these whiz bang technologies. What’s the difference? VR is a computer generated simulation of a 3D environment where you can interact in real time, using VR headsets, gloves, suits, etc. AR superimposes a computer generated view on top of what you are seeing in real life. The difference is, VR tends to be completely immersive. Facebook’s Oculus Rift is a VR headset. If you have it on and you’re moving in a room to get a drink from the refrigerator, you may be moving in the game but you have no idea where you are in the room. You’re locked into the reality in your headset. AR is different. One example of AR is if you had on a headset, you could walk down the street in London and it could give you a walking tour of where you are walking in WW II or during the time of King George II. Or, it could show you where the closest Indian restaurants are in real time, as you walk. Microsoft’s HoloLens headset is using AR for it reality. Value beyond gaming already Both these technologies were born and are already gaining significant ground in the gaming community. And there’s a reason they started there. Gamers are the early adapters of new technology. For tech companies, that is a great place to test new products as well, because gamers, while they have high expectations, they also are willing to allow products to improve and provide tons of feedback. Broader consumer markets expect something plug and play that is flawless and they’re far less forgiving of “works in progress.” There’s also a new group that is adopting these technologies — the military and hospitals. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, about 20 percent of the 2.7 million veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom remain psychologically scarred from their service in theater. As far back as 2003, Albert “Skip” Rizzo developed an VR program he called Bravemind to help vets with their PTSD from Iraq. Since then, it has grown and is used on more than 100 military bases as well as hospitals and other care facilities. And it’s getting results — after 10 sessions, a significant number of soldiers are reporting up to 80 percent relief from anxiety, stress and depression symptoms. Recently, after looking at the results in the U.S., Canada’s military has bought in and Denmark is also interested. And Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, along with the world famous Cleveland Clinic, has adopted the HoloLens to examine and autopsy bodies instead of using real cadavers. Apparently, dissection labs are getting very crowded and there are too few cadavers for too many students. Now med students can “work” on virtual cadavers and get an augmented look at a body’s various systems and organs. Also, Facebook’s founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg also envisions VR to create an entire new space for social networking. Winners, winners, chicken dinners As usual, in this fast moving technology, you can either buy into the end products and hope your company wins the day or you can buy the companies that sell equipment to the companies that sell to end users. I like the latter approach. That said, some of the top plays are the chip makers. And right now, I like Intel, Micron Technology and Western Digital. The latter two firms specialize in data storage, which is essential to modern tech equipment, whether you’re talking mobile phones or data farm servers. NAND and DRAM memory technologies are in a long-term demand upcycle and these players have a lot of headroom at this point. Intel has been shuffling along due to concerns over its ability to transition from its large share of the desktop and last generation computer market to the new sectors that are showing the next generation of growth. Intel is a big ship to turn, as the largest chip maker on Earth, but this is a good management team and they’re deploying resources to key strategic areas that should help the company in transition. It’s still a long-term gem. If I had to pick between VR and AR, I would say that AR is more attractive to me because you can do more with it — for now. It will be interesting to see what happens once Microsoft releases its HoloLens. Either way, both Facebook and Microsoft are great long-term picks in this space as well — GS Early This entry was posted in Financial Foresight. Bookmark the permalink.

Automakers have been breathlessly announcing self-driving cars they claim are five years or fewer away — or even earlier if you’re Tesla and Elon Musk. Just look, all the cool brands are doing it! They’ll delight us with their ability to somehow make traffic jams and crashes go away. We’ll all be able to tune in, turn on, and tune out, take a nap, network, and most importantly shop — all while the car whisks us without drama to our destination. Much of the latest news about the glorious, human-driverless future came during the recent annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. This year more than ever, automakers new and old used CES to crow about their coming autonomous breakthroughs and partnerships. Among the highlights: • Chrysler Portal Concept: Boasting a 250-mile range from its electrified powertrain, this crossover, based loosely on the Pacifica, boasts lidar laser radar and vehicle-to-infrastructure tech to enable it to “talk” to smart traffic lights and other enabled infrastructure. • Faraday Future FF 91: Another full-EV crossover, this one from the fledgling Chinese-owned brand, which Faraday says will be in production in 2018. Faraday claims it will be the world’s quickest SUV, with a 60-mph time of less than 2.4 seconds — when it isn’t driving you and using 3D lidar to help it see all that lies ahead. (Read more about it on page 18.) • Honda NeuV (New Electric Urban Vehicle): A tiny, urban runabout EV that uses artificial intelligence to gauge the driver’s behavior and make recommendations, and when not in use by its owner could be deployed as an autonomous ride-sharing vehicle. It also has a dash-width touchscreen interface and a killer skateboard to get you that last mile, if necessary. • Toyota Concept-i: This concept is also focused on artificial intelligence, and its team even created a personality called Yui to be your best artificial friend. The Concept-i’s mission is to make mobility tech fun to use. You can switch from autonomous to manual mode, and the car will let other vehicles know it. It also displays messages on a screen at the rear of the car to warn drivers of zombies or other obstacles ahead. Not every automaker brought a brand-new concept car to CES, but those who didn’t still made plenty of headlines. Hyundai had a couple of autonomous Ioniq sedans equipped with lidar making the rounds on a short route around the Las Vegas Convention Center. It also announced a deal with IT giant Cisco to create a connected-car platform to interface with infrastructure and other cars on the road. BMW, which has already formed a partnership with a couple of other major players in the IT world, Intel and Mobileye, says it will develop a fleet of 7 Series test models with autonomous tech that will be on the road by late this year. It also displayed what it called “the i Inside Future sculpture,” a vision of its interior of tomorrow with a tech it called HoloActive Touch, designed to change the way drivers interact with vehicle systems. Nissan detailed its future mobility strategy, boldly predicting it will achieve fatality- and emissions-free driving. One of the strategy’s pillars is its Seamless Autonomous Mobility system (SAM), which is based on elements of NASA software used to guide robotic vehicles. SAM enables a Nissan car to communicate with other cars, and it helps its artificial-intelligence tech navigate obstacles and other situations it hasn’t yet encountered. Mercedes-Benz made its future CASE (Connected, Autonomous, Shared & Service, Electric Drive) at CES and is determined to drive toward being a leader in all of those areas. Audi, which has been at the forefront of autonomous technology development, announced with its longtime IT partner NVIDIA that it will have vehicles equipped with advanced artificial intelligence on the road by 2020. If all of this vehicle connectivity, electrified powertrain, and AI madness has you intrigued, confused, scared, and skeptical, you are not alone. As this year’s CES proved, though, we are apparently approaching a turning point. There are major hurdles, of course, namely how messy the shift will be and how long it will take before autonomous vehicles truly rule the road, issues that Gill Pratt, CEO of the Toyota Research Institute, called out in his CES address. “Human nature, not surprisingly, remains one of our biggest concerns,” he said. “There are indications that many drivers may either under-trust or over-trust a system.” Pratt’s point is well taken because no matter how humans get around in the future, we will still be at the center of it all. And no amount of artificial intelligence is going to change that reality. Show more Mike Floyd, Editor-in-Chief Twitter Google Plus Email Articles from this author.

Fresh clashes leave four dead, 28 injured in IHK 28-Mar-17 370 SRINAGAR: Three civilians and ... There is a lot of talk and understandable handwringing about declining state revenues for higher education. The difficulty of finding funds for expansion, let alone maintenance, is often painful for college and university executives, as well as for many state leaders. But even amid cash-strapped state governments, creative solutions can be found to maximize resources. In my home state of Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey has found an intriguing approach to redirect a small amount of tax money for a large, long-term investment into the development of our three public universities and enhance their role as drivers of economic development and growth. Mr. Ducey intends to draw on some $30 million in annual state taxes - what are known as transaction privilege taxes paid by Arizona's three universities. With a matching amount from the schools serving as collateral, this can fund a billion-dollar bond for infrastructure construction and maintenance. At Arizona State University, for example, this makes it possible to expand the commitment to scientific and medical research and development, strategic partnerships and innovation. This includes the construction of three buildings: an interdisciplinary science and tech building for global work on sustainability, an anchor building for the university's biomedical campus, and a home for health care solutions involving ASU's major alliance with Mayo Clinic and its medical school. The faster this expansion happens, the sooner ASU can add to its research initiatives and burgeoning collection of homegrown, job-producing startups and spinouts. In the race for research dollars and the effort to drive scientific and technological breakthroughs, every dollar counts. That's why this kind of creative use of state money is so important. Rather than $30 million going into the general fund, it becomes a significant investment that can help expand the state's economy and drive innovation. Ultimately, the benefits accrue to both the state and far beyond. The history of America's technological triumphs has depended on the combination of public and private investment. At a federal level, we can trace the existence of time-sharing computers, microprocessors and the internet to investments made by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, better known as DARPA. Beginning in 1958 after the Soviets' launch of Sputnik, that federally funded research not only led to technologically advanced applications well beyond defense, it also spurred the success (and high-paying jobs) at Intel, IBM, HP and other top tech companies such as Microsoft and Dell. It can be argued that there would be no Google or Amazon or Facebook without DARPA and that national investment. Today we can identify states and universities that both recognize this tradition and are focused on innovation and knowledge enterprise that produces concrete, real-world impact. Some of our largest state governments spend hundreds of millions of dollars on R&D - more than $500 million by California, over $365 million by New York, $185 million by Texas and nearly $200 million by Florida in 2015. Smaller states generally can't compete with that scale. But it's not always a question of how many dollars are invested, rather how well-targeted those dollars are to yield genuine advances. Which brings us back to Arizona. Hard hit by the Great Recession, it has clawed back from a nearly $3 billion deficit in 2010 to a balanced budget. Mr. Ducey's unique approach to using the state's resources to support higher education and advance its competitive position is a model for other cash-starved states who also recognize that colleges and universities are critical catalysts to workforce development, economic growth and prosperity. Recently, a new ASU spinout was launched to produce a gene-sequencing technology that allows physicians to tailor and accelerate cancer treatments around patients' individual disease and immune responses, Emerging from the work of scientists at the university's Biodesign Institute, one of the state's largest investments in research, Gemneo Bioscience is the kind of enterprise that not only can be a driver of economic growth - it also can save lives. It's surely too early to estimate how many lives may be saved by other breakthroughs resulting from the state's investment in sophisticated R&D. But it's clear that it will take creative funding ideas to prove that investing in advanced research can be the difference between life and death.

Charlene Schmid, event manager for the show, started raising them three years ago at her farm Integrity Alpacas and Fiber in Vacaville. At the same time she began organizing the annual get-together for alpaca owners. “It didn’t make sense to have someone from North Carolina try to organize this,” she said. “So I volunteered.” The goal is to bring together breeders for an opportunity to get feedback on the quality of their animals’ fleece and to talk with others who might be able to help with breeding better animals for the future. “This is looking to help improve the breed’s fleece,” Schmid said. “With better fleece you get a better product.” The commercial industry is growing for alpaca fleece. “And we all would love to see it grow more,” Schmid said. Raising the animals is not Schmid’s full-time job. She only has 21 alpacas, but Dale Davis, of owner of Derwydd Alpacas out of Esparto, has made it into her career. Her mother, Jan Davis, began the Alpaca Classic in California in 1993 and the interest has grown ever since. While unable to attend the event Sunday, her daughter Dale carries on her legacy, showing their Suri and Huacaya aplacas. Dale Davis wasn’t going to raise alpacas, but her mother broke her leg and instead of attending San Jose University, Dale Davis stayed home and became a partner with her mother in 2001. Jan Davis lives with her on the ranch and does the books for the business but now uses a wheelchair for mobility. Dale Davis’ husband Alan Kyker helps, but his full-time job as a principal engineer at Intel is the bread and butter of their lives. “I don’t really make a lot, but I cover expenses,” Davis said. The animals have a complex language made of sounds and body movements. They live between 20 to 25 years and, Davis said, aren’t that difficult to raise. “You got parasites,” she said. “Internal and external.” The alpacas get sheered about once a year. Davis lets the animals’ coats grow just long enough that it doesn’t reach their knees. “Seventeen months of growth leaves it long.,” she said. “It’s good for hand spinning into yarn.” The fleece is not only used for clothing but has grown into a national business for carpet fibers in high-end flooring, upholstery for furniture and even insulation for homes. Participants in Sunday’s show love the industry and hope to see more people come to share their enthusiasm. “The future of the business is the babies,” Dale Davis said. “To be successful you want the children to be better than the parents.” Reach Susan Hiland at 427-6981 or [email protected] .

But their dispute over Israel's new public broadcaster put their promise on the back burner.

Emil Salman Analysis Netanyahu's government partners turn on him in opposition to early elections Finance Minister Kahlon tells TheMarker: 'I'm not afraid of Netanyahu firing me' Opinion Early elections are dumb, not dangerous, for Israel When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was still friends with Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon two weeks ago, they issued a joint announcement promising Israelis another round of tax cuts soon. Early elections were in the air, which was one reason both men were anxious to announce the good news. That was then, this is now. Early elections are still in the air, but the atmosphere has become poisonous, with the two men engaged in a tense standoff for the past week over the fate of the new public broadcasting corporation. On Sunday, they met to try to reach a compromise but as of press time had failed. Ironically the coalition crisis and the growing prospect of early elections has resulted in nothing being done to advance the plans for the tax cuts. The joint statement offered no details about which taxes would be trimmed or by how much – that was supposed to be decided in deliberations between Eli Groner, director general of the Prime Minister’s Office, and Shai Babad, his counterpart at the treasury. But sourses said the two have not met over the last two weeks and that no meetings are planned this week either. The planned tax cuts aren’t just a function of election economics: The Finance Ministry’s coffers are awash in tax revenues and Kahlon has been cutting taxes to give back some of the windfall to the taxpayers who paid it. There are good objective reasons for the growing tax take. Israel’s economy has been growing strongly, and is close to full employment. A surge of car-buying last year, which involves paying steep purchase taxes, helped boost collections as has a crackdown on the black market as a series of one-time events. Coincidentally, the biggest one-time event of all occurred the same day Netanyahu and Kahlon made known their tax-cut intentions: Intel announced it had agreed to buy the Israeli self-driving tech company Mobileye for $15.3 billion, which would spell a windfall of unexpected tax revenues that could reach as much as 6 billion shekels ($1.65 billion). Kahlon had been hesitant about unveiling any tax cuts until the treasury had seen all the data for the first quarter and could be sure that the steep 5.8 percent rise in collections in January-February was not going to fade away. But any doubts he had were quickly cast aside by news of the Mobileye deal. But apart from a foundation of a strong economy and Mobileye, another reason the treasury seems to be collecting so much tax is that officials have been low-balling their targets. This year, for instance, the official target for revenues is 294 billion shekels, a 3.8 percent increase over 2016. However, on average over the past 18 months, revenues have been rising at a 6 percent annual rate, which would add up to 300 billion shekels of revenues – 6 billion more than the official target. And that’s before Mobileye and the unusually strong collections in the first two months of the year (which are traditionally a slow time for the taxman). Netanyahu and Kahlon could have used the tax windfall to help pay down the national debt or step up spending on education, health and welfare, but they prefer lowering taxes. If they disagree, it’s only because Netanyahu gives top priority for cutting corporate income taxes while Kahlon opts for personal income taxes. Last week at TheMarker’s financial conference, Kahlon said he wanted to improve the payback for the lowest-income workers who qualify under Israel’s negative income tax program. In all events, Groner and Babad can’t begin their work until their two bosses settle their dispute over public broadcasting.

Holly Morgan (ARN) 27 March, 2017 10:20 - - - - print email Distributors Alloys Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Hills Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Sektor Synnex XiT Distribution Comments Ros Harvey - Founder and CEO, The Yield “I’m 52, I’m a woman and I’m not a technologist.” Perhaps not the most common opening lines of an elevator pitch ever heard, but for Ros Harvey, such diversity breeds ingenuity. In founding The Yield in 2014, Harvey is crafting a world-leader of intelligent solutions in agriculture, an industry ripe for the picking - quite literally - and primed for innovation. “I have an eclectic background and I sometimes describe myself as an unlikely entrepreneur,” admitted Harvey, who started the company from her kitchen in Hobart. “But I think that helps because whilst I love technology, it’s important to focus on the business problem you’re trying to solve. Technology is a business enabler.” When chatting to Harvey it’s clear that the story behind The Yield fits the typical start-up archetype. For agricultural tech – known as agtech for short - has gradually become a lucrative vertical for start-ups, start-ups entering a gigantic, traditional market that desperately craves new tools and fresh ways to succeed. During the past few years, the young and accelerating business has been rapidly revolutionising the local agricultural landscape, garnering worldwide attention in the process. As a leading agtech business, The Yield has won a major international award for innovation in agricultural technology, alongside an Internet of Things focused profile on BBC Future. Ros Harvey - Founder and CEO, The Yield Through “creating public good with private effort” - as Harvey explained - the vision behind The Yield is simple, feed the world without wrecking the planet. “My background in international development is littered with examples of people throwing money at problems and then the money dries up and it all collapses,” said Harvey, who founded the globally- recognised Better Work and Sense-T programs - both which have strong novel technology underpinnings. “The holy grail is to answer how we can build things with communities that really meet their needs. That’s what we focus on and we achieve that by using platform technology that we can use over and over again, at scale.” As a major agricultural producer and exporter, with over 325,000 employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing, agriculture and its closely related sectors earn in excess of $155 billion-a-year for around a 12 per cent share of GDP in Australia.

Specifically, Australian farmers and graziers own over 135,000 farms, covering 61 per cent of the country’s landmass. “Everything that happens on a farm, impacts the whole food value chain,” Harvey explained. “By working closely with customers and being able to stretch shelf life by one day, it’s worth millions across the food supply chain, and also reduces waste. “We named the business The Yield for a reason. If you can’t have that effect, then you don’t have a business. The name really reflects our values and the way we approach technology.” Ros Harvey - Founder and CEO, The Yield Underpinned by intelligence Read more Microsoft delays tools for third-party Cortana integrations Designed to improve yields and reduce customer risk, The Yield’s solutions are powered by reliable, accurate and trusted data, targeting the agriculture and aquaculture industries specifically. Leveraging key partnerships with Microsoft, Intel and Robert Bosch, the company uses both mobile and web applications, combining wireless sensor networks and localised data, before using data analytics to transform raw observations into value- adding information. Specifically, The Yield utilises Microsoft solutions via Azure, including IoT Suite, Microsoft Azure SQL Databases, Azure Data Storage and Azure Machine Learning and Analytics. “Part of what The Yield does is take away the hassle,” said Harvey, who previously worked at the International Labour Organisation in Geneva, Switzerland. “We provide an end-to-end service where we install our own hardware, service it, support it and make sure the data is curated. “We then analyse it, transform it through predictions and then it drives these simple interfaces. Our unique differentiator is that in working with weather data, we do it at a very microclimate level such as the farm itself, the field and the plant right down to the row. Read more Microsoft is playing Windows hardball “If we do our job well, we are almost like magicians. It’s like everything disappears and all people have to focus on is the app.” Whilst predictions and answers lie within the tech and the raw data itself, Harvey said that ultimately, the end solution for the industry as a whole, is underpinned by a commercial approach. “There is so much data out there and it’s important,” she explained. “But what is arguably more important, is understanding the business problem that you are trying to solve. “So we think about the decisions that are made on farms; when to plant, irrigate, feed, protect and harvest.

It is much more prevalent today than it was 10, 20 or 30 years ago. Hilbert does a better job than most but no one is perfect. My old school of thought and teaching was that accuracy showed professionalism, not to mention getting my ass chewed for making grammatical errors many times. I do still value accuracy but making minor mistakes in grammar doesn't affect professionalism IMO anymore. I laugh to myself everyday when I read or see grammatical errors. But I laugh not only at the error/author, but also at myself for being an old fart and saying, "the good ole days"! LOL So for a couple laughs now ; ) "There's not a day that goes by with something Ryzen." LOL @ Hilbert There's not a day that goes by without something Ryzen.

AMD didn’t provide a detailed report on the root cause, the company said that BIOS changes will be distributed to motherboard manufacturers to resolve the issue.  Customers are encouraged to keep an eye on their motherboard vendor’s website for an update, reports digital trends. We are aware of select instances where FMA code can result in a system hang,” the company said. “We have identified the root cause.” Ryzen processors reportedly cause a hard system lock when running certain FMA3 workloads. The first sign of trouble appeared in the open-source processor benchmark Flops (v2) by Alexander “Mystical” Yee. This simple program provides separate versions supporting specific processor architectures, such as Intel’s Haswell, Skylake, and so on.  But because the author has yet to upload a version for AMD’s new Zen architecture used in the Ryzen chips, the Haswell-specific binary is the version of choice for testing Ryzen … at least, for now. Using the Haswell binary is important because it supports the Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) microprocessor instruction set, which is also supported by AMD’s Ryzen processors. The short description of FMA is that the processor can compute A+BxC in one step before rounding the final result. The “unfused” method involves BxC first, rounding the number, adding that to A, and rounding the final result. However, Ryzen’s issue with FMA3 isn’t locked to the Flops benchmark. Simple apps with basic user privileges can crash a Ryzen-based machine. Even more, code using FMA3 could be executed on virtual machines running on AMD’s upcoming Zen-based “Naples” processors for the enterprise. Thus, finding the FMA3 issue in Flops now saved AMD and corporations from a lot of headache stemming from the security implications alone at the launch of Naples. “Don’t be fooled by the Haswell binary,” Yee said. “The benchmark is five years old and I’ve largely neglected it for the last three. So I haven’t updated it for Zen yet. Any processor will be able to run any of the binaries if it supports the underlying instruction sets. If it doesn’t, the program merely crashes with an ‘illegal instruction.’ Under no circumstances should a user-mode application be able to bring down an entire system.” Rate this story Rating: 1 ...

For some games, glitches are inevitable and people need to just chill out. Take Witcher 3 for example, which had a handful of glitches but they didn't ruin gameplay, they didn't make the game a laughingstock, and most (if not all) were eventually fixed. Sometimes, these kinds of glitches give a game character. Meanwhile, there are games like Sim City 2013, which punished players due to crappy servers. Or Assassins Creed Unity, which was riddled with game-ruining glitches. Or that Batman game (I forget which one) that was so unplayable for weeks that it was taken off Steam. Or GTA4, which was left with no performance optimizations and had memory leaks. These are things that are just plain unacceptable on release date. It gets you to question if they ever tested the game for more than 10 minutes on a PC weaker than whatever $2500 could buy you at the time of their release. Not to sound old-timey, but I miss the days where you bought a game and you got what you paid for. You bought a game that was well-tested and stable at release date, because patches just weren't viable. Of course, games were much simpler back when they were still shipped on CDs (not DVDs) and floppies, but, it was also much harder to get a wide-audience of test results before publishing too. It reminds me of the concept of authors who write their entire books on typewriter, because you are much more likely to do things right the first time around when you can't easily undo your mistakes. </rant> Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum.

But enrollment in UIC's computer science department has grown twice as fast as in Urbana-Champaign over the past five years. The latter is twice as big at 1,686 students. But there's no denying the boom at UIC. "We're bursting at the seams," says UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis. "We're fighting over closet space." U of I's board of trustees just gave final approval to build a $34 million building on Taylor Street for 50,000 square feet of ​ new labs and office space for the College of Engineering. It's the first new academic building on the main campus since 1991. The university has even bigger plans for computer science, which became the largest major in the College of Engineering this year and is the fastest-growing program on campus. Peter Nelson, the college's dean, wants to build a 168,000-square-foot home for computer science by 2021. Preliminary drawings are done, and he is working donors and alumni to raise $15 million for a building with an expected $68 million price tag. If he can get the new buildings, Nelson says UIC's engineering enrollment could grow to 6,500 from about 4,500 today. In 2005, the program had just 2,600; the first class of engineering graduates from UIC in 1968 totaled 75. "The demand is there," Nelson says. It's remarkable that UIC is talking about building anything, given the financial condition of the state, which has $13 billion in overdue bills and hasn't passed a complete budget in nearly two years. But the irresistible force that is demand for computer science talent is greater than the immovable object that is political gridlock. Nationally, undergraduate computer science enrollment more than tripled between 2006 and 2015, estimates the Computer Research Association. UIC's enrollment nearly quadrupled, rising by 292 percent, compared with a 20 percent gain in the school's overall student population. University of Chicago's computer science enrollment grew 643 percent, and Northwestern University grew 453 percent, though they have far fewer students than UIC. "We're at the right place at the right time," Amiridis says. The tech industry is exploding in Chicago as it is in other cities. And UIC is just across Interstate 290 from a fast-growing neighborhood that's home to Google and dozens of tech companies. Although Willis Tower looms over UIC's home on the West Side, the school is overshadowed by the flagship U of I campus in Urbana-Champaign, as well as Northwestern and U of C. "Whenever you say 'engineering,' everyone thinks Champaign," says Nancy Sullivan, CEO of Illinois Ventures, the U of I venture fund, who previously worked at Northwestern. "They do some great stuff at UIC. But they don't have the history and the legacy (of the flagship)." U of I in Urbana-Champaign is fifth-best among the computer science programs ranked by U.S. News & World Report. Northwestern and U of C tied for 34th on the U.S. News list; UIC is tied with University of Notre Dame at 60th. Nelson has to hustle for students. In 2013, the school launched a guaranteed paid internship program for incoming freshmen. Two-thirds of the internships are on-campus, but corporate employers include Google, Here, Nokia, ComEd, Amazon, Argonne, Microsoft, BMW, ITW, Intel, HP, PayPal and Zebra. "It's a big selling point," he says. Rohit Pasam, a UIC alum with a master's in bioengineering, has frequently tapped his alma mater for talent as he builds a security-software startup. "We have two top engineers from UIC on our team," says Pasam, co-founder and CEO of Xaptum. "We got amazing interns from UIC, who now work for top companies. They were hidden gems." Cybersecurity, as well as data mining and data visualization, are among UIC's strengths, along with its location. Philip Yu, who joined UIC in 2008 from IBM's Watson Research Lab, is a top expert in data mining. "Because of our location, we're able to hire better people than you'd expect, based on our ranking," Nelson says. "Our kids also want to study in an urban environment." Like most university administrators, he has a love-hate relationship with rankings but recognizes the reality that they matter to students, faculty and alumni. Nelson wants to one day become a Top 25 program, which is way beyond a stretch goal, given the glacial pace at which rankings change. The 54-year-old doesn't lack for ambition. A specialist in artificial intelligence who did his graduate work at Northwestern, Nelson joined UIC in 1988 and became head of computer science in 2001. He was named dean of engineering a decade ago. "He is a top-drawer guy," says Dennis Roberson, a computer science professor and former vice provost at Illinois Tech, which ranks 101st on the U.S. News list. "He also is absolutely driven to win." Nelson is quick to point out that UIC has an older, more diverse and less affluent student body than many of its peers. You won't find it near the top of anyone's list of party schools. (The Urbana-Champaign campus ranks No. 3; it was No. 1 in 2015.) Fifty-six percent of students are eligible for Pell grants, or need-based federal scholarships. At the Urbana campus, it's 22 percent. As tuition rates soar, that puts more pressure on students, but it also makes UIC more appealing. Transfers to UIC have doubled since 2009. "Our job is to provide students access to excellence," he says. "To maintain that access, we have to grow."... To see the full article, subscribe or log in.

On this week’s “NFV/SDN Reality Check,” we speak with Radisys on the connection between the telecommunication industry’s move towards a “5G” technology future and software efforts based on the central office re-architected as a data center design. The CORD project, which was formed by the Open Network Operating System in early 2015, is focused on accelerating the adoption of open source SDN and NFV solutions for service providers using open source platforms like ONOS, OpenStack, Docker and XOS. ONOS last year showcased various CORD use cases, including mobile CORD, which is said to integrate disaggregated and virtualized radio access network, evolved packet core and mobile edge computing to target “5G” technology moves. The project was recently folded into The Linux Foundation as an independent open source project, and was quickly followed up by the release of its first open reference implementation targeted at providing a single integrated solution platform for creating new customer services. The reference design is said to allow developers to autobuild CORD on a single node within one hour. CORD members include AT&T, China Unicom, Google, NTT Communications, SK Telecom, Comcast, CenturyLink and Verizon Communication; and vendor partners Ciena, Cisco, Fujitsu, Intel, NEC, Nokia, Radisys and Samsung. CenturyLink this week claimed a market first by using its own virtualized broadband network gateway to support broadband services using the CORD design as part of an ongoing transition of its central offices using network virtualization technology. The implementation includes the use of a CenturyLink software-defined networking access controller, which is based on an OpenDaylight-based controller stack, designed to integrate the operator’s legacy operating support systems and “latest generation orchestration platforms.” On this week’s show we spoke with Bryan Sadowski, VP of product at Radisys, to get insight into the connection between CORD and M-CORD work and the telecommunication industry’s march towards 5G technology. Thanks for watching this week’s show and make sure to check out our next “NFV/SDN Reality Check” when we speak with Sprint COO of Technology Guenther Ottendorfer on the carrier’s NFV and SDN plans.

And, then again, in a tweet, she reiterated that according to her “sources,” this claim was true: From my sources and what has been openly reported, it increasingly looks like #Flynn may have a deal with the FBI. #trumprussia pic.twitter.com/U0PHdexlFV — Juliette Kayyem (@juliettekayyem) March 25, 2017 Here’s where I’m troubled by this: I did some digging and could find no other “open reporting” which indicate that Kayyem’s statements are accurate. That’s a pretty bold claim. I’ve emailed Kayyem for further clarification about where she found this information and what “open reporting” she is referring to. I haven’t heard back from her. The only report that I could find was from Bill Palmer, who runs The Palmer Report. He also surmises that Flynn likely struck a deal with the FBI citing the fact that campaign advisor Carter Page, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, and former Trump aide Roger Stone have all agreed to speak with the U.S. House Intelligence Committee which is probing the Russia deal. Flynn is notably absent, which may be an indication he’s working with the feds, Palmer notes. The claim about Flynn might very well be true, but, unlike Kayyem, Palmer at least prefaces his piece, “I don’t have an inside source on this, just a pretty good gut feeling and some publicly known facts I can point to.” In a Facebook post over the weekend, Kayyem predictably started to back peddle on her comments saying, “Sources I have talked to in the field also are increasingly wondering the same thing.” Sources “wondering” (emphasis added) is a lot different than what she first said on CNN and Twitter on Friday. Kayyem continued in Saturday’s Facebook post with more back peddling: “I did not say on this segment that I have any confirmation that he is actually cooperating or that I have talked to anyone who does.” If she had no confirmation about this, why didn’t she say that on CNN and then on Twitter before lodging the accusation? What she did, instead, only fueled speculation. Her original tweet, which includes the CNN segment, was re-tweeted more than 8,000 times. It has not been deleted. To be clear, there is nothing wrong with speculating. Pundits do that all the time by saying things like “according to my experience, I believe Flynn is working with the feds.” But Kayyem took her claim a step further. This incident comes on the heels of another wildly irresponsible comment made by another pundit on another network. Earlier this month, Fox’s Judge Andrew Napolitano insinuated that Obama may have used British Intel to spy on Trump. President Trump used Napolitano’s words to bolster his claims that Obama had “tapped” his wires. This claim turned out not to be true. “Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command. He didn’t use the NSA, he didn’t use the FBI… he used the GCHQ,” Judge Napolitano said during an appearance earlier this month. Fox has since walked back these comments, and has even pulled him from the air. I emailed a spokesperson from CNN to see if they plan to stand by Kayyem’s reporting. They pointed me in the direction of her Facebook post on Saturday further “explaining” the situation. Admittedly, Kayyem’s original comments were a bit more nuanced than Napolitano’s words. But, her comments, nonetheless, left the impression to many that Flynn had struck some kind of deal with the feds, which would be a troubling blow for President Trump if true, and lend even further credence to the claim that there is truth behind the Russian connection rumors. In a world where the public is constantly confused by what is truth, what is hyperbole, what is punditry, and what is fake news, making speculative and bold claims should be done with the utmost care. I commend Kayyem for at least clarifying her statements on Facebook. Maybe CNN, where her words were broadcast out to hundreds of thousands, should do the same. In this politically charged climate, throwing accusations out there without much backing is troubling, no matter which side does it. This is an opinion piece.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ENTREPRENEUR Guest How Chinese-led globalization will impact tech Hagai Tal, Taptica March 26, 2017 8:35 AM Tags: China, Hagai Tal Image Credit: Mmaxer/Shutterstock The politics of protectionism are turning America inward at roughly the same moment high valuations have forced Chinese firms to seek profits abroad. From a macro perspective, globalization marches on, albeit with a different leader. But if Chinese firms will increasingly be at the center of a global economy, the nature of that market will certainly reflect the Chinese style – one that is noticeably distinct from the American and European styles of business. What will that development mean for tech firms outside of China? Pay attention to Beijing — and ask Chinese counterparts to interpret Late last year, the Chinese government placed strict controls on overseas investment. The stated reason for the shift in policy was to prop up domestic growth – a pressing concern given the fact that China’s 6.7 percent growth rate is the weakest annual economic growth the country has seen in 26 years. But if Chinese companies are seeking growth, changing the rules won’t necessarily spur domestic investment because Chinese firms already know that domestic investment won’t deliver the returns they need. So, what’s going on here? To be blunt, only the Chinese truly understand the dynamics at play between the private sector and government regulation in China. To some extent, that’s true for anyone trying to understand a foreign society, but China represents a special case because its political and economic system represents a hybrid that’s neither the Communist regime of the 20th century, nor a free market economy like what we expect in the West. Commenting on last year’s rule change, commerce minister Gao Hucheng said the government would “promote the healthy and orderly development of outbound investment and cooperation in 2017.” In other words, this isn’t about closing China off forever; it’s about finding new investment equilibrium. But where do Chinese authorities draw the line? Reading Chinese government statements only gets you so far. Speaking with Chinese business counterparts can shed a lot of light on government thinking. By their reckoning, restrictions on capital leaving the country are a reaction to the overseas investment boom of 2016. The message the Chinese government is sending isn’t exactly “no” so much as “not so fast,” and the expectation, at least in the Chinese business community, is that the clamp-down at the end of last year will begin to loosen sometime this summer. Expect Chinese investment, not management Chinese firms already have great tech. What they need right now are new revenue centers. That focus on the bottom line won’t mean much for things like synergy or integration, and because the target company is already making money, it’s hard to see a reason why Chinese investors would want to meddle with the underlying business operations. When restrictions on the outflow of capital are loosened, we’ll see deals that are about revenue and little else. Chinese-run holding companies will balloon in size, as if they’re on steroids. Meanwhile, the size of the Chinese investment will alter the overall market landscape in favor of tech companies that have revenue – a departure from a market driven by investors seeking disruption. What about innovation? Technology investments are often about the tradeoff between innovation and a return on that investment. Historically, at least in the U.S., investors have focused on innovation – a company with a good story to tell about disruption is the definition of a hot startup. But with a Chinese-led focus on revenue, the market will have to rethink the value proposition of innovation and the disruption that it brings. Airbnb, for example, was founded on a story about disrupting the hospitality industry by giving travelers an alternative to hotels that didn’t really exist in the past. But it took Airbnb nearly a decade to translate that disruption into a profitable business. What that means is that today’s Airbnb is attractive to Chinese investors because it’s profitable, but those same investors would likely look at the startup version of Airbnb with a lot of skepticism. Similarly, Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye wouldn’t make sense from a revenue perspective because that deal is about the long-term strategy of disrupting transportation through self-driving cars. Meanwhile, a startup like Waze probably wouldn’t have much value to a growth investor because Waze has little revenue potential, despite the fact that its technology represents a clear win for consumers. Add it all up and the focus on growth could mean missed business successes, missed strategic growth opportunities, and diminished innovation. In the near-term, the Chinese emphasis on revenue may inject a healthy dose of skepticism into the technology industry. In moderation, that can be a good thing. But if the primary focus in the market is about disciplined adherence to business fundamentals, there’s no room for the big idea, one so revolutionary that its value cannot be understood through the lens of the prevailing business paradigm. Making those kinds of ideas a reality is something the technology industry excels at because technology is about dreaming up a future that has not yet been written. At the moment, China has an opportunity to lead the global technology industry, but if that leadership is going to be sustainable, Chinese investors will have to start investing in ideas that promise to change the world.

Crawford surprised by Comey disclosure, ‘all options’ on table with North Korea Latest NewsTalk PoliticsVideo / Podcasts by Roby Brock (roby@talkbusiness.net) 2 days ago 367 views  Tags: FBI Director James Comey North Korea Rep. Rick Crawford 0 SHARES Share Tweet Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Jonesboro, said he was surprised when FBI director James Comey revealed to the House Intelligence Committee that an investigation of Trump ties to Russia had been underway since July. The First District Congressman also advocates a return to private hearings and he’s concerned that diplomatic and economic efforts have not deterred North Korean aggression. In a Talk Business & Politics interview, which also included Crawford’s explanation for his opposition to the Trump-Ryan healthcare plan, Crawford said he thinks the public setting for conducting House oversight is too limited. “While I think it’s important that the American people know that we’re engaged in this ongoing investigation in the House Intelligence Committee, as is the Senate, the FBI Director came out and he was authorized by the DOJ [Department of Justice] to acknowledge that they in fact were also conducting an investigation. I think that’s as far as we need to go in a public setting. Beyond that, I think we probably are not doing ourselves any favors in regard to how we pursue the facts,” he said. “Some of that stuff just needs to continue to be behind closed doors until such time as we arrive at a conclusion and we can disclose that at that point and time.” When asked if the FBI disclosure should have been made prior to the November election – as the Clinton email investigation was – Crawford said that was a Justice Department call. “I’m not sure that’s necessarily the best context there. I think if we’re talking about strictly Russian active measures in the election, that’s something that the DOJ had to make a legal determination on whether or not that could be disclosed,” Crawford said. “It wasn’t until that hearing on Monday when Director Comey came forward with that. I was quite frankly a little bit surprised that he was authorized by DOJ at that point and time to make that release and make that public, but he did.” Crawford is advocating for fewer public hearings at this time while the House Intelligence Committee conducts its work. He said Director Comey’s answers were largely “no comment” due to the public nature of the hearing. “That’s what happens in an open setting. We’re kind of limited to what we can share in an open forum. So I think we need to go back to that classified, secure platform then maybe we can get a little further along and create a little better dialogue and maybe expedite the investigation,” he said. Later in the week after the TB&P interview was conducted, Crawford released a statement about House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who has come under fire for discussing sensitive information with the White House involving the investigation. Crawford said Nunes’ moves “have not compromised the independence or bipartisan nature of the committee.” As a member of the House Intel panel, Crawford serves on the Emerging Threats subcommittee. When asked about potential concerns involving North Korean weapons and nuclear aggression, Crawford said “all options” should be examined. “I think certainly you have to make sure that our adversaries understand that all options are on the table at this point. North Korea’s a bad actor. I don’t want to characterize the entire North Korean population, but I do think it’s safe to say that the Kim Jong Un regime is very unhinged. I’m not sure that it’s in our interest to take military action off the table,” he said. “Secretary Tillerson is engaging in this, using whatever diplomatic means he can. But they don’t seem to really respond to diplomatic measures. They don’t seem to respond to sanctions. So we’ll see. It’s not my place to speculate, but I am highly concerned about what’s taking place in North Korea and how long Kim Jong Un can continue to subject his people to this kind of treatment and how, look even China is concerned about this and they consider China their ally. He’s really a threat to the region in more ways than one,” he continued. Watch Crawford’s full interview below.

DHS Official Claims Michael Flynn May Have Deal With FBI by Rachel Stockman | 9:33 am, March 26th, 2017   A CNN analyst made a pretty bold claim during a panel discussion on Friday night. Juliette Kayyem, a former Department of Homeland Security official in the Obama administration and a lecturer at Harvard University, said that from her sources, and what has been “openly reported,” it increasingly looks like Michael Flynn may have a deal with the FBI. FBI Director James Comey confirmed last week that his investigators are probing ties between Russia and Donald Trump’s campaign. In a CNN segment, Kayyem noted that former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, and former Trump aide Roger Stone have all agreed to speak with the U.S. House Intelligence Committee which is probing the Russia deal. “The name that is not mentioned is a name that I mention often on this show is the name Mike Flynn, the former national security advisor. It is starting to look like from my sources and from open reporting that Mike Flynn is the one that may have a deal with the FBI and that is why we haven’t heard from him for some time,” Kayyem said. From my sources and what has been openly reported, it increasingly looks like #Flynn may have a deal with the FBI. #trumprussia pic.twitter.com/U0PHdexlFV — Juliette Kayyem (@juliettekayyem) March 25, 2017 Flynn was fired by Trump as National Security Advisor after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of conversations he had with the Russian ambassador. The clip with Kayyem’s statements went viral over the weekend, and on Saturday night, Kayyen followed up with a Facebook post clarifying “I did not say on this segment that I have any confirmation that he is actually cooperating or that I have talked to anyone who does. My informed analysis of this case is based on my years of experience in the national security arena.” She wrote: There is a lot of attention today on the CNN segment last night. I, as have others in the national security field, have observed that former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn is potentially a key figure in the investigation; I have said so many times for many weeks. Last night, I noted that other Trump players named in recent stories have agreed to speak in front of the House Intel Committee and that Flynn has not. And I stated that it raises a question about whether he may have a deal with the FBI. Moreover, sources I have talked to in the field also are increasingly wondering the same thing. But, to be clear, I did not say on this segment that I have any confirmation that he is actually cooperating or that I have talked to anyone who does. My informed analysis of this case is based on my years of experience in the national security arena. A Flynn spokesperson declined to comment to The Daily Caller.  “I don’t have anything on that,” Flynn spokesman Price Floyd told the outlet.

This new 12C/24T chip will probably end up competing against the newly-rumored X390/X399 chipset for the higher-end Ryzen CPUs.     The new Ryzen 12C/24T processor was spotted inside of the Alienware Area 51-R3, and for comparison sake the Area 51-R2 features Intel's Core i7-6800/6850K. This isn't the server CPU processor, but it does sport a new socket - and a 3.2GHz Turbo clock, not bad for a 24-threaded CPU.

By Adam Davidson CreditIllustration by Tim Lahan On January 22, 1930, not quite three months after the stock-market crash and the ensuing economic collapse, the Times, in a front-page article, quoted President Herbert Hoover saying that “the tide of employment has changed in the right direction.” His Secretary of Labor, James J. Davis, citing reports on America’s industries, pronounced the country “well on the way to complete recovery.” Reading the article, Frances Perkins, the industrial commissioner of New York State, was horrified. She knew that the President was relying on data from the U.S. Employment Service, a notoriously inaccurate source, rather than from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which showed that huge numbers of people were being laid off. She imagined the psychological harm that Hoover’s words would inflict on the unemployed, writing in her memoir that she feared the jobless “would feel that there was something wrong with them personally. A great despair would enter their hearts.” Young people would “read the story and say, ‘Why doesn’t Papa work?’ ” Perkins called a press conference, prompting a national scandal about statistical methodology. Within a month, the Times was condemning Hoover’s misuse of data and praising Perkins (who went on to become Secretary of Labor under Franklin Roosevelt). The economist overseeing the unemployment numbers quit when he learned that the Administration also was trying to alter Bureau of Labor Statistics data to make them seem sunnier. Congress commissioned the development of objective employment data, and, since the nineteen-forties, two government data sets have been essential measures of the nation’s economic health. Those statistics have often played a role in politics. In good times—under Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton—the data have helped an incumbent win reëlection. In bad times—Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush—the data have contributed to defeat. Still, until Donald Trump, no major candidate or President had publicly challenged the validity of even the grimmest numbers. Throughout the campaign, Trump openly mocked employment data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis as “phony” and “totally fiction.” His tone changed when he wanted to take credit for a good jobs report. In March, Sean Spicer said at a press briefing that the President wanted to make clear that the unemployment rate “may have been phony in the past, but it’s very real now.” The White House press corps laughed, but, to government statisticians, the words sounded less like a joke and more like a threat. “When I saw that, I said, ‘Wow. You said the numbers were wrong,’ ” Kathleen Utgoff, who ran the B.L.S. under President George W. Bush, told me. “ ‘Now you are politicizing them.’ ” She said that she is “terrified” by the President’s willingness to declare the government data “very real” or fake news based solely on how they reflect on him. Utgoff isn’t afraid that the Trump Administration will meddle with statistical methodologies or the numbers they produce; that would require co-opting thousands of career government surveyors, statisticians, and economists in an effort to alter data collected from hundreds of thousands of businesses and citizens. (Even Richard Nixon, who, in 1971, hatched a plan to rid the B.L.S. of what he thought was a “Jewish cabal” out to destroy him, was unable to undercut the bureau’s independence.) Nor does anyone object to the reasonable arguments about which unemployment rate (there are six of them) best reflects the true state of the economy. The danger is that a President who disparages the data might convince his followers that bad economic news is political propaganda, and offer numbers that have no statistical rigor behind them. Good economic statistics benefit the left and the right, government and business. Without reliable data, businesses can’t take risks on investments. Boeing, for example, decides how many 787 Dreamliners to build and therefore how many people to employ based on its Current Market Outlook forecast, which is rooted in B.L.S. data and projects aircraft demand for the next twenty years. On a visit to a Boeing plant in South Carolina, in February, President Trump made his first major speech about employment. “We’re going to fight for every last American job,” he told the crowd, which had gathered in a hangar, in front of a new Dreamliner. Rhetoric and anecdote are Trump’s preferred jobs data. Last month, he claimed credit for a new Intel chip-manufacturing plant in Arizona “that will result in at least ten thousand American jobs.” In December, he celebrated a deal to keep around eight hundred jobs at a Carrier plant in Indiana. Trump didn’t point out other, less convenient facts—that Boeing was laying off thousands of American workers; that Intel’s plant had been announced in 2011, and would employ three thousand people, not ten thousand; and that Carrier was eliminating twenty-one hundred jobs in Indiana. Were Frances Perkins still alive, she would surely be thinking about those laid-off workers, who, hearing how Trump had saved their jobs, might see the failure in themselves and not in the Administration’s false promises. ♦ Adam Davidson is a staff writer at The New Yorker.

Mark Warner said. | Getty Warner, Schiff supportive of inquiry into Trump-Russia ties By Cristiano Lima 03/26/17 12:28 PM EDT Updated 03/26/17 04:25 PM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Sen. Mark Warner and Rep. Adam Schiff, the two top congressional Democratic leaders on government intelligence, on Sunday were supportive of calls for an independent commission to investigate ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. "I do think the events of this week call out the need for an independent commission quite separate and apart from what we do in Congress," said Schiff on CBS' "Face the Nation." Schiff first called for such a probe on Twitter on Saturday. Story Continued Below Warner echoed Schiff's call during a later appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press," while noting that creating such a commission would be an uphill battle politically. "Listen, if we could get an independent commission, I'm open to that," he said. "That means you've got to pass a bill, [and] the President's got to sign it." Warner and Schiff, the ranking Democrats on the Senate and House intelligence panels, respectively, were also heavily critical of House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes' handling of his panel's probe. Nunes has faced strong criticism for publicly announcing, without notifying his Democratic counterparts, that Trump transition officials were put under inadvertent surveillance following November's election — and briefing President Donald Trump and the White House on the subject. "I am totally mystified by what Mr. Nunes has said," Warner (D-Va.) said. "I think it's fairly mystifying, if not outrageous, that he’d make these claims, then goes down and briefs the White House. " Roger Stone: 'I have had no contacts or collusions with the Russians' By Cristiano Lima Following Nunes' press conference on Wednesday unveiling his claims of surveillance, Schiff (D-Calif.) accused the chairman of acting a "surrogate of the White House." “The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he is going to act as a surrogate of the White House, because he cannot do both,” Schiff said. On Sunday, Republican House Intelligence Committee member Trey Gowdy disputed Schiff and Warner's assessments of the events, however, arguing that Nunes had every right to brief the president on the surveillance intelligence because it was not germain to the Russia probe. "The chairman of House Intel briefed the commander-in-chief on something that has nothing to do with the Russia investigation," Gowdy (R-S.C.) said on "Face the Nation" on Sunday. "So if the commander-in-chief cannot be briefed by the chairperson of the House Intel Committee on a matter that has nothing to do with the FBI investigation, then I don't know what they can talk about. Nunes himself reportedly apologized Thursday "for not sharing information about the documents he saw with the minority before going public.” Morning Cybersecurity A daily briefing on politics and cybersecurity — weekday mornings, in your inbox.
