We are a bit puzzled as to what is going on with Intel these days, last year here in the Netherlands and well, many other spots in the EU, they cancelled all press-agencies and press contacts. E.g. sampling + info retrieving through Intel is gone. Now we get our info and samples through other ways then Intel these days, but it is indicative as to the why, how and what is going on with Intel. They just do not want to communicate with media anymore. This morning news reaches us that the yearly technology event IF, the Intel Developer Forum now is scrapped. here developers, media and analysts always have been briefed on new and upcoming technology.     "Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions." It seems and feels like Intel is shifting and stepping away from the processor industry. Ian from Anandtech got a response back from Intel: I just got off the phone with Intel, discussing why IDF is being cancelled. The main reason I was given is that Intel has been changing rapidly over the last two-to-three years, especially as they are changing from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. With the rise of AI, FPGAs, Optane, IoT, wireless comms, automotive, and the other new areas that Intel is moving into, Intel felt that IDF no longer fills the need when it comes to giving out information. As a result, the decision has been made to find new ways to communicate with the audience (media, developers and companies) and the ecosystem with targeted events. These will be like the recent AI Day or Manufacturing Day, or be connected to partner events, or involve separate geocentric events. So rather than have one big melee on everything, Intel is set to split its message across several different areas in the hope that it accurately digs deep enough into every area. I was told that Intel wants to find a better way to present the experiences in each of the fields, and this is the way to do that. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ...

I don't understand why they're taking this approach. I also don't see what suggests Intel is stepping away from the processor industry, and more importantly, why. That's like if Yamaha suddenly stopped making musical instruments and strictly focused on motorcycles - sure, they could do that, but they're losing a huge source of profit. I figure desktop and laptop CPUs (so, not including servers) alone make up more revenue than all of the other mentioned products combined: * Intel is not known for their AI; meanwhile, companies like Google and IBM (both of which produce their own processors) have made newsworthy AIs. * Intel recently acquired companies like Altera, which as far as I'm concerned, were doing fine without Intel. FPGAs generally aren't a big sellers. * Though I personally see the benefits of Optane, it doesn't seem to be very appealing to most people. * Intel is trying WAY too hard when it comes to IoT. ARM and Arduino platforms have generally been more appealing, due to costing less and being simpler to set up. * What was the last truly innovative and noteworthy wireless technology Intel released? Widi/Mirrorlink don't count - that's basically just a glorified Wifi + VNC. * Nvidia and other ARM brands are also way ahead when it comes to automotive. It just seems to me that if Intel really is shifting away from CPUs and toward these other things, they're going to doom themselves.

Intel is a Goliath with clay feet,unfortunately (Im looking,aswell,at M$$$).Big company,big money stock,but only few useful ideas. They need to broke in pieces to work at today's useful tech.They think too much in the past,because they dont have a visionary CEO.

They have to diversify, their market for PC's is not only saturated (they have what, like 90%+ marketshare?) but the PC market itself is dwindling and clearly charging more to increase profits just pisses everyone off. So what exactly do they do? How do they make money selling CPUs? People here love to say "well they could try increasing performance more than 5% each generation" or something - but for 90% of the market, more performance isn't even necessary. Like if Intel released a processor tomorrow that's 500% faster, I would upgrade 0 machines at my office, because no one here does anything that requires more than an i3. So yeah, they are behind in all this stuff - but if they don't start diversifying they die anyway. Nvidia recognized this as they were in the same boat. They had vast majority of GPU marketshare - the only way to increase revenue was to either charge customers more or utilize their products and find new avenues for revenue. They were just smart enough to get into the AI/Cars/Etc before anyone really realized how big of a market it was. Intel was too slow and now they are playing catch-up in a bunch of areas, but they don't really have a choice. schmidtbag Maha Guru Posts: 1442 Joined: 2012-11-10 #5421877 Posted on: 04/18/2017 04:12 PM Quote: Originally Posted by Denial They have to diversify because their market for PC's is not only saturated (they have what, like 90%+ marketshare?) but the PC market itself is dwindling and clearly charging more to increase profits just pisses everyone off.

I completely get what you're saying, but many people seem to forget that Intel still makes around $11 billion in net revenue per year. I'm sure almost all of that is coming from CPUs, SSDs, NICs, and motherboards. Note how none of those are the products Intel is changing their focus toward. If Intel sticks with what they're known for, they will still remain over-powered for many more years. They have the money to really make a difference, but instead they're either playing it safe, or, they're dumping all their money into markets where they're severely behind. There are plenty of tech markets out there that don't have much competition, yet Intel decides to join the ones that are very competitive, well-established, and don't yield much interest to either the general public or industries.

You're absolutely right - Intel isn't going to save themselves by continuously making faster CPUs. It's exactly that mentality why Intel is losing sight of what they should be doing - improving efficiency. We don't need faster CPUs anymore. We don't need more threads. What we need is to keep up the same performance while lowering the wattage. Intel is so blinded by "moar iz better!" that they had to drop out of the smartphone market. Their phone CPUs were over-complicated, over-powered, and were way too expensive. From what I recall, some had thermal problems too. Even AMD is putting more of an effort toward efficiency. As much as AMD is just a little ant that could be squished at the whim of Intel, I suspect they'll last longer as a company, because they're forced to adapt in order to stay afloat. Intel never needed to know how to do that, and these decisions they're making exemplify that.

Intel has spent close to 40 billion dollars in various acquisitions and market efforts with close to zero return.

'Turkey’s Intel Agency MİT Helped Jihadists Kidnap Foreigners In Syria.': Stockholm Center of Freedom. (Stockholmcf). A Turkish al-Qaeda militant who had been involved in kidnapping for a ransom to raise revenue for the radical armed group was saved by the government of Turkey’s autocratic President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who hushed up the probe, thwarted the trial hearings and eventually secured the release of all suspects from prison. The operative’s name is Orhan Yaşar, 43 year old (DOB: July 11, 1974) from the the Suruç district of Turkey’s southeastern province Şanlıurfa on Turkish Syrian border. He was involved in the scheme of kidnapping and later the release of Turkish photo-journalist Bünyamin Aygün of Milliyet daily from his captives in al-Qaeda affiliated armed group in Syria. Yaşar had been probed as part of the confidential investigation file No. 2012/1361 which was launched by the Office of the Public Prosecutor in the Eastern province Van in 2012. Yaşar was detained in a sweeping al-Qaeda operation on January 14, 2014 and formally arrested few days later. He and other suspects in the case were indicted on July 2014. But Yaşar was released pending a trial on the first hearing in the case by Van No.3 High Criminal Court on August 6, 2014.  The release of Yaşar did not make a sense at all given the fact one of the wiretap evidence in the case file revealed how he and his al-Qaeda cell leader was tipped off about the ongoing probe and planning to flee Turkey before police detained them on January 2014. Most likely the MİT learned about the police investigation file and passed that info to al-Qaeda suspects. As soon as the prosecutor was alerted by the investigators that suspects were made aware of the probe, he ordered their detention before they could have escaped the country. There are five wiretap recordings in the investigation file that revealed how Yaşar involved in abduction of foreign nationals by al-Qaeda affiliated Jihadist groups in Syria. The case file includes a wiretap recording that shows Yaşar was discussing the kidnapped Turkish photo-journalist Bünyamin Aygün, and Spanish correspondent Javier Espinosa and Spanish freelance photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova. Aygün was kidnapped on Nov.26, 2013 while Spanish journalists were kidnapped on Sept.16, 2013. Yaşar was urging his contact to locate these journalists, and ask for a ransom money from their families. “Without taking any [ransom] money, do not release him [Aygün],” Yaşar was recorded as saying according to the investigation file submitted to the court. All three journalists were eventually released from captivity but there was no mention of any ransom money was paid in exchange of their freedom. When asked about that, Aygün simply said he had no knowledge of such transaction. The interesting part of his kidnapping is that Turkish media reported that MİT teams helped secure his release and took him back to Turkey. The controversial charity group International Humanitarian Relief (IHH), accused by Russia at the UN Security Council for smuggling arms to rebels in Syria, was also involved in negotiations for Aygün’s release. In other words, while MİT had been helping Jihadists to organize kidnapping, ransom demanding and even killing hostages, it was also brokering the release of hostages to save the day and appear as a hero at the same time. If the MİT was helping Jihadist groups to arm, fund and resupply themselves as the evidence in the prosecutor’s confidential file suggests, it should not come as a surprise that these hostages were easily picked up from the hands of Jihadist groups.

Goldman Sachs believes that competition could take AMD down, but this Fool thinks otherwise. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Apr 19, 2017 at 7:53PM The yearlong run of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock came to a sudden halt last week after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on the semiconductor specialist with a sell rating and an $11 price target, compared to the $13 that it is trading for at the time of writing. Analyst Toshia Hari believes that the chipmaker has gotten ahead of itself after its terrific 390%-plus rally over the past year, as rivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) could knock the wind out of AMD's sails through discounted products. Hari's research note points out that AMD's market share won't improve dramatically with its new products as NVIDIA and Intel could cut prices of their chips to keep the former under pressure. The analyst wrote, "While we expect Intel and NVIDIA to remain disciplined on pricing, if necessary, both companies have the capacity to compete on price given significantly higher gross margins." Evidently, Hari's thesis is based on AMD's new products failing to do as well as expected because of competition from rivals. But this ignores the recent popularity of AMD's GPUs that has led to a turnaround in the companys market share in recent quarters, and that its latest products are reportedly delivering more performance for less money -- which could give the chipmaker an edge over NVIDIA and Intel. AMD's GPU market share is fast improving AMD has broken into NVIDIA's stronghold in the discrete graphics processing unit (GPU) market over the past year thanks to its focus on providing powerful graphics cards to gamers on a budget.

It is now going after NVIDIA in high-end graphics with its latest Vega GPU, and could possibly match NVIDIA's latest GTX 1080 Ti graphics card, if claims by an AMD executive (via The Inquirer) are to be believed. Though AMD hasn't released the tech specs and the pricing of the Vega GPU yet, it is expected to be in line with NVIDIA's $699 price for the 1080 Ti, with a price tag between $600 and $700. According to leaked information the Vega GPU is going to pack a lot of computing power, and is said to be two times faster than the NVIDIA Pascal X in deep-learning scenarios. If AMD undercuts NVIDIA's latest offering on pricing and delivers an identical performance, then it stands to gain more market share. AMD is going after Intel in server chips Intel has a vise-like grip over the server chip market, with a share of 99.3% in the third quarter of 2016. However, AMD is now going to try and hurt Intel's near-monopoly in this market with its Naples architecture. The Naples CPU for servers was previewed by AMD in early March and is claimed to carry 45% more cores and 122% more bandwidth memory than Intel's fastest Xeon server chip. AMD believes that the stronger specs allow Naples to perform at least twice as fast as the Intel offering in various seismic analysis scenarios, though independent benchmark tests will illustrate the real potential of these chips. Cisco forecasts that data centers will witness a 262% spike in traffic in 2020 from 2015 levels, processing 92% of the workload in the cloud. AMD's movement into the server-chip market is timely, as data center servers are going to need a lot of processing power. Image source: AMD.  Similarly, AMD is trying to challenge Intel's stronghold in the desktop CPU market with its Ryzen CPUs. As it turns out, AMD's flagship Ryzen 1800X CPU costs half as much as a comparable Intel Broadwell processor, which could make it the processor of choice for workstation users. Intel has recently lowered the price of its processors, indicating that it is scared of AMD's potential gains in the desktop CPU market. Goldman doesn't have much company Goldman Sachs' bearish outlook on AMD is not in line with the Wall Street consensus. Jefferies and Susquehanna have both raised their price targets on the semiconductor specialist in the past month, citing possible market share gains -- thanks to the growing adoption of its Ryzen chips -- that could drive incremental sales of $1.1 billion to $4.6 billion. Three analysts have raised their earnings projections for the current year and none have revised down. Investors, therefore, shouldn't get into panic-selling mode after the Goldman Sachs downgrade, as market share gains could boost AMD going forward.

Apple's iPad Fights For the Education Market Why Apple Should Eventually Build Family Service Robots View All Editorials → Why Apple Will Be Using Xeon CPUs in This Fall’s “Pro” iMac John Martellaro @jmartellaro 3 minute read Apr 19th, 2017 5:33 PM EDT | Analysis Recently, we learned that Apple may be seriously considering the use of a Xeon CPU in its so-called “server-grade” iMac planned for later this year. There are good technical reasons why the use of the Xeon has entered the discussion in what has traditionally been considered a consumer iMac—in contrast to the Mac Pro which has had Xeons all along. Image credit: Intel. Like may elements of society, personal computers are also falling into what’s called a bimodal distribution. Education is a case in point. The advent of inexpensive tablets (and Chromebooks) that can do most of what’s needed has left a gap in the middle price range. More advanced students, professors and researchers, however, need the computational and graphics power to do advanced work. There’s a pricing hole in the middle. Similarly, in professional circles, where Apple left a performance gap in its aging Mac lineup, other companies, notably, HP have moved in and catered to those pros with really powerful workhorse machines that have more memory, better memory bandwidth, and more computational punch. Apple appears to have become sensitive to this movement and the demands of the creative and technical professionals. See, for example: Apple’s Pro iMac to Compete with Microsoft Surface Studio Apple Throws a Mac Pro Hail Mary, Promises Redesigned Model Coming The Xeon Angle The technology, nomenclature and models of the various Xeon processors can quickly become complicated. I’m going to keep it at a high level and cite just a couple of sources. (Here are some additional technical details, as background, for the geeks.) I started with the idea that I’m seeing more and more references to Xeons in areas where it seemed that Core i5 and i7 dominated almost exclusively. It’s probably that bimodal trend. I asked Jim Christensen at HP about it, with the initial hunch that a Xeon is required for Error-correcting Code (ECC) Memory. He confirmed that and told me: The reason behind Xeon and ECC memory is for data integrity mainly. The combination provides server class data and calculation integrity that is not available in Core processors. Xeon processors also tend to have faster clock speeds. I got further confirmation directly from Intel. It’s not as if there’s been a dramatic reduction in Xeon prices or any new emphasis by Intel. Xeons have been around since 1998. Rather, the demands of professionals have meshed well with the entry-level E3-class Xeons. Stephen Gabriel at Intel told me: The Xeon E3-1200 series targets entry level workstations that focus on more performance, more memory, professional VR, graphics rendering, video production, greater memory bandwidth. This is why, for example, there is an option for the E3-1200 V5 in the HP Z2 Mini entry-level workstation that I recently reviewed. The E3 supports only one processor with multiple cores. Some Xeon Advantages In general, then, here are some reasons to select a Xeon CPU, the E3 class, in preference to a Core i7.  Briefly and not exhaustively, It supports ECC Memory. It generally supports higher clock rates. But that means more heat. Tech professionals accept that. Computational power beats “thin.” The memory bandwidth is greater. It can access more memory than the Core series, typically 64 GB. The “Pro” iMac Apple was evidently taken aback by the Microsoft Surface Studio announced last October. In parallel, HP has been working on some very serious Z notebooks and workstations that appeal strongly to professionals. If my email is a glimmer, Apple has come under strong pressure from those creative and technical professionals: “Give us the power we need, or we’ll look elsewhere.” Accordingly, the article I cited above suggests that this fall’s “pro” iMac will have a Xeon E3-1285 v6. The Xeon E5, E7 For clarification, there are three levels of Xeons. I’ve mentioned the entry-level E3 above. The E5 is a mid-range system for high-end desktop workstations. These Xeons don’t have integrated graphics, and so they’re geared towards a partnership with a very high end GPU. A familiar example is the 2013 Mac Pro with its E5-1620 v2 (and AMD FirePro GPUs) that supports multiple processors, each with multiple cores. (The FirePro was strong in 2013, not so much now.) And so, we can likely expect the 2018 Mac Pro that Apple recently talked about to have an E5-class CPU and very powerful discrete graphics. The E7-class Xeon is used primarily in very high-end server farms in data centers. You won’t see one in your Mac any time soon. Summary Technical and creative professionals need extreme silicon quality and stability, high memory bandwidth, lots of RAM and ECC memory for mission critical uses. If Apple is going to regain the trust and admiration of technical professionals who want to use 5K (8K?) iMacs for high end CAD, graphics, professional VR, video production, and scientific computation, then it’s a very natural thing to move to the E3-class Xeons. For those who need even more power and the benefits of their own specialty displays, the (presumed) 2018 Mac Pro with E5-class Xeons and massively capable graphics can carry an even higher load. All in all, it appears as if Apple is back on the Mac extreme power bandwagon, and it’s very welcome indeed. _____________________ Jim Tanous helped with some aspects of this article.

Two factual errors in this article: 1. Xeons are made of higher quality silicon. Not true. They are made from the same bins as the Core series. As a system builder who has sent out thousands of systems, I have only seen two CPUs come back that went bad… and one of them was a Xeon. 2. Xeons tend to have higher clock speeds. Not true. The Core K-series chip have higher clock speeds and lead all CPUs in single thread performance. Xeons tend to be clocked lower, especially since they also tend to have higher core counts than the Core series. That latter point is where they outperform Core series chips, in multi-threaded performance. There are only two reasons why Apple would go with Xeons for the iMac: 1. ECC memory – a dubious benefit to the average iMac buyer, who is a prosumer that does not often do mission critical work. 2. Branding, by which to charge more money for a system with a chip that is only marginally more reliable (by virtue of ECC memory) than a Core chip.

Users who purchase a new CPU and are running older Windows versions, including the popular Windows 7 which powers about 50% of all computers, would normally be required to update to Windows 10. Thanks to a developer called zeffy it’s now possible to run a script that patches Windows 7 and/or Windows 8.1 can also be run on Kaby Lake and AMD Ryzen CPUs. Microsoft has added code to Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. that checks whether the system runs on a ‘supported CPU’ during Windows Update. The patch from zeffy will make sure that this check always returns ‘true’ . The developer warns that his patch “will not magically make updates work that are truly incompatible with next-gen CPUs”, and thus that Microsoft could eventually block his patch method.

Heralded as the 'Next Unit of Computing,' the ultra-small form factor was designed to revolutionise the traditional PC with a footprint and performance level that appealed to the masses. Fast forward half-a-decade and the NUC hasn't really taken off, with price serving as the most obvious obstacle. The majority of NUC-like machines are today sold as barebone solutions, so when you add the memory, storage and operating system, cost tends to exceed that of a modern laptop. Can a fully-equipped model breathe new life into the flagging form factor? MSI reckons so, and is hoping to score a hit with its latest-generation mini-PC, the Cubi 2. Priced at £450 and designed to work right out of the box with no additional hardware, this itty-bitty machine requires no configuration and seems ideal for anyone needing a quick and easy replacement for a traditional tower. First impressions are positive. The size of Intel's original NUC was wonderfully cute, and the Cubi 2 is no exception. Dimensions of just 115.2mm x 112.2mm x 32.6mm allow it live happily on top of a desk or bookshelf, and MSI's matte-white finish is sleek and modern. In person it's a good-looking piece of kit and, despite its size, there are ample connectivity options. The front of the unit is lined with USB 3.1, USB 3.1 Type-C and a pair of audio jacks. There's a neat backlit power button lining the top edge, then around back you'll find a connector for the small, external 65W power supply, HDMI and mini-DisplayPort outputs, Gigabit Ethernet and two USB 3.0 ports. Everything a mini PC needs? Well, not quite, as the HDMI output is of the 1.4 variety, and without support for the newer 2.0 standard, the Cubi 2 can't drive a 4K60 resolution without relying on DisplayPort. An unfortunate limitation, as the size of the machine makes it an ideal companion for a big-screen TV. What Cubi 2 does well is take the guesswork out of buying a NUC-like PC. These systems have traditionally been sold as barebone solutions, and usually in a choice of sizes depending on storage requirements. Taking a different tack, MSI's unit includes a hard-disk-compatible baseplate as part of the bundle - if you do want to add a 2.5in drive, simply unscrew the existing cover and swap it for the cover lined with a drive tray. Doing so will increase the height of the PC from 32.6mm to 42.7mm, but it's a handy option to have. All of the SATA cables and screws required to add a 2.5in drive are included, as is a VESA mounting bracket, should you choose to attach the PC to the rear of a compatible display. Those of you who are already planning modifications should note that the M.2 slot is limited to 2242 - MSI hasn't made room for the more common 2280 standard - and, while the system is clearly designed with upgrades in mind, opening the Cubi 2 will break a sticker that claims to void the warranty. If that all sounds too complicated, fear not, the Cubi 2 doesn't need to be opened at all and can be used straight out of the box. By default, the £450 model comes equipped with an Intel Core i3-7100U processor, 4GB (1x4GB) of DDR4 memory and a 128GB M.2 SSD loaded with Windows 10 and a small amount of unwanted bloatware. We aren't talking ground-breaking stuff here, yet while the memory and storage can be upgraded, out-the-box performance should be sufficient for everyday computing. Browsing the rest of the miniscule motherboard doesn't reveal any major surprises. Underneath the SSD there's a basic 1x1 Intel Wireless-AC 3168 WiFi adapter, and if you flip the motherboard over you'll find a small fan tasked with cooling the 15W CPU and venting hot air out the back of the chassis. Intel's latest-generation Core i3 processor is ultimately what shapes this PC. The ultra-low-power part offers two cores, hyper-threading and integrated HD 620 graphics, but frequency is limited to a modest 2.4GHz. It should, you would think, be a low-cost solution, but Intel's recommended customer price is a whopping $281. Yes, that is more than a six-core, 12-thread AMD Ryzen 5 1600X, and CPU pricing alone will prevent Cubi 2 from offering genuine mainstream appeal. Eager to see exactly how the seventh-gen Core i3 performs? Let's move on to some benchmarks.

Rumor: Intel puts the pedal to the metal on its HEDT refresh by Wayne Manion  12:00 PM on April 19, 2017 The notorious rumor mongers at Digitimes report that Intel is planning to move several upcoming releases foward. The first rumor concerns the release date of the rumored Basin Falls high-end desktop (HEDT) platform, the accompanying Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs, the X299 chipset, and the rumored LGA 2066 socket. According to "Taiwan-based PC vendors,"  Basin Falls' premiere is moving from the end of July to a release date during the Computex trade show at the end of May. This news comes just days after rumors that the same launch was being moved from late July to late June. For those who don't follow the minutiae of Intel's ever-shifting codename structure, Skylake-X is expected to be the Skylake incarnation of Intel's long-running HEDT series of chips, which have traditionally born the '-E' suffix. Skylake-X CPUs are rumored to pack six, eight, or ten CPU cores and a quad-channel memory controller inside packages with at least 2000 pads. These chips are the natural successors to Broadwell-E models like the $1650, 10-core Core i7-6950X. The nature of Kaby Lake-X is not quite as well understood, but rumors suggest these chips will be quad core processors with dual-channel memory controllers that fit into the same motherboards as the Skylake-X chips. The advantage of these processors over standard-issue desktop Kaby Lake chips like the Core i7-7700K may be limited to higher clock speeds allowed by more aggressive TDPs, as well as any feature advantages inherent to the X299 motherboard chipset. In news that could affect a larger part of our audience, the rumor mill is also churning out speculation that Intel's Coffee Lake mainstream chips' release is being moved forward from January 2018 to August 2017. Coffee Lake is widely expected to be another subtle refinement of Intel's 14-nm architecture, similar to the relatively small changes observed in the Skylake to Kaby Lake transition. Some speculate that top-of-the-line Coffee Lake processors may sport six CPU cores. This would represent the first time that Intel has increased the core count of its mainstream processors since the 2008 release of the first Core 2 Quad processors. The rumor mongers speculate that Intel is quickening its cadence as a response to AMD's renewed competitiveness in the realm of high-performance desktop CPUs with its existing Ryzen R5 and R7 lineups, the coming Ryzen R3 chips, and the rumored 16-core models and accompanying X399 motherboard chipset. The move could also be somehow related to Intel's cancellation of the Intel Developer Forum conference. Tags: CPUs Chipsets Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Evidence of a renewed vigour is provided by the source which says that the Basin Falls platform will arrive in time for Computex (three months earlier than previously indicated), and Coffee Lake products will arrive in summer 2017, rather than early next year. Considering the industry rumours chronologically, DigiTimes says that Intel will unveil its Basin Falls platform at Computex 2017. This key PC tech show takes place spanning the end of May and the beginning of June. Basin Falls consists of the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors, and the X299 chipset. According to the source report Skylake X will consist of three 140W processors with 6-, 8- and 10-core architectures, followed up in December by a 12-core processor. A little later, at the E3 gaming show, also in June, Intel will actually launch the Basin Falls platform, says the source. These dates are approximately three months earlier than Intel had previously signalled that the launch would go ahead. Intel's 14nm Coffee Lake architecture is also said to be moving forward with regard to its scheduled release date. Rather than adhere to its planned January 2018 launch for Coffee Lake Intel is going to push for an August launch of the new processor series. The rollout will begin in August, say the Taiwanese industry sources, with several K-series Core i7/i5/i3 processors and accompanying Z370 chipsets. In the months following Intel will roll out more CPUs plus chipsets such as H370, B360 and H310 versions. Offered as evidence for the accelerated rollout the DigiTimes report says Intel has bolstered its manufacturing capacity and capability with five new EUV machine sets from ASML. Of course AMD has plans to move ahead with faster and more powerful Ryzen chips. The previously rumoured 16-core Ryzen processor(s) and X399 platform will launch to eager enthusiasts in Q3 this year, according to the Taiwanese report.

Register today! Posted by fynxer - Wed 19 Apr 2017 15:49 Finally some real pressure on Intel, thanks to AMD we can once again enjoy faster development and eventually better prices. The last few years we have only seen like 5-10% increase in real world performance with each generation from Intel, just recently Intel suddenly flagged that Canon Lake would have an 40% increase in performance. This confirms that Intel has been holding back immensely to milk its customers with the same old every year. The coming years will be interesting, we will now get to know how much Intel really has been holding back the last five years. Posted by marshalex - Wed 19 Apr 2017 15:55 What's the point of stepping up the schedules? Unless the new chip performance is going to be drastically improved surely just applying some discounts to the existing product sets would suffice for the time being? Whilst Ryzen has put AMD back in the game if Intel wanted to stay ahead a price reduction now would keep them in pole position due to the single thread performance Posted by Bagpuss - Wed 19 Apr 2017 16:06 marshalex What's the point of stepping up the schedules? Unless the new chip performance is going to be drastically improved Well Intel have gone on record as saying Coffee Lake will be 15% faster than Kaby Lake in terms of single core IPC, which would give it a combined 20-25% lead over Ryzens single core IPC performance. Which would be a significant gap especially in the all important gaming benchmarks. Posted by fynxer - Wed 19 Apr 2017 16:20 marshalex What's the point of stepping up the schedules? Unless the new chip performance is going to be drastically improved surely just applying some discounts to the existing product sets would suffice for the time being? Whilst Ryzen has put AMD back in the game if Intel wanted to stay ahead a price reduction now would keep them in pole position due to the single thread performance Lowering prices is only a temp fix which Intel wants to avoid so they can keep profits up, they do not want to ignite an all out price war. Intel also knows Ryzen is only the beginning and with AMD working hard at optimizing every aspect of the Zen 2 architecture and already on it's way to release 16 core HEDT platform Intel is feeling the heat for real. They have been holding back development for years now and if they do not start to accelerate and do some catching up they will find them self in AMDs rear view mirror end of next year.

Which would be a significant gap especially in the all important gaming benchmarks. Surely it would depend on the cost of such improvements? AMD have shown they can get nearly there whilst keeping costs low. If Intel come back with here's the best get your wallet out whats the point.

According to The Register, Trish Damkroger, Intel’s Vice President and General Manager for Technical Computing Initiative sent an email this week to partners and customers confirming the change. Damkroger said: “Starting today, Intel will contribute all Lustre features and enhancements to the open source community. This will mean that we will no longer provide Intel-branded releases of Lustre, and instead align our efforts and support around the community release. “These changes are designed to increase Intel’s involvement in the community and to accelerate technical innovation in Lustre. For the community as a whole this will mean easier access to the latest stable Lustre releases and an acceleration of the technical roadmap.” Intel offers three of its Lustre editions, which include Enterprise, Foundation and Cloud. Each of the editions all includes unique offerings.

Lastly, the Cloud Edition provides maximised storage performance and cost-effectiveness with Intel’s cloud solution. This will now become the Community Edition, which will still gain input from Intel based on individual releases. “Intel will be heavily involved in producing the Lustre community releases and expects there to be the same high level of quality that customers have come to expect from the Intel-branded releases. “Furthermore, Intel will be publishing community maintenance releases for a designated Long Term Stable (LTS) release so that users can easily access an up to date ‘latest and greatest,’” said Damkroger. This LTS release Intel talks of will be offered as Lustre 2.10, due to be released in May 2017. The company is also expected to continue its support for Lustre.   Tags Cloud Community Enterprise File hosting Intel Lustre Previous ArticleSnap World Lenses bring AR Snapchat Filters into the real world Next ArticleFacebook Spaces – Zuckerberg’s $2bn Oculus buy finally pays off Most read Red Hat brings legacy apps back to the future with Kubernetes James Nunns 13th April 2017 Cloud wars: Oracle CEO plans to beat AWS without as many data centres Hannah Williams 13th April 2017 Accenture claims to be the biggest user of cloud & Office 365 in the world Byomakesh Biswal 12th April 2017 Over a quarter would trust robots over doctors with heart surgery Ellie Burns 11th April 2017 What went Wonga?

Intel has been winning for far too long, and within weeks of AMD's launch of the Ryzen CPU family - now available in Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5, Intel has reacted in multiple ways. The 52% IPC improvement in the Zen architecture must have taken Intel by surprise, with some amazing value for money in the Ryzen 7 1800X as it's a 8C/16T part on the cheap.     First, were the rumors of the next-gen X299 platform - and then the news of the weirdly-placed Core i7-7740K, a HEDT part on LGA2011, but with 4C/8T. Intel launching an 8-threaded CPU, a little faster than the much cheaper LGA1151-based Core i7-7700K, but on the more expensive LGA2011 platform, strange. Then the news of Intel cancelling its IDF (Intel Developer Forum) convention, after nearly 20 years in operation. IDF17 was cancelled in the process.   Now there is news that continues this strange Bizarro world that we're living in, with Team Blue now rumored to be bringing the launch of its Basin Falls platform by two months, with the new family bringing us the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors. The new Basin Falls platform will arrive with the new X299 chipset, while the 'accelerated launch' of the next-gen Coffee Lake architecture is reportedly primed for an August 2017 release, pulled up 5 months from January 2018.   I think Intel is definitely acting differently since the launch of Ryzen, and that a big show at Computex 2017 next month will be an interesting time, if the once almost too confident Intel is pushed in to a corner. It'll only see them drop prices and compete in a way we have probably never seen before from the company, and now that AMD has shown us some massive IPC improvements from Ryzen, AMD are only going to fight back with 12C/24T, 16C/32T at a rumored $999, and even 32C/64T variants of its next-gen processors.   We're in for the wildest ride in consumer technology in a very long time, and it is beyond exciting.

clock menu more-arrow The Memomi digital mirror. Photo: Memomi Tech Tackles the Fitting Room Smart dressing rooms and digital mirrors are coming to make trying stuff on less of a hassle. by Poornima Apte Apr 19, 2017, 9:32am EDT tweet share pin You’re out shopping and you’ve spotted a dress you like. You wander on over to the fitting room to try it on — only to find that it doesn’t quite fit. What do you do now? Will you slip into your old clothes, get back out there on the floor, pick the right size, and try it on again? Michelle Tinsley, director of mobility and secure payments in the retail solutions division at Intel, predicts that unless you’re really in love with that dress, those chances are pretty slim. The numbers back her up. Intel’s internal research found that a whopping 73 percent of the time, consumers browse online but then buy in store. “When you take that effort, you go into the store, you actually want to complete [the transaction], so you’re going to be irritated or mad if you drove all the way to the store only to be forced back online,” Tinsley says. “We found that people only go into a dressing room once and get undressed once. If they can’t get the right size and the right fit and they leave the dressing room, it’s very hard to get them to go back into the dressing room a second time.” This, for retailers, is a problem — one they’re increasingly looking to solve with technology. “We found that people only go into a dressing room once and get undressed once... it’s very hard to get them to go back into the dressing room a second time.” Sure, there are fitting rooms with call buttons you can push for sales help, but even such solutions are not the fix that many are looking for. Enter: the smart fitting room. When you walk into the fitting room of the future, Tinsley explains, expect to see a mirror that will recognize the dress you bring in. The mirror will display your item, overlaying it on the screen, which would work almost like a virtual dashboard. If the dress doesn’t fit, make a request on the mirror’s interactive display for a different size or even a different color. When you do so, the sales associate on the floor will be alerted: “Nancy’s in dressing room three, she needs a size up in this dress, in this color; bring it to her now.” Even better, that call to action is moved up the queue to become the highest-priority task for the associate. The result? A new size delivered to you while you’re still likely to try it on. How does this work? Essentially, that dress you bring into the smart fitting room is fitted with what is known as an RFID (radio-frequency identification) tag. An RFID tag reader in the fitting room scans this tag, much like a barcode. Coded into the tag is a whole host of variables, including colors and sizes, which is why the mirror shows you not just the size you picked but all the additional sizes and colors you can choose from in the store.

While these solutions are still being worked on so they can be scaled up and deployed on a large scale, luxury-space retailers like Neiman Marcus have tactics implemented today that are improving the customer experience in fitting rooms and on the store floor. How many times have you shared a dressing room selfie with friends to get their opinions? Now, says Scott Emmons, head of Neiman Marcus’s Innovation Lab, there is a better way. With a push of a button, a smart digital mirror in a Neiman Marcus fitting room can record how you look with a 360-degree view. No more awkward questions to ask about how your... cough... derriere looks in an outfit — simply check out the video and see for yourself. You can also use this mirror to record multiple try-ons of an outfit and then stack them alongside each other to see which one you like best. Neiman Marcus uses proprietary technology from tech company Memomi for its digital mirrors. Also possible: Try on a red dress and it shows up in the mirror as another available color — green, for instance. This magic is made possible by the power of augmented reality, which essentially superimposes data on an existing model. In this case, the color green would be transposed on the image of the dress you’re wearing to make it look green. Neiman Marcus is gradually leveraging Memomi’s digital-mirror technology in additional ways. Looking to try on sunglasses? Especially if you’re a prescription glasses wearer, that can be a challenge: After all, how can you tell how you look in something if you don’t have your glasses on? Neiman Marcus’s countertop version of the digital mirror records your reflection in various sunglasses and plays them back so you can pick the one you like best. Essentially, it’s a series of selfies, but all stacked next to each other so you can compare and contrast. Makeup stations at Neiman are also using these digital mirrors to record applications upon customer request. If you choose to, artists can now record a makeup tutorial on the digital mirror, even breaking it down into segments — cheeks, eyes, etc. — and email you the recording to refer to at home. Tinsley sees three important technologies as converging to enhance your in-store experience even further: RFID tags and readers, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence as applied to big data. Michelle Bacharach leverages this convergence to solve a common question you might have when you shop: “How do I wear this?” Bacharach is the CEO of FindMine, a New York-based high-tech venture that essentially uses machine-learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to address this dilemma. FindMine is currently used by luxury menswear retailer John Varvatos for its e-commerce platform, and Bacharach says the technology is ripe for expansion to major retailers all over the United States. FindMine is, in essence, a personal shopper. How would this play out in the store? You’ll be able to interact with a touchscreen display on the shop floor for personalized recommendations, or a sales associate might have this information in a tablet, ready to share. A makeup mirror at Neiman Marcus. Photo: Neiman Marcus Place an RFID tag on a garment and you can take it one step further. That smart fitting room can be fitted with a digital screen that lights up and recognizes the blazer you walk in with. To the right, you’ll be presented with an option to “complete the look.” If you press it, the screen shows you shoes, a dress, jewelry, and a scarf that complement your blazer. The options, Bacharach says, will be curated. You can pick the one you want (just swipe right for more choices) and have the entire ensemble — from blazer to scarf to blouse and more — delivered to your fitting room. Such recommendations are powered by big-data analytics and artificial intelligence. FindMine incorporates a whole slew of parameters from a particular retailer — including the entire product catalog — and analyzes it by color, pattern, titles, description, price, gender, and more. These parameters are supplied by the retailer, and FindMine uses its internal expertise to suggest additional ones. The final set of processing parameters has the retailer’s blessing. Image processing plays a key role in creating look books that retailers want to present. There’s a lot of artificial intelligence and big-data crunching that happens behind the scenes to deliver those options to you. “We use artificial intelligence, we have analytics, but those are a means to an end,” Bacharach says. “The end that we’re trying to serve is really just to help the retailer give the shopper [more of] what they need.” The end result is what is increasingly being labeled as a “frictionless” shopping experience. “There’s a very small subset of the population that really enjoys geeking out on that sort of thing, but I think the rest of us really want to just get what we need and move on with our lives.” There are a fair number of styling apps and startups — such as ClosetSpace, My Dressing, and Stylebook — inspired by the personal-shopping model. But, Bacharach says, the process is usually cumbersome. “You have to fill out a style profile and take a quiz and pick 10 celebrities whose style resonates with you, take a picture of everything in your closet... you have to do all this work,” she says. “There’s a very small subset of the population that really enjoys geeking out on that sort of thing, but I think the rest of us really want to just get what we need and move on with our lives. Shopping is a means to an end for me; it’s not the end in itself.” Using the retail buzzword du jour, “frictionless” is what Bacharach is looking for — and she’s betting you are too. Andy Hobsbawm, co-founder and chief marketing officer at Evrythng, a tech company that manages data from smart products, says that you, the customer, controls the extent of your interaction with these technologies. “It would be insane for any brand to do anything with the data without your permission and without explaining to you what they’re doing,” he says. If you do give your permission, you’re essentially buying into a value proposition: Do you want that video recording of the makeup application or a series of dress tryouts enough to share your email address so it can be emailed to you? You, as the customer, have to agree to the recording first and activate it, either through a sales associate — in the case of the makeup application — or with a mere push of a button. Most consumers, retailers are betting, will shake on the deal. As shoppers become fluent in the language of e-commerce, they’re looking for more retail theater and expect the ease of online shopping to translate to the in-store experience, industry experts say. A Memomi mirror in-store. Photo: Memomi Bill Toney, vice president of global RFID market development with Avery Dennison, a technology company that provides RFID solutions, predicts you’ll increasingly see seamless “omnichannel” transactions. “How do you make the in-store experience as convenient as buying online, and how do you add experiences that will be different in the store than online?” he asks. These are the challenges that retailers are looking to solve with technology. Although there’s no consensus on timing, you probably won’t have to wait too long to see these technologies implemented at your favorite retailer. Neiman Marcus has already installed digital mirrors in many stores. Smart fitting rooms and digital mirrors powered with RFID, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and big-data analytics are all part of that theater, adding some pop to your shopping while making it as painless as possible. It’s what Michael Klein, Adobe’s director of industry strategy and marketing, calls “merchant-tainment.” “We’re not reinventing retail; we’re just trying to make it better,” Klein says. These digital technologies, he adds, have a way of making that idea much more real and appealing. Think about that the next time you get stuck with an ill-fitting dress in a fitting room.

Farewell, IDF: Is This the Demise of the Big Trade Show? By Joel Santo Domingo April 18, 2017 10 Comments Big conferences and shows like IDF and WinHEC attracted tens, if not hundreds of thousands of attendees, and were a great way to get a deep dive on the latest tech. Now they're gone. Once upon a time, over a dozen large technology conferences and trade shows dotted the landscape—from COMDEX and CTIA to TechEd and WinHEC. They had a mechanical regularity: details about Windows in the early spring, x86 chip announcements in early autumn, and COMDEX in November. Now, with news of IDF's demise, only Computex, CeBIT, Mobile World Congress (MWC), and CES remain, with company-specific developer gatherings like WWDC and Google I/O picking up some of the slack. Intel says it has "evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the [Intel Developers Forum] program moving forward." As Anandtech reports, Intel's shift to data played a role in its decision to axe IDF, as did its desire to host smaller gatherings aimed at specific segments. But in addition to big product announcements, like the Intel Pentium 4 or Core processors, shows like the IDF and Microsoft's WinHEC were opportunities for developers and the media to get deep dives on upcoming technologies, from the latest version of DirectX to esoteric details, like how IR cameras make Windows Hello more secure than previous facial-recognition methods. And while WinHEC returned in 2014 after a six-year hiatus, it's now largely limited to China and consists of technical conferences and smaller workshops. Related The Most Intriguing Hardware at IDF 2016 The Most Intriguing Hardware at IDF 2016 At larger shows, we couldn't cover every session, but we were able to glean highlights that enhanced reviews and feature stories. WWDC still has breakout sessions, but attendance is limited to developers, so the press (and therefore the general public) can't avail themselves of insider info. Developer support websites and webcasts have largely replaced these shows as a source of general and specialized information. Ever since Apple left the Macworld Expo in 2008, it has kept its own sporadic release schedule. An iPhone- or Mac-related special event dominates the news cycle for a few days every year, so why would it share the spotlight at a larger trade show? Other manufacturers have tried to emulate this method, some more successfully than others.

Intel will fabricate Spreadtrum's SC9853 series chips slated for launch in the third quarter of 2017, said the sources. Earlier in 2017, Spreadtrum announced its new SC9861G-IA as a mid-range and high-end LTE SoC platform produced via Intel's custom foundry services. Spreadtrum's previous-generation SC9860 series was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) using the foundry's 16nm process, industry sources indicated. Spreadtrum is also working with TSMC to develop its 28nm SoC solutions. Spreadtrum will provide a more complete 4G offering in 2017, which will boost its overall 4G chip shipments to over 50% higher than the about 100 million units shipped in 2016, the sources said.

NEWS CLOUD BIG DATA APPS EMERGING TECH INFRASTRUCTURE PEOPLE CLOUD BIG DATA APPS EMERGING TECH INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH CLOUD BIG DATA APPS EMERGING TECH INFRASTRUCTURE Wikibon TheCUBE ABOUT US SIGN IN Home » NEWS Earnings preview: Will profits get the tech market rally back on track? by PAUL GILLIN UPDATED 19:16 EST . 17 APRIL 2017 Quarterly earnings season begins this coming week, and the question for technology companies is: How high is up? Despite two weeks of modestly declining share prices in April, technology shares are still up an average of 10 percent in 2017, compared with 4 percent for the overall market. Prior to the latest skid, Apple Inc. (which reports May 2) was up 22 percent for the quarter, Facebook Inc. (May 3) climbed 21 percent and Amazon.com Inc. (April 27) hit a peak of 20 percent above its year-end close. Even stocks of legacy technology companies have shown resilience. SAP SE (April 25) was up 15 percent in the first quarter, IBM Corp. (April 18) rose 9 percent, Google Inc. parent Alphabet Inc. (April 27) climbed 8 percent and Microsoft Corp. (April 27) was up 5 percent. Among the information technology giants who will report over the next two weeks, only Intel Corp. (April 27) and Qualcomm Inc. (April 19) have declined. Why the surge, and can it last? We’ll start to get an answer to the second question late Monday, when Netflix Inc. reports, and on the enterprise tech front Tuesday afternoon when IBM weighs in. Sales at Netflix are expected to be up 35 percent to $2.64 billion and the company said it expects to add 5.2 million international subscribers. If Netflix misses on either of those numbers, and especially if IBM fails to impress, the punishment the market metes out could set the tone for the rest of the earnings season. Experts say the recent run-up has been fueled by investors who are seeking growth now that hopes have dimmed for near-term big tax cuts or infrastructure spending by the new administration. That prospect had driven price/earnings multiples for some companies into the stratosphere. Amazon’s P/E ratio, for instance, is 180. But with Gartner having recently slashed its global forecasts for personal computer shipments and overall IT spending, there seems to be little good news to keep the market buoyant. Looking ahead One thing likely will emerge from the first-quarter performance: Leaders in mobility and the cloud are in favor. “The ongoing movement toward cloud services is not only being fueled by the mainstream acceptance of these on-demand alternatives, but also by the continued economic uncertainties facing companies in an increasingly volatile global environment,” said Jeff Kaplan, managing director at THINKstrategies Inc., a cloud consulting firm. Ralph Finos, an analyst at Wikibon, owned by the same company as SiliconANGLE, expects Amazon to report $3.74 billion in quarterly revenue from its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit, up 46 percent from the same quarter last year. Analysts are estimating overall quarterly earnings per share will be about $1.13. In recent quarters, virtually all of Amazon’s operating profits have come from AWS. Finos thinks No. 2 cloud player Microsoft will grow its Intelligent Cloud business about 9 percent to $6.45 billion and the Azure infrastructure-as a service business between 90 and 100 percent. In handily beating sales and earnings estimates in the most recent quarter, Microsoft reported 95 percent growth in its Azure business, with Office 365 successfully baiting the hook for many enterprises to move cloudward. Analysts are looking for a 69-cent EPS in the quarter. Cloud computing remains a tiny portion of revenues for Alphabet despite Google’s accelerating focus on new cloud services and infrastructure spending since at least 2015. Investors will certainly have questions about its cloud operation, mostly how much Google is spending to build it up. But shares no doubt will turn more on how its massive advertising business performs. Analyst are looking for profits of $7.40 a share on a 20 percent jump in revenues, to $24.2 billion. IBM continues to frustrate investors who see the company’s strategy hitting most of the right notes but revenue still falling for 19 straight quarters. “I’m still waiting for some sign of an inflection point,” when growth markets like analytics and cloud will make up for declines in IBM’s traditional hardware and software businesses, Finos said. He’s expecting the string of declines to continue, however, with IBM’s quarterly revenue falling 2 percent to $17.9 billion, below the analyst consensus of $18.4 billion. The public cloud business should grow 57 percent, to $2.1 billion, and overall cloud revenue should surge 35 percent, to $3.5 billion, Finos said. But that would still have IBM falling further behind Amazon and Microsoft. The big question for IBM is whether its can charge up its Watson-led Cognitive Solution business, which Finos expects will grow a scant 2 percent in the quarter. “That needs be higher for them to move the needle,” he said. Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moorhead Insights & Strategy will be listening for news of improvements in IBM hardware sales, especially its Power line of chips, which Google endorsed last year. “Are there any indications that Google is actually using Power9 processors?” Moorhead asked. Echoing Finos, he added, “IBM needs to drive strategic imperatives at a greater rate than traditional enterprise business.” In transition Intel is in transition as it sheds no-growth business such as security and places big bets on nascent markets such as autonomous vehicles. Investor expectations are modest as a result. Analysts expect Intel to report quarterly revenues of $14.81 billion, up about 7 percent. Moorhead said he’ll be looking for statements about how Intel is coping with new competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. He’ll also be listening for news of whether a modest revival in PC sales is trickling down to the bottom line and when investors should expect to see results of recently announced artificial intelligence initiatives. As a dominant maker of chips for mobile devices, Qualcomm Inc. is another bellwether for tech, but it’s embroiled in a back-and-forth court battle with Apple over claims by the iPhone maker that Qualcomm asked for excessive royalty payments for its cellular technologies. Qualcomm has lost almost $14 billion in market value as its shares dropped since the January Apple lawsuit filing. The case could play out over months or years, and Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said in January that the suit wasn’t changing its own estimates for its second fiscal quarter. But the billions of dollars at stake in the case could make investors less forgiving of any earnings glitches. Analysts on average expect a $1.20-a-share profit, in the middle of Qualcomm’s own estimates, on revenues of $5.9 billion, up 7 percent. No one is expecting fireworks from SAP, but that’s not the company’s style. In posting its most recent quarterly earnings, SAP confidently raised its three-year outlook and said it expects to surpass $20 billion in sales in 2020. The S4/HANA in-memory enterprise resource planning software appears to be hitting on all cylinders, and SAP is making progress selling HANA as a standalone platform, thereby open up new revenue sources. Look for SAP’s cloud revenue to continue to grow in the 35 to 45 percent rate and for subscriptions to grow as a percentage of overall revenues. SAP continues to defy the gravitational forces that have brought down other IT legacy giants. “For the last couple of quarters they have beaten my statistical trend line forecasts,” said Finos, who’s estimating the company’s software business will book $3.6 billion in quarterly revenues with more than a quarter of that coming from subscriptions. Analyst consensus estimates are $5.47 billion in total revenues and 78 cents in earnings per share.

Microsoft flagged its new policy early last year, telling world+dog that Windows 10 will be the only supported Windows platform on Intel’s upcoming 7th Gen Intel Core (Kaby Lake) silicon. The policy went down badly with business users who had perfectly good reason to run old Windows on new PCs. Microsoft eventually changed the policy so that those of you running Windows 7 or 8.x will still get security updates until those OSes reach end-of-life, but won't get other fixes. Microsoft put the policy into effect last week. Enter Zeffy, who on his GitHub page describes the policy as “...just Microsoft's nice way of telling everyone who'd rather keep using Windows 7 or 8.1 on their Intel Kaby Lake or AMD Ryzen systems to screw themselves.” As you may infer from his choice of language, Zeffy doesn't think the policy is a good idea and therefore tried to code his way around it. His solution targets the new CPU-detection bits that Windows has added to help Windows Update know when not to ship new code. His GitHub page explains it all in detail, but the TL;DR version of the story is that if you can mess with wuaueng.dll in certain ways, you can kill the CPU detection code and get all the updates you want. The Register hasn't tested Zeffy's fix because we don't have a suitable Windows machine to hand. If you give it a try, do let us know if it does the trick. ® Tips and corrections 78 Comments MORE Microsoft Windows Update Windows 10 More from The Register Microsoft raises pistol, pulls the trigger on Windows 7, 8 updates for new Intel, AMD chips Don't want to use Windows 10?

Nvidia to release GeForce GT 1030 Guru3D.com » News » Intel 300 series chipsets to integrate USB 3.1 Gen 2 and Gigabit WIFI Intel 300 series chipsets to integrate USB 3.1 Gen 2 and Gigabit WIFI by Aritra Das on: 04/17/2017 08:35 AM | Source | 14 comment(s) Intel is going to release two new platforms in the coming months which consists of  the X299 HEDT based CPUs and the other is the mainstream Coffee Lake based CPUs.  The upcoming Intel mainsteam chipset is known as the 300 series and we can expect that the top end chipset would be called Z370 which ironically sounds similar to AMDs X370 chipset. Intel 300 series desktop processor motherboard will be based on the current LGA 1151 socket. Earlier rumours stated that the 300 Series chipset's Coffee Lake-S processor will provide 6 Cores 12 threaded CPUS, which is Intel's first in the mainstream platform to enhance the number of processors and threads.  AMD has already put forward their 8 Cores 16 Threads and 6 Cores 12 threads CPUs at price point lower than Intel, although there are a few bugs, but the performance is quite good for the money. Now, intel is pushing forward its new CPUs. At this stage, Intel 300 series processors will be have integrated USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10Gbps) and Gigabit Wi-Fi which are some nice additions to this new platform.   It is rumoured that Intel will release their Coffee-Lake CPUs in the later half of 2017.

Just delay it until there are enough features that make it worth it for the previous platform owners? Because that seems like a poor business decision and ****ty for everyone else who now has to wait because someone who bought Z270 is upset that they are being tempted by two new features.

Gigabit WiFi in an enterprise/office setting will be hugely popular. Places where it is difficult to run cable but needs network connectivity, etc. MorganX Newbie Posts: 26 Joined: 2015-03-30 #5421490 Posted on: 04/17/2017 02:59 PM While I "think" I'm done with Intel once ITX Ryzen Mobos are available, this is a good evolution of the chipset. Built-in WiGig will be great, and hopefully with 3.1 Gen 2 USB-C becomes a PC standard.

As for the new features, they are cool, nothing more. eddward Newbie Posts: 12 Joined: 2013-10-01 #5421509 Posted on: 04/17/2017 04:03 PM Quote: Originally Posted by H83 So from what i understand, the new chipset will maintain the current socket 1151, does this means that there´s a small chance that Cannonlake cpus will work on current Z170/Z270 boards??? As for the new features, they are cool, nothing more. First of all Cannonlake has to come to the desktop segment. I really think they will jump straight to Ice Lake as the first 10nm desktop SKU. And even if Cannonlake desktop will appear in 2018, these Z170 boards will be ~3 years old so basically out of support anyway. slyphnier Master Guru Posts: 304 Joined: 2009-11-30 #5421517 Posted on: 04/17/2017 04:54 PM Quote: Originally Posted by Matt26LFC OK now this 300 series platform I feel is taking the piss a little Is there any reason why CoffeeLake won't work on Z200 series!?

I don't understand. The fact that the 200 series itself does not have features such as USB 3.1 (gen2) and is a 2017 chipset itself is astonishing.

I dont use neither like wifi on desktop, but is a MUST. It s a joke needing an ethernet cable this days. Most casual pc users dont even know what an ethernet cable is or how is connected. Hope they put wifi on every 300 chipset. Tvs, streaming media players, phones, consoles, even the freaking fridge has wifi. But the most advanced and productive piece of technolgy on your house, been lacking wifi for more than 10 years. Shame on you manufacturers.

It tried to convince hardware partners to invest in tablets running Windows for years. That didn’t work. Instead, it got into the market itself with Surface. 2015 wasn’t the first year we got a glimpse of a Surface Pro. It was the year that Microsoft perfected the Windows 2-in-1 with the Surface Pro 4. 2017 could be the year we get an even better Surface Pro 5. The Surface Pro 4 launched with Microsoft’s massive Windows 10 operating system update. It was a testbed for all sorts of new technologies. It came with Intel Skylake processors, infrared cameras for sign in, updated digital pen technology and a 12-inch high-resolution display that offered amazing colors. The Surface Pro 5, if it’s announced and released this year, could be as equally forward thinking as the Surface Pro 4 was. Microsoft uses Surface to prove concepts that it hopes hardware makers will attempt with their own designs. The Surface Pro 5 release can’t be too far off now. Read: 11 Surface Pro 4 Tips & Tricks Some are saying that the Surface Pro 5 release could mean the end of the device’s signature charging and docking port. These reports point to the tablet adopting a new port that’s already seeing widespread adoption in smartphones. Others believe that the Surface Pro 5 will include only rudimentary updates designed to help it better compete against the iPad Pro and devices that copied the Surface Pro 4’s design. They predict a modest update to its processor and memory. A Surface Pro 5 release is definitely happening. Microsoft has been on a hot streak with the line, releasing the Surface Book and Surface Studio in quick succession to help establish new areas for growth. Those devices are gaining mind share, but the Surface Pro is the most popular computer Microsoft makes by far. Read: Microsoft Surface: Everything New in 2016 The Surface Pro 5 release is coming. Here’s what we know. Surface Pro 5 Release Date The Surface Pro 5 release date hasn’t been announced yet, but there’s a generally agreed upon window that’s coming into focus. The Surface Pro 4 was revealed at an event in October 2015. Microsoft generally aims to replace a device around 13 months. The only exception to this is the Surface Pro 3, which effectively established the Surface Pro as a productivity powerhouse in the first place. The Surface Pro 4 just hit the 18-month mark of availability, roughly. Read: Surface Book vs Surface Pro 4 When a new piece of hardware is about to be released, Microsoft schedules an event. The last few events have focused on both hardware and software. That is, the company likes to give users a look at the entire package together. The company recently sent out invites to an education-focused event on May 2nd. It is believed that Microsoft will discuss a new Surface at this event. All About Microsoft believes this will be an all-new Surface form factor to show off Windows 10 Cloud, not a Surface Pro 5. Microsoft reveals the Surface Pro 4. It is worth noting that the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book launches came around the same time as Microsoft released a major update to Windows 10. The Windows 10 Creators Update launched in early April. The next major update to Windows likely won’t come until late in 2017. It’s in early development now. Surface Pro 5 Price Predicting the Surface Pro 5 price is a huge gamble, just as it is with the Surface Pro 5 release date. It’s hard to make a prediction because there’s nothing stable to base that prediction on today. The Surface Pro 4’s cheapest iteration cost $899 at launch, $100 more than its direct predecessor. Microsoft has said that it wants to keep the Surface in the premium hardware category, but there are Surface Pro 4 alternatives that you can purchase that have its specs for a lot less than it costs. Adjusted pricing for the Surface Pro 4. It doesn’t help that Microsoft has fiddled with Surface Pro 4 pricing often. The cheapest Surface Pro 4 now costs $799.99, $100 less than it did at launch. The company removed the Surface Pen from this model. Instead, it’s giving buyers a free Surface Dock worth $99. Microsoft could decide to leave well enough alone and stick with the $899 price tag. This would leave room open for cheaper alternatives from Lenovo, HP and Samsung. Whatever it’s priced at, it almost certainly will not include the Surface Type Cover. The company has sold them separately since the earliest iterations of Surface, despite advertising them together. Surface Pro 5 Features The list of Surface Pro 5 features runs the gamut. There are some features that Microsoft absolutely has to do something about to keep the line viable. Other things seem as if they’d be a good idea. The Surface Pro 4 has a full-size USB port, Mini DisplayPort, headphone jack and Surface Connect port for charging and docking. At least three of these could be combined into one USB 3.0 Type-C port. USB Type-C is already making huge inroads with smartphones. As it stands today, the Surface Connect port is only useful for charging and the $99 dock. A USB 3.0 Type-C port could handle those duties well. Read: iPad Pro vs Surface Pro 4: Which is Better? Another thing Microsoft has to address is battery life. With real-world use, the Surface Pro 4 gets around 6-5 hours of time between charges. This is at a time when the productivity-minded people who buy the device could use more battery life than ever. Surface Pro 5 needs to get well above the 9 hours of video playback the current model reaches. What’s more, it’d be nice if it didn’t take so long to charge. The ports of the Surface Pro 4. Support for mobile internet access support seems possible. The last Surface to support data through a carrier was the then mainstream Surface 3. The Windows team has moved to bolster support for those types of data connections in recent updates and the Surface Team usually builds its hardware around what it thinks will highlight the Windows Team’s work. Surface Pro 5 Specs As for potential Surface Pro 5 specs, we know with some certainty that Surface Pro 5 will have newer processors. The Skylake processors inside the Surface Pro 4 debuted in 2015, meaning it’s about time for a refresh to keep the line on the cutting-edge. Microsoft watcher Paul Thurrott has shared accurate information about the company’s plans before. His sources are saying that Surface Pro 5 will use Intel Kaby Lake processors and that it won’t have a USB Type-C port. Surface Pro 5 will not change the Surface Connect power connector, I was just told. Kaby Lake, nothing dramatic. — Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) April 6, 2017 We don’t know if there’ll be storage and RAM upgrades. A Surface Pro 4 can have as little as 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and an Intel Core M3 fan that doesn’t require a fan. The most powerful Surface Pro 4 has 16GB of RAM, 1TB of storage and an Intel Core i7 processor. Microsoft could aim for a bigger sharper display than the 12.3-inch 2736 x 1824 display that’s in the Surface Pro 4 today, but that seems unlikely. People seem to like the tablet’s size already. A sharper display might have negative effects on battery life. Surface Pro 5 Accessories One patent points to some interesting things happening with Surface Pro 5 accessories. It’s an area where Microsoft has only had a few genuine success stories. Most people agree that the Surface Pen, with its rubber eraser cap, metal body and interchangeable tips, is solid. Microsoft’s ultra-thin touch-sensitive cover failed. The battery cover was killed off before the Surface Pro 4 launched. Read: 13 Essential Surface Pro 4 Accessories Remember, only the Surface Pen comes with the Surface Pro 4. Today, you have to replace its AAAA battery once a year. A magnet on the left side of the device hangs on to it. A patent discovered by Patently Mobile would allow the device to charge a Surface Pen and hold it in place. A patent for an upgraded Surface Pen found by Patently Mobile. The Surface Dial arrived last year with the Surface Studio desktop. The Surface Pro 4 supports using the Dial on your desk, but not on your screen the same way the Surface Studio does. It’s hard to imagine the Surface Pro 5 won’t offer this functionality. Surface Studio also sports connecting to an Xbox One Controller without the need for Bluetooth or a separate adapter. It’d be worthwhile for Microsoft to include this technology in the Surface Pro 5 for uniformity’s sake. Plenty of low-end games, like Minecraft Windows 10 Edition would benefit from it. It’ll be interesting to see if the Surface Pen continues to come bundled with the Surface Pro 5. Microsoft frequently discusses the accessory when talking about Surface, that cheaper Surface Pro 4 forces users to buy it separately. The Surface Dial being used with Surface Studio. It’ll also be interesting to see if the Surface Pen continues to come bundled with the Surface Pro 5. Microsoft frequently discusses the accessory when talking about Surface. However, that cheaper Surface Pro 4 that comes without it suggests a new line of thinking. Even if we don’t hear about the Surface Pro 5 at this May 2nd event, expect Microsoft to have something concrete to say about the device this fall. By then, the Surface Pro 4 well be a two-year old device surely ready to be replaced. 5 Best Surface Pro 4 Alternatives in 2017 Huawei MateBook - $399   1 / 5  Boasting nine hours of battery life and a slim profile, the Huawei MateBook is relatively new to the Windows 2-in-1 space. Its maker is known best for affordable Android phones with decent build quality. This machine offers 4GB of RAM and an Intel Core m3 processor for just $399. More expensive configurations add an Intel Core m5 processor, up to 8GB of RAM and 512GB of solid state storage. The Huawei MateBook goes for minimalism at all costs. Its metal frame has just a USB Type-C port, a headset jack and a connection for its add-on keyboard. The front is dominated by a 12-inch high-definition display that has a 2160 x 11440 resolution. Read: Huawei MateBook Review: If iPad and Surface Mated You’ll need to factor in the cost of the digital pen and the keyboard because neither of these come with the Huawei MateBook. They, like the tablet itself, are cheaper than what Surface offers. The MatePen is just $49 from the Microsoft Store. The keyboard, which has a kickstand for propping the device up and backlit keys, costs $99.

When McAfee formally separated from Intel this month, it brought with it 350 Oregon employees. That’s an increase of about 100 from 2010, when the company sold to Intel for $7.7 billion. Most of the company’s Oregon employees work in corporate product development, according to Jaime Le, McAfee’s head of public relations. Last year Intel announced plans to make McAfee its own company again. The chipmaker retains a 49 percent stake following the spinout, which valued McAfee at $4.2 billion. Private equity firm TPG controls the rest.

This sponsored article will focus on a brand new technology, the new 5Gbit Ethernet standard, and two motherboards that carry it; the Z270 SuperCarrier and Fatal1ty Z270 Gaming i7.   Both of these ASRock motherboards carry one of the latest NBase-T controllers, the Aquantia AQC108. ASRock is the only vendor I know of that is offering 5Gbit networking to consumers, and they also made sure that these two motherboards offered three M.2 slots and extra storage options. Modern storage protocols and devices using NAND provide very high transfer speeds. While back in the day, 1Gbit made sense with HDDs, nowadays with SSDs the system can take advantage of faster networking, if only locally.     Why 5Gbit? The story began when vendors started to see a need for network speeds faster than 1Gbps, but couldn't justify the cost for 10Gbit infrastructure. Newer generation Wireless-AC cards were starting to exceed 1Gbps in throughput and 10Gbps over Ethernet requires Cat6a cabling, while most small offices and homes are wired with Cat5e. The NBase-T alliance was formed in 2014 and includes multiple OEMs such as Cisco and HPE and chip companies such as Intel and Aquantia. In fact, in 2015, IEEE decided to use the NBase-T specification to produce the 802.3bz standard that would make 2.5Gbps and 5Gbps speeds over 100m Cat5e and Cat6 possible.     In September 2016, 802.3bz was standardized and approved. Come early 2017, and ASRock is the first consumer motherboard vendor to integrate 2.5Gbps/5Gbps NICs into their Z270 and even X370 motherboards. The benefit of the new Aquantia 2.5/5Gbit NICs is that they will work with older Cat5e cabling, and will work with many of the NBase-T routers, switches, and access points shipped in 2015.     The Modern Bottleneck       A byte is equal to 8 bits, and it's important to differentiate Megabytes per second (MB/s) and Megabits per second (Mbps or Mbits). You should be able to divide numbers in Mbps by eight and then see how many MB/s you would get, however, we also have overhead, so in reality, we never get a clean cut bits/8 to get throughput in bytes.   For instance, the DMI in modern Intel chipsets operates at 32Gbps (x4 PCI-E 3.0), which would give us 4GB/s throughput, but because of the 128b/130b encoding we lose 2% in theory, and in reality after all overhead, we are limited to roughly 3.5GB/s. When we test three fast NVMe drives in RAID 0, we are stuck with this maximum 3.5GB/s limited by the DMI.   SATA (realistically around 550 MB/s limit) and LAN protocols work in the same way, so we don't get 625 MB/s, but closer to 500 MB/s in real-world testing of the 5Gbit protocol. Keep this in mind with the chart and connection protocols, since overhead can be found in all connections. The one outcome that should be simple to see is that there is a need for a long distance local transfer protocol that is faster than the 1Gbit NIC, can reach the same distances, and doesn't cost as much as 10Gbit infrastructure.   For some, the 5Gbit NICs on ASRock motherboards teamed with other 5Gbit systems and NBase-T switches could be the perfect options, especially if the building is already wired with Cat5e.

That GPU is none other than the venerable GeForce GTX 1080 Ti — a $700 card with 11 Gbps of GDDR5X memory and a 11 GB frame buffer. Needless to say this card is one that will interest those looking to push their games to the next level. I took the time to install my EVGA GTX 1080 Ti FE inside of my Akitio Node external GPU enclosure. After connecting the unit to my 2016 MacBook Pro via a Thunderbolt 3 cable, all it took was a simple shell script and a reboot to get the unit working with a (required in macOS) external display. Nvidia’s drivers are still in beta, and from my hands-on time, the experience is far from perfect in macOS. That said, you can most certainly see the potential and performance differences between the 13-inch MacBook Pro’s integrated Intel Iris Graphics 550 GPU, and the beastly 1080 Ti. As expected, it’s also a lot faster than the GTX 1050 Ti that I tested last week. If you’re looking to truly experience the power of such a card with the MacBook Pro, however, you’ll need to step into the Windows world, and run a Boot Camp installation. The GTX 1080 Ti + Windows turns the MacBook Pro into an insanely powerful and flexible gaming machine with just a single Thunderbolt 3 cable. Watch our hands-on video walkthrough as we explain. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? Pascal in macOS Here’s how I was able to get the GTX 1080 Ti working with my 2016 MacBook Pro. This same technique will work with any Nvidia GPU with Pascal architecture, such as the GTX 1080, 1070, 1060, 1050, etc. Step 1: Install the GTX 1080 Ti or other Pascal graphics card inside of the Akitio Node, and connect the 6+8 pin power connectors. Step 2: Boot into macOS. Step 3: Connect the Thunderbolt 3 cable from the Node to one of the Thunderbolt 3 ports on the 2016 MacBook Pro. If you’re using a 13-inch model with four Thunderbolt 3 ports, Apple recommends connecting to the ports on the left side of the machine. Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more hands-on videos Step 4: Connect to an external display from your graphics card via HDMI or Display Port. Step 5: Connect the power to the Akitio Node, and turn it on. Step 6: Open a Terminal window and paste in the following to download, install and configure the beta Nvidia drivers: curl -o ~/Desktop/automate-eGPU.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goalque/automate-eGPU/master/automate-eGPU.sh && chmod +x ~/Desktop/automate-eGPU.sh && cd ~/Desktop && sudo ./automate-eGPU.sh Enter your password when requested and press Return. Follow the instructions presented in Terminal, and reboot your Mac when requested. After rebooting, you will see macOS on the externally connected display. You should also see Nvidia’s Driver Manager app running in the menu bar, and available in System Preferences. Special thanks to goalque for providing such a simple-to-use script. Here is what you will see when you run the Automate-eGPU script macOS Benchmarks We ran a few Benchmarks using Unigine Heaven, Valley and CineBench, and you can very obviously see the performance difference between the integrated Intel GPU and the discrete Nvidia GPU. Benches were performed at 1080p resolution on an external display. Even if you have a relatively weak MacBook such as the entry-level model without the Touch Bar, you can get big performance gains with this setup when it comes to gaming. Of course, a more powerful quad-core MacBook will perform even better, but all eligible models stand to reap serious gaming benefits. But those performance gains are largely stymied by the bugginess and general unreliability of such a setup on macOS. Remember, these are just beta drivers, and it’s still very much early in the game. Many of the games that I tried via the Mac App Store, or via a service like Steam experienced some issues with bugs or crashing. It’s clear that the potential is there waiting to be tapped into, but it’s not quite ready for prime time. Therefore, it would be difficult for me to recommend investing into such a setup if you’re only interested in running macOS… Windows is where it’s at And that’s where Windows comes in. Yes, Pascal is now somewhat compatible with macOS, but in reality, you’re going to want to run Windows on your MacBook Pro if you want to be able to justify such an investment. By going this route, you’re essentially turning your MacBook Pro into a bonafide high-powered Windows gaming machine. And let me tell you folks, it flies. The great thing about running Windows with an eGPU setup is that, unlike in macOS, the GPU can drive the MacBook Pro’s internal display, and you’ll find stable drivers that work well for most games. That means that you can utilize an extra long Thunderbolt 3 cable for added flexibility while enjoying the latest games. To learn how to install Windows 10 on your MacBook Pro, be sure to watch and follow our full hands-on Boot Camp guide for Windows 10. The video has been viewed over 200,000 times now, and lots of people have been surprised by how easy it is to run Windows on a MacBook Pro. After Windows is installed on your MacBook Pro, simply connect the eGPU via a Thunderbolt 3 cable, and install the GPU drivers. Please note that you’ll need to plug in the Thunderbolt 3 cable after the Windows logo appears as it starts the boot process. Windows gaming and benchmarks We saw how much the MacBook Pro improved in benchmarks when using the GTX 1080 Ti, but how about on Windows? As you’ll see, the Windows environment is where such an eGPU setup thrives. Since Windows allows me to use the MacBook Pro’s internal display, I included benches for that as well. Notice the huge performance gap between Windows and macOS. But benchmarks only tell a portion of the story. The games heavily benefit from the added power of the eGPU. Forza 3 Horizon running on the MacBook Pro’s internal display I was able to run graphics-intensive titles like Forza 3 Horizon at maximum settings on my external display at 4K resolution. The game looks absolutely incredible, and stays locked in at 30 FPS for a smooth experience, but can easily fluctuate around 40-45 FPS if you disable the FPS lock. Trying to pull off a feat like that using the MacBook Pro’s Intel Iris 550 Graphics would be utterly laughable. In fact, the game won’t even run at all with the integrated GPU. Don’t even try to let the Intel Iris 550 do the heavy lifting Other games, like Rocket League, play at maximum settings on my 4K external display while locked at a silky smooth 60 FPS. My experience while using the eGPU in macOS was nothing like that, in fact, Rocket League could barely hold up a consistent 30 FPS while running at 4K. Conclusion eGPUs are here to stay. They afford a great deal of on demand power while allowing you to have a light and nimble machine like the 13-inch 2016 MacBook Pro. One of the biggest remaining hurdles is the fact that eGPU enclosures are still very hard to come by. The Akitio Node is just now becoming more readily available, while other eGPU solutions are backordered, or still in the works. As mentioned, you can use any Pascal-based card in the Akitio Node and have it function with macOS. That means that you don’t necessarily have to spend $700 on the 1080 Ti. More price-conscious cards like the GTX 1060, 1070, and 1080 can still provide ample gaming performance gains. Having Pascal support on macOS is nice, but the real fun and potential is realized by running Windows via Boot Camp. If you’re a gamer with a 2016 MacBook Pro, then you are in possession of a very flexible machine that can run macOS for day-to-day work, and Windows for intense gaming sessions when connected to any Pascal-powered eGPU. Would you consider using an eGPU with your MacBook Pro given the obvious gaming benefits? Sound off with your opinions down below.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Microsoft introduces Power Throttling for background apps in Windows 10 build 16176 04/18/2017 at 3:01 PM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment The next major version of Windows 10 may include a feature that can extend the battery life of your notebook or tablet. Microsoft has introduced a new feature that’s currently called Power Throttling. It’s designed to limit the resources used by background processes, which means that heavy multitaskers might be able to get a bit more battery life. You don’t have to wait for Windows 10 Redstone 3 to be released to try the new feature though. It’s available in Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 16176, which means you can take Power Throttling for a test drive by signing up for the Windows Insiders Program and joining the Fast Ring. The feature currently only supports systems with an Intel Skylake or newer processor, since Power Throttling requires Intel’s Speed Shift tech to work. But Microsoft says there are plans to add support for other processors in the future. So does this mean Windows 10 will just start shutting down programs running in the background, causing music to stop playing, VoIP calls to end, and other features to stop working? Not if everything works as designed. Instead, the operating system will figure out which processes are running in the foreground and give them a high priority. Background apps will continue to run, but “Windows places the CPU in its most energy efficient operating modes” while running those programs. So music or video should keep playing, for instance… but I imagine some CPU-intensive activities may take longer to complete in this mode. Keep in mind that this is a new and experimental feature available to members of Microsoft’s beta tester community. So it’s possible that not everything will work perfectly, but part of the reason Microsoft is rolling Power Throttling out to testers first is to solicit feedback to make sure all apps work as expected with the feature enabled. You can also disable Power Throttling for specific apps if the feature causes problems. By the way, Power Throttling may get a name change by the time it’s available more widely. Microsoft says that’s a “temporary working name” that may change. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Another source claims Intel will launch X299 and Skylake-X at Computex Another source claims Intel will launch X299 and Skylake-X at Computex Matthew Wilson 10 hours ago CPU, Featured Announcement It looks like another source has come to light, claiming that Intel will now unveil its ‘Basin Falls’ platform at Computex this year. This new platform will encompass Skylake-X, Kaby Lake-X and X299. As previously thought, this source claims that Intel is bringing the launch forward by a few months after mounting pressure from AMD’s Ryzen architecture, which will soon roll out to HEDT chips as well. The initial report comes from DigiTimes, whose report claims that Basin-Falls will launch at Computex 2017, backing up earlier rumours which claiming that the launch had been moved forward from August. According to the report, Skylake-X will contain three 140W SKUs, featuring six, eight and ten cores. Meanwhile, Kaby Lake-X will reduce the TDP to 112W and will apparently feature a quad-core SKU, which seems like an odd step, but could be connected to the new Core i7 CPU we heard whispers of earlier this year. Aside from HEDT processors, the report also claims that 14nm Coffee Lake based CPUs and Z370 chipset will be coming by early 2018. KitGuru Says: DigiTimes can be hit or miss with information at times, so take this with a pinch of salt. However, at this point, signs do seem to be pointing towards Computex for a new CPU launch from Intel.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Rumor iMac Models With Server-Grade Hardware Rumored to Launch in Q3 2017 – Xeon Processors Listed By Omar Sohail Apr 18, 2017 16Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has been rumored to step up the hardware game for its upcoming iMac models, with the latest rumor stating that these machines are going to be touting server-grade hardware. Though we expect that these models will still be offered in Intel’s latest desktop-grade processors, those who want to rake every ounce of performance can opt to purchase those versions that feature even more powerful internals. Apple Will Retain the Screen Sizes of Its iMac Family – 27-Inch Will Be the Largest Variant and Can Sport an Intel Xeon Processor and up to 64GB of ECC RAM The first rumor also stated that Apple’s future iMac models will feature Intel’s Xeon processor coupled with ultra-fast PCIe-based NVMe solid state storage and ECC RAM. The advantage of having ECC RAM present in a computer is that it can detect and repair errors on its own, preventing crashes and data corruption as a result, which is also why they carry a very high price tag. Related iMac Family Coming Later This Year Rumored to Feature Hardware for ‘Pros’ – Intel Xeon CPUs and ECC RAM Listed According to the latest report from DigiTimes, the new machines are going to be hitting the market during the third quarter of 2017. The ECC RAM portion of the iMac can be configured to feature between 16GB to 64GB, but creative professionals will naturally be requiring all of that memory. In addition, the source also states that an Intel Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor will be a part of the hardware. Intel has not introduced such a chip to the market and the closest thing to it is the Xeon E3-1285 v3, which is based on the 22nm architecture (and is no longer being produced). Advertisement This particular processor features a total of four cores and eight threads with the base clock speed running at 3.60GHz. We understand that the iMac is going to be a thin AIO so using an extremely powerful chip will mean that the cooling system will not be able to dissipate the heat faster so that’s what the upcoming Mac Pro will be designed to do. A quad-core processor running on an iMac seems like the ideal configuration and we also believe that Apple will be including Intel’s 7th generation of i5 and i7 processors in the mix.

A beginner's guide to processors What is a CPU? A beginner's guide to processors by Chris Finnamore 16 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments What is a CPU? The CPU, Central Processing Unit, or simply processor, is the main chip in a computer responsible for carrying out all tasks. It's responsible for telling all the other components in a computer what to do, according to the instructions it is given by the programs (software) running on that computer. In fact, CPUs exist in many kinds of device apart from computers. If something can run programs, chances are it will have a CPU. For example, phones and TVs have CPUs inside them. In modern computers, and especially in smartphones, the CPU may sit on the same physical chip as other components. Most modern computer CPUs share a chip with a computer's graphics electronics (that decides what appears on your monitor). An example of this is the Intel Core i7-7700K. In smartphones and tablets the chip containing the CPU may also handle phone calls, Wi-Fi, GPS and many other things. Such multi-purpose chips are known as SoCs (system-on-a-chip). An example of this would be the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. Related: When is Black Friday? Mobile SoCs contain a CPU and loads of other important kit that makes your phone work Where is the CPU? In a computer, the CPU is found at the heart of the system, plugged into the motherboard. You wouldn't be able to see it if you took the side panel off your desktop PC, as it will be hidden under a cooling fan – a CPU is a powerful component and would get very hot without proper cooling. In a desktop PC, the CPU and cooler are designed to be easy to remove. This means replacing the chip if it goes wrong is a simple process. It doesn’t mean a processor can be easily swapped for a more powerful model, however, as the CPU will need to be compatible with the motherboard. Most of the time, if you’re upgrading to a CPU that’s a year or two newer than your current one, you’ll also need to fit a new motherboard. In laptops, on the other hand, the CPU and cooler are as good as impossible to remove (and even harder to replace). It’s also not possible to change the motherboard, so it's best to think as laptops as non-upgradable in this regard. Related: Best CPU coolers Some examples of CPU coolers CPU Jargon Buster: Speed There is a vast difference in computing performance between different models of CPU. PC and laptop manufacturers tend to splash three things all over their marketing material when trying to sell you a computer: CPU model (see below), clock speed and number of cores. Clock speed is expressed in gigahertz, or GHz, and is a rough indication of how many calculations a processor can make each second – the higher the number, the more calculations. CPU Jargon Buster: Cores How quickly a CPU can process data is also affected by how many cores it has. Each core is essentially a CPU in itself, and many programs are written so that multiple cores can work on processing the data the program requires at the same time – vastly increasing how quickly that program can run. Modern CPUs have at least two cores, with many having four, eight or even more. Having multiple cores will certainly give you a speed boost, but it depends on the kind of program you’re running: a quad-core processor can perform some tasks, such as video editing, almost twice as fast as a dual-core chip, but this won’t be the case in all situations. For more, read our Intel Core i3, i5 and i7 guide, which explains how cores can make a difference in more detail. CPU Jargon Buster: Model names There are two main CPU manufacturers in the computer industry: AMD and Intel. Both companies make many different CPUs under many different model names, but those names, such as Core M or Atom, don’t tell you a great deal about a CPU’s capabilities. Here’s a quick breakdown to give you an idea of what each CPU range can do. What else should I know about laptop CPUs? Almost all laptops have Intel CPUs. The ranges are: Atom: Power-efficient but not-very-fast chips for smartphones, tablets and small cheap laptops. Devices with these CPUs tend to struggle to run Windows smoothly, but have great battery life. Core M: Another range of power-efficient chips, but far faster than anything with an Atom logo. Good for light laptops with long battery life. Core i3/i5/i7: Intel’s main laptop CPUs. Broadly speaking, the i7 CPUs are the fastest, i3 are the slowest and i5 sit in the middle. It’s a little more complicated than that in reality, which is why we’ve written the handy guide we mentioned above. Intel rival AMD makes chips called A4 up to A10, which are roughly equivalent. What else should I know about desktop CPUs? Intel has some real competition when it comes to desktop PCs, with the latest AMD Ryzen CPUs promising serious power at a good price. As with laptops, desktop processor ranges are complicated. The main thing to remember is that, despite differences in design, Intel and AMD CPUs offer broadly similar performance for the price. This means that if you buy a £500 AMD PC, it will be around as quick as a £500 Intel PC. Enthusiasts buying absolutely state-of-the-art kit will want to dig a little deeper, but most people will be happy with a PC containing a CPU from either manufacturer.

That may not sound too exciting at first blush, but we’re here to offer four reasons why a single spec improvement is a bigger deal than it appears. 1) Improved Video Codecs: 4K video sources are becoming increasingly common these days, and Kaby Lake is insanely well equipped to handle high-quality media. Its new 4K HVEC codec offers more than double the battery life when playing 4K videos. This boils down to a massive reduction in power consumption that keeps your computer lasting longer. 4K may not matter much if you’re watching content on the Surface Pro 5 tablet display, but, especially if you’re transmitting to another screen, that boost can be a huge help. Video is at the center of the modern web, and Kaby Lake is well suited to handle that aspect now and in the future. 2) Increased Web Performance: Every CPU refresh offers an increase in overall performance. With regard to the web, Intel’s advertised numbers suggest a 19 percent bump when using Microsoft’s Edge browser. As recapped by us last fall, those enhancements may be even larger if you go for a higher-end model. A 19 percent increase is far from night and day, but the simple truth of the matter is Surface Pro 5 will make productivity better with Kaby Lake inside it. It means markedly faster research, work or social media browsing. 3) Gaming: A lot of folks hoped the Surface Pro 4 would be a formidable gaming machine. While Kaby Lake doesn’t exactly reinvent the wheel in that area, Intel does promise some performance gains for gamers. While demoing the CPU, the hardware maker had totally average laptops running Overwatch at 30 fps. Bilzzard Entertainment's "Overwatch" beta was a huge success. Photo: Blizzard Entertainment A hardcore PC gamer will scoff at those results, but the point is, a mid or high-tier Surface Pro 5 should be able to run some fairly modern games if you want it to. It’s still not really designed for that, but at least it can handle itself OK. 4) General Battery Improvements: We’ve technically already mentioned this in the video section, but it’s worth reiterating for those who skipped by. The main purpose of putting Kaby Lake in the Surface Pro 5 is to make it a mobile device that lasts longer no matter what you’re doing. The Surface Pro 4 suffered from terrible battery drain issues when it launched in 2015. That shouldn’t happen with its successor. It’d be irresponsible to offer an exact benchmark without knowing the full specs, but we’ve seen gains of up to 20 percent battery life on Kaby Lake. The difference may not be as large with the Pro 5, but at least you’ll be getting a tablet with more juice regardless. Microsoft has not officially unveiled the Surface Pro 5, and it’s rumored to be absent from the company’s May 2 hardware event. Is Kaby Lake a big enough spec improvement to make you consider a Surface Pro 5? Tell us in the comments section!

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker Origin Chronos review: the monster gaming PC that isn’t monstrous A PC for people that don’t want to build a PC by Sam Byford@345triangle Apr 19, 2017, 9:00am EDT share tweet Linkedin PC gaming is really two hobbies in one. There’s the side of things related to playing games: the endless Steam library curation, the experimentation with mods, the discovery of something obscure that you just wouldn’t be able to find anywhere else. Then there’s the hardware side, where sourcing components to build a rig and tweaking it hot rod-style to get the maximum performance possible is an entire pursuit unto itself. For a lot of PC gamers, the former wouldn’t be as enjoyable without the latter. But there’s not really any need for that to be the case — it’s totally worth getting into PC gaming even if you have zero desire to plug a GPU into a motherboard yourself or scout Newegg for hot RAM deals. And one thing that’s happened over recent years is that pre-built systems have become a lot more compelling than ever before. You’ll pay more than if you build your own system, of course, but you’ll save a lot of time and often get something that would be difficult to reproduce at home. Take Origin’s Chronos, for example. If you want an ultra-powerful gaming PC that’s only a little bigger than an Xbox — and don’t mind an entry price of over $1,200 — it’s worth a serious look. The Chronos felt like a premium product before I even looked at the box. Origin shipped it to me in a heavy-duty wooden container that I eventually managed to open with the assistance of a power drill. Once extracted from its ostentatious packaging, which of course includes a free T-shirt, the Chronos revealed itself to be an attractive, minimalist PC that I wouldn’t be embarrassed to put on display anywhere. My unit’s case has been painted white with red trim, which happens to match my apartment’s decor well, but Origin offers several customization options to suit your personal taste. You can place the Chronos in whatever position you like The advantage of a compact, good-looking PC is that it frees you up to place it almost anywhere. If the Chronos were a console it’d be considered pretty chunky — at 11.75" in height and 4" in width, it’s just slightly bigger in all dimensions than an original Xbox One. But considering the power inside, it’s very diminutive, and far more flexible than most PCs. One neat aspect of the design is the magnetic rubber feet that can be attached to almost any side of the metal case, meaning you can place the Chronos in whichever horizontal or vertical configuration you like. It was easy to slot under my TV or on my desk, and the system isn’t big or heavy to the point that moving it around became impractical. The Chronos isn’t entirely free of gamer bling, however: there’s a GPU-shaped window that exposes the Nvidia graphics processor inside, and on my unit the whole window lights up bright red when the system is turned on. The unit shipped to me is based around an Asus Z170i Pro Gaming motherboard with an Intel Core i7 6700K Skylake processor, an 8GB Nvidia GTX 1070 Founder’s Edition GPU, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, a 250GB Samsung 850 Evo m.2 SSD paired with a 2TB hard drive, Origin’s own Frostbyte 120 liquid cooling system, and a 450-watt power supply. You get a total of 10 USB-A ports with varying capabilities — no USB-C or Thunderbolt 3, unfortunately — along with HDMI, DisplayPort, ethernet, and the standard PC audio in/out array. There’s even a split purple and green PS/2 port. You also get one extra HDMI and three DisplayPort inputs through the GTX 1070 itself. Origin gives you lots of options when ordering, and the Chronos' GPU selection ranges from a GTX 1050 Ti all the way up to Nvidia’s brand-new 12GB Titan Xp. You couldn’t order my exact review unit today, though — I received it just before Intel launched its desktop-class Kaby Lake processors, which Origin now offers as standard. But configured as close as I could get it with the current options available, a similar Chronos would cost somewhere in the region of $1,892. The cheapest model possible, with an i3 processor, GTX 1050 Ti GPU, 8GB of RAM, and — sadly — no wooden shipping crate, would set you back $1,233, which feels very expensive for the specs. If you're fine spending that much on the Chronos itself, you probably shouldn't skimp on the components; just spending the extra $283 to upgrade to a GTX 1070 and $65 to an i5 would go a long way. What these specs mean in practice is that my Chronos unit is an ultra-solid performer. The GTX 1070 is really the key, here — at this point it’s right in the middle of Nvidia’s range, but as the owner of a higher-end GTX 1080 myself I found little difference in practical use. Right now the extra headroom of the 1080 and 1080 Ti only really come in useful if you have a high refresh rate monitor or for things like 4K and VR supersampling, where you need the ability to push as many pixels as possible. The faster cards should also last a while longer before you’ll want to upgrade, of course. Nvidia’s GTX 1070 is a great choice for the Chronos But in 2017, on my 21:9 monitor with a pixel count above 1080p but below 4K, it’s hard to hit the 1070’s limits. Games like Rise of the Tomb Raider and Doom ran effortlessly at 60 frames per second with the highest graphical preset, and I had no trouble playing advanced VR titles like DeadCore and, amusingly, Chronos at full blast either. On 3DMark’s challenging "Time Spy" DirectX 12 benchmark, the Chronos scored 5,514 — that’s below the 6,733 that 3DMark recommends for 4K gaming, but well above the 3,362 stated as the baseline for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. I would say that the GTX 1070 is probably the best balance of cost and performance that you could find in a GPU right now, and it’s a great choice for a PC like the Chronos. And, while the Chronos would be loud for a games console, its heat and noise output are surprisingly low for a gaming PC of this potency. Until recently, the best-known example of this type of machine was the slightly smaller Alienware X51, which Dell discontinued last summer. I owned one about four years ago and liked it — it did the same job of offering strong performance in a roughly console-sized chassis, and the engineering was impressive. But it didn’t stand the test of time as well as this Chronos ought to. The power supply was too weak to handle serious GPU upgrades, and it was physically difficult to fit a powerful card in the case in the first place; Dell never offered truly high-end stock options. I think if you’re going to spend extra money on a pre-built PC, the Chronos design represents a better compromise — it’s a little bigger than the X51, sure, but it gives much more power out of the gate and more flexibility down the line. The Chronos is bigger than a Nespresso, but smaller than a Sodastream and an Ikea desk lamp. And, coming right after Apple admitted its Mac Pro design was failing many advanced users that require high-performance GPUs, it’s worth pointing out that the Chronos is fantastic when used simply as a Windows 10 desktop computer. The SSD performance in particular stands out, with speedy boot times and an overall sense of responsiveness that I’m not used to from my own PC. It’s a totally different class of machine to a Xeon-powered workstation like the Mac Pro, obviously, but Apple would make an awful lot of people extremely happy if it were to release something with a similar size, shape, and spec sheet to the Chronos. (People have fantasized about such a product, hypothetically dubbed the xMac, for pretty much the entirety of the 21st century.) If you’re concerned about price versus performance, the Chronos is not for you. And personally, I don’t disagree — I myself put a more powerful computer together for a little less last summer. But the Chronos is prettier, smaller, and quieter than my PC, and not everyone is interested in digging through lists of components, and hey — time is money. The time Origin spent assembling this computer and making sure it works well is worth something to whoever is happy to spend money and save time. Like I said before, PC gaming is two separate hobbies. If you don’t want to dive into the technical side of things but do want an attractive, made-in-the-USA machine fully capable of exploring the most vibrant gaming platform in the world, the Chronos is a great option if you can afford it. It shows the flexibility of the Windows ecosystem at its best: a strong product from a boutique manufacturer who has a specific user in mind.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Pro-level IMac Computers Tipped For End Of 2017 Launch Posted: Apr 19 2017, 5:33am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in Rumors | Apple     Hardware rumored to include Intel Xeon processor Professional users who don't like the current Mac Pro computers might have been pumped to hear that Apple would be producing an iMac AIO computer that would cater to the needs of the professionals out there ahead of the new Mac Pro launch. I think that a lot of us expected that new pro iMac to land this summer, but a new rumor making the rounds suggests otherwise. Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock MacRumors reports that the new mainstream consumer iMac computers will enter into production next month and will launch between August and October. The pro-grade iMac version won't launch until the end of 2017 according to the rumor. The consumer versions will land in time for the holiday shopping season. Some specs have been previously leaked for the new iMac machines suggesting that the pro version of the iMac tipped for late 2017 will feature an Intel Xeon 3-1265 v6 processor and options for 16GB to 64GB of ECC RAM. Storage in the pro version is expected to be up to 2TB of NVM Express PCI-e SSD. Rumors also tip a discrete graphics card of unknown type. That discrete graphics card is very nice for pro-users, the iMac AIOs normally get underpowered laptop grade GPUs. Other rumors have pointed to Apple working on a new iMac keyboard that could have the Touch Bar and Touch ID tech from the latest MacBook Pro. However, that keyboard feature for the iMac as said to depend on how well consumers liked the features on the MacBook. New iMac machines could have an 8k display and both USB-C ports and Thunderbolt 3 are expected. This story may contain affiliate links.

The Basin Falls-based products are expected to be launched at the E3 gaming show in the US in June, with the official release at the end of the month. The Skylake-X series has three 140W processors featuring 6-, 8- and 10-core architectures, while the Kaby Lake-X series has an 112W quad-core processor. In August, Intel will release a top-end 12-core Skylake-X processor. Meanwhile, AMD is planning to announce its top-end 16-core Ryzen processor and X399 platform in the third quarter to compete for the gaming market. As for the 14nm-based Coffee Lake-based processors, Intel will initially release several K-series Core i7/i5/i3 processors and its Z370 chipsets in August, and will release more CPUs as well as H370, B360 and H310 chipsets at the end of 2017 or early 2018. Intel has reportedly spent over US$100 million to order five EUV machine sets from ASML, to accelerate its pace of manufacturing. Intel and AMD both declined to comment on unannounced products.

Fluctuations in demand for AMD's products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations; AMD's ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property; AMD depends on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software and other computer platform components to support its business; if AMD loses Microsoft Corporation's support for its products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on AMD's products, its ability to sell its products could be materially adversely affected; and AMD's reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects it to certain risks. Investors are urged to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in AMD's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to AMD's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

(AP Photo/Matthias Rietschel, File) KUWAIT CITY (AP) — Video gaming will be featured as a full sport at the 2022 Asian Games, with competitors in electronic sports set to receive medals for their digital prowess. The Olympic Council of Asia says it will introduce esports to the official program of the Asian Games at Hangzhou, China. It will also be a demonstration sport at the 2018 Asian Games in Palembang, Indonesia. The OCA said the decision reflects "the rapid development and popularity of this new form of sports participation among the youth." The council is collaborating with Alisports, a unit of China's Alibaba Group, to bring esports to the games. No details were given on which video games would be included. The Asian Games features a wide range of traditional Olympic sports along with others containing more regional appeal. Some of the more obscure sports include sepak takraw, which combines features from soccer and volleyball, and kabaddi, a contact team sport that evolved in and is dominated by India. The sports program has also included a variety of martial arts, contract bridge, jet-ski racing and sport climbing.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews Computers Will Apple Release the Mac Mini in 2017? Here’s What to Expect on the Tiny Display-less Computer By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on April 19, 2017 12:48 PM While the Mac Mini is not exactly one of Apple’s best selling computers, it seems that the company is still very much involved in its development. Over the years, the tiny display-less and keyboard-less computer has been left behind in terms of performance and considerable upgrades. With the release of the iMac 2017 looming ever so near, many are now beginning to wonder if Apple is going to release the said computer anytime this year. Fortunately, in the previous round table interview with the Cupertino company, it said that the Mac Mini remains to be an important product for the company. However, the Apple executive declined to give more details about the Mac Mini’s future. Mac Mini overall build Immediately after the said round table discussion, a blog claimed to have first-hand information about the mini computer. According to Pike’s Universum, the Mac Mini will be released with two slightly different models. The entry-level version will retain the original form factor of the computer. However, the blog says that the high-end version of the Mac Mini will have a much taller build. Unfortunately, no details were provided on how much of a change the top-tier model will have compared to the entry-level. Performance and hardware configuration There is no denying that the current generation Mac Mini has lost some degree of performance compared to the previous iteration. The top-tier 2012 Mac Mini has an Intel processor with a total of four cores. Not to mention that the said version of the computer also has the Intel Hyper Threading enabled, thereby giving it a total of eight virtual cores. 2014 Mac Mini (via apple.com) In comparison to the current generation Mac mini, the 2014 model, performance has suffered a bit because Apple has decided to equip it with only a dual-core CPU. Even with Hyper Threading enabled, the 2014 model still lags in performance by almost 50 percent; the 2014 model runs at 3GHz while the 2012 model runs at 2.6GHz. Perhaps the main question is, what exactly are consumers to expect on the next generation Mac Mini? For one, Apple could finally admit the fact that it has miscalculated the performance gains of the current generation Mac Mini. In doing so, there is a chance that it would once again offer quad-core processor-equipped versions of the said computer. Meanwhile, on the top-tier model, since the build is considerably taller or bigger than the entry-level, Apple could then include a discrete GPU. Perhaps, an AMD Radeon R7 350 which has a TDP of 75W and is relatively new. Mac Mini internals showing RAM and exhaust fan (via ifixit.com) Will the top-tier Mac Mini support VR? Unfortunately, virtual reality or VR is a very taxing graphics technology. It requires faster and more powerful graphics cards in order to pull a convincing and acceptable VR gameplay. Due to its size, there is a very slim chance that the Mac Mini will support VR. Nevertheless, it would be quite a feat if Apple manages to include this feature in the upcoming update for the tiny desktop computer. Mac Mini release date and price So far, Apple has not mentioned anything else on the Mac Mini. It has been more than two years since the company has updated the computer. At the moment, Apple is focusing more on both the Mac Pro and the iMac. The former to be released next year while the latter before the end of 2017. That being said, it could be that the Cupertino giant may decide to release the Mac Mini in between the releases for the iMac and the Mac Pro. It is more likely that it will happen early next year than later this year. As for the price, let us assume for a moment that the entry-level version will have a dual-core processor. With that, it can be said that Apple might price the Intel i5 version running at 2.8GHz somewhere around $499. It could then push the price for the top-tier version to $1,099. This is assuming it will have a quad-core Intel i7 chip. For more updates in the Mac Mini, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Opinion: Electron Is Flash For The Desktop Deals: Navigate The Right Way With This Smart Phone Car Mount There's A Potential Solution For Ryzen CPUs Locked Out Of Windows Updates junglist Apr 19, 2017, 3:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  amd Australian Stories intel ryzen windows update Share If you have a Ryzen CPU or Intel Kaby Lake and haven't wanted to upgrade to Windows 10, there's a chance you might be locked out of future Windows updates and need a creative workaround. Luckily one exists, and all the digging around the dll files has already been done for you. Apparently a March 16 update includes the following line in the changelog: Enabled detection of processor generation and hardware support when PC tries to scan or download updates through Windows Update. Github user Zeffy has come up with a few solutions for you, and has documented his whole cyber-sleuthing process. If you want to skip straight to the patches which fix the issue, head here. Zeffy recommends you create a system restore point before beginning. But all the information is included on how these fixes came to be, so you can also try doing them yourself — either because something went wrong, or for education, or for fun. These fixes aren't for novice computer users, but I'll try to include some extra information to bring the skill requirements for this down a notch. The first (as well as easiest & best) method applies to Windows 7 x64 users: Patch wuaueng.dll and change dword_600002EE948 (see this line) which is at file offset 0x26C948, from 0x01 to 0x00. This makes IsDeviceServiceable(void) jump over its entire body and return 1 (supported CPU) immediately. This is my preferred method. Note: these offsets are only for the Windows 7 x64 version. To edit these dll files, you'll need a decompiler like ILSpy, .NET Reflector, or dotPeek. Then you'll have to use a program such as Visual Studio to edit the code. For more information on these tasks, check out the Wikihow. The second method is below: Patch wuaueng.dll and nop out all the instructions highlighted here in IsDeviceServiceable(void), this will enable the usage of the ForceUnsupportedCPU of type REG_DWORD under the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\Test\Scan (you will most likely have to create this registry key). Set this value to 0x00000001 to force unsupported CPUs, and back to 0x00000000 to change the behaviour back to default. You will probably need to restart your PC or restart the wuauserv service in order for changes to apply. This behaviour is undocumented and could be removed in future updates.

Even though it would cost more to collect the GST than the tax would raise the government wants to kick start this exciting new initiative (not) on 1 July 2017.

Supplier Asus www.asus.com.au Price $2199 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel 7th Gen Core i7-7700 (quad-core, HyperThreading, 4.2GHz Turbo); GeForce GTX 1060; 16GB DDR4 memory; 256GB Samsung M.2 SSD Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Mini-PCs are all the rage. We’ve been inundated with mini-PCs of late, with tiny towers packing SLI systems, shoeboxes that are VR ready, and now this relatively affordable PS4-sized package. We can thank both Intel and Nvidia for dropping the energy requirements – and resulting thermal output – of its products for this revolution in PC shrinkage. And yet, we still end up paying quite a lot more for a system that underperforms similarly priced, yet larger, PC gaming towers. The Asus ROG GR8 II is the perfect example of this quandary. With an interior capacity of just four litres, this PC is smaller than a Playstation 4. You might think that makes it the perfect PC to stash in your AV unit, but there’s a slight hitch. It can only be operated in an upright position. The entire cooling solution has been designed for the unit to be operated vertically, drawing in fresh cool air from the bottom, and expelling the hot air from the rear and top. Lay it down horizontally and that design goes out the window, yet even when vertical it’s a little loud, measuring 51dB during our sound test. It’s a shame, as the design is rather eye-catching, and would look lovely next to your amplifier.  Given the small size, we can’t expect a huge amount of I/O options. Adorning the front are twin USB 3.0 ports, along with the usual mic-in/headphone out jacks. Looking to the rear reveals twin USB 2.0, one USB 3.1 Type A and one USB 3.1 Type C; sadly the latter does not appear to support Thunderbolt as there’s no mention of it in the specs, where it would usually be called out in bright, bold letters. Video is handled courtesy of the custom Asus graphics card within, with twin HDMI 2.0b and a single DP1.4. Audio can be delivered via the rear over S/PDIF optical, or a single 3.5mm audio jack. Finally there’s a single Gigabit Ethernet connector, and Kensington lock, though why you’d need the lock in the environment this thing is going to live in seems a bit redundant.  As well as the standard Ethernet connector, full 802.11ac Wi-Fi is integrated, and it’s nice to see that it supports MIMO. However, it’s a rather basic 2x2 antennae setup, so don’t expect to make the most of your AC5300 router. However, this can be combined with the unit’s Ethernet via Asus’ interesting GameFirst IV technology. This teams all of your network connections to deliver maximum throughput, so you can combine both the wired and wireless connections. Looking inside the case reveals a box that doesn’t offer a lot of room for upgrades thanks to its crowded capacity. In fact, Asus has had to build a custom version of the graphics card to fit, which is based on Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1060 GPU. This has been paired with Intel’s high-end i7-7700 CPU, which seems a bit of an odd mix. This is basically one of Intel’s flagship CPUs, hitting a Boost speed of 4.2GHz across all four HyperThreaded cores. It’s a problem we’ve seen in other systems recently – combining a top-end CPU with a mid or lower end GPU. We’d have much preferred to see a slightly slower CPU such as the 7500 paired up with the much more powerful GeForce GTX 1070. Sure, the  price would jump by a couple of hundred dollars, but the performance would be significantly improved. 16GB of RAM is fine, but the long-term storage is a bit on the scarce side, with just a single 256GB Samsung M.2 drive. A spare 2.5-inch drive bay will accommodate a larger SSD or HDD, but you’re going to need to fork out for that yourself.  Given the price, it’d be easy to build a faster system in a full-sized case for the same price, but that’s not really applicable for those who don’t want to get their hands dirty. Still, we wish Asus had gone for a slightly more sensible CPU/GPU balancing act. Related Reviews Review: Corsair One Pro gaming PC Review: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti - single card 4k gaming!

Furthermore, the Cupertino company also acknowledges the fact that most users of the iMac are professionals. In line with this, Apple is revamping the all-in-one desktop computer to cater to professional users. According to Digitimes, Apple is already preparing the manufacturing of the iMac 2017. In a report posted yesterday, the website said that just like current generation iMac, the new iMacs will be manufactured by Quanta Computers starting on May 2017. Unfortunately, the report did not specify exactly how many units Apple ordered from Quanta Computer for the upcoming line of iMacs. Perhaps the most promising feature of the new iMac 2017 is the hardware focused on professional use. Last year, some reports suggested that the iMac could potentially sport an Intel Xeon processor instead of a normal desktop version. It seems like this will not be a reality, at least according to the Digitimes report. 2015 iMac (via apple.com) The report yesterday said that the iMac 2017 will sport the later Intel Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor. At the moment, it is still unclear if it will support newer server-grade processors with more than four cores. However, one thing for sure is that the new iMac will finally support ECC type RAM. This will give the upcoming iMacs a more robust build as these memories have in-built error detection and correction. In addition to the Xeon processor and ECC memory, it looks like the iMac 2017 will be the first iMac to finally move to an entirely NVMe storage technology. For those who are unaware, the current generation iMacs still rely on spinning disk hard drives. However, it has an option to include a second NVMe drive on the iMac. This makes use of the Fusion technology from Apple. The new storage configuration will surely give the iMac 2017 an unprecedented increase in data throughput as NVMe storage is known for very fast read and write speeds. At the moment, it is still uncertain when the actual release of the new iMacs will be. But since Apple already said that they will come this year, once can only surmise that it will be between September and October; either on or after the launch of the iPhone 8.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Tech Roundup: QCOM Answers Apple, GOOGL Answers DoL, WDC Objects Shutterstock photo Last week saw Qualcomm QCOM filing counterclaims against Apple AAPL in their ongoing patent-related lawsuit, Alphabet GOOGL defending itself against gender inequality allegations by the Labor Department, Western Digital WDC objecting to Toshiba’s chip unit sale to Broadcom AVGO and much more. So let’s jump to the details- Qualcomm Replies to Apple In counterclaims filed in a California Federal court, Qualcomm has indicated that Apple is playing needlessly dirty in an attempt to keep costs down. The point of contention, as has often been in the past, is standard essential patents (SEPs), on the basis of which much of modern day telecommunications takes place. The companies that contributed technology to form the standard are required to license the technology to others on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. But what constitutes FRAND has been debated about a lot because companies offering this technology obviously want to be paid more, especially from companies like Apple that make super normal profits. While on the other hand, the companies that license want to point to all their other innovations built on top of the standards and argue that the standards are just a very small part of the end product and so don’t deserve a good price.  Qualcomm’s complaints are mainly about Apple failing to engage in good faith negotiations over its 3G and 4G patents while also seeking to use both these and its 5G technology at a fraction of the cost that other smartphone vendors are apparently willing to pay. „Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well-established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm” reads the complaint. It also says that Apple made „false statements” to the Korean FTC and encouraged Samsung to go after it to force Qualcomm to change its licensing model. The KFTC investigation ultimately led to an $865 million fine on Qualcomm. Note that Apple doesn’t use Qualcomm technology directly but through its manufacturing partners, which have licensing deals with Qualcomm, some going back to before Apple started using its technology. If Apple withholds payments to its partners they might hold out on payments to Qualcomm. Qualcomm may be able to get its agreements enforced in court but it leads to unnecessary and wasteful litigation on multiple levels. This is exactly what Apple is doing according to Qualcomm. Qualcomm further says that Apple „acted to prevent Qualcomm from revealing to consumers the extent to which iPhones with Qualcomm’s chipsets outperformed iPhones with Intel’s chipsets” and later falsely claimed that there was „no discernible difference.” Google’s Fight with the Labor Department The U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) has made a sweeping statement that it had „found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce” and DOL Regional Director Janette Wipper said the agency had received „compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.” In a detailed response to the allegation, Google’s VP of people operations, Eileen Naughton said that the claims had been made „without any supporting data or methodology.” She also explained the salary analysis system Google currently employs: „Each year, we suggest an amount for every employee’s new compensation (consisting of base salary, bonus and equity) based on role, job level, job location as well as current and recent performance ratings…The analysts who calculate the suggested amounts do not have access to employees’ gender data. An employee’s manager has limited discretion to adjust the suggested amount, providing they cite a legitimate adjustment rationale.” The model then measures individual salary calculations against those received by their peers which is done to eliminate „statistically significant differences between men’s and women’s compensation”. Naughton also said that Google’s methodology is available to other businesses if they want to test their own compensation practices for equal pay. This has been going on since Sep 2016, after which a case was filed in January, asking for its compensation data. Things came to a head after Google failed to comply with a routine audit. Western Digital Objects Toshiba is under pressure to sell its memory chip business after accounting irregularities related to its Westinghouse nuclear project put it into financial trouble. But Western Digital, which recently acquired SanDisk, is in a JV with Toshiba and has also invested billions of dollars in that business. WDC says that Toshiba didn’t have the legal right to split the chip business and it also deserves prior and confidential negotiating rights in case of its sale as a result of this agreement. It also objects to a sale to Broadcom, despite it being the highest bidder because of unsavory dealings with that company.

This was the 10 th straight quarter of PC shipment declines. Business PCs did better than consumer PCs as expected. The spoilers remain largely the same: shift to mobile devices and emerging markets, and a longer replacement cycle.

The BIS reportedly says that this phone will be different from international versions. Apple recently discounted the 4-inch phone to Rs. 19,999, which is expected to help it gain share in the mid-range market. Wistron-owned ICT Service Management Solutions, based in Yeshwantpur, Benguluru has been commissioned for the manufacturing. MKM Optimistic on Alibaba Cloud Growth : MKM analysts have issued a highly optimistic report about Alibaba’s BABA cloud business. They estimate that the business could be worth $20 billion today with the potential to grow to a $65-70 billion valuation over the next 4-5 years. The optimism is driven by data supplied by the analysts: 60K developers are working on the platform, AliCloud has 765K paying customers (up 100% year over year), it has 2.8 million total customers; after large enterprises, which use state-owned infrastructure, AliCloud is the largest private player with 70 of the largest 100 startups using its services. Also, Alibaba has been investing in the business for the past eight years, which is reportedly three years short of Amazon and four years longer than Alphabet’s Google. New Technology/Products AMD Ryzen 5 Release : AMD started selling its Zen-based Ryzen 5 processors (four core/eight thread and six core/twelve thread) into the channel some time back and now, these products are available to consumers. The processors reportedly compare well with Intel’s Kaby Lake-based i5 chips (four core/four thread) going by the considerable number of reviews comparing the two. As may be expected, Intel’s chip is more expensive when you consider the fact that it has fewer threads and cores, but single-core performance is better. On a net basis, while AMD still lags Intel slightly on performance, it’s packing in more compute power at lower costs that is likely to go down well with consumers. Gamers are the biggest drivers of consumer PC sales right now so both Intel and AMD have their work cut out.  Microsoft Tools for Hybrid Cloud Migration : Microsoft MSFT has come out with three new tools that in very broad terms, will help enterprises evaluate the savings generated from moving corporate workloads to Azure, the Azure Hybrid Use Benefit in the Azure Management Portal that can save them up to 40% on their Windows server licenses and Azure Site Recovery to facilitate the process of migrating virtual machines to Azure. Microsoft is en route to delivering annualized commercial cloud revenue of $20 billion by 2018 and its pace of growth indicates that the once unreal target is now within reach. Microsoft Launching Minecraft Marketplace : The Minecraft development team apparently can’t keep up with the demand for customizations and levels and so it’s getting on board independent developers that will supply these and other customizations through the in-game store. The good thing for developers is that Minecraft maker Mojang, now owned by Microsoft is willing to pay out 50% of what the creation generates, with 30% going to Apple, Google, or Microsoft’s app stores and itself retaining the rest. Minecraft is an insanely popular title, having sold 121 million copies worldwide, with 55 million unique monthly players (figures from Microsoft). As of now, nine businesses have been approved for selling feature packs with prices ranging from $1-10 per creation. Microsoft will sell Minecraft Coins that can be used to buy items.  Microsoft intends to eventually make the purchases sync across devices and platforms. Microsoft Ends Support for Vista : Microsoft has officially withdrawn support to its unsuccessful Windows Vista launched in 2009. While some people did buy systems based on the OS, most were dissatisfied and what’s more, Vista was the reason that most XP users simply refused to move on. All that is well behind us and both Windows 7 and Windows 10 have been received well. Microsoft says, Windows Vista users „will no longer receive new security updates, non-security hotfixes, free or paid assisted support options, or online technical content updates from Microsoft.” So that ends the matter. Google Home Services, Food Delivery App for India : Google has launched an app called Aero in Bengaluru and Mumbai, India that will allow people to connect with home service providers like plumbers, electricians and the like. It will also allow users to search for nearby restaurants and schedule food delivery. M&A and Collaborations Microsoft, eBay, Tencent Invest in India’s Flipkart : Microsoft, eBay and China’s Tencent joined earlier investors Naspers Group, Tiger Global Management, Accel Partners and DST Global for a share in Flipkart, India’s largest ecommerce company. The three companies together invested $1.4 billion. Ebay sold its Indian operations to Flipkart and added $500 million for its share in the company. The company is now valued at $11.6 billion. Microsoft Buys Deis : Microsoft spent an undisclosed amount of money to buy San Francisco-based software startup Deis that was reportedly acquired by Engine Yard back in 2015. The startup has developed an open source tool based on the Kubernetes container management system that Google developed and then open sourced. Microsoft initially agreed to work with Google on Kubernetes back in 2014 but also backed competing platforms Mesos and Docker Swarm. But Kubernetes has gained ground so in February, Kubernetes became available on the Azure Container service as well. The reason this is all so significant is because containerization is extremely important for information stored in the cloud since it creates a virtual box of code that can be shared and moved between applications and across clouds as needed. „At Microsoft, we’ve seen explosive growth in both interest and deployment of containerized workloads on Azure, and we’re committed to ensuring Azure is the best place to run them,” Scott Guthrie, EVP cloud and enterprise group at Microsoft wrote in a blog post. Google to Invest In LG Display : South Korea’s Electronic Times has reported that Google has offered to pay LG Display up to $880 million (one trillion KRW) as its contribution toward a production line for flexible OLED panels for use in second-generation Pixel phones. LG is considering the offer. Google’s Pixel, which has the appearance and features of a premium device and has been marketed as such, will fall back in the race with Samsung and Apple on features if it doesn’t get some OLED screens of its own. So Google’s needs are clear: it also doesn’t need to get into a deal with Samsung, which uses OLED in its own phones and is also in an agreement to supply to Apple. So it’s trying to find another supplier.  Some Numbers Facebook Announces Monthly Advertisers : Facebook FB has announced that the number of advertisers on its platform has grown from 4 million to 5 million between September and now. Businesses with mobile pages now total 65 million while businesses with Instagram profiles are up to 8 million. Among the 5 million advertisers, the biggest industries are e-commerce, entertainment/media and retail. Unsurprisingly, around 75% percent of advertisers are in its fastest-growing markets, which are India, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Nearly 50% of advertisers create ads on mobile devices. Facebook Messenger Users : Facebook Messenger, which the company spun out in 2014 and then enhanced with games, a chat bot platform, voice calling, video calling, as well as a revamped camera with masks, frames, stickers and effects now has 1.2 million users. That’s up from 700 million users when it was spun out and 600 million users on the hot Facebook-owned platform Instagram. Sell These Stocks.

Peter Wennink, ASML's president and CEO, told analysts following the company's first quarter financial report Wednesday that the company continues to make progress toward its goals for EUV of 125 wafers per hour productivity and 90 percent light-source availability. Wennik alluded to presentations at the recent SPIE Advanced Lithography Conference from Intel, Samsung and TSMC showing their latest results with EUV systems and the status of the EUV infrastructure. "And while there is still work to be done on things like the pellicle, there appear to be no major roadblocks for EUV insertion in the timeframes as indicated by our customers," Wennik said. After years of often frustrating and painfully slow development, EUV is now poised to be deployed in production in the next couple years beginning with the 7nm node by the likes of Intel, TSMC and Samsung -- all of which invested in ASML as part of a customer investment program to help the company develop the technology. ASML said Wednesday it has an order backlog in the pipeline of 21 NXE:3400B EUV systems—its most advanced EUV tool which started shipping this year—worth 2.3 billion euro (about $2.46 billion). ASML also has 14 older 3300 and 3350 systems in the field, most of which are expected to be upgraded. G. Dan Hutecheson, CEO of semiconductor industry market watcher VLSI Research Inc., told EE Times that ASML's report didn't contain an unexpected news about EUV lithography. "It’s pretty much moving along as planned," Hutecheson said. "Of course, the big issue now is can you get it to where it’s really systematically reliable and have it fully integrated into manufacturing, and that’s what everyone is working on now."

Supplier Pioneer Computers www.pioneercomputers.com.au Price $2678 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel i5-6500 CPU • Nvidia GTX1050 Ti GPU • 16GB of DDR4 RAM • 240GB SATA SSD • 32-inch 1080p curved LCD Tweet Email this Print this Feedback A highly configurable, big screen, all-in-one PC that’s decent value compared to the competition. Once upon a time, an all-in-one PC meant weak specs with a high price. They were more like a piece of furniture than a computer. These days, with much more energy efficient CPUs and GPUs around, all-in-one computers don’t necessarily equate to something simply to look nice in your living room – they’re useful too.  Pioneer Computers (no, not the Pioneer you’re thinking of, a different Pioneer) new DreamVision 32-inch Curved All-in-One VR PC X32 aims to be a gaming powerhouse without the big bulky tower clogging up your home’s Feng Shui. The model tested contains a B150 chipset motherboard, Intel i5-6500 CPU, Nvidia GTX1050 Ti GPU, 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 240GB SATA SSD. The LCD is a 1080p 32-inch curved panel. All fairly stock standard stuff. There’s loads of configuration options on the Pioneer Computers website, including a variety of CPUs, upgrades to RAM and range of additional hard drive options to suit your needs. It’s not surprising there’s so many configuration options, as unlike most all-in-one computers, the guts are not some unique motherboard or parts designed to keep the size down. It’s literally an ITX motherboard screwed in behind an LCD. The GPU isn’t even internally connected to the LCD - a short DVI cable runs out from the monitor’s enclosure, into the GPU’s external monitor socket. There’s a regular SFX power supply and a full size PCIe GPU too.  There’s nothing particularly wrong with this setup, but it is a bit tacky and ergonomically, accessing the ports is a massive pain, as everything faces down towards your desk. At least there’s two USB ports on the side of the display. There’s also no VESA mount options for anyone who would like to hook this up to a monitor arm or mount it on a wall with a bracket.  The upside of this approach however, is that replacement parts should be a piece of cake to find, as there’s nothing proprietary. You can go to your local PC store and pick up bits to replace or upgrade it. An unusual surprise with the DreamVision is a little lever that can be pulled out of the side of the case, which one could assume is an antenna for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but no, it’s simply a place to rest your headphones. Rather oddly, there’s no built-in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The LCD’s quality is nothing to write home about. It looks fine, but it’s a rather low resolution 1080p. Good for TV and games, but not so much for day to day web browsing and productivity. Curved screens are primarily a gimmick at this size, so besides looking cool there’s no real benefit here.  Performance wise, there’s also nothing particularly special. In the PCMark 8 Home Conventional 3.0 benchmark, the DreamVision scores a respectable 3975 and in 3DMark Cloud Gate benchmark, it performs on par with other GTX1050 Ti machines, achieving a score of 17542. Pioneer’s support options are worth a mention too. The standard 1 year return to base warranty is typical of the industry, but for $49 extra, you can add on-site pickup, so you don’t have to pack this big boy up and worry about it in the back of some courier’s van.  There aren’t that many big screen all-in-one PCs on the market. There’s plenty of 24-inch and 27-inch units, but when it comes to displays over 30 inches, the Pioneer DreamVision’s only competition is the very impressive HP Envy 34-A001A, which retails for $3,999 - much more than the Pioneer’s $2,826 for an X32 configured like the HP. Despite the initial cheap feeling of the DreamVision 32-inch Curved All-in-One VR PC X32, it is great value for money if you’re after a big screen all-in-one computer. The 32-inch display makes it perfect to use with a USB TV tuner to sit in a bedroom and be a television, as well as a competent games machine.  Pioneer also sell a non-curved 32-inch LCD all-in-one computer, the DreamVision 32-inch All-in-One Gaming PC 6X, that is a few hundred dollars cheaper, making it a much better buy than this machine. Curved displays just aren’t that amazing to justify the extra cost. But if you actually want an all-in-one computer with a curved LCD it’s going to be hard to find one any cheaper than the DreamVision 32-inch Curved All-in-One VR PC X32.

TIM SHEEHAN tsheehan@fresnobee.com Local April 19, 2017 6:55 PM Columnist Thomas Friedman says big forces are changing things in Fresno and the world By Tim Sheehan tsheehan@fresnobee.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Economics, politics, ethics, employment and communities are being greatly affected by three major global forces – and places like Fresno are squarely in the path of that change. That’s the message that Thomas L. Friedman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The New York Times and best-selling author, brought to an audience Wednesday evening at Fresno State’s Save Mart Center. Friedman’s lecture, which was free to the public, was sponsored by The Fresno Bee, Valley PBS and Channel 24 (KSEE). Friedman told reporters before his talk that it would focus on themes in his latest book, “Thank You for Being Late: An Optimist’s Guide to Thriving in the Age of Accelerations.” “What I argue is that it’s actually three big things happening at the same time: Market, Mother Nature and Moore’s Law,” Friedman said. “The market is digital globalization – not your grandfather’s globalization, which was containers on ships and airplanes – the way everything is being globalized and digitized (by) Facebook, Twitter, PayPal, etc.” What I argue is that it’s actually three big things happening at the same time: Market, Mother Nature and Moore’s Law. Columnist and author Thomas L. Friedman “Mother Nature is climate change, biodiversity loss and population growth,” he added. “And Moore’s Law was coined in 1965 by Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel, who said the speed and power of microchips will double every 24 months. But now it’s closer to 30 or 32 months … and it’s the driver of all technology.” If one were to chart each of these factors, Friedman said, “it would look like a hockey stick” with a sharp rise compressed into a short amount of time. “The three together are what are shaping more things and more places in more ways in more days,” Friedman said. “More technology drives more globalization, (and) more globalization actually drives more climate issues and more solutions to all these problems at the same time.” Friedman acknowledged that he’s not a fan of President Donald Trump, who campaigned last year on a platform to “Make America Great Again.” That slogan would seemingly make Trump no fan of globalization, but “he is – he just wants it to be tilted more our way,” Friedman said. Globalization is a key concern to places like Fresno, Friedman added. “In Fresno, I suspect you’re exporting a lot of agriculture all over the world,” he said. “So this community is deeply affected by all those trends, and the book is really about how all of those trends are reshaping the workplace, politics, geopolitics, ethics and community.” Because of the changing pace of technology, the days when when someone could make a middle-class living with middle-range skills are long gone, as is the era where one can earn a college degree and remain comfortably in one career with one company for 30 years. “You can still be in the middle class with a high-wage job, but not a middle-skills job,” Friedman said. What digitization and globalization of technology are creating is an employment environment in which workers need to be lifelong learners to keep up with the skills needed for a changing workplace. “If technology is changing every three to five years, we’re required to learn all kinds of new things,” he said. “People need to retool themselves so much faster.” Tim Sheehan: 559-441-6319, @TimSheehanNews LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you   Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 5 hours ago African lion cub, Kijani, is a bundle of energy at Fresno Chaffee Zoo 1:33 5 hours ago African lion cub, Kijani, is a bundle of energy at Fresno Chaffee Zoo 1:21 6 hours ago Family remembers Mark Gassett after Tuesday shooting 0:39 8 hours ago Shooter laughed after killing man, witness says View More Video Local Critics hold a town hall to talk issues with Rep.

But there's one area where virtual reality (VR) is lacking: human emotion. The technology doesn't effectively relay nonverbal cues like facial expressions between VR users. However, there's a company that plans to change that. And investors are lining up to get in on the action, investing $100 million in the last funding round. MindMaze, a Switzerland-based tech company founded in 2011, created "MASK," which synchronizes physical emotions with digital emotions. "By syncing the physical body in all its expressive capacity with a digital avatar, MASK allows developers to build playable characters that emote in pre-real-time," MindMaze said on its website. According to TechnologyReview.com, MASK recognizes 10 different expressions, some of which include smirking, grimacing, and eyebrow-raising. And investors are buying into this being the next big trend in VR… In February 2016, MindMaze raised $100 million, led by multinational conglomerate Hinduja Group. That brought MindMaze's valuation to $1 billion. Video MindMaze CEO Tej Tadi Presents MindLeap New technology like this is at the center of the next big trend that Money Morning Director of Tech & Venture Capital Research Michael A. Robinson is calling Neural Imprinting. In Robinson's 35-year career, he's been a board member of a venture capital firm and an advisor for two more. And he's been watching this trend closely, as some of the most influential companies and investors are rushing to fund this exciting new technology. Microsoft's CEO jumped in with a $150 million investment, saying this technology has "mind-blowing potential." Google headed up a funding round worth $542 million. After spending less than two hours with this technology, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg invested $2.1 billion. By 2020, Robinson believes just one major factor in this Neural Imprinting trend could create $2.86 trillion in new wealth. Here's how you can take part… Watch This One VR Stock Right Now In 2016, Neural Imprinting devices generated $70 million in revenue. For 2017, they could generate $684 million. That's an increase of 877% in just one year. And because this one tiny company in Silicon Valley has 7,300 patents for a key component behind this technology, every major player in tech is beating down its doors. Already, this company has established contracts with Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL), Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC), and Cisco Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO). To make things even better, this company has been selected to take part in a $425 million project with the U.S. Department of Energy. Of course, like any investment, there are risks involved. That's why Robinson has thoroughly vetted the opportunity and would like to tell you everything you need to know about this company. But before Robinson's full presentation, we want to make sure Money Morning readers know more about our Director of Tech & Venture Capital Research and his many accomplishments. Who Is Tech Guru Michael A. Robinson? Michael is one of our most prominent and respected investing "gurus" here at Money Map Press – and for good reason. He is one of the top financial analysts working today. Make no mistake: Michael's ideas are completely his own. He's a true original. He works solely for Money Map Press… and receives absolutely no compensation from companies he writes about. His book "Overdrawn: The Bailout of American Savings" was a prescient look at the anatomy of the nation's S&L crisis, long before the word "bailout" became part of our daily lexicon. He's a Pulitzer Prize-nominated writer and reporter, lauded by the Columbia Journalism Review for his aggressive style. Michael's 30-year track record as a leading tech analyst has garnered him rave reviews, too. As editor of the financial newsletter American Wealth Underground, Michael amassed an amazing track record using rigorous investing. The first analyst to uncover the rare earth mineral crisis, he amassed cumulative gains of 990% for his readers in just 16 months. His research is world class, too. The Oakland Tribune, Detroit News, The San Francisco Examiner, The Kansas City Times, Wealth Magazine, and American Banker all publish his reporting. He has appeared on Larry King's syndicated radio show. Robinson has an honors economics degree from the University of Missouri at Columbia with a minor in journalism. And today, we're excited to share his thoroughly vetted opportunity. You can see the full presentation, right here. New Technology Could Create $2.86 Trillion in Wealth: The revenue growth is shocking. Last year, with a very limited release, it generated $70 million in revenue. This year, it's on track for $684 million. But over the next three years, the core technology could create $2.86 trillion in new American wealth. And this isn't just for the billionaires of the world. Many everyday Americans could become millionaires as well. Click here to see how you could be one of them… Follow Money Morning on Twitter @moneymorning, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news concerning the upcoming iMac update. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Tuesday. Source: Apple New iMac: A new rumor claims that AAPL will release its new iMac updates during the third quarter of 2017, reports DigiTimes. According to the rumor, the company will launch two updates to the iMac line this year. These will be new versions of the 21.5-inch and a 27-inch iMac computers. Quanta Computer will reportedly begin production of the new computers in May. The rumor also says the new iMac models will come with Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor and the latest discrete graphics card. iPhone 8: More rumors backup previous rumors of iPhone 8 features, Bloomberg notes. The rumors claim that the tech company will release a new high-end device this year with a screen that takes up almost the entire front of the device. This will allow it to have a display about the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus, but on a device that is roughly as big as an iPhone 7. The rumors also say that the device may face a delay due to supply issues. The display may also be curved and Touch ID could be moved to below it. Headphone Jack Adapter: Rumor has it that Apple will still include its headphone hack adapter with its 2017 smartphones, reports MacRumors. However, it says that it is unlikely the tech will include the device with its 2018 models. Previous rumors have claimed that AAPL will get rid of the adapter this year. Apple started including the adapter with its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus smartphones. These were the first of its smartphones to ditch the 3.5 mm headphone jack.

Military Military: The Intel VIDEO: Marines airlift 1,100 desert tortoises Marines airlift 1,100 desert tortoises The Marines are using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the Mojave in make way for an expansion of desert training grounds. The Marines are using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the Mojave in make way for an expansion of desert training grounds. Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter More than 1,000 desert tortoises are taking a trip with the Marine Corps this month. The Marines are using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the Mojave in make way for an expansion of desert training grounds. During the two-week long process, the hubcap-sized tortoises are being loaded into plastic containers, which are then stacked and strapped to a helicopter. More than 1,000 desert tortoises get a Marine Corps airlift. Their new home will be swaths of federal land to the north and southeast of the Twentynine Palms base, Marine officials said. The areas were deemed far enough away that the tortoises wouldn’t migrate back to the original habitat. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day The cost of the whole effort, including a 30-year monitoring program to ensure the health of the federally protected species, is $50 million. The Marines at the Twentynine Palms base want to be able to practice large-scale exercises with live fire and combined-arms maneuvering. The campaign goes back to 2008, when the Corps began studying how to do it without breaking environmental law. The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act handed land formerly managed by the Bureau of Land Management to the Defense Department. Tortoises living on that land are now being moved. In March 2016, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a notice of intent to sue, arguing that the federal government failed to fully examine how the move might harm the tortoises. However, the move went ahead this month after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told the Marine Corps that its review wouldn’t be done before the spring window for the move, Marine Corps officials said. It’s not the first time that the Corps has been in the tortoise-moving business. In 2006, the Twentynine Palms base relocated 17 adult tortoises in order to build a training range. Marine officials say no tortoises died during three years of post-move monitoring. This time, Marine Corps biologists will monitor tortoises intensely for the first five years. Then monitoring requirements will diminish over time until the 30-year obligation is met, officials said. About 235 juveniles too small for relocation are being admitted to the base’s “headstart facility,” where they will remain until they grow large enough to better survive on their own.

Cloudera’s 2014 Series F funding round gave the company a valuation of $4.1 billion. In filings with the SEC, Cloudera revealed revenues of $261 million for fiscal 2016, up 57 percent from $166 million the previous year. The company lost over $186 million in 2016, however, $203 million in 2015, and $135 million in 2014. Further, the company says in its Form S-1 that it expects net losses to continue “for the foreseeable future.” The filing lists competition from “legacy data management product providers” HP, IBM, Oracle, and Teradata, public cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, and open source companies Hortonworks and MapR. See also: How to Prepare your Infrastructure for the World of Big Data As other reports noted, the market cap for Cloudera could hurt one of its largest investors: Intel, whose investment in Cloudera totals over $1 billion since it was founded 2008, according to Crunchbase. According to Forbes, “in May 2014, Intel took a 22 percent stake in Cloudera — investing about $766 million at $30.92 a share — when the company was valued at $4 billion.” Intel and Cloudera jointly developed machine learning intelligence threat platform Apache Spot, which was announced in September. IPO valuations for tech companies lower than previous funding rounds, or “IPO down rounds,” have previously been identified as possible trend by TechCrunch, but are not necessarily major cause for market concern. Application performance management company AppDynamics was set for an IPO with the same share price range as Cloudera and a similar valuation in January before announcing its surprise sale to Cisco for $3.7 billion. Cloudera is expected to hold its IPO in the next several weeks on the New York Stock Exchange as “CLDR.” Previous Article Liquid Web Helps WordPress Customers Visualize Site Changes with New Tool Next Article IBM Sales Miss Shows Return to Growth Not Without Roadblocks View all Cloud Computing articles WHIR NewslettersSubscribe Now and Get Our Exclusive Report on "The Hosting Infrastructure Ecosystem" WHIR Daily Web Hosting Newsletter European Web Hosting Newsletter Email* Country* Please select United States United Kingdom Canada India Netherlands Australia South Africa France Germany Singapore Sweden Brazil -------------- Afghanistan Åland Islands Albania Algeria American Samoa Andorra Angola Anguilla Antarctica Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Aruba Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bermuda Bhutan Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Bouvet Island Brazil Brit/Indian Ocean Terr.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 19, 2017 9:00 AM PT Credit: Samsung More like this Everything we think we know about the Galaxy S8 Samsung Galaxy S8: What we know so far Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+: Great enterprise phones with potential to be better Video How to create a mobile hotspot with your Android smartphone Samsung is now ready to produce faster and even more power-efficient chips than the ones it uses the latest Galaxy S8 smartphones. In the fourth quarter, Samsung will start producing chips on the 10-nanometer LPP (low-power plus) process. These chips are faster than existing chips because of an enhanced 3D structure. On average, the new chips made on the new process will be 10 percent faster and 15 percent more power efficient than the first wave of 10-nanometer chips like the Samsung Exynos 8895, which is one of two processors used in the S8 devices. [ The votes are in: Which mobile data provider is best? ] Samsung's announcement is a sign that it has received orders to make chips, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Samsung hasn't announced customers for the new chips. But one client could be Qualcomm, which has its Snapdragon 835 chips in the Galaxy S8. They are made in Samsung's existing 10-nm fabs. A successor to the Snapdragon 835 could be made on the new manufacturing 10-nm LPP node, though Qualcomm hasn't announced anything yet. Faster chips add more capabilities to mobile devices while preserving battery life. For example, the Snapdragon 835 and the Exynos 8895 in the Galaxy S8 smartphones handle virtual reality applications better than their predecessors, and they also have special circuitry for artificial intelligence tasks. Samsung and Intel are in a dog fight to claim the crown of the world's most advanced chip manufacturer. Samsung is the first to 10-nm, while Intel delayed its move due to manufacturing issues. Intel is still making chips using the 14-nm process and will release its unprecedented fourth chip architecture on its process. The fight is largely focused on smartphone chips. "Over the past 15 years, the industry has shifted from being driven by PCs and servers. It is now being driven by mobile devices," McGregor said. Intel is moving to 10-nm later this year but even at 14-nm holds a technical edge over Samsung, McGregor said. However, Samsung is catching up fast, he added.

Military Military: The Intel VIDEO: Marines airlift 1,100 desert tortoises Marines airlift 1,100 desert tortoises The Marines are using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the Mojave in make way for an expansion of desert training grounds. The Marines are using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the Mojave in make way for an expansion of desert training grounds. Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter More than 1,000 desert tortoises are taking a trip with the Marine Corps this month. The Marines are using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the Mojave in make way for an expansion of desert training grounds. During the two-week long process, the hubcap-sized tortoises are being loaded into plastic containers, which are then stacked and strapped to a helicopter. More than 1,000 desert tortoises get a Marine Corps airlift. Their new home will be swaths of federal land to the north and southeast of the Twentynine Palms base, Marine officials said. The areas were deemed far enough away that the tortoises wouldn’t migrate back to the original habitat. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day The cost of the whole effort, including a 30-year monitoring program to ensure the health of the federally protected species, is $50 million. The Marines at the Twentynine Palms base want to be able to practice large-scale exercises with live fire and combined-arms maneuvering. The campaign goes back to 2008, when the Corps began studying how to do it without breaking environmental law. The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act handed land formerly managed by the Bureau of Land Management to the Defense Department. Tortoises living on that land are now being moved. In March 2016, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a notice of intent to sue, arguing that the federal government failed to fully examine how the move might harm the tortoises. However, the move went ahead this month after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told the Marine Corps that its review wouldn’t be done before the spring window for the move, Marine Corps officials said. It’s not the first time that the Corps has been in the tortoise-moving business. In 2006, the Twentynine Palms base relocated 17 adult tortoises in order to build a training range. Marine officials say no tortoises died during three years of post-move monitoring. This time, Marine Corps biologists will monitor tortoises intensely for the first five years. Then monitoring requirements will diminish over time until the 30-year obligation is met, officials said. About 235 juveniles too small for relocation are being admitted to the base’s “headstart facility,” where they will remain until they grow large enough to better survive on their own.

(AMD) Stock Still Has Some Pop Left Don't let analysts shake you from your conviction. AMD stock still has plenty more upside to deliver. By Tom Taulli, InvestorPlace Writer & IPO Playbook Editor  |  Apr 18, 2017, 11:05 am EDT     Popular Posts: 3 Reasons Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Is Still a Lemon International Business Machines Corp.

(AMD) Stock Still Has Some Pop Left Recent Posts: 3 Reasons Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Is Still Dead Money International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock Punished After Dismal First Quarter Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Still Has Some Pop Left View All Posts Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has been hitting some turbulence lately. That’s largely thanks to Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari, who threw cold water on shares with a “sell” rating on AMD stock. Source: AMD Investors took note, scattering to send shares down by 6%. No surprise — Advanced Micro is hyper-sensitive, especially considering how many investors are sitting on triple-digit gains. Why take the risk? Hari offered up several reasons for his bearishness on AMD stock. One is that the valuation appears to be out of sync with the underlying fundamentals; Hari thinks that a fair value is $11. It’s not a crazy argument, as Advanced Micro has spiked from less than $2 in March 2015 to the $13 area and now trades at 43 times forward earnings estimates. By comparison, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is at 28X and Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) sports a 14 multiple. But perhaps Hari’s other concern is much more serious: the threat of competition. While AMD’s run has come amid improved fundamentals based on increasingly superior products, NVDA and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are no slouches. These tech operators not only have enormous resources but dominant positions in their market categories. What’s more, they may be willing to engage AMD in price wars if they must. Hari’s not the only skeptical analyst out there, as the consensus price target sits at $12.20, below current prices. AMD Stock and Momentum While the bears have good arguments, I think they miss the point. Advanced Micro Devices is at a major inflection point, which has attracted numerous momentum traders that couldn’t care less about valuation. They see a strong growth path and exciting developments, and that’s enough for them. AMD should continue to deliver on this front. CEO Lisa Su has crafted a great strategy including several years of disciplined R&D efforts. For example, there is the Ryzen 7 CPU, which has garnered standout reviews. The technology is poised to snag a lucrative share of the massive gaming cateogry. There is also the Vega GPU, which is gunning for Nvidia, as well as Naples, a chipset that should give INTC a run for its money in the datacenter market. AMD has already been gaining traction with customer demand. Some of the marquee names include Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA), which hosts 35% of the websites in China. AMD also has a platform that is based on outsourcing manufacturing to third parties, such as Global Foundries and Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM). This allows for much more focus on innovation and product development — but also means that the company can quickly scale production according to customer needs. In the meantime, Su is continuing to invest in longer-term opportunities like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the internet of things. For example, last week, Su announced a deal to buy startup Nitero, a leader in millimeter wave technologies that allow for wireless VR and AR headsets. Keep in mind that current systems on the market — from HTC, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) and Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) — require unwieldy chords. If anything, this has likely been a problem with customer adoption. Bottom Line This isn’t to imply that AMD stock will post triple-digit returns again last year. That’s a stretch. But Advanced Micro is in the midst of a transformative upswing, driven by multiple product launches in red-hot markets. Considering that, it seems like a good bet that AMD should continue to outperform the broader market.

The Marines are using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the Mojave in make way for an expansion of desert training grounds. During the two-week long process, the hubcap-sized tortoises are being loaded into plastic containers, which are then stacked and strapped to a helicopter. More than 1,000 desert tortoises get a Marine Corps airlift. Their new home will be swaths of federal land to the north and southeast of the Twentynine Palms base, Marine officials said. The areas were deemed far enough away that the tortoises wouldn’t migrate back to the original habitat. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day The cost of the whole effort, including a 30-year monitoring program to ensure the health of the federally protected species, is $50 million. The Marines at the Twentynine Palms base want to be able to practice large-scale exercises with live fire and combined-arms maneuvering. The campaign goes back to 2008, when the Corps began studying how to do it without breaking environmental law. The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act handed land formerly managed by the Bureau of Land Management to the Defense Department. Tortoises living on that land are now being moved. In March 2016, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a notice of intent to sue, arguing that the federal government failed to fully examine how the move might harm the tortoises. However, the move went ahead this month after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told the Marine Corps that its review wouldn’t be done before the spring window for the move, Marine Corps officials said. It’s not the first time that the Corps has been in the tortoise-moving business. In 2006, the Twentynine Palms base relocated 17 adult tortoises in order to build a training range. Marine officials say no tortoises died during three years of post-move monitoring. This time, Marine Corps biologists will monitor tortoises intensely for the first five years. Then monitoring requirements will diminish over time until the 30-year obligation is met, officials said. About 235 juveniles too small for relocation are being admitted to the base’s “headstart facility,” where they will remain until they grow large enough to better survive on their own.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Here's How Much Tech Companies Gave to the Trump Inauguration Sidney FussellYesterday 1:15pm Filed to: complicity tech trump Donald trump intel microsoft google at&t verizon 92 5 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Photo: AP On Wednesday, the Presidential Inaugural Committee filed its final report with the Federal Election Commission, revealing the full list of donors who financed Donald Trump’s electoral college victory party. Unsurprisingly, the biggest names in tech all chipped in, including Google, Amazon, Intel, and Microsoft, all of whom spoke out against Trump’s Muslim ban. The filing reveals that just weeks before the companies denounced the executive order, they gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to celebrate the man who promised to issue it. AT&T, Trump’s biggest ally in communication, was silent. Advertisement The tech companies include: Microsoft, which donated $500,000. Google, which donated $285,000. Charter Communications, which donated $250,000. Verizon, which donated $100,000. Amazon, which donated $57,746.13. AT&T, which donated $2,082,483.43. Intel, which donated $500,000. Boeing, which donated $1,000,000. Qualcomm, which donated $1,000,000. Unlike his taxes, the FEC filing is both publicly available and searchable. The committee reports a total of $106,715,308.29 in donations. In addition to tech and telecommunications, Trump’s campaign received millions in funds from various real estate tycoons, oil barons, and automakers like General Motors and Ford. Beer maker Anheuser-Busch, which ran a pro-immigration Superbowl ad, and multiple payday lenders, who are banned from advertising on Google, chipped in funds too. Advertisement Of course, individuals can donate to committees, too, and Silicon Valley’s elites opened up their wallets as well. Peter Thiel, now a member of Trump’s transition team, donated $100,000. Margaret Maloney, wife of former Intel China head Sean M. Maloney, donated $100,000. Companies like Google and Amazon garnered very positive press for their opposition to the Muslim ban, so these donations seem immensely hypocritical. What policy preferences or political influence those companies garnered with their money remains to be seen, but if there’s one truth the Trump, it’s that even his most heavily criticized actions are mostly in line with the promises he made on the campaign trail. These companies have been aware of Trump’s intentions all along and met him first with cash and later with public criticism. The former speaks much louder.

Military Military: The Intel Congress considering new 'tax' on troops for GI Bill Congress considering new 'tax' on troops for GI Bill A new proposal in Congress would impose a new $2,400 fee on troops who want to sign up to get the GI Bill after discharge. A new proposal in Congress would impose a new $2,400 fee on troops who want to sign up to get the GI Bill after discharge. Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter VFW has started a hashtag campaign #NoTaxOnTroops A proposal in Congress would impose a new $2,400 fee on troops who want to sign up to get the GI Bill after discharge. The idea is being considered by the House Veterans Affairs Committee next Wednesday at a hearing. The nation’s veterans groups appear to be steaming about the proposed change. “We are still a nation at war. We have troops actively engaged in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and now in Syria,” said leader of Veterans of Foreign Wars, Brian Duffy, in an issued statement. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day “The war on terrorism is not over! Congress’ focus should be on defeating our enemies and ending the war, not cutting the benefits of those who are fighting it.” The VFW has proposed a hashtag campaign: #NoTaxOnTroops The folks over at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America — who are enjoying the current version of the generous post-9/11 GI Bill — are equally irate. “Yep. Just when you thought things in DC couldn't get any stupider! #IAVA will again fight like hell to #DefendTheGIBill,” wrote Paul Reickhoff, chief executive of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans group, on his Facebook page. “Especially in a time of war. Join us and spread the word. This is shameful,” he added. Prior to 2009, troops had the option of paying into the Montgomery GI Bill, a benefit created during peacetime that came with a $1,200 non-reimbursable enrollment fee. The new proposal would offset taxpayer cost for the GI Bill by about $3.1 billion over the next 10 years, according to news reports. As is, the GI Bill is expensive: The U.S. government paid out an estimated $42 billion between 2009 and 2014.

Baidu, one of China's internet giants, on Wednesday announced plans to provide free, open-source software to automakers developing autonomous vehicles. Baidu's move, announced at the Shanghai Auto Show, was hailed by Chery, a leading Chinese carmaker, and NextEV, an electric car startup. Baidu is one of NextEV's financial backers. Nvidia was not included in Baidu's release. Nvidia could not be reached for comment on Baidu's software strategy. Baidu and Nvidia, both of whom have pushed into artificial intelligence, in 2016 agreed to collaborate on autonomous vehicles. Nvidia unveiled a palm-sized artificial intelligence computer to be used by Baidu's self-driving cars. If Baidu's self-driving car partners need artificial intelligence hardware, they could turn to Nvidia as well. New York Stock Exchange-listed shares in Baidu finished up 1.9% at 177.81 in the stock market today. Nvidia stock rose 0.4% to 99.68. Nvidia also supplies technology for electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA) and BMW of North America, among others. It aims to be a leader in the fast-emerging self-driving car industry, where tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) are jockeying for inside-lane position. IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia stock recently fell below its 10-week line, triggering a sell signal. Nvidia is no longer on the IBD Leaderboard, but Tesla, Dycom, Alibaba Group and Apple are among companies listed. Chipmaker Intel (INTC) in early 2017 bought a 15% stake in Here, a developer of digital mapping technology for self-driving cars, deepening its ties to German automakers. Intel and Nvidia are growing rivals in artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. Google-parent Alphabet last year spun off its self-driving car project, Waymo, into a stand-alone company. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Waymo unveiled a new low-cost sensor system and hinted it could license technology to automakers. Baidu says it will open source its software in areas including "obstacle perception," route-planning and vehicle control. Baidu says it'll form a partnership with automakers to "lower the barriers to entry for research and development of autonomous driving technologies."

Twitter Facebook Samsung ready to make chips faster than the ones in Galaxy S8 Samsung is upgrading its manufacturing facilities, and will start churning out chips using an upgraded 10-nm process Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 20 April, 2017 02:00 - - - - print email Comments Samsung is now ready to produce faster and even more power-efficient chips than the ones it uses the latest Galaxy S8 smartphones. In the fourth quarter, Samsung will start producing chips on the 10-nanometer LPP (low-power plus) process. These chips are fasterÂ than existing chips because of an enhanced 3D structure. On average, the new chips made on the new process will be 10 percent faster and 15 percent more power efficient than the first wave of 10-nanometer chips like the Samsung Exynos 8895, which is one of two processors used in the S8 devices. Samsung's announcement is a sign that it has received orders to make chips, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Samsung hasn't announced customers for the new chips. But one client could be Qualcomm, which has its Snapdragon 835 chips in the Galaxy S8. They are made in Samsung's existing 10-nm fabs. A successor to the Snapdragon 835 could be made on the new manufacturing 10-nm LPP node, though Qualcomm hasn't announced anything yet. Faster chips add more capabilities to mobile devices while preserving battery life. For example, the Snapdragon 835 and the Exynos 8895 in the Galaxy S8 smartphones handle virtual reality applications better than their predecessors, and they also have special circuitry for artificial intelligence tasks. Samsung and Intel are in a dog fight to claim the crown of the world's most advanced chip manufacturer. Samsung is the first to 10-nm, while Intel delayed its move due to manufacturing issues. Intel is still making chips using the 14-nm processÂ and will release its unprecedented fourth chip architecture on its process. The fight is largely focused on smartphone chips. "Over the past 15 years, the industry has shifted from being driven by PCs and servers. It is now being driven by mobile devices," McGregor said. Intel is moving to 10-nm later this year but even at 14-nm holds a technical edge over Samsung, McGregor said.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 19, 2017 9:00 AM PT Credit: Samsung More like this Intel pursues Moore's Law with plan to make first 7-nm chips this year Samsung wants its Exynos 9 chip in VR headsets, not just smartphones Intel's Cannon Lake PC chip shipments may slip into next year Video Hands on with Launchboom's do-everything wearable, Pinn Samsung is now ready to produce faster and even more power-efficient chips than the ones it uses the latest Galaxy S8 smartphones. In the fourth quarter, Samsung will start producing chips on the 10-nanometer LPP (low-power plus) process. These chips are faster than existing chips because of an enhanced 3D structure. On average, the new chips made on the new process will be 10 percent faster and 15 percent more power efficient than the first wave of 10-nanometer chips like the Samsung Exynos 8895, which is one of two processors used in the S8 devices. Samsung's announcement is a sign that it has received orders to make chips, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Samsung hasn't announced customers for the new chips. But one client could be Qualcomm, which has its Snapdragon 835 chips in the Galaxy S8. They are made in Samsung's existing 10-nm fabs. A successor to the Snapdragon 835 could be made on the new manufacturing 10-nm LPP node, though Qualcomm hasn't announced anything yet. Faster chips add more capabilities to mobile devices while preserving battery life. For example, the Snapdragon 835 and the Exynos 8895 in the Galaxy S8 smartphones handle virtual reality applications better than their predecessors, and they also have special circuitry for artificial intelligence tasks. Samsung and Intel are in a dog fight to claim the crown of the world's most advanced chip manufacturer. Samsung is the first to 10-nm, while Intel delayed its move due to manufacturing issues. Intel is still making chips using the 14-nm process and will release its unprecedented fourth chip architecture on its process. The fight is largely focused on smartphone chips. "Over the past 15 years, the industry has shifted from being driven by PCs and servers. It is now being driven by mobile devices," McGregor said. Intel is moving to 10-nm later this year but even at 14-nm holds a technical edge over Samsung, McGregor said. However, Samsung is catching up fast, he added.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman MSFT or AAPL: Who Will Win in the Battle of Apple vs Microsoft One of the greatest tech rivalries of all time is heating up. The Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saga is long and storied, and has been one of the main driving forces in the computer sector for decades. While the two companies long ago parted ways in terms of the types of products they produce (that explains why you haven’t seen those Mac vs. PC commercials in a long time), the technologies that are currently in development by both companies may bring them back into a heated head-to-head conflict. And that brings us to Microsoft stock vs. Apple stock. The two companies currently have stakes in very different markets. Apple has the “iPhone,” the “Mac,” and the “iPad,” and the company has generally established its empire on the backs of consumer tech gadgets. Microsoft, by contrast, has focused more on the software side of things, with the “Windows” operating system, “Microsoft Suite,” cloud offerings, and “Office 365” being some of the company’s main sources of revenue and growth. But that calculation is changing. Microsoft Surface Studio vs. Apple Mac  One of the biggest new additions to the Microsoft vs. Apple tale is the first-ever desktop computer made by Microsoft: “Microsoft Surface Studio.” Being billed as a direct competitor to Macs, the new Microsoft product seems to be taking what the Mac does best and is outperforming the long-held standard in desktops for creatives. Microsoft Surface Studio is a 28″ super-high-resolution desktop computer complete with touchscreen functionality, sixth-generation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) processor options, and a dedicated graphics card. It’s being billed as the must-own tool for creative types, which is bad news for Apple Mac. Apple has long held that Macs are preferable to PCs when it comes to creative ventures, including picture and video editing, sound design, art projects, etc. Apple has long since owned that portion of the market, while Microsoft has been seen as the more business-friendly alternative to Apple’s cool factor. But the new Microsoft Surface Studio could shake things up. And computer sales are definitely in need of a revitalization. Computers sales have suffered in recent years. Among the top five computer vendors, Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DVMT) is the only one to see growth in 2016, with a 2.6% boost over the previous year. The industry more broadly saw a sales decline of 6.2% from 2015. But AAPL stock is currently on a tear, regardless of its flagging computer revenue. The company shipped 8.7% fewer Mac units in 2016 than it did in 2015. (Source: “Gartner Says 2016 Marked Fifth Consecutive Year of Worldwide PC Shipment Decline,” Gartner Inc, January 11, 2017.) “The broad PC market has been static as technology improvements have not been sufficient to drive real market growth,” said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner. Kitagawa continued, “There have been innovative form factors like 2-in-1s and thin and light notebooks, as well as technology improvements, such as longer battery life. This end of the market has grown fast, led by engaged PC users who put high priority on PCs. However, the market driven by PC enthusiasts is not big enough to drive overall market growth.” (Source: Ibid.) Microsoft has long been looking to get into the hardware market, with its “Surface” line of products, but Microsoft Surface Studio is the company’s boldest move yet. MSFT stock might become the beneficiary of the Microsoft finally striking gold with must-have consumer hardware. Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com  Artificial Intelligence Tech in 2017 One of the most exciting developments in the tech sector is the focus on artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The AI sector is likely to be one of the most transformative innovations we’ll see in the next few years. As such, whichever company can assert itself as the leader in the AI sector will likely see huge stock gains. Which brings us to another new front in the Apple vs. Microsoft battle. Both Microsoft and Apple ventured into the realm of responsive machines with voice-activated AI helpers. But, while Apple is focusing more on augmented reality (AR) these days, Microsoft seems to be pushing forward with AI in 2017. “Siri” made headlines years ago when Apple first introduced it, but Microsoft followed its success with a version of its own in “Cortana.” Named after a heroine in its Halo video game franchise (who is, of course, also an AI, though a much more sophisticated and sentient one), the company is seeking to push itself into the AI market. The latest news surrounding the MSFT stock price is the partnership between Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Microsoft, in which the two behemoths will seek out ways to enhance their products via AI tech. (Source: “Adobe, Microsoft working together on artificial intelligence,” The Economic Times, March 23, 2017.) While Apple hasn’t made any significant consumer-facing play in terms of AI since the introduction of Siri, the company is looking toward other forms of machine learning and smart devices in order to take advantage of this burgeoning sector. “Apple Car,” for instance, was once rumored to be the company’s version of an autonomous vehicle, though the latest information now points to Apple moving toward programming for autonomous cars rather than producing its own vehicles. And that makes a lot of sense. Why get involved in the hardware side of things in an area in which your company has little expertise, when you can direct your hugely powerful and resource-rich programming departments to tackle another fast developing tech sector? Apple Investments May Push AAPL Stock Over MSFT Stock  One big advantage that Apple has over Microsoft is a war chest that is fit to burst. Apple has a lot of money that it can play around with and, as such, the company has many targeted investment options that could dramatically alter the path of the AAPL stock price. Perhaps the biggest rumor surrounding Apple is whether it will acquire the massive media mogul Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS). This would be a huge coup for Apple, were the acquisition to take place. Why? Well, for one thing, Apple is a very diverse and well-situated company with a lot of different plays on the go, but one area where it is lacking is the media division. Apple has yet to produce much of its own original media content. The company has always valued its brand image, with some of the most memorable commercials of all time coming from the Apple marketing department, but it has yet to step into the content arena. And we all know how much Apple loves to exert total control when it comes to its products, often avoiding outside influence whenever possible. Bringing Disney into the fold would essentially buy Apple a ready-made media empire that it can shape in its own image. If Apple wants to continue its expansion and dominance into new commercial ventures, eventually the creation and sale of original content will become a likely avenue to pursue in order to open up new revenue streams, Disney being one of the most desirable media acquisitions. Walt Disney Co has rights to the entire box-office-smashing “Marvel Cinematic Universe,” as well as children’s favorites, two foundational genres that often draw in hordes of viewers. Not to mention it also owns the rights to the Star Wars franchise, which is hardly a bit player in movie theaters. Consider the Beauty and the Beast live-action remake that recently hit theaters. With a gross of over $700.0 million since its release in early March, the movie is killing it at the box office. And last year’s highest-grossing film? Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, another Disney production. (Source: “Box Office: ‘Beauty And The Beast’ Waltzes Past $700M Worldwide,” Forbes, March 28, 2017.) Not only would Apple acquire the largest movie franchises in the world, it would also gain the ability to have its own original content produced by the best in the industry. Disney stock is up over eight percent since the beginning of 2017, and up 14% over the past 12 months. The rumors that Disney will be spinning off “ESPN,” which has been seen as a detriment to DIS stock, could also help create an atmosphere for an Apple acquisition. With strong revenue growth year-over-year in 2016, Disney would make a great fit as an Apple investment. (Source: “Global revenue of the Walt Disney Company in the fiscal years 2006 to 2016 (in billion U.S. dollars),” Statista, last accessed April 17, 2017.) MSFT Stock vs. AAPL Stock  With all that information out of the way, where does that leave us with MSFT stock and Apple stock? The fact is that both companies have the ability to be profitable but, as they continue to step into each other’s industries, there will undoubtedly be more friction and, therefore, some strong dips and rises. At this point, Apple looks to be in the better position than Microsoft from a share price perspective, but that can be misleading. While Apple stock has enjoyed strong gains in recent months, the company has acquired a lot of debt and faces declining sales in iPhones, as first adopters who can afford the expensive smartphone are shrinking. And that’s the state of the Microsoft vs. Apple rivalry. After a years-long detente between the two companies, they are once again entering into each other’s markets. While AAPL stock has the upper hand at the moment, threats to its stock in the long run make Microsoft stock a safer pick, albeit with less opportunity for huge growth.

Colin Johnson 4/19/2017 01:01 PM EDT 1 Comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet LAKE WALES, Fla. -- A new copy/paste method for mass production of expensive circuits has just been invented at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). After the fabrication of a "donor" wafer topped by graphene, the technique uses a deposit-and-peel-off (copy/paste) method that reduces the cost of the circuitry and makes the cost of the underlying wafer relatively insignificant. The technique could encourage manufacturers to combine silicon (Si) with expensive materials, like gallium arsenide (GaAs) for transistor channels, very easily and inexpensively. (left to right): Post doc Kyusang Lee, professor Jeehwan Kim (sitting), and graduate students Samuel Cruz and Yunjo Kim. (Source: Jose-Luis Olivares/MIT) "We are taking advantage of the strength and slippery qualities of graphene, rather than its electrical properties, in order to fabricate extremely thin circuits of expensive materials, thereby greatly reducing the overall cost of using exotic materials," professor Jeehwan Kim told EE Times in an exclusive interview before the public announcement of his "remote epitaxy" technology. Today Intel, IBM and many other manufacturers are struggling with, for instance, growing GaAs transistor channels on silicon wafers for transistor channels, ending up with low quality results because of the lattice mismatch between silicon and GaAs, according to Kim. However, using remote epitaxy, those GaAs channels can be separately fabricated on a thin layer of GaAs peeled off the graphene-topped donor wafer and bonded to the silicon wafer without any problems with lattice mismatch. The researchers fashioned the donor wafers by merely depositing a single-atom thick monolayer of graphene. Because graphene bonded to the donor wafer, but is “slippery” on top, a thin layer of an expensive material can be fabricated atop the stack which does not stick to the donor wafer. Kim's group members then simply peel the expensive top semiconducting layer from the donor wafer and transfer it to an inexpensive substrate, such as Si. The substrate can even be patterned already with the source and drain in silicon, then etch to add the GaAs channels to its otherwise CMOS circuitry. And with no lattice mismatch problems, the resulting silicon transistors with GaAs channels will outperform any silicon channel transistors used today. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) being grown on graphene and then peeled off for placement on another substrate. (Source: MIT) Because graphene is 600 times stronger than steel and bonds strongly to the underlying donor wafer, the process can be repeated over-and-over, like the steel mold used to mass produce rubber car tires, giving graphene a leg-up on the mass production of CMOS wafers combined with exotic materials. The exotic materials can also be used by themselves for LEDs, solar cells, high-power transistors or other devices. The team claims not to have yet found a limit on how many copy-and-paste operations can be performed by a single donor wafer. Kim's team perfected the method at MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics with the help of doctoral candidate Yunjo Kim, graduate students Samuel Cruz, Babatunde Alawonde, Chris Heidelberger, Yi Song, and Kuan Qiao, postdoctoral researchers Kyusang Lee, Shinhyun Choi, and Wei Kong, visiting research scholar Chanyeol Choi, MIT Professor of Materials Science and Engineering Eugene Fitzgerald, professor of electrical engineering and computer science Jing Kong, and assistant professor of mechanical engineering Alexie Kolpak, along with contributors from other universities including Jared Johnson and Jinwoo Hwang from Ohio State University, and Ibraheem Almansouri of Masdar Institute of Science and Technology. The team has proven the feasibility experimentally of lowering the cost of using exotic materials, including GaAs, indium phosphide, and gallium phosphide. They have also transferred the exotic active layers onto cheap flexible substrates, successfully fabricating light-emitting diodes there. A nickel film peel-off from a silicon wafer demonstrates the concept of using a 2D material-based transfer process for wafers. (Source: Jose-Luis Olivares/MIT) Next they plan to try the technique on clothing and other wearable materials, as well as attempt to stack multiple layers to create more complicated devices. Funding was provided by the One to One Joint Research Project between the MI/MIT Cooperative Program and LG electronics R&D center. — R.

All you do is coat the GaAs (or other exotic substrate) with a monolayer of graphene, the lay down the thickness of GaAs you want for you channels. The GaAs is peeled off the graphene and bond it to the silicon wafer with its source and drains already fashioned in silicon, then you just etch-out the GaAs channels with no lattice mismatch problems.

Privacy Policy The recent news that long-awaited IPO Cloudera may be priced at a valuation lower than that paid by private investors is big news for the lowly retail investor. The big data software company recently filed preliminary documents for its IPO. The valuation of the IPO is expected to be between $12-$14 a share. This price compares to the $30.92 that Intel paid for its shares purchased in 2014 and the $17.85 value per share of stock awards granted to employees in March. This is a remarkable shift. Historically private equity investors injected funds into private companies at such low valuations that huge gains were all but guaranteed when the company went public. Most institutional investors are accustomed to paying multiples of the price paid by insiders and private equity investors when valuing IPOs. However, the balance of power has shifted. Too many dollars chasing the most desirable tech companies in Silicon Valley have driven valuations up to unsustainable levels. Technology IPOs were few and far between in 2016. It took four months for the market to warm up enough for the first to get priced. By year end just 21 technology companies went public, down from 29 in 2015, a year considered to be pretty anemic regarding IPOs. The story was that the “best” IPOs wanted to remain private. Controversial Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has long bragged that he would only take his company public only as “the last resort. Unicorns, private companies, with valuations greater than $1 billion, proliferated in Silicon Valley as private equity and sovereign wealth funds tripped over each other to pony up for funding. Barrels of private equity funds have been chasing the same group of “hot” private tech companies for some time. Uber, founding father of the popular ride-sharing app, has raised $16 billion as a private company. The most recent rounds of funding value the entire company at $68 billion. This valuation compares to Amazon, who sported a total valuation of $438 million when it went public in 1997. (The total value of a private company is calculated by dividing the absolute dollars of funding most recently invested in the company by the percentage ownership attached to those funds.) The history of Snap’s long anticipated March IPO illustrates the market’s malaise with overpriced IPOs. The IPO was priced at $17 and initially burst up to $29.40, only to immediately reverse and settle in at $20. This is great news for the retail investor. I’ve found many great investments in the IPO bin in the past 12 months for Profit Catalyst Alert subscribers and will be looking for more. Less frothy demand for new issues is forcing private companies to offer good values to IPO buyers.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web It’s work, Jim, but not as we know it By Nick Lazaridis Feature  Commercial mobility is yet to hit its full disruptive potential, but it will transform our whole notion of “work”. Shares The world of work as we know it is poised to change forever. Business is about to boldly go where no company has been before. And it’ll be fuelled by the next generation of mobile technology. As consumer mobility matures, commercial mobility has yet to hit its full disruptive potential. And this isn’t about emailing at the family dinner table, or the odd day working from home. Mobility is going to pull into question our whole notion of “work”. Craft work With PwC predicting that the global gig economy will be worth $63bn by just 2020, what will a “job” really mean to children born today as they leave education? A globally connected network of “guns for hire” could be selling their freelance services to the highest bidder in a highly fluid digital marketplace, whether they are a brain surgeon or a tree surgeon. All prompted by the proliferation of mobile devices and apps.   Warp drive And getting to work will be revolutionised. Boston Consulting Group predicts that the rise of autonomous vehicles, and associated car-sharing, will reduce the cost of car travel by 20-40 per cent, and cut average journey times by 40 per cent in 10-20 years’ time. Suddenly, the wasted hours spent crammed into metro and commuter belt rail services become unviable and unnecessary. And as the car completes its evolution into a connected computer on wheels, it becomes a productive work environment in itself – at least for those of us lucky enough not to suffer from travel sickness. Petrol or electricity may power the mechanics of our car, but mobility is powering its evolution. It’s why we’re seeing collaborations between car makers and telco equipment firms, such as the recent deal between BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz and Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm to accelerate development of the 5G infrastructure needed for self-driving cars.   Out of office This said, “work” as a single location we commute to each day may be an obsolete concept long before our cars drive themselves. We’re already moving towards the notion of a “blended life” whereby folks increasingly see work as “a thing you do” and not just a “place you go”. At the same time, co-working spaces have recently exploded in popularity in cities across the globe. These attractive, collaborative environments are hotbeds of innovation. They’re a physical embodiment of today’s dynamic employment market, and of generation Y’s desire to explore its entrepreneurial potential. But co-working isn’t just for start-ups. Corporates are also getting in on the act, with companies such as KPMG opening their own doors to create centres of collaboration. The office of the future probably won’t be an office at all. Expensive city-centre floorspace, with its doors locked to outside influence and innovation, will begin to look like a thing of the past, and “out of office” will become the norm, not the exception.   Upwardly mobile But like the gig economy and self-driving cars, co-working space doesn’t function without intelligent mobile technology. As the global workforce goes increasingly mobile, people need to take their offices with them wherever they go. Employees are in search of a PC equivalent to a swiss army knife that can transform based on the task at hand. As such, we’re delivering devices that bring traditional PC-based productivity to a more mobile experience, in a way that IT can securely manage and service. For instance, we recently launched the HP Pro x2, a versatile tablet and notebook ‘detachable’ device featuring multiple modes for commercial use. We also announced a range of new accessories for the HP Elite x3, the first true 3-in-1 device for mobile workers. These new technologies are designed with versatility in mind, to help mobile professionals be productive and remain connected, whether they are in the office or on the go. Mobility began with consumer usage, but I believe the real application is for enterprises and organisations. Three quarters of CIOs say mobility will have a bigger impact on their business than the advent of the internet. Mobile technology is already transforming analogue workflows that haven’t changed in decades, boosting efficiency & productivity. And now it’s set to fundamentally transform what we consider as “work”.   Nick Lazaridis, President, EMEA HP Inc.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Granted 60 Patents Today Covering Laser Texturing Apple Products like a MacBook and more | Main | Chip Demand for Apple's New iPhone to Exceed 100 Million by the end of 2017 and up to 230 Million Overall » April 19, 2017 Intel appears to be Months ahead with new Skylake-X, Kaby Lake-X Processors in Line with Timing of New iMacs   Yesterday Patently Apple posted a report stating that Apple will release two new iMacs in Q3. Back on April 04, when Apple announced that they were working on a new modular Mac Pro, Phil Schiller also noted that "Apple has 'great' new iMacs in the pipeline, slated for release "this year," including configurations specifically targeted at large segments of the pro market." Today we learn about Intel's plans for processors that may shed some light on what Apple may use for their new iMacs.   It's being reported today that Intel will unveil its Basin Falls platform, i.e. Skylake-X, Kaby Lake-X processors and X299 chipset, at Computex 2017 in Taipei during May 30-June 3 two months earlier than originally scheduled, and will bring forward the launch of Coffee Lake microarchitecture based on a 14nm process node from January 2018 originally to August 2017, to cope with increasing competition from AMD's Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 processors, according to Taiwan-based PC vendors.   The Basin Falls-based products are expected to be launched at the E3 gaming show in the US in June, with the official release at the end of the month.   The Skylake-X series has three 140W processors featuring 6-, 8- and 10-core architectures, while the Kaby Lake-X series has an 112W quad-core processor. In August, Intel will release a top-end 12-core Skylake-X processor.   Meanwhile, AMD is planning to announce its top-end 16-core Ryzen processor and X399 platform in the third quarter to compete for the gaming market.   As for the 14nm-based Coffee Lake-based processors, Intel will initially release several K-series Core i7/i5/i3 processors and its Z370 chipsets in August, and will release more CPUs as well as H370, B360 and H310 chipsets at the end of 2017 or early 2018.   Intel has reportedly spent over US$100 million to order five EUV machine sets from ASML, to accelerate its pace of manufacturing.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The feature is aimed at improving CPU power efficiency by throttling background tasks. It is currently only available for systems using Intel 6th-gen and 7th-gen processors. Windows 10 automatically throttles background tasks while not affecting important applications, and users can control the level of power throttling using the power slider. Power throttling is disabled completely when users select the “Best Performance” power setting.

One policeman was killed and three others were wounded when militants opened fire at the checkpoint, the Interior Ministry said in a statement late Tuesday. Several militants were also injured in the shootout. The Islamic State claim was reported by SITE Intel Group, which monitors jihadist channels on social media. Authorities had already declared a three-month state of emergency and vowed stronger anti-terrorism measures after twin church bombings on Palm Sunday left at least 45 dead and dozens wounded. The Islamic State also claimed those attacks, as it expands beyond its local base in north Sinai and targets Egypt’s orthodox Christian minority ahead of Pope Francis’s visit later this month. St. Catherine’s Monastery is popular among visitors in its own right, while its proximity to key tourism sites including the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh is also a potential setback for Egypt’s struggling tourism industry. Visitor numbers have yet to recover since the 2015 downing of a Russian passenger jet after it took off from Sharm El-Sheikh killed all 224 on board. Boosting tourism is key component of Egypt’s plan to revive the economy. Authorities floated the currency last year to end a crippling dollar shortage and to finalize a $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan. The decision, along with an accompanying cut in fuel subsidies, caused inflation to surge. The IMF on Tuesday lowered its projection for Egypt’s economic growth this year to 3.5 percent, though it also said reforms underway would drive a 4.5 percent expansion in 2018. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Tablet Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs. Surface Pro 4 – Design, Display and Hardware By Catalina Nastase. Published on April 19, 2017. 0 When you hear the word “tablet”, what product comes immediately to your mind? For most people, it might be the symbol iPad, but truth is there are lots of other interesting options on the market, such as Samsung and Microsoft. Some of the best products on the market are the Galaxy Tab S3 and Surface Pro 4, which is visible from their specs and the market numbers. Design and Display When it comes to design and display, the two products are quite different. First of all, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 device weighs 434 grams, while the Microsoft product weighs 790 grams. However, both are pretty light in general, so maybe this won’t affect your decision. The difference is weight is given by the display size. Regarding the design, Galaxy Tab S3 sports an aluminum frame, paired with a glass back panel, whereas the Surface Pro 4 has a magnesium alloy design. Internal Hardware Galaxy Tab S3 runs on a Snapdragon 820 CPU, while the other tablet has a sixth gen Intel processor. Even though the Snapdragon choice is an excellent one, the Intel CPU makes the tablet behave almost like a laptop. In fact, you can even convert the Surface Pro 4 into a desktop with the help of a Surface Dock. The Microsoft product also wins here because it offers you the possibility to choose between 4, 8 or 16 GB RAM, while Tab S3 only has one option: 4 GB. About the camera, Galaxy Tab S3 features a 13 MP snapper on the back and a 5 MP one on the front. In comparison, the Surface Pro 4 fights back with an 8 MP/ 5 MP configuration. Samsung opted to offer only 32 GB storage, while Microsoft allows for 128, 256, 512 GB or 1 TB storage.

The total annual investment, on average, among the top 20 employers that are looking to hire AI talent is $33,292,647. Yet Amazon is allocating nearly 600 percent more and Google is investing nearly 300 percent more than this figure, indicating that their future success is heavily dependent upon AI technologies, and subsequently, the talent to create them. According to a 2016 Markets and Markets Report, the artificial intelligence (AI) market is expected to be worth $16.06 Billion by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 62.9% from 2016 to 2022. Several U.S. companies have raised $1 billion dollars or more to fuel artificial intelligence (AI) development. Companies that are hiring to fill AI jobs are currently seeking tech and engineering talent with deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, neural networks and reinforcement learning skills. The top 20 employers who are hiring for these jobs and their current average annual investment allocation, based on average net salary, are as follows. Amazon at $227,769,001 Google at $130,048,389 Microsoft at $75,158,057 NVIDIA at $34,280,190 Facebook at $38,636,827 Intel Corporation at $19,390,160 Rocket Fuel at $25,288,196 GE at $11,355,668 Cylance at $8,917,665 Oculus VR at $11,545,141 Booz Allen Hamilton at $8,453,977 Huawei at $11,191,901 Adobe at $11,234,781 Accenture at $8,124,716 iRobot at $8,185,097 Magic Leap at $7,479,133 Rethink Robotics at $6,262,943 BAE Systems at $8,320,677 HERE at $8,552,227 IBM at $5,658,187 The findings also show that 40 percent of the open AI positions are available at large enterprises with more than 10,000 employees, 10 percent are available at companies with 1001 – 10,000 employees and 7 percent are available at companies with 11-50 employees. Companies with 51-100 employees account for 5 percent of the open positions across the market while just 2 percent of the open AI positions are available at companies with 0-10 employees. Another 25 percent of today’s open AI positions were reported as being at companies with employee counts that were unknown at the time of the study.

The top 15 U.S. cities where companies are hiring the most tech talent with artificial intelligence skills and expertise include: San Francisco, CA New York, NY Seattle, WA Washington, DC Chicago, ILL San Diego, CA Austin, TX Charlotte, NC Denver, CO Atlanta, GA Tampa, FL Minneapolis, MN Phoenix, AZ St. Louis, MO Albuquerque, NM Total investment by region, considering average salary and number of available jobs is as follows: “From powering the self-driving car to guiding the way we shop, manage our finances and even do routine tasks, AI technology plays an increasing a role in every aspect of life as we know it, so it’s no surprise that investment in this area is growing at a rapid pace and companies are having a hard time keeping up,” said Chris Bolte, CEO of Paysa. “This latest research reveals that AI and machine learning skills are in such high-demand that companies across the country at every funding stage are weighing the skills and track-records of individuals even more heavily than years-of-experience or their degree as they staff-up their development teams.” “The explosion of AI talent needs is a critical event happening right now nationwide -- engineers with right skills can land a great job at a top tier company in any region of the U.S,” added Bolte. Although a majority or 35 percent of the jobs require a Ph.D, 26 percent require just a master’s degree and 18 percent require only a bachelor’s degree. And not all open jobs require a specific degree level – suggesting that for some 21 percent of the jobs, having the right skills are more important than graduating from a specific university or degree program. The Paysa study also reveals that just five percent of the open jobs are executive level, calling for 10 or more years-of-experience, 28 percent of the available AI jobs are senior level positions, requiring five or more, 27 percent are mid-level, mandating two to five years, and less than two percent are junior level, asking for just one to two-years. Another 39 percent of open AI jobs have experience level requirements that are unspecified. Finally, employers that are hiring for the majority of the positions (36 percent) are at companies that have been around 20 years or more while 21 percent of today’s open AI jobs can be found at companies that are 10 to 20-years-old. Only six percent of the open positions are at start-ups or companies that have been around five years or less.

Caffe2 appears to be product driven, and is geared towards deploying machine-learning systems into smartphone applications and onto large-scale clusters. It differs from PyTorch, another software framework from Facebook that is more research oriented as it allows programmers to experiment with different neural network architectures more easily. Using AI in production is tricky, and Caffe2, written in a mix of Python and C++, tries to alleviate the pain. Facebook has been working with Nvidia to integrate Caffe2 into the graphics chip giant's deep-learning developer libraries so the framework can take advantage of hardware acceleration on Nv's GPUs. We're told, for example, Caffe2 is nippy on Facebook’s Big Basin OpenCompute AI servers that pack 64 Nvidia Tesla P100 GPUs. Intel, Microsoft and Amazon have also stepped up to make sure Caffe2 is optimized for their systems and services. Meanwhile, Qualcomm’s Neural Processing Engine (NPE) software development kit supports Caffe2 and Google’s TensorFlow. This library glues software to the neural network math unit built into its top-end Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip, which is appearing in smartphones, tablets and notebooks this year. Code using the engine will therefore gain a performance boost via the on-chip acceleration. The NPE dev kit will be available in July. It’s a sensible move, considering Qualcomm designs chips used in millions and millions of Android devices, and Facebook is investing heavily in augmented reality, a technology that will manipulate photos and video taken with smartphones. That's going to require some machine-learning processing to identify objects and meddle with them – hence the marriage between Caffe2, Qualcomm, and Facebook. And, hey, if that means developers using Facebook's tech to produce apps to rival SnapChat – the image-fiddling toy that's cool with the kids and in the way of Mark Zuckerberg's world domination plans – so much the better. “Augmented reality is going to help us mix the digital and physical in all new ways and that's going to make our physical reality better," Facebook CEO Zuckerberg told his social network's F8 conference in Silicon Valley on Tuesday. Caffe2 doesn't just add cartoon doodles over images. It's hoping to be more general purpose, allowing developers to create chatbots, hook up IoT devices, use machine translation and speech, and image classification algorithms for medical applications. Caffe, a predecessor of Caffe2, was developed by Yangqing Jia while he was a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley. Jia is now a research scientist and leads Facebook’s efforts in building a general platform for its AI applications. ® Tips and corrections 2 Comments MORE Facebook Deep Learning More from The Register Hacker cracks Facebook with remote code execution bug ImageMagick exploit earns chap US$40k bug bounty 13 Comments Please don't call them Facebook chatbots, says Facebook's bot boss F8 2017 That whole conversation-as-a-UI thing was just a big misunderstanding 8 Comments Oculus Drift: VR gaming boss out at Facebook Less-than-rosy Palmer leaving Zuck's $2bn lawsuit magnet 9 Comments NY court slaps down Facebook's attempt to keep accounts secret from search warrants Jurisdiction a problem for The Social Network™ 37 Comments Facebook's 'delightful' AI Clippy the Paperclip creeps into Messenger What fresh hell 35 Comments Facebook ‘Happy Birthday’ lawsuit rolls on Could be costly for Zuck.

Baidu will offer a vehicle platform, hardware platform, software platform and cloud data services, and will open source code and capabilities in obstacle perception, trajectory planning, vehicle control, vehicle operating systems and other functions, as well as a set of testing tools, it said in a statement. The project called Apollo, after the U.S. moon missions, could help speed up the development of self-driving cars, making the technology available sooner to smaller car makers and users at a more competitive price. Until now car makers and tech companies have been pursuing the development of self-driving cars independently or in close-knit alliances, guarding their inventions protectively as the ongoing lawsuit between Alphabet's Waymo and Uber Technologies indicates. “An open, innovative industry ecosystem initiated by Baidu will accelerate the development of autonomous driving in the U.S. and other developed automotive markets,” said Qi Lu, Baidu’s group president and chief operating officer in a statement. Baidu’s bid to create a standard platform will depend largely on how many partners sign on to the project. “What strikes me at first is the lack of any partners that have signed on. Open sourcing something is interesting, but only if other people join you,” said Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. This is the challenge that currently faces Intel and BMW, who are trying to create an open platform for self driving cars, he added. In July last year, BMW, Intel and Mobileye said that they would work together to arrive at an industry standard and define an open platform for autonomous driving. Baidu has been testing its autonomous cars both in China and in the U.S. In 2015, it said it had tested a fully autonomous car in Beijing on a route that had mixed roads in a variety of environmental conditions. The company also received permission last year from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test its cars in the state, and tied with Nvidia for the development of a self-driving platform for companies in China and abroad. Baidu plans to first open its autonomous driving technology for restricted environments in July and will later share its technology for cars running autonomously in simple urban road conditions towards the end of the year. It plans to introduce fully autonomous driving capabilities on highways and open city roads over time by 2020. It wasn’t immediately clear which areas of self-driving technology Baidu will continue to control over time. The company did not also disclose what was its revenue stream from the project. “How they make money is unclear but like Google with TensorFlow, I believe it's to get everyone building on their AI frameworks or that they own the data that they can monetize in numerous ways,” Moorhead said. Baidu did not immediately comment. Why Performance Matters When Building Your SD-WAN More from Silver Peak Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Blacktech Week Technology April 16, 2017 8:25 PM What would a venture capitalist say about that? Startups get a chance to find out By Nancy Dahlberg ndahlberg@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Access to capital is lacking — that’s a common refrain among Miami area entrepreneurs, and particularly in minority communities. So Derick Pearson and Felecia Hatcher, founders of Code Fever and Blacktech Week, thought let’s bring the venture capitalists here. At a recent conference Pearson talked Marlon Nichols, co-founder and managing partner at Cross Culture Ventures and former investment director at Intel Capital, into agreeing to be Code Fever and Blacktech Week’s first VC in Residence. The program, thought to be one of the first of its kind, will have top venture capitalists spend a month in Miami advising and guiding black, Latinx and Caribbean entrepreneurs. Nichols, who generally splits his time between offices in Los Angeles and Silicon Valley, took up residence at WeWork earlier this month and has been holding office hours, fireside chats and lunch and learns that will continue throughout the month to help sharp founders think through the businesses that they are building. It wasn’t a hard sell and the arrangement is benefiting both sides of the table. “You can’t beat coming to Miami in April, but more importantly, Miami is rich in culture and our investment thesis is about understanding global culture to try to predict where consumers are going to spend their dollars,” said the Jamaican-born Nichols in an interview last week. He leads one of the relative few black-led venture capital funds in the U.S. “Black and Latinx cultures have been known for early adopters, so for understanding what is going on in those communities as well as the Caribbean community, Miami is a melting pot. For me it is a lot of learning.” The new VC in Residence program is one of a number of Code Fever initiatives, which include producing Blacktech Week and Weekend, and it recently received $1.2 million in Knight funding. Entrepreneur-in-residence programs are commonly hosted at universities and accelerators to support entrepreneurs, solve problems and help innovate. Code Fever believes that borrowing from this model and inviting VCs to spend a month in residence in communities where there’s little access to funding can help reshape the way black communities are valued in the innovation sector. It’s a big challenge. Only about 1 percent venture capital funding goes to black founders, and only 13 black women founders in the entire nation have raised a million dollars or more in venture capital. In the half-hour office hour visits so far, Nichols has met with tech startups developing products or services for student debt, media content, cloud-based secure storage, educating inmates, dentistry and others. Most of the entrepreneurs are not yet at the stage for venture capital or do not have appropriate businesses for that kind of funding, but the door is still open. I don’t want to invest in the next Uber or the next Lyft. I want new market creators. What are big pain points for people in Miami that haven’t been met? Let’s figure out what those are and go solve them. Marlon Nichols, Cross Culture Ventures Some were interested in advice for preparing themselves for investment, others wanted mentorship on starting up or just wanted to talk strategy. And it hasn’t been all tech — Nichols met with a cupcake entrepreneur who wanted to talk about the best way to grow her business. And when companies are ready for investment, he wants to know about them. “I think gone are the days when all investments happen in Silicon Valley. ... Amazing companies can be created any where in the world and I want to keep my finger on the pulse of that. ... The biggest thing I will get out of this is developing a network here – with entrepreneurs I will keep in touch with, with angels here and organizations. They will help be eyes and ears for great investment opportunities here.” Nichols is also holding frequent fireside chats, bringing in entrepreneurs who have experience starting and growing companies. “The best resource for new entrepreneurs is successful entrepreneurs as well as unsuccessful entrepreneurs,” he said. “There is just a wealth of knowledge that can be learned from both.” Last week, Nichols hosted entrepreneurs Brian Brackeen of Miami-based Kairos and Chris Bennett of Wonderschool and Soldsie.com for a fireside chat, dinner and networking. Bennett grew up in Miami but moved to San Francisco in 2009. While both entrepreneurs have raised millions in venture capital and angel funding and gave advice on that, they also dished on the realities of startup life — including 180-degree pivots, botched pitches with important VCs, building and overbuilding without reaching product-market fit and somehow keeping a team focused through the toughest months. We also learned that Brackeen wakes himself up at 3 a.m. because he does his best work then, but don’t bother him at 3 p.m. — that’s nap time. Bennett is a big proponent of accelerators – he participated in NewME and 500 Startups — and he said he would do another one today. He also said the benefit to Silicon Valley is there are so many entrepreneurs, engineers and investors to learn from. “Talk to as many VCs as you can, because you learn what they care about. ... The best way to get ready for talking to VCs is to join an accelerator. The next best way is to surround yourself with entrepreneurs who have been successful and learn from them,” he said. Brackeen is bullish on the 305, including on the number of angels in South Florida and the growing infrastructure such as co-working spaces and accelerators — and maybe soon, innovation districts. “You can have the same success as a San Francisco company if you find the right people, find the right lawyer, find the right investors. There is not one model for the result,” he said. See more of their conversation here.   Coming up on Tuesday is a lunch and learn with Silicon Valley startup attorney Brian Patterson and a fireside chat with Diishan Imira, CEO and co-founder of Mayvenn. Pearson and Hatcher plan to bring more VCs down. Find more information about the VC in Residence program at blacktechweek.com/funding. For his part, Nichols said he has been impressed so far with the potential of Miami. “Successful ecosystems have universities spinning out technologies and talent, investors and angel groups, accelerators and co-working spaces — and challenges unique to those communities, that is the biggest thing. I don’t want to invest in the next Uber or the next Lyft. I want new market creators. What are big pain points for people in Miami that haven’t been met? Let’s figure out what those are and go solve them.” Nancy Dahlberg; @ndahlberg READ MORE: Blacktech Week receives $1.2 million in Knight funding to expand entrepreneur programs Marlon Nichols, co-founder of Cross Culture Ventures, Chris Bennett, founder of Soldsie.com and Wonderschool, and Brian Brackeen, founder of Miami-based startup Kairos, talk about startup life at a VC in Residence fireside chat at WeWork.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 19 April 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM Don’t worry, driverless cars are learning from Grand Theft Auto As hyper-realistic videogames are able to generate data that’s very close to what AI agents can glean on the road, some researchers are now deriving algorithms from GTAV software that’s been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector. — AFP In the race to the autonomous revolution, developers have realised there aren’t enough hours in a day to clock the real-world miles needed to teach cars how to drive themselves. Which is why Grand Theft Auto V is in the mix.  The blockbuster videogame is one of the simulation platforms researchers and engineers increasingly rely on to test and train the machines being primed to take control of the family sedan. Companies from Ford Motor Co to Alphabet Inc’s Waymo may boast about putting no-hands models on the market in three years, but there’s a lot still to learn about drilling algorithms in how to respond when, say, a mattress falls off a truck on the freeway.  If automakers and tech enterprises want to make their deadline, they have to hurry up. The test cars tricked out with lasers, sensors and cameras being put through the paces on tracks and public roads can’t do it on their own. Simulators never run out of gas – and the ones at Waymo can model driving more than 3 million miles in a single day.  “Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,” said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose, California, for Nio, a startup aiming to introduce an autonomous electric car in the US in 2020. “With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.”  As improbable as it may seem to the lay person, hyper-realistic videogames are able to generate data that’s very close to what artificial-intelligence agents can glean on the road. AI software has been playing around with games from Super Mario Bros to Angry Birds for a while now, tackling problems in controlled environments and learning through trial and error.  Last year, scientists from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and Intel Labs developed a way to pull visual information from Grand Theft Auto V. Now some researchers are deriving algorithms from GTAV software that’s been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector.  The latest in the franchise from publisher Rockstar Games Inc is just about as good as reality, with 262 types of vehicles, more than 1,000 different unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 weather conditions and countless bridges, traffic signals, tunnels and intersections. (The hoodlums, heists and accumulated corpses aren’t crucial components.)  The idea isn’t that the highways and byways of the fictional city of Los Santos would ever be a substitute for bona fide asphalt. But the game “is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from,” said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering who advises the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team.  Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance. What’s learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation.  Quick Brown Fox  Whenever a human has to grab the wheel of a test car because self-driving software hasn’t responded properly, “we’re able to play back the exact situation and predict via simulation what could have happened if the car had been left to drive itself,” Waymo said in a self-driving project report. “If the simulator shows better driving is called for, our engineers can make refinements to the software, and run those changes in simulation in order to test the fixes.”  At Toyota Motor Corp’s Toyota Research Institute in California, engineers try to “break the system” through what’s known as the Quick Brown Fox test: running mile after mile in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions.  For all the stupid mistakes motorists regularly make, the human brain is far superior to a computer in perceiving and reacting to the unexpected, from a pothole to a construction zone to a toddler chasing a ball into the street. That’s the great challenge for all the companies competing to be first in the autonomous space: how to make on-board systems better than people at driving, and make driving safer.  A looming question is what state and federal safety regulators will demand as proof an autonomous car should be given license to roam. Hundreds of billions of miles may have to be racked up, one way or another. The authorities will probably accept a combination of real and replicated, but rules spelling out requirements have yet to be written.  Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of the Toyota institute, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February that simulation should “be an acceptable equivalent to real-word testing,” with follow-up validation. That’s the road developers are increasingly travelling. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested China's ZTE appoints US head Cheng as new mobile business chief Taxing the new economy, starting with Uber, Lyft eBay’s second-quarter profit forecast falls short of estimates Alphabet's Verily unit launches study to track health data How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read Discovering Asia’s Las Vegas A place with personality Penang Gerakan urges Zairil, Dyana to lodge report over 'fake' photos advertisement Latest News JPMorgan said to plan tripling size of New York technology hub Amazon rolls out chatbot tools in race to dominate voice-powered tech Shared office space company WeWork starts facilities management service Cyberattack hits 1,200 InterContinental hotels in US Amazon says it is bringing retail shopfront service to Australia Most Viewed in Tech The original Starcraft now available as free download Bose headphones spy on listeners: lawsuit Could 18:9 displays become the new smartphone standard?

Microsoft has bought back a power-saving feature in its latest Preview Build of Windows 10.  According to blog post, the latest build (16176) features “Power Throttling” that uses modern processor architecture to run background work in a power-efficient manner, improving battery life. Microsoft had introduced the feature in an earlier preview build (15002), but it failed to make an appearance on the Creators Update, launched earlier this month. This experiment showed up to 11% savings in CPU power consumption for some of the most strenuous use cases, according to  Bill Karagounis, director of program management for the Windows Insider program and OS fundamentals.  READ NEXT: The Windows 10 Creators Update is brutally timed for NSW school holidays “With ‘Power Throttling’, when background work is running, Windows places the CPU in its most energy efficient operating modes – work gets done, but the minimal possible battery is spent on that work,” he said. The new feature is currently available only for processors with Intel’s Speed Shift technology, available in Intel’s 6th-gen (and beyond) Core processors, but the firm is working on working on expanding support to other processors as well over the next few months.

Consider the affluent neighbor immediately south of us. California’s prosperity correlates well with the percentage of foreign-born to whom the Golden State is now home. More than a quarter — about 27 percent — of California’s population was born outside the country. It is no wonder that the Silicon Valley looks more and more like the United Nations. Consider a contrast, West Virginia: The state is an economic laggard, where elections are won or lost depending on how one talks about coal, not silicon. Here, too, there is a correlation between the economy and the percentage of foreign-born. Barely 1.4 percent of the population in West Virginia was born outside the U.S. Immigrants do not flock to West Virginia. It is more than a mere correlation, of course. The foreign-born population cannot afford to be jobless and poor, whether they are here legally or illegally, and whether they are skilled or unskilled. Hence, immigrants almost always head to states where there is potential for work and wages. California offers that promise, and West Virginia does not. In this broad framework, Abigail Cooke, an assistant professor of geography at the University at Buffalo, and Thomas Kemeny, a research assistant professor at UB and at the University of Southampton in England, recently published their research findings in the journal Economic Geography. There is “a strong relationship between greater immigrant diversity and higher productivity — in this case, wages.” Jobs and incomes are urban-based. “What we found was remarkable. In cities that are unwelcoming to immigrants, as diversity rises, people’s wages either don’t change, or they go up by only a small amount. In cities that are welcoming to immigrants, as diversity goes up, people’s wages go up, and by a lot,” Cooke notes. It is an interesting feedback cycle. Cities and states with growing economies attract immigrants. This influx strengthens the human capital that in turn creates more economic growth and development. Such dynamics are seen not merely in the contrast between California and West Virginia. In Oregon, the foreign-born account for about 9.8 percent of the population. Even within the state, we can observe differences between, for example, the Portland area, where the economy is based on modern economic activities, and Coos Bay, whose economy was based on natural resources. An economy based on resources that were prized in the past — like timber — lags behind one that is driven by the likes of Intel and Nike. This means we will also notice a corresponding significant difference in the percentage of the foreign-born in the Portland area vs. coastal communities. A diverse immigrant population is naturally attracted to regions for obvious economic reasons — even farming grains, fruits, and flowers, with considerable export potential, will attract immigrants. The implications of unequal economic growth and development across the geography of the country, and within the regions of a state, are serious. Richard Florida, an academic and public intellectual based in Toronto, has always been enthusiastic about cities — but he is now worried about a new urban crisis. Florida writes in a recent essay about the winner-take-all urbanism “in which the talented and the advantaged cluster and colonize a small, select group of superstar cities, leaving everybody and everywhere else behind. Much more than a crisis of cities, the New Urban Crisis is the central crisis of our time.” Modern economic activities are urban-based, and immigrants flock to those urban areas with the greatest economic potential. The reinforcing feedback cycle makes some cities and regions more prosperous than others, and soon we have regions that are seemingly left behind. These left-behind regions, like West Virginia, are also home to a less diverse population. It has long been clear that economic advancement does not seem to reach such places as West Virginia or Coos Bay. We the people need to try to understand such complexities in a rapidly evolving global economic geography. And, more importantly, we will need political leaders who can articulate constructive policy responses that will not dampen the pace of economic development even while assisting the under-performing regions. Or, we can simplistically decide that immigrants in a heterogeneous California are to blame for the lack of economic opportunities in an overwhelmingly homogeneous West Virginia. I would rather that we attracted the immigrants, instead of chasing them away. Sriram Khé of Eugene (AmDrKhe@gmail.com) teaches geography at Western Oregon University.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Here are 7 of The Best YouTube Channels for Learning About Technology Rehan Ahmed 2 days ago There is a reason why learning through a teacher is always considered to be easier than learning yourself, be it from books or guides. We, as human beings, are wired to learn better when taught by another person, who can explain concepts and answer any questions the pupils might have. There is a certain transformative power associated with an effective teacher. You can find the full courseware about almost anything you want to learn online, but understanding it is another matter. There are a number of great online learning platforms that offer paid as well as free courses, but what better resource to learn online than YouTube? It is free, easy to use, doesn’t even require a sign-up, and is accessible from every corner of the world. Just a while ago, we covered “6 of the best YouTube channels for learning about Science”. Now, we are focusing on some of the best YouTube channels learning about Technology. 1. PCWizKids Subscribers: 90K+ Total Views: 38 Million+ PCWizKids is a channel for true PC geeks.

Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg credited his “Jewish mother” for giving him the willpower to turn down a $1 billion buyout offer from Yahoo! in 2006 - at a time when he was only 22 years old and the social network was only making $20 million in revenue. Mike Hoefflinger, Facebook’s former director of global business marketing, recounted the story in his book “Becoming Facebook,” which came out earlier this month. Hoefflinger recalled being present at a lunch meeting in 2009 between Zuckerberg and legendary businessman Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel. Grove, trying, in Hoeflinger’s words, to “determine the legitimacy—his bar was notoriously high—of his lunch companion,” asked Zuckerberg how he turned down Yahoo’s offer, a decision for which he was heavily criticized at the time. “I just thought we could do it,” Zuckerberg replied, adding that he believed at the time that Facebook could grow to become a successful company with a much higher valuation. “Where does that willpower come from?” Grove asked. As Hoefflinger wrote, “Zuckerberg considered the question—possibly for the first time—and concluded simply, ‘Jewish mother.’” Contact Aiden Pink at pink@forward.com or on Twitter at @aidenpink.

Box 964, Chiloquin, OR 97624 ← Trump’s Poll Numbers Rise for Every Bomb He Drops John Lamb ~ NO VERDICT YET 4/18/17 → Facebook Gives Staff Green Light to Join May 1 Political Protests Posted on April 19, 2017 by Kantucky Bloomberg – by Josh Eidelson Facebook Inc. said it won’t punish employees who take time off to join pro-immigrant protests on May 1. And, in a nod to security staff, janitors, shuttle-bus drivers and others who work for Facebook contractors on campus, the company also said it will investigate if any of its vendors illegally crack down on their employees’ protest rights. “At Facebook, we’re committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where employees feel comfortable expressing their opinions and speaking up,” a spokesman wrote in an emailed statement. “We support our people in recognizing International Workers’ Day and other efforts to raise awareness for safe and equitable employment conditions.”   Facebook notified employees of its policy in a posting on an internal forum April 14. A spokesman said it applies regardless of whether workers notify the company ahead of time. The Menlo Park, California, company also said it would re-evaluate its ties to any vendor if it breaks the law that protects workers’ rights to organize and protect themselves. “It’s important not just to the engineers and H-1B holders that are traditionally thought of as the immigrants in tech but also to folks who are subcontracted but work side-by-side on those campuses,” said Derecka Mehrens, co-founder of Silicon Valley Rising, a union-backed coalition. “Immigrants play a critical role in the tech sector — both as engineers and coders but also in keeping tech campuses running smoothly.” Many tech companies have been vocal in their opposition to aspects of Trump’s agenda. Facebook has criticized Trump’s immigration moves. At a rally in January at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California, CEO Sundar Pichai and co-founder Sergey Brin spoke against Trump’s executive order that closed U.S. borders to people from several majority-Muslim nations. Both companies, along with Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., are among more than 120 firms that signed a February court filing opposing the travel ban. Activists have been pushing for more. On March 29, employee delegations spearheaded by Silicon Valley Rising visited 20 tech firms, including Facebook, to ask them to show support for immigrant workers and to promise that there would be no retaliation against employees who protested on May 1. They also visited Google sites in seven cities last week to make the same demand. Next month’s worker walkouts and rallies, which organizers pledge will draw massive participation, are among an array of efforts to take on the new administration using workplace power and pressure on management. “Our members are pushing us to be part of this resistance in a bolder way than ever,” said Denise Solis, vice president of United Service Workers West, a California-based affiliate of the Service Employee International Union that represents 40,000 janitors, security officers and other workers. Among the goals, she said, is “sending a message to employers that this is not the time for them to take advantage of this situation and act irresponsibly” toward their immigrant workforce. Employers across industries are in a tricky position, said Peter Cappelli, a management professor who directs the Center for Human Resources at the University of Pennsylvania’s business school. They’re navigating conflicting concerns, including the need to compete for liberal employees and customers, and the desire to secure pro-business policy changes and lucrative government contracts. CEOs of companies like Uber Technologies Inc., Walt Disney Co. and IBM joined Trump’s business advisory council, only to find themselves the targetsof protests, including from their own staff. “They are making calculated economic decisions based on their stakeholders,” said Cappelli, and not many will opt to aggressively antagonize the president. “For the most part, they’re going to duck it.” Facebook has already weathered scrutiny from all sides. Conservatives accused it of a liberal bias in its News Feed. Liberals criticized CEO Mark Zuckerberg for keeping Trump supporter Peter Thiel on the board, which Zuckerberg has defended. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-18/facebook-gives-staff-green-light-to-protest-trump-on-may-1 Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

I wonder just how all inclusive these liars truly are. Reply wasntme says: April 19, 2017 at 10:57 am “…the company also said it will investigate if any of its vendors illegally crack down on their employees’ protest rights.” i.e. – require them to show up for their job instead of “protesting” I will spend International Workers’ Day going to work.

Qualcomm said on Wednesday that Apple's contract manufacturers including Foxconn paid royalties, although they withheld around $1 billion from the undisclosed total amount due. The amount withheld equaled the amount Qualcomm withheld from Apple last year under a separate agreement to cooperate on mobile technology that has since expired. Shares of Qualcomm, which have lost 19% so far this year, were up 2% in after hours trading based on news of the royalty payments and quarterly results which were somewhat better than Wall Street analysts expected. Qualcomm said it was unsure whether Apple's manufacturers would withhold any royalties owed during the current quarter. Apple declined to comment. The partial royalty payments and future uncertainty come as a legal disputes over intellectual property rights in the mobile market have reignited after a few years of quiet. Apple, which sued makers of Android phones for patent infringement six years ago, filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in January that claimed the mobile chip designer charged excessive royalties to use its technology and alleged that Qualcomm owed Apple $1 billion in rebates. Last week, Qualcomm counter-sued, saying Apple had violated agreements between the two companies. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. "We have successfully navigated challenges like this in the past and we have confidence in the sustainability of our licensing business," Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said on a call with analysts on Wednesday. "But we know these periods can generate added volatility in near term results and require open and regular dialogue with our investors."

The mobile chip maker charges phone makers a percentage of the price of every phone, regardless of whether the device includes chips actually sold by Qualcomm or a competitor like Intel (intc). Qualcomm's royalty business brings in the lion's share of its pre-tax profits, or 80% in the most recent quarter–despite accounting for only about half the revenue brought in by its chip sales. Disclosure of the withheld royalty payments came as Qualcomm (qcom) reported results for the first quarter of 2017, its fiscal second quarter. Adjusted revenue of $6 billion was up 8% from a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share rose 29% to $1.34 and beat Wall Street analyst expectations of $1.19 per share. Why Apple and Qualcomm are headed to court: Analysts said Apple (aapl) and its manufacturers likely would continue to pay at least a portion of what they owe in the future. "The $1 billion cooperation agreement ended at the end of 2016, so Qualcomm is preparing for smaller payments in the next quarter, not zero payments as that would be unprecedented," says Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy.

As Zen+ IPC will improve and clock is likely to improve too. As for AMD/nVidia skipping 10nm, it is just question of parameters of this manufacturing technology.

They still only have a single gen out of the 16/14nm, so it would seem wasteful to drop any optimisation and jump to 10nm only to start from a scratch. Not that Nvidia wouldn't have the money for it. If 7nm is ready when they are ready to move on, it would seem like a more efficient move.

Advertisement 2016 was a busy year for the video card business, with both major players introducing their new architecture to the gaming public. While Nvidia attempted to hit every corner of the market with its broad-ranging line of Pascal-based cards, AMD attempted to gain ground by focusing on the lower end of the spectrum with its first generation of Polaris-based cards. At the top of the line was the AMD Radeon RX 480, a card aimed at delivering VR-ready performance at around $200. Below that was the RX 470, a solid 1080p performer priced below $200. Both were and remain solid cards, but low supply and high demand saw many buyers paying a premium price for what should have been an excellent value. Advertisement Now we have the Radeon RX 500 line, AKA not the powerful cards featuring AMD’s new Vega architecture everyone was hoping for. AMD is calling the RX 500 series the second generation of Polaris, though it’s less of an upgrade and more of a refresh. The line consists of enhanced versions of the RX 460, 470 and 480, along with an $80 RX 550 card, you know, for the kids. We’re focusing on the very familiar Radeon RX 570 and 580. Most of the specs for the RX 570 and RX 580 are exactly the same as last year’s RX 470 and RX 480. They’re basically the same thing, only slightly more powerful. The RX 580 has had its clock speed upped to 1,257 MHz base and 1,340 MHz boosted over the 480's 1,120/1,266, while the RX 570 tops its predecessor at 1,168/1,244 Mhz to the older card’s 926/1,206. Like I said, it’s a small but significant improvement. Note that these specs are reference specifications, but AMD isn’t releasing reference cards this time around. Instead we’ve got a slew of board partner offerings available, many of which provide even more of a boost. The Sapphire RX 580 Nitro+ 8GB card we tested (the RX 580 is also available in 4GB versions) kicks the boost clock up to 1,411 MHz, while the ASUS RX 570 Strix OC card we received boosts to 1,278 MHz. The Sapphire Nitro+ RX 580 is pretty on the bottom, plain on the top and outfitted with striking heat pipes on the inside. Here’s a list of RX 470 and 480 partner cards available at launch. Advertisement Sponsored ASUS $189 for RX 570 STRIX OC 4GB (tested) $179 for RX 570 STRIX 4GB Gigabyte $259 for RX 580 Aorus OC 8GB $229 for RX 580 Aorus 8GB $219 for RX 580 Gaming 8GB $199 for RX 580 Aorus 4GB $189 for RX 580 Gaming 4GB $179 for RX 570 Aorus 4GB $169 for RX 570 Gaming 4GB MSI $245 for RX 580 Gaming 8G $229 for RX 580 ARMOR 8G $199 for RX 580 ARMOR 4G $175 for RX 570 ARMOR 4G Sapphire Advertisement $275 for RX 580 Nitro+ Limited edition 8GB $249 for RX 580 Nitro+ 8GB (tested) $229 for RX 580 Pulse 8GB $209 for RX 580 Pulse 4GB $199 for RX 570 Nitro+ 4GB $169 for RX 570 Pulse 4GB TUL Advertisement $269 for RX 580 8GB Red Devil Golden Sample $249 for RX 580 8GB Red Devil $229 for RX 580 8GB Red Dragon $199 for RX 580 4GB Red Dragon $175 for RX 570 4GB Red Dragon It’s 2017, and the Asus Strix card is sporting dual DVI ports. This will doubtlessly overjoy someone. Before we get into performance, let me say right off the bat that if you purchased an RX 470 or RX 480 last year, don’t feel compelled to trade up to the newer, slightly more powerful models. You’ve still got a fine card. Save your cash for when the Vega cards come out later this year. AMD’s target audience for the Radeon RX 500 series is the reportedly large number of gamers still playing on video cards two years old or older. AMD tells us that audience is more than 500 million strong, some 80 percent of all PC gamers. The RX 570 is for those looking for a smooth experience on modern games at 1080p. The RX 580 is for those who might be up for pushing towards 1440p. Advertisement As for the competition, AMD is pitting the RX 580 against Nvidia’s $299 Geforce GTX 1060, while the RX 570 has its sights on the GTX 1050 Ti, priced at $199. Performance I took turns swapping the two cards out of my current work system, featuring an Intel Core i7 6700, 16GB of pretty old Corsair DDR4 memory and damn I really need to upgrade my testing PC. I’ve got a newer system with an AMD Ryzen 1700x and much newer memory, but I decided to stick to the more known quantity for the purposes of benchmarking. Since we already know a lot about how these chips are put together (everybody loves finfet) and in the interest of time, I stuck with the basics. Here come the frames per seconds. GIF If you’re looking for absurd numbers, look elsewhere. These are a couple of low to lower-middle range cards with modest goals in mind. Both do an admirable job of handling some of today’s tougher games at unreasonably high settings. Advertisement Advertisement The Radeon RX 580 hovered around or at the 60 frames per second mark for the more demanding titles, the average dropping below that for Ashes of the Singularity, which is mean, and Metro Last Light Redux, which is always kind of a dick. The RX 570 did its best, keeping its distance from the scores of its more powerful sibling but still putting up a good fight. Richard Leadbetter over at Eurogamer ran a comparison between the newer cards and last year’s releases, and the RX 570 performs about the same as last year’s RX 480. That’s quite a nice bump. GIF The Radeon RX 580 would love to be a card for reliable 2160p gaming, but it’s probably not going to be that if you stick to ultra settings. Hitman running DirectX 12 managed to break the 60 frames per second barrier here, while the rest hung out in the high 40s, early 50s. Except Metro Last Light Redux. I don’t even known why I include it anymore. Advertisement And look at that Radeon RX 570! If you don’t mind 30 frames per second, you’d be hard-pressed to find a card in its price range to handle 2160p as well. Final Thoughts That’s the key, isn’t it? The price range. Before I started swapping in the new Radeon RX 500 series cards, I had a Nvidia Geforce 1080 ti in my system, blowing most games out of the water at 4K resolution. But that’s a $700 card. The Radeon RX 580 starts at around $220 for the 8GB version, and it either keeps up with or outperforms Nvidia’s similarly priced GTX 1060 6GB. It’s hard to say what’s going to happen when AMD starts rolling out its new Vega cards later this year, but that’s a worry for another time and likely another price bracket. Things at the lower end of the price pool are heating up as AMD introduces a pair of strong swimmers.

Though exposed to all the latest advertising technologies and trends, there were three topics that really stood out in terms of guiding advertising in the future: neuroscience, the impact of mobile on media behavior and the theory of “pre-suasion” in messaging. • Neuroscience The measurement of emotional responses to advertising through neuroscience was a major theme prevalent across numerous SXSW sessions. Studies conducted by the Advertising Research Foundation (ARF) showed that adding neuroscience testing to traditional ad testing may help to predict the impact that ads will have on sales. Using neuroscience testing, marketers can map consumer brain activity second-by-second during their exposure to advertising in order to measure emotional responses to ads. This allows marketers to measure what people actually feel as opposed to what they think they are feeling. While there will never be a perfect way to test and measure which advertising approach will generate the greatest results, this approach may help to enhance the impact of ads, and help to make them more memorable. • The impact of mobile Another hot topic at the conference was the impact that mobile devices are having on consumer behavior. According to eMarketer, 56% of digital media time is spent on mobile devices. People are connected to their devices all day long – at the gym, in their cars, at work, at home. A recent ARF study shows that TV viewers may only be watching programming 35% of the time. The other 65% of the time, their heads are down, looking primarily at their mobile devices. How do you fight the consumer’s fascination with their devices? One great suggestion at the conference was to use sound cues in TV commercials to bring viewer attention back to the screen. Advertisers like Intel and Farmers Insurance use audio cues to grab viewer attention or at least generate branding impact audibly if not visually. • “Pre-Suasion” While neuroscience and the impact of mobile were the most prevalent topics across the SXSW sessions, “Pre-suasion” may have been the most fascinating. While persuasion is what you put into your advertising messages to get people to say yes, “pre-suasion” is the process of arranging for people to agree with a message before they are fully exposed to it. Adding images to your advertising that focuses consumers’ attention on the most critical part of the message is pre-suasion. An example of “pre-suasion” was reflected in the results of a study done for an online furniture retailer. The retailer sent half of the visitors to its website to a landing page where the background consisted of fluffy clouds. They sent the other half of visitors to a landing page where the background consisted of pennies. People who were exposed to the images of clouds were more likely to purchase more comfortable furniture. They were trained in advance to want comfort. Those people exposed to the images of pennies were more likely to purchase more inexpensive furniture. In each case, people were pre-suaded to either buy comfortable furniture or cheaper furniture through imagery. When asked afterward if the images had an impact on their purchases, customers thought that the idea was ridiculous and that the images had no impact at all. The images helped to focus the internal preferences of customers to either comfort or price. As the advertising landscape continues to evolve quickly, information, like that above, that can be gleaned from conferences like SXSW is invaluable in helping marketers stay on the cutting edge and get the best results for clients. ––––––––––––––––––– Editor’s note: Brian Kratkiewicz is senior vice president of media and innovation at CJRW, a communications firm in Little Rock and Northwest Arkansas.

Cue wailing, gnashing of teeth, and portents of doom. But this may not be quite so bad as it appears, because the OpenStack Innovation Center isn’t nearly so critical to the open source cloud computing project as its name might imply. Before I joined Forrester I used to post a short thought (almost) every day, commenting on some piece of news that caught my interest. The last of these, on 24 July 2015, was concerned with the then-new OpenStack Innovation Center. I was unimpressed. You see, the OpenStack Innovation Center isn’t an initiative of the OpenStack Foundation. Despite the name, it was only a joint initiative of two contributors to the OpenStack project – Intel and (OpenStack co-founder) Rackspace. They set up some clusters, for developers to test code. And they did some work to make OpenStack more enterprise-ready. Both efforts were useful, for sure. But both of these things were already happening in plenty of other places.

Dow Jones industrial average American Express (AXP), eBay (EBAY), Qualcomm (QCOM), CSX (CSX) and United Rentals (URI) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) all topped quarterly earnings estimates after Wednesday's closing bell. EBay Estimates: Wall Street expects the online auction site to report fiscal Q2 EPS of 48 cents, up 2%, on revenue of $2.21 billion, up 5%. Results: EPS was 49 cents, revenue was $2.22 billion. Gross merchandise volume $20.9 billion. Outlook: EBay sees Q2 EPS of 43-45 cents and sales of $2.28 billion to $2.32 billion vs. views for EPS of 47 cents and revenue of $2.32 billion. For the full year it sees adjusted EPS of $1.98 billion to $2.03 billion vs. estimates of $2.21. Full-year revenue guidance of $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion is below the consensus for $9.96 billion. Stock: Shares of eBay sank 2% in late trading. Shares closed down 0.5% at 33.85 in the stock market today, still in range at that time from a 32.95 buy point. Investors are likely to focus on the overall value of the items sold on eBay, RBC said recently. The firm also said Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) have emerged as competitors. American Express Estimates: Wall Street expects the credit-card issuer to report first-quarter EPS down 12% to $1.28, with revenue slipping 4.2% to $7.75 billion. Results: American Express earned $1.34, with revenue of $7.89 billion. Stock: American Express rose 2% in after-hours action. Shares closed off 0.3%, trying to hold support at the bottom end of a flat base. American Express got hit last year after the company lost its card partnership with Costco (COST). The company is also battling it out with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to offer a better high-end, high-fee card, after Chase's Visa (V) Sapphire grabbed attention. Visa, another Dow component, will report earnings on Thursday. Unlike American Express, Visa does not hold card balances, which are kept by issuing banks like Chase. RELATED: Dow Stock American Express Ups Ante In High-Fee, High-End Card Race Qualcomm Estimates: Fiscal Q2 EPS up 14% to $1.19; revenue up 6% to $5.89 billion. Results: EPS of $1.34, revenue of $5.99 billion. Outlook: Qualcomm sees Q3 EPS of 90 cents to $1.15 vs. the consensus for $1.10. It expects revenue of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion vs. analyst forecasts for $5.95 billion. Stock: Qualcomm rose more than 2% in after-hours action. Shares of the wireless chipmaker closed down 0.1%, after sinking last week following sluggish sales from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and legal issues. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh recently wrote that market-share gains with China's major handset makers could help Qualcomm, even as the handset market in that nation shows some weakness, RELATED: Qualcomm Loses BlackBerry Arbitration Amid Apple Dispute Qualcomm: Apple Misled On Intel Chip Performance In iPhone 7 CSX Estimates: A Q1 EPS jump of 16% to 43 cents. The railroad operator's revenue is expected to rise 5.5% to $2.76 billion. Results: Adjusted EPS of 51 cents, revenue climbed 10%. Stock:  CSX shares rose nearly 3% in after-hours trading. CSX closed up 0.6%. The stock is in a flat base. Hunter Harrison, an executive known for finding ways to get more profits out of railroads, took over the rail operator last month. Steel Dynamics Estimates: Analysts expect the steel producer to report a 192% surge in Q1 EPS to 76 cents, with a 27% hike in revenue to $2.21 billion. Results: Steel Dynamics earned 82 cents a share on revenue of $2.4 billion. Stock: The steel maker reported at 6 p.m. ET, so trading was light following the results. Shares closed the regular session up 0.1%. The stock, like others in the steel sector, jumped after the election. But Steel Dynamics shares have cooled as expectations dim for how quickly the Trump administration might be able to carry out infrastructure investments and protectionist policies. Steel Dynamics and Nucor (NUE), which reports Thursday, already warned on Q1 results. RELATED: This 'Explosive' Protectionist Signal From Trump Looks Like A Dud United Rentals Estimates: EPS up 8.6% to $1.52, with revenue up 1.8% to $1.33 billion. Results: EPS was $1.63, revenue $1.356 billion. But United Rentals said rental rates are still under pressure. Outlook: United Rentals raised its full-year revenue target range to $6.05 billion to $6.25 billion from $5.75 billion to $5.95 billion. The analyst consensus is $6.05 billion. Stock: Shares fell 6% in after-hours trading on pricing concerns. United Rentals closed down 0.4%. United Rentals, which rents out construction and industrial equipment, also got a boost from Trump's potential infrastructure plans. Shares are currently in a flat base.

By Gregg Keizer Senior Reporter, Computerworld | Apr 19, 2017 12:40 PM PT Credit: Adam Patrick Murray More like this Windows 10 Redstone: A guide to the builds New Windows 10 build is a monster update Microsoft's update shrinking reduces Windows 10 Insider betas by 65% Video Windows 10: Maps and Mail Microsoft yesterday touted operating system-wide power savings in a recent preview of Windows 10, claiming that the technology will reduce notebook battery consumption by 11% on laptops equipped with the newest processors. The technology, temporarily tagged as "Power Throttling," was enabled on all copies of Windows 10 Insider build 16176, which Microsoft released Friday. Insider is the beta program Microsoft runs for both enthusiasts and businesses. The latter rely on Insider to learn how the OS will change for the next feature upgrade, as well as for testing the upgrade prior to deploying the final code when it is shipped several months later. [ Related: Windows 10 Redstone: A guide to the builds ] "With 'Power Throttling,' when background work is running, Windows places the CPU in its most energy efficient operating modes -- work gets done, but the minimal possible battery is spent on that work," Bill Karagounis, director of program management for Insider, said in a post to a company blog. The CPU throttling is triggered on an app-specific basis by a detection system Microsoft integrated with the OS, said Karagounis. Like other such technologies, Microsoft's is meant to recognize foreground tasks -- such as active apps -- as well as persistent applications, like music streaming applications, then give them full access to the processor. Other apps, or even individual processes within an app, that are classified as "background," are restricted in how they impact the CPU's power usage. For instance, they may not be allowed to kick the processor into its higher-frequency, higher-power, higher-consumption mode. Power Throttling works only on Intel processors with that firm's Speed Shift, a feature of sixth-generation and later CPUs, including "Skylake" and the newer "Kaby Lake." Recognizing that most personal computers are laptops and that battery longevity is a major factor in productivity, Microsoft has aggressively promoted Windows 10's power savings, notably in the boosterism behind Edge, the OS's default browser. The Redmond, Wash. company isn't working in a vacuum: Other operating systems also try to eke out more battery life by scaling back CPU use. Apple's iOS, for instance, switches to a low-power mode when an iPhone or iPad battery reaches about 20% capacity. Among other things, the iOS mode halts background app refreshing and stops automatic email fetching. Microsoft first added Power Throttling to Windows 10 in January, saying that it had turned it on for a subset of Insider-equipped devices as an experiment and promising to provide an update in mid-February. That update never appeared, hinting that Microsoft pulled it from inclusion in the then-upcoming Creators Update, the feature upgrade released April 11. The first opportunity most users will have to apply Power Throttling will be with 2017's second feature upgrade. Microsoft has not revealed a release timetable, but most experts expect it to appear this fall.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Latest Windows Insider build aims to squeeze the… Latest Windows Insider build aims to squeeze the life out of background processes By Jayce Wagner — April 18, 2017 2:59 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The Windows Insider Program acts as a test bed for new features, so it's important to keep an eye on what Microsoft has in the works. The Creators Update is live, but work continues behind the scenes, with Windows Insiders getting a taste of some brand-new features on the horizon. Today’s Insider build includes the usual assortment of bug fixes, and just might extend your laptop’s battery life. Insiders installing Build 16176 can expect some slight improvements in overall battery life, thanks to Microsoft’s new “Power Throttling” feature. Designed to make background applications more efficient, Power Throttling can reportedly decrease your CPU power consumption by about 11 percent in strenuous use cases. “To give great performance to the apps you’re using, while at the same time power throttling background work, we built a sophisticated detection system into Windows,” said Bill Karagounis, director of program management for the Windows Insider Program. Windows will automatically detect which applications are most important to you — foreground applications and the like — and start throttling the power consumption of other, less important processes. Power Throttling works as an add-on to the existing battery saver settings, and users can control it through the Power Slider, scaling throttling up and down depending on their workload. Aside from the Power Slider, users can also control how Power Throttling works through the Battery Settings menu. From there, it’s easy to exempt certain applications if Power Throttling is misbehaving or throttling an important application’s CPU usage. It’s important to note that Power Throttling only works on systems running processors with Intel’s Speed Shift technology — which is available in sixth-generation Intel Core processors and beyond. Microsoft has stated, however, that it has plans to roll out support to other processors in the future. Microsoft also set about fixing a few major bugs introduced in the previous Insider build. For instance, some apps and games were crashing unexpectedly due to a misconfigured advertising ID caused in a previous build, and Microsoft has reportedly fixed the issue. For a full list of all the bug fixes and known issues in this latest Insider build, check out the Microsoft blog here.

Ryan Brooks reports.   Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter Sorry, Navy families. It's a tense time for a deployment. As military families know, high tensions in the world can mean more a longer absence for Dad or Mom. That’s the case for the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier group, which includes the Coronado-based carrier and two other local warships, the destroyer Wayne E. Meyer and cruiser Lake Champlain. Last night, the commander of the Vinson strike group posted a Facebook message announcing a 30-day extension to a deployment that began in early January. “I promised to keep you apprised of changes as soon as we knew and when we are authorized to communicate them. Our deployment has been extended 30 days to provide a persistent presence in the waters off the Korean Peninsula,” wrote Rear Adm. Jim Kilby, commander of Carrier Strike Group One. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day The intersection of the Vinson group deployment and North Korea’s nuclear saber rattling has spawned many headlines in recent days — the oddest of which probably came yesterday. That’s when news outlets realized that the carrier was not heading toward Korea — as early announced by the Navy. Instead it was in the Indian Ocean. Either way, looks like roughly 6,000 sailors will be gone a month longer than planned.

(AAPL) iPhone 8 Facing a Resurgent Samsung (SSNLF) F8 Conference: Facebook Inc (FB) Bets Big on AR Apple Inc. (AAPL) Predicted to Ramp Up New iMac Production in May View All Posts We know that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has new versions of its iMac all-in-one PC in the pipeline. We also know it’s working on a pro iMac, aimed at power users who may not need quite as much firepower as a Mac Pro. Source: Apple What wasn’t entirely clear was the release time frame. A new report based on information from Apple’s supply chain, however, says the new iMac models will go into production in May, with launch in the second half of 2017. The pro iMac is likely to go on sale at the end of the year. Apple’s Push to Reassure Mac Fans Apple has been in a rut in terms of Mac development, focusing on the iPhone over the past several years. The iPad and Apple Watch have also seemed to be more in the forefront in Apple’s plans. As a result, many Mac models have gone for years without an update. When AAPL finally released an all-new version of its iconic MacBook Pro in late 2016, it was blasted by many Mac loyalists for questionable design choices that included dropping all legacy ports in favor of USB-C. Several weeks ago, senior Apple Executives sat down with tech journalists in a rare event to discuss their plans for Mac development. In the session, AAPL assured the media that it remained committed to its Mac PCs. The company admitted to design missteps — another rarity. And it promised new iMac models were in the pipeline, including a new pro iMac aimed at professional users. AAPL was short on details, but a new report out of Apple’s supply chain is starting to fill those in. What to Expect From the New iMac, and When Digitimes published a report this morning based on information from sources in Apple’s supply chain. They claim the new iMac — in the same 21.5 and 27-inch versions as currently offered — will go into production starting in May. That would put the consumer models of the new iMac on track to hit store shelves by the third quarter of 2017. Details about the new pro iMac Apple promised have also emerged. According to Digitimes, this is going to be a server grade powerhouse of an all-in-one PC. Claims include an Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) Xeon CPU, 16 to 64GB of ECC RAM, an advanced NVMe SSD (up to 2 TB in capacity) and current generation discrete graphics card. Release of this pro iMac would be late in 2017. Digitimes also claims both new iMac models — consumer and pro — will be manufactured by Quanta Computer (OTCMKTS:QUCPF). If accurate, the Digitimes report is good news for Mac fans, and for Apple. The iMac hasn’t seen an upgrade since 2015. Having the mass-market versions of the new iMac available in Q3 would mean Apple should be able to catch the back-to-school rush and be in a strong position to take advantage of any holiday computer shopping. And if the pro iMac details are correct, Apple will have a beast of an all-in-one PC in its lineup, that should be capable of anything from professional design to 3D modelling and even PC gaming. Apple’s global Mac sales were up slightly in Q1, even as overall PC sales continued their slide. With new iMac models in the mix, AAPL’s second-largest division may be on the upswing in 2017. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. More From InvestorPlace Apple Inc. Telegraphs Record iPhone 8 Sales (AAPL) Apple Inc.

The world of Minority Report is about to be unlocked, and the key is inside your phone Posted 12 hours ago by Mike Butcher (@mikebutcher) 0 SHARES Next Story Facebook wants to help you hear through your skin Remember that scene in Minority Report where Tom Cruise’s character walks into a Gap and an AI voice asks him if he’s still enjoying the trousers he bought last week? That vision was dreamt up by MIT consultants for the film many years ago, and as of today it would be entirely possible to reproduce, given we all now walk around with smartphones which could be alerted in such a manner. There’s just a few snags. GPS, Bluetooth, NFC and Beacons are all technologies which have singularly failed to live up to the hype around hyper-location targeting. My inbox is daily filled with startups doing ‘in-store’ location targeting, with various flavours of Wifi, Bluetooth, you name it. None of them have interested me in the slightest. Until, that is, I met NewAer at the most recent SXSW. In a demo area with, crucially, a bar, I slipped a small plastic disc into my pocket (a ‘physical cookie’ if you will) which — once loaded — magically contained my Facebook profile. As I walked around the room, I would be, without asking, presented with my favourite drink (G&T) and put into a queue for a side-demo of a VR experience just by hanging close by, instead of waiting in line. I could approach screens which would tell me if there were any other people from London in the room. I didn’t retrieve or open my phone once the whole time, and every experience was tailored to me. If I walked away from the area my data and profile disappeared from the screens. But that wasn’t the greatest revelation. What was truly interesting to me was that I didn’t even need this little Beacon sitting in my pocket. I could have done the same thing with an app on my phone, which would allow me to set all my communication and privacy preferences, and which wouldn’t suck precious battery power away. That, to me, is the game changer. It also wouldn’t need me to download multiple apps for multiple locations. Walking me through the experience was founder Dave Mathews. This entrepreneur should know about location-based apps and linked the physical world with online. He has in fact been championing creating a ‘physical cookie’ for some time. He pioneered the CueCat barcode reader which could link printed magazine articles to the Web back in 2000. It’s been a long journey, but it looks like he may now have cracked what could be a huge market going forward. He even wrote a story in 2012 as to why location-based apps have failed in the past. For how else will the Walmarts and small retailers of this world compete against Amazon without a way to tailor their real-world retail environments to customer preferences? The applications don’t stop there, but let’s first explore how all this works. NewAer has an app called Kiosk. Under the hood, this a WebKit-based browser with integrated Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) detection built in. That means it can determine the range of nearby mobile devices and automatically change what is displayed on the screen. Mobile devices can be Android, iOS, or even fitness Wearables and iBeacons. NewAer’s Kiosk app (less than 8MB big) then lets an iPad or maybe even an Apple TV act as a digital signage host and turns the iPhone into a client. In reality, NewAer is far more likely to appear inside, say, an airline’s app to display your personal flight time on a nearby display in the lounge, of instance. So far they’ve worked with multiple airlines on pilot projects to do just this such as American Airlines and Lufthansa. What NewAer is tapping into an old idea left by the wayside by phone makers which used to be pretty interesting. It meant you could use your phone like a little server, broadcasting information. In the distant past Nokia had an app called Sensor which could broadcast a little web page about yourself to those nearby. It was almost like a hyper-location-based Tinder which could work inside in underground bar, far from 3G. Today we have NFC for similar applications, but this technology is locked down by Apple for their payment system. NewAer can now open up this up by allowing Bluetooth to work like NFC. At the demo, Mathews had the Kiosk app set up to receive data under one foot of distance for assigning guest’s Facebook profiles to the little circular iBeacon. Literally a small plastic circle. I could assign my Facebook ID to this bit of plastic and walk around the room trying out various applications. The best part, of course, was having my ID signed to my favourite drink at the bar. NFC can’t do this but Bluetooth can. Where it gets really interesting is when you make NewAer Kiosk work on a smartphone to turn it into an iBeacon. That means you could either ask your users to download an application or have the NewAer SDK embedded inside an existing application. Developers can download the SDK for free at ProximityPlatform online or develop their own web interactions after downloading Kiosk in the iTunes store. NewAer acts as an iBeacon that can wake up a mobile phone, even when the app is closed by the user. Kiosk runs on an iPad, the 4th Gen Apple TV and Raspberry Pi 3 to drive digital signage inside of spaces. Its investors include Intel Capital and Telekom Ventures. The disruption NewAer presages could be transformational. Right now Apple has iBeacon and Google has Eddystone. Dozens of companies make beacons which are $15-33 devices built on that ecosystem. Both of these competitors require those beacons to be placed in stores and both wake up the user phone – effectively spamming them. The whole area has more or less failed. Turning all this into a simple, free SDK (not requiring $15-33!) inside an app which does not spam the user and allows them to tailor the experience would utterly disrupt how this technology could be applied and literally set it free from physical beacons. Imagine seeing monitors and screens that are already on the walls of airports and malls come to life for you with relevant information (gate and time, or special offers based on your personal preferences) or an experience like Amazon gives you, but in the real, physical world, just like in Minority Report. But this time it doesn’t use cameras or biometrics, or reading your iris and you can opt out of any experience before, during or after within the applications which contain NewAer’s SDK. Most observers in tech would agree that iBeacon is dead. Nobody wanted to download an application for every retail store, and the beacons themselves either fell off the walls or the batteries died. They didn’t protect privacy, spammed users and even the Apple store didn’t have a positive interaction with them. As NewAer hints, the future of mobile will be an “agent” doing things for you once you set a goal. Like “find me a car2go” or “send an Uber self driving car to me”. This peer-to-peer technology will make those vehicles personalized to us when they approach us. Or screens we approach. The point is that in the future people won’t need to look down at their phone. Instead they can let those things around us “greet us” with a “digital wink” or a message.

Driverless vehicles are coming, and we'll be relying on them to transport us around in the next decade if everything goes to plan. But before that can happen, the artificial intelligence controlling the cars needs to prove itself to be completely reliable. How do you do that? With lots of learning! Car AI needs to drive a lot. That may seem obvious, but the AI needs to experience any and all driving situations so as to learn and demonstrate the right reaction. It's very difficult to experience all situations on real roads, so simulation is key. And it turns out the best simulation is a game we've been enjoying for a few years now: Grand Theft Auto V. If you look past the violence, GTA V is about as complete a city and road simulation as you can get. As detailed on Bloomberg, entering the world of GTA V gives an AI access to 262 different types of car, 14 weather conditions, every road situation you can think of, and over 1,000 different types of pedestrian to deal with. Driving around the city of Los Santos day-after-day would certainly prove to be a good learning experience. Related Driverless Cars: Can They Really Eliminate Traffic? Driverless Cars: Can They Really Eliminate Traffic? Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering (PAVE) realized this, with PAVE advisor and Princeton University professor Alain Kornhauser referring to GTA V as, "the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from." Last year, Intel Labs and Darmstadt University of Technology went so far as to pull visual data from the game, and now algorithms are being developed using GTA V data to help improve driverless car AI. So when we do all start trusting an AI to safely drive us to a destination, remember it was in part due to the tireless population of Los Santos going about their daily business and acting as a teaching tool. And don't forget, this kind of sumlation isn't limited for use by the big car manufacturers. In January, the DeepDrive project opened this up to everyone.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Facebook thinks AI can replace expensive dual-camera phones Chris Davies - Apr 19, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Dual cameras are becoming a must-have feature on today’s top-tier smartphones – to the point that their absence is one of a few big complaints about the Galaxy S8 – but Facebook is looking to replace one of their most common uses with AI. At F8 2017 today, the social network’s annual developer conference, Facebook showed off one of its potential implementations of artificial intelligence. While smart computers may most commonly be associated with Facebook’s work on bots, in fact the applications are far broader. In an on-stage demo, Facebook showed how AI could replicate one of the currently fashionable effects on smartphones: virtual bokeh. Best known, perhaps, as the iPhone 7 Plus’ Portrait mode, currently the best implementations of those effects use two cameras. By offsetting the two lenses, and thus adding the ability for the phone to recognize depth, the subject of the frame can be distinguished from what’s behind them. Facebook’s alternative uses AI algorithms to analyze a scene, and from a single lens figure out the depth of what’s in it. From that, it can do the blurring calculations. On-stage, the mockup app had a slider which could be used to adjust the degree of bokeh to taste. Now, doing a portrait mode with a single camera isn’t new. The Galaxy S8 has a mode for that, in fact, despite only using a single lens. Where Facebook’s system goes further is in how it applies the effect in real-time: if you move around to reframe the scene, the blurring is automatically generated within the camera preview. It’s all particularly important now, given Facebook’s focus on extending the camera. Already it’s been added to all of the company’s apps. Now, at F8, the company is talking about how computational photography, augmented reality, and more will use the expanding camera API to blend real and virtual components in the same scene. That could be everything from face filters through to digital sticky notes that could be pinned to real locations for others to find. To encourage developers to get onboard, Facebook has open-sourced Caffe2 along with Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Intel, and others. A deep learning framework, it allows developers to tap into advanced AI processing, with server-side GPU crunching, a suite of software, and a device-side element. It opens the door to a huge range of AI implementations. Indeed, artificial bokeh is only the start of it. Facebook is also working on using AI to power algorithms for casual 3D capture on any phone. Rather than require a multi-camera system – like, indeed, the x24 Facebook Surround 360 camera also announced today, a huge ball studded with 24 different lenses and sensors – the system could allow any phone to generate 3D environments which users could move around, even with a single camera.

Published: 20:06 April 19, 2017 Glenn Thrush, Nick Wingfield and Vindu Goel, New York Times News Service   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Kenosha, Wisconsin: US President Donald Trump, hammering his “America First” campaign theme, signed an order Tuesday that he said would favour American companies for federal contracts and reform the visa programme for foreign technical workers. After recent policy reversals that have angered his populist base, Trump described the visa programme as an initiative gone awry that has driven down wages for Americans. The order was a means to end the “theft of American prosperity,” which he said had been brought on by low-wage immigrant labour. Yet the order calls for a series of relatively modest steps, like a multi-agency report on changes needed for the H-1B programme, under which the government admits 85,000 foreign workers annually, many of them in the high-tech, industrial, medical and science fields. Collectively, the efforts outlined in the order could take years to carry out. The H1-B programme has become a focus in the debate over the impact of foreign workers. Trump has criticised employers for abusing the programme and using it to avoid hiring higher-paid American counterparts. He vowed to revamp its lottery-based selection process. The order, signed at the sprawling Snap-on tool factory here, represents a small win for bigger tech companies, which have been in pitched battles for those visas. Companies like Google and Microsoft, which rely heavily on high-skilled foreign workers, had worried that Trump would make drastic curbs to worker programs that could cripple them. “I think people are cautiously optimistic that this will be OK, and maybe even better,” said Tom Alberg, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle firm that invests in high-tech start-ups. But the order would likely hurt the biggest users of the visa programme, technology outsourcing firms that bring foreign workers to the United States to perform technical jobs, typically from India. On the campaign trail, Trump stoked outrage from his supporters with accounts of companies like Walt Disney forcing laid-off technical workers to train their overseas replacements. On Tuesday, Trump spoke in terms of an apple-pie populism that helped him pull off upset victories in November in Midwestern states like Wisconsin. H-1B visas “should include only the most skilled and highest-paid applicants and should never, ever be used to replace American workers,” Trump told a gathering of about 500 workers and local luminaries, including the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who hails from Kenosha. On this point, many executives at US technology companies agree with Trump. They argue that they mostly apply for H-1Bs for workers when they can’t find qualified American workers, usually those with advanced degrees like a masters or Ph.D. In recent years, there has been so much demand for H-1B visas that the whole fiscal year’s allocation has run out in a few days in April, when applications are accepted. The visas are then awarded by lottery to qualified applicants. Some 600,000 to 900,000 immigrants are currently in the United States on H-1B visas, researchers estimate. Outsourcing firms — the top 13 of which accounted for a third of all granted visas in 2014, the last year for which information is publicly available — typically flood the system with visa applications. The top recipients were Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro, all from India. India’s leading tech trade group, the National Association of Software and Services Companies, said Indian companies were being treated unfairly. “We believe that the current campaign to discredit our sector is driven by persistent myths, such as the ideas that H-1B visa holders are ‘cheap labour’ and ‘train their replacements,’ neither of which is accurate,” the group said in a statement. Companies like Microsoft, Intel and Amazon are also big recipients. At least 15 per cent of the American workforces of Facebook and the chip maker Qualcomm hold H-1Bs, according to the most recent documents the companies have filed with the Labor Department. The announcement came at a jittery time for the White House, as Trump faces the 100th day of his presidency without much to show for it in the way of legislative accomplishment, after the defeat of his health care overhaul. And his two high-profile executive orders cracking down on immigration from predominantly Muslim nations have been stymied by the courts. “This does nothing,” said Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “Like all the other executive orders, it’s just words — he’s calling for new studies. It’s not going to fix the problem. It’s not going to create a single job.” Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., whose district includes Silicon Valley, said the issue of foreign workers was real, but dismissed the president’s order as poorly targeted and unlikely to achieve its desired result. “Half of the start-ups in Silicon Valley were created by highly skilled people from other countries,” she said. “I don’t think the president and his staff fully appreciates that fact.” In a briefing with reporters Monday, White House officials said the “Buy American and Hire American” order would also overhaul federal procurement practices to increase the selection of products from US companies, especially in the domestic steel industry, which has faced stiff competition from China. One reform advocated by the Trump administration, which has drawn bipartisan support from Congress, would change the lottery system for awarding H-1B visas, giving extra preference to the highest-paying jobs — a proposal favoured by many in the US technology industry. Representatives from Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google either declined to comment or didn’t respond to requests for comment. Blake Irving, the chief executive of domain name and web hosting firm GoDaddy, said he supported the idea of changing the system for issuing H-1Bs to give priority to higher-skilled workers. He said GoDaddy typically receives only about 20 per cent of the H-1B visas it applies for. “If anything, it moves the policy towards something that’s preferential to the expert workforce,” Irving said. “Anything that gets us closer to that is goodness.” But some smaller technology companies said they were concerned about the changes proposed by the Trump administration. Punit Soni, the chief executive of Learning Motors, a six-person company in Silicon Valley that is trying to apply artificial intelligence to health care, said the visa changes proposed by the Trump administration would hurt start-ups. Small companies cannot afford to pay high salaries and are already struggling to attract talent in a tight market, he said.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Firefox 53 arrives with new themes, separate graphics process on Windows, and compact tabs on Android Emil Protalinski@EPro April 19, 2017 10:31 AM Tags: Firefox, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Foundation Mozilla today launched Firefox 53 for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android. The new version includes two new themes on desktop, running the graphics compositor in a separate tab on Windows, compact tabs on Android, a redesigned interface for site permissions, estimated reading times, and more. Firefox 53 for the desktop is available for download now on Firefox.com, and all existing users should be able to upgrade to it automatically. As always, the Android version is trickling out slowly on Google Play. Mozilla doesn’t break out the exact numbers for Firefox, though the company does say “half a billion people around the world” use the browser. In other words, it’s a major platform that web developers target — even in a world increasingly dominated by mobile apps. Desktop First up, Firefox 53 ships with two new themes: Compact Light and Compact Dark. Both shrink the user interface (also known as the chrome) size. The former uses Firefox’s default theme colors, while the latter inverts them. Next, as part of Mozilla’s plans to build a next-generation browser engine (Project Quantum) that takes full advantage of modern hardware, the company today shipped the Quantum Compositor for Windows. The graphics compositor, which determines what you see on your screen by flattening into one image all the layers of graphics that the browser computes, now runs in a separate process. This means Firefox is faster, because the Quantum Compositor runs on the GPU instead of the CPU, and more stable, since occasional bugs in underlying device drivers that cause crashes no longer bring down all of Firefox or even your current tab. In fact, Mozilla found that the Quantum Compositor reduced browser crashes by about 10 percent. The Quantum Compositor will be enabled for about 70 percent of Firefox users: those on Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10 running on computers with graphics cards from Intel, Nvidia, or AMD. Firefox has received a redesigned interface for granting and managing a website’s permissions. When you visit a website that wants to access sensitive hardware or send you a notification, you’ll get a dialog box that explicitly highlights the permissions that site is requesting. To change a site’s permissions, just click the ‘i’ icon in the Awesome Bar. Speaking of redesigns, the controls for video and audio HTML5 content have received a modern look. Furthermore, HTML5 media will not autoplay by default until you switch to that tab. Also worth noting is that Windows users can now select between 32-bit and 64-bit Firefox during installation. Firefox 53 also removes support for 32-bit Firefox on macOS, as well as for older Pentium 4 and Opteron CPUs on Linux. Developers meanwhile will want to know that Firefox 53 supports positioned CSS Masks, which allow authors to partially or fully hide visual elements within a webpage. Masks work by overlaying images or other graphics that define which regions of an element should be visible, translucent, or transparent. Masks can be configured to use either luminance (white pixels correspond to fully visible pixels while black pixels render the area transparent) or alpha values for occlusion (transparent pixels in the mask cause transparent pixels in the element). The new display: flow-root value, which achieves similar results to clearfix, is also supported. Here’s the full Firefox 53 changelog: Improved graphics stability for Windows users with the addition of compositor process separation (Quantum Compositor) Two new ‘compact’ themes available in Firefox, dark and light, based on the Firefox Developer Edition theme Lightweight themes are now applied in private browsing windows Reader Mode now displays estimated reading time for the page Windows 7+ users on 64-bit OS can select 32-bit or 64-bit versions in the stub installer Various security fixes Updated the design of site permission requests to make them harder to miss and easier to understand Windows XP and Vista are no longer supported. XP and Vista users running Firefox 52 will continue to receive security updates on Firefox ESR 52. 32-bit Mac OS X is no longer supported. 32-bit Mac OS X users can switch to Firefox ESR 52 to continue receiving security updates. Updates for Mac OS X are smaller in size compared to updates for Firefox 52 New visual design for audio and video controls Ended Firefox Linux support for processors older than Pentium 4 and AMD Opteron The last few characters of shortened tab titles fade out instead of being replaced by ellipses to keep more of the title visible Changes for web developers Support for WebM video with alpha, which allows playing videos with transparent backgrounds If you’re a web developer, more details are available for you here: Firefox 53 for developers. Android Firefox for Android got one major new feature: Compact tabs (Settings => General). When you switch tabs, this new setting displays your tabs in two columns. This makes it easier to switch tabs when you have several open. Here’s the full Firefox 53 for Android changelog: Right to Left Language Support — Arabic (ar), Urdu (ur), Hebrew (he) and Persian (fa) Users can enable two columns tabs setting in portrait mode Long press on a search suggestion removes it from browser history Reader Mode now displays estimated reading time for the page Mozilla releases new Firefox versions every 6 to 8 weeks, and Firefox 54 is currently slated for mid June.

 What you need to know on Wall Street today Business Insider Apr. 19, 2017, 1:34 PM 615 facebook linkedin twitter email print Morgan Stanley Chairman and CEO Gorman speaks during the Institute of International Finance Annual Meeting in Washington Thomson Reuters Welcome to Finance Insider, Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours. What's going on in the fixed income, currencies, and commodities business? It's the question that has dominated earnings calls for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs this week, but for very different reasons.  Morgan Stanley reported earnings of $1 a share on revenue of $9.7 billion in the first three months of 2017 on Wednesday, beating analyst estimates by a lot.  That performance was driven by a big rebound in fixed-income sales and trading revenue. In contrast, Goldman Sachs underperformed in FICC in the first quarter.  The results mean that Morgan Stanley's first quarter fixed income revenues ($1.714 billion) were ahead of Goldman Sachs' fixed income revenues ($1.685 billion). Goldman Sachs is also licking its wounds in equities. In other news, BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, reported a 31% rise in quarterly profit helped by higher investment advisory fees and securities lending revenue. Also, it turns out you can pretty much thank Larry Fink for Maroon 5. Who knew? The world's largest hedge fund manager is losing faith in the Trump bump. It's not the only one, and a growing number of investors are now worried about the US stock market.  Here are the stocks millennials love more than people over 30 do, according to trading app Robinhood. And tons of people set up trading accounts just to buy Snapchat, according to TD Ameritrade. Bond exchange-traded funds have exploded in size in the last few years. The big-ticket trades in them are getting bigger too, according to new research. Wall Street critic Elizabeth Warren took a picture with the famous "Fearless Girl" statue on Wall Street. In tech, IBM revenue has fallen for 20 quarters — but it used to run its business very differently. In related news, Warren Buffett's bet on IBM is down more than $787 million. Intel could be down $400 million when Cloudera goes public. Verizon's CEO just said he's open to merger talks with Comcast, Disney, or CBS. And a banker-turned-Googler explained the 2 biggest differences between working in tech and finance. Theranos just agreed to refund 175,000 people in Arizona who took its tests. And we just got a better idea of how much drug companies rely on price hikes, and it doesn't look good. Emirates is cutting flights to the US because of Trump's travel policies. Lastly, here are the 18 countries with the most millionaires.  Here are the top Wall Street headlines from the past 24 hours. The tool company Trump just visited has an unsettling relationship with its blue collar franchisees - Did anyone in the White House vet this? Donald Trump just visited the headquarters of Snap-on Inc., a Kenosha, Wisconsin maker of tools sold to auto repair shops and mechanics.  SCOTT GALLOWAY: Investing in Snap is something "no one responsible should ever do" - Scott Galloway is a marketing professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and the founder of business intelligence firm L2. Galloway stopped by Business Insider to talk about the biggest names in tech. Yahoo beats earnings expectations, stock goes nowhere - Yahoo's Q1 earnings report, likely the last one before the Verizon acquisition closes, is a beat. CREDIT SUISSE: JCPenney is finally responding to the death of brick-and-mortar retail - Things have not been easy for brick-and-mortar retailers.  BlackRock CEO Larry Fink shares the 2 leaders who most inspire him — and neither comes from finance - As the chairman and CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink is responsible for a massive $5.1 trillion in assets under management, making him one of the most influential people in global finance. 2 small firms are going to make a killing on Cardinal Health's $6.1 billion deal - Two of the usual suspects played a role in setting up Cardinal Health’s $6.1 billion acquisition of Medtronic’s medical supplies business. But two smaller firms also got in on the action. JEFFERIES: Investors are loving Nintendo Switch's new games - Shares of Nintendo are up 5.4% this week after the company revealed an extended list of upcoming game releases for its new Switch console.  SEE ALSO: The 27 most important finance books ever written Follow Finance Insider and never miss an update!

NYC Ferry Operated by Hornblower is an initiative conceived in 2015 by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to expand and improve ferry service in New York City to neighborhoods where jobs and housing are growing rapidly, and to areas that have been transit deserts for decades.  When Phase 1 launches in just a couple of weeks (Phase 2 launches in summer 2018), a total of 20 brand new state-of-the-art vessels operating at 21 landings throughout New York City will service over 4.6 million projected passenger trips annually and create vital new travel links to culturally diverse neighborhoods from the Rockaways, to Soundview, Bay Ridge, Lower East Side and others. „Throughout the process, the Ruckus team has demonstrated its experience and expertise in brand development and campaign execution,” said Madalena Phillips, Director of Marketing Development for Hornblower. „It’s with great confidence we have selected Ruckus as our creative agency to roll out one of North America’s most transformative and innovative transportation systems to-date.” „Hornblower has a tremendous track record of creating amazing tour and transportation experiences,” added Ruckus President Alex Friedman. „We couldn’t be more excited to work with the Hornblower team and the City of New York to better help residents and visitors get around.” This collaboration represents the latest in a growing line of client engagements that have propelled Ruckus into the conversation of the fastest-growing private companies in America. Recent among these are the rebranding of Simply Self Storage, campaign work for Tweezerman and Mobileye – which recently sold to Intel for $15.3 billion. With the launch of NYC Ferry Operated by Hornblower coming in May and offering a unique blend of amenities and concessions, including Wi-Fi, NYC Ferry Operated by Hornblower will be a critical and resilient addition to New York City’s transportation network that will form new connections for decades to come.

The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.8%, the S&P 500 rose 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average was flat to negative. Small caps outperformed with the Russell 2000 up 0.8%. Volume was mixed, tracking lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq in the stock market today vs. the same time Tuesday. Chips, banks and automobile-related industry groups led the upside, while gold miners, fiber optics and utilities lagged. IBM gapped down and tumbled 5% in heavy trade to a four-month low. The stock, which has been consolidating the past two months, undercut the 200-day moving average. After the close Tuesday, Big Blue reported mixed Q2 results that beat on earnings but missed on sales. It maintained its outlook for full-year EPS of at least $13.80. Analysts expect $13.78 a share. Top blue-chip gainers included Intel (INTC), Visa (V) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH), each up about 1%. Apple (AAPL) added 0.5% in rapid trade as it holds above its 50-day line and just above a 141.12 buy point of a four-weeks-tight pattern. The iPhone maker is slated to report quarterly results May 2 after the close. Morgan Stanley (MS) rose 3% in fast turnover after its Q1 earnings and revenue beat Street estimates. The investment bank's stock has been consolidating since early March and is 4% below its 50-day line. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) surged 7% in big volume to an all-time high. Shares are well extended from a prior breakout but a 776.01 three-weeks-tight entry is still in play. Late Tuesday, the robotic surgery system maker delivered Q1 results that topped views on both the top and bottom lines, thanks to 18% growth in procedures by its da Vinci tool. On the IBD 50, Lam Research (LRCX) rallied 7% to a new high after the chip equipment maker's late Tuesday beat-and-raise quarterly report. Several analysts raised their price targets. Dycom Industries (DY) added 4%, following through on Tuesday's breakout past a 98.57 buy point.
