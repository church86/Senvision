By: Rohit Arora Updated: Monday, January 2, 2017, 19:50 [IST] Microsoft is gearing up for an all new Surface Pro machine in the year 2017. The US tech giant is said to be working on a new version of its Surface Pro laptop, which is set to arrive in the first quarter of 2017, most probably by April 2017. As per reports, the Surface Pro 5 will be manufactured by Pegatron Electronics and the 2-in-1 laptop will come with a 4K Ultra HD display and a magnetic charging stylus, possibly an improved version of Surface Pen. The current generation Microsoft Surface Pro 4 uses the latest sixth-generation "Skylake" Intel processors, and the Surface Pro 5 is expected to come with Intel's Kaby Lake Core i7 processor paired with 512 SSD for internal storage.

As noted, the Surface Pro 4 supports Windows Hello face authentication using the camera as well as a fingerprint sensor on a new Type Cover for the Surface Pro 4. Microsoft is expected to equip the Surface Pro 5 with the same or improved security features. We can also expect Microsoft to improve the Surface Pen, which is designed exclusively for the Surface series of devices and is used for effortless training and drawing. This Pen comes with three buttons and a tip.

Some recent leaks suggest that the phone will be laden by a plastic body with three capacitive hardware keys on the front for back, home, and Bing search. On the back, there is Microsoft logo and camera module, and it looks far more similar to the previous Lumia devices Saturn ring. On the specification side, we might see a 5.5-inch Quad HD display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor running the show in support with 6GB of RAM.

Introduction and design 2. Value, performance and verdict Best in Class Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict The Dell XPS 13 is like a tortoise surrounded by hares, taking its time in adopting fresh, new tech to deliver an excellent, modern experience that doesn’t leave legacy users behind. Plus, it’s just bloody gorgeous. For Faster than ever Same long-lasting battery SD card slot Great range of prices Against Still poor webcam position No Windows Hello Dell has done it all over again. The latest and greatest Dell XPS 13 recently arrived, and it’s frankly already been our favorite laptop for the last two years. This time coming equipped with the latest, 7th generation ( Kaby Lake) Intel processors behind that same eye-dropping display and punchy keyboard we’ve come to enjoy typing on – now all within an optional rose gold frame – the new XPS 13 has wowed us all over again. And, much of that isn’t thanks to crazy innovations or fresh additions, but a few key refinements that help the XPS 13 stand out amongst a sea of laptops that are perhaps trying to change a bit too quickly. The XPS 13 is a tortoise surrounded by hares … only it’s got a rocket strapped to its back.  Price and availability Available now through its website and several retailers, Dell begins the bidding for the standard XPS 13 at $799 (£999, AU$1,899) to start. In the US, that gets you a Kaby Lake, dual-core Intel Core i3 processor with Intel HD Graphics 620, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of solid-state storage behind an FHD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels), non-touch InfinityEdge display. (The UK and Australian versions come starting with an Intel Core i5.) If you want the touchscreen at QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) resolution – and the two screen features only come as a pair – you’ll need to cough up at least $1,299 (£1,249, AU$2,499). That also nets you a dual-core Intel Core i5 chip, but sadly doesn’t up the storage or RAM capacity. Of course, you can choose to upgrade both of those components for extra cash.  Weight-wise, the XPS 13 is a totable 2.7 pounds (1.2kg). It's something you could toss in a bag between classes or take with you on your next business trip and barely notice it's there. (That said, it's probably for the best if you cover your new investment with a case just to be safe.) The screen itself is Dell's new InfinityEdge Display. Images go nearly to the edge of the screen with only a thin strip of plastic separating the glass from the edge. The distance separating the two, for the record, is a measly 5.2mm. Spec Sheet Here is the Dell XPS 13 configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-7500U (dual-core, 4MB cache, up to 3.5GHz) Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 RAM: 8GB LPDDR3 (1,866MHz) Screen: 13.3-inch QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) InfinityEdge touch display Storage: 256GB PCIe SSD Ports: 1 x USB 3.0, 1 x USB 3.0 w/PowerShare, 1 x USB-C (Thunderbolt 3), SD card reader, headset jack Connectivity: Killer 1535 802.11ac (2.4 & 5GHz); Bluetooth 4.1 Camera: 720p widescreen HD webcam with dual array digital microphones Weight: 2.9 pounds (1.29kg) Size: 11.98 x 7.88 x 0.33 – 0.6 inches (W x D x H) (304 x 200 x 9 – 15mm) Design Frankly, there isn’t a ton to be said of the XPS 13’s design this time around, as very little, if anything, has changed. You still have the 13.3-inch display as sharp as QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800 pixels) with optional touch controls squeezed inside an 11-inch-wide frame.  And, you still have the gorgeous, machined aluminum lid and base that beset a comfy, carbon fiber keyboard deck coated in soft-touch paint. Only this time, the lid and base come in rose gold – the salmon shade that’s all the rage in tech products these days – as well as the traditional silver option. The machine somehow measures even thinner than the previous generation, though only by a hair: 0.33 inches (9mm) at its thinnest point to 0.6 inches (15mm) at its thickest. For those keeping score, the previous model came in at two hundredths of an inch thicker at the nose. Dell has also reduced the weight of its leading laptop, but by such a small degree it would be impossible to notice: from 2.93 pounds (1.32kg) to now just 2.9 pounds (1.29kg) even for the touchscreen model. Short of a major breakthrough in the materials used to construct the XPS 13, we’re likely looking at the thinnest and lightest Ultrabook from Dell for a while. (Please, prove us wrong.) All told, we’re still smitten by the XPS 13 design, and frankly we’re happy it hasn’t changed much, because it doesn’t have to. One small request: if Dell could at least center that bottom bezel-oriented webcam like it has on the new Dell XPS 13 2-in-1, that would be clutch.  More ‘pro’ than the MacBook Pro? During our time with the new XPS 13, we realized an important point: this laptop can match and even surpass the new, entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro part-for-part. For 100 bucks less than Apple’s latest laptop, the XPS 13 offers a sharper screen, a stronger processor and the same amount of RAM and storage. Oh, and this guy has a full-size SD card slot.  The MacBook Pro? You’ll get one more Thunderbolt 3 port – one of which needs to be used for charging – and little else for its starting price. On paper, it seems like the XPS 13 will give you a better time editing photos and video than its archnemesis. Well played, Dell. Nick Pino has also contributed to this review.

It's Complicated By Doug Mohney January 13, 2017 Building the connections for the Internet of Things (IoT) is challenging, since applications, services, and devices of all different shapes, sizes, and requirements have to seamlessly communicate.  In an ideal world, we would have a WebRTC-like interface standard accessible through HTML, but it's not going to be that simple, says the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF). “The approach we've taken is focusing on data level interoperability,” said David McCall, a Senior Strategic Planner at Intel. “It's difficult for developers to build things since they have to focus on [lower level] protocols and build upward.” OCF is made up of over 300 companies, with members spanning from the usual tech suspects such as CableLabs, Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, and Qualcomm to industrial concerns including Electrolux and GE along with Lowe's (yes, the home improvement store) and a cast of other interested parties.  The organization is focusing on building a common open set of standards with a grammar, a language of sorts, and specific “words” useful for devices.  IotTivity is the open source framework built and available for use today, with a standardized resource interaction model, standardized data modules, worlds, and language, enabling developers to write apps based on the OCF framework and make them interoperable with other services and devices in a particular ecosystem. Devices, services, and apps using the OCF framework and specifications should be able to intercommunicate, but there will be specialized words (characteristics) and uses within specific areas. An IoT healthcare device under the OCF framework should work fine within and to another OCF-based healthcare device, service, or app, while an IoT device for the Smart Home will have a different applicable set of worlds.  There are currently specific OCF projects for Automotive, Healthcare, and Smart Home, with a separate working group dedicated to security to insure best practices from day one. Since there are already a large number of IoT devices in the world, the OCF framework also included the concept of bridges since the beginning of the effort. In the telco world, a bridge would be similar to a session border controller (SBC), with translation in this case being between existing/legacy proprietary IoT protocols and OCF-speak. OCF is handling both, defining the specification and certifying compliance to it, along with providing and supporting the IotTivity open source code for developers.   There are eight OCF certification labs up and running around the world and there are a number of devices and manufacturers already working with the specification today. Demonstrations I saw at CES 2017 included interoperability between OCF wearable healthcare devices, “legacy” healthcare devices and OCF services, a kitchen and living room “smart home” demonstration, and an interop between an OCF automobile and a smart home.  The smart home demonstrations were the most memorable for the shiny new devices working in combination, including an LG refrigerator loaded with a large Microsoft Windows 10 see-through touchscreen connected to various devices and air conditioner/purifiers.  One can have pre-loaded scripts of IoT settings on the fridge for cooking that cranks up the local air purifier, to prevent odors from filling the household, another for party mode that lowers the AC, adjusts the lighting, and turns on music, and so on. The connected home/auto demo showed how different settings could be customized for the driver and the home, changing the tone and volume of music in the house once the driver has left the garage – something that may be appealing to parents and children with different music tastes, if nothing else. Given that OCF has been in operation for less than three years, it is impressive to see the progress made in developing code and getting working interoperable solutions between devices and services.   I'm hoping for more marketing of OCF IoT interoperability awareness at the buyer/consumer level so I can buy the “Best of breed” solutions of what I (think) I need without having to worry about compatibility or being locked into a specific solution.  OCF will also mean bigger opportunities for the reseller/VAR world, since businesses will want to do the same when it comes to applying IoT to their own needs.

Historically, moving to larger wafers was a critical way that foundries and fabs cut prices and improved yields. Historically, companies like Intel led the charge on wafer size, but there’s always been a very long tail. Currently, some 23 firms have 300mm fabs in production, while 58 companies still operate 200mm fabs. 450mm wafers were meant to further extend the cost savings of 300mm wafers, but high costs and uncertain rollouts appear to have doomed the endeavor. Several years ago, Intel, Samsung, GlobalFoundries, TSMC, and IBM collectively launched the Global 450 Consortium (G450C) in partnership with The Colleges of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) at SUNY Polytechnic Institute (SUNY Poly). This collaboration was a $4.8 billion-dollar endeavor (over five years) to develop tools, work with suppliers on 450mm ecosystem development, and to create appropriate infrastructure for the future deployment of 450mm wafers. This was no small task — larger wafers means different tools, and tool costs are a substantial reason why process nodes are becoming more expensive over time. EUV tools and lithography equipment, for example, are significantly more expensive than traditional 193nm ArF lasers. According to a recent report in the Times-Union, two of the five companies involved in the G450C are pulling out after the end of the five-year program. Graph and data by ICInsights. A report from IC Insights published in October 2016 sheds some additional light on this situation. While 300mm wafers are more popular than 200mm wafers in terms of total production capacity, they are also limited to specific areas of the market. DRAM, NAND flash, image sensors, power management devices, CPUs, GPUs, and other high volume technologies are typically built on 300mm wafers. 200mm wafers are used for smaller runs, where lower total volumes are expected. We’ve discussed before how TSMC makes a significant percentage of its income using nodes that haven’t been cutting-edge in a decade or more. Many of these older nodes are paired with older equipment to keep them cost-effective and minimize the purchase of new hardware. Intel’s estimated wafer costs, when it still expected 450mm wafers to be A Thing. There are several intrinsic advantages to using larger wafers. If the foundry can keep its wafers-per-hour production rate on 450mm wafers close to its 300mm wafer production rate, it can produce vastly more chips per hour. This helps reduce costs, provided that the semiconductor economy is healthy and the foundry utilization rate is high. Being able to build more chips per hour can also allow older lines to be shut down, saving on factory costs. Larger wafers mean that large-die processors don’t cost as much area around the edges of the wafer and reduce overall waste as a result. The graph above shows Intel’s estimated wafer costs over time, and illustrates why the company was anxious to move to 450mm wafers over the long term. If the shift had been successful, Intel’s long-term roadmap for Atom processors might have taken a different path, since 450mm wafers would have allowed the company to reduce its per-die Atom cost and likely compete more effectively against TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries (at least, until those firms rolled their own 450mm wafers). With multiple companies pulling out of G450C and no clear roadmap for the technology, it seems safe to conclude that 450mm wafers are pretty much dead. Pilot programs have ended, firms are still focused on ramping up 300mm wafers at various foundries, and no semiconductor firm we’re aware of is still championing 450mm wafer research or deployment. High costs and machine replacements appear to have nuked any argument for superior cost savings in the long term or improving wafer utilization.

As part of a series of tweets, Trump also blamed Democrat and Republican politicians, claiming they were conspiring against him. BREAKING: CNN reports Intel report to Obama and Trump said that Russia has compromising info on Trump … https://t.co/eWCC8xt85P — Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) January 10, 2017 Using information allegedly obtained from a former U.K. intelligence agent named Christopher Steele, the Associated Press reports United States intelligence agencies last week provided information to President Obama, President-elect Trump, and senior leaders in the House and the Senate – the so-called Gang of Eight – indicating that Russian operatives might have compromising financial and personal information about Trump. Trump Putin portrait in Moscow. Donald Trump Twitter rants deny supposed Russian connections. [Image by Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP Images] The 35-page report also apparently contained information suggesting that the Donald Trump campaign team interacted with Russian officials throughout the 2016 election. The information in the report was originally compiled by Steele partly at the request of Donald Trump’s competitors for the Republican nomination. In the early morning Donald Trump Twitter messages, he indicated that the leak of this document to the media was part of a conspiratorial effort on the part of his political opponents in both parties to produce false but damaging information about him and his incoming administration. “Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and Republicans…” In addition to politicians and intelligence agencies, Trump has also targeted CNN in his Twitter feed attacks, and during his most recent news conference, he described CNN as “fake news.” This despite the fact that Fox News – hardly a liberal-leaning news organization – has affirmed that CNN’s methods and reporting on this story are solid and journalistically sound. These recent Donald Trump Twitter posts also leaned on Russian assurances that they had no such information about him, once again indicating the greater trust Donald Trump seems to have in Russia and Vladimir Putin than he does in United States intelligence agencies. “FAKE NEWS! Russia says nothing exists.” In yet another Donald Trump Twitter message, Trump went the time-honored route of attacking the messenger, in this case the messenger being – as reported by the Associated Press – former U.K. MI6 intelligence agent Christopher Steele. “It now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued…” But the various United States intelligence agencies involved in examining this material to verify its accuracy and authenticity have already concluded that Steele has proven to be a highly reliable intelligence source in the past, making his assertions this time more believable.

[Image by Leon Neal/Getty Images] In addition, prior investigations by various news organizations have suggested that Donald Trump may owe considerable sums of money to Russian oligarchs and banks, making him extremely vulnerable to pressure from Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. This most recent report also apparently includes rather salacious suggestions that Donald Trump, while in Moscow in 2013 and staying at the Ritz Carlton, engaged the services of two prostitutes. In the leaked report, United States intelligence agencies report indications that Russian intelligence might have video of this encounter, which supposedly included a sexual practice known as “golden showers.” The sad thing is, I would believe Trump participated in #GoldenShowers way before I would believe he is president. #GoldenShowerGate — Paul Chatlain (@PaulChatlain) January 11, 2017 Given the extremely scandalous nature of such financial, personal, and sexual information on the incoming president, it’s hardly surprising that the Donald Trump Twitter account would be plastered with his denunciations and denials. However, it’s also true that Donald Trump has frequently denied doing things – such as mocking disabled reporters or making sexually offensive comments about women – despite video or audio evidence that he did. MStreep speech re-opened subject of Trump mocking disabled reporter. TV Trump-bots, tell us not to believe our eyes, ears & brains…again. — Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) January 10, 2017 It’s an open question whether Donald Trump as president will allow these investigations to proceed. Will we see Donald Trump Twitter account attacks against his own administration’s intelligence agencies?

Security researchers began openly discussing the vulnerability this week, which allows attackers to bypass security mechanisms and run malicious code via the USB debugging interface. This specifically affects Intel’s U-series of Skylake and Kaby Lake processors, which are lower powered processors typically used in OEM systems. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to go as far as rewriting your system BIOS but it does require USB 3.0 to work, along with a supported debugging interface, according to researchers at Positive Technologies. Before Skylake came around, debugging was done through a special port on the motherboard that was not easily accessible. However, since then Intel has moved to a Direct Connect Interface, which allows access to the JTAG debugging interface through a USB 3.0 port, though only one port on any machine will be capable of accessing JTAG. This isn’t something that would necessarily affect every day users, but it could be a big deal for servers or enterprise users. This exploit can be used regardless of the operating system installed on the machine, so it can affect Windows, Mac and Linux. However, the issue has since been brought up with Intel, so they are aware of it and will hopefully look into fixing it. KitGuru Says: Obviously for an attacker to pull this exploit off, they would either need to be physically at the machine or they would need to trick someone into plugging a dodgy USB in to the right port by themselves. Either way though, it is a security hole that could use some tightening, particularly now that it is public knowledge.

MSI Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium Overclocked to 5.2GHz During the discussion, MSI stated they have tested several hundred different Intel Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake processors and haven’t had any issues with any of them.  There are a couple caveats that you have to be aware of to reach the 5.2GHz.  First, a good high quality (closed loop) water cooler is required, it needs to be a minimum of a 240mm model (dual rad).  Next, the memory should be a good high quality enthusiast brand; while overclocking the CPU won’t be impacted by the memory much, it is always recommended to get the best you can afford.  Of course, MSI did reinforce that they are not responsible for damages caused by the GAME BOOST feature as with any end user performed overclocking. MSI Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium The demonstration at CES 2017 did indeed show the system up and running within the UEFI, but not within Windows (which is the real test).  The test system included the MSI Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium motherboard, G.Skill F4-4000 DDR4 memory, and a Thermaltake Water 3.0 Ultimate.  We asked them to reset the UEFI back to defaults, and once that was done. They demonstrated the single click to get to 5.2GHz, simply by setting the Game Boost to 11.  After a quick reboot, the system took a moment to re-enter the UEFI, but once it did, it was showing 5.2GHz once again. MSI Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium BIOS A couple interesting things within the UEFI that we noticed, the CPU voltage was automatically configured to run at 1.507V.  The next thing, the CPU temperature was reading 48C.  This seems to be higher than most would want, especially considering that it is in an open air test bed, with a Thermaltake Water 3.0 Ultimate running with the fans at high speed.  So while 5.2GHz might not be an issue while idle, once we start running tests it might become an issue with heat. MSI Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium In our current testing of the Gigabyte Aorus Z270X Gaming-9 and ASUS Prime Z270-A motherboards and the Intel Core i7-7700K, we have been able to obtain an unstable 5.1GHz, and a stable 5.0GHz overclock.  MSI sent Legit Reviews their Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium motherboards, so we can verify the overclocking ourselves.

The Kaby Lake processors bring a number of changes to Intel’s traditional CPU lineup, including low-TDP models of most chips and Pentium processors with Hyper-Threading. 7th-gen Intel desktop processors are available in South Africa, although certain chips have not released locally yet. Intel has branded several processor models with a “T” suffix in order to show that the chip is a special, low-TDP model – which has been under-clocked in order to use less power. The majority of these low-TDP models are currently not available from South African retailers, including Rebel Tech, Wootware, and Evetech. Below is a pricing overview of the Intel 7th-gen desktop processors available from these stores.

If you’ve ever used an embedded Linux development device with wireless networking, you’ve likely benefited from the work of Marcel Holtmann, the maintainer of the BlueZ Bluetooth daemon since 2004, who spoke at an Embedded Linux Conference Europe panel in October. In 2007 Holtmann joined Intel’s Open Source Technology Center (OTC), where he created ConnMan (Internet connectivity), oFono (cellular telephony), and PACrunner (proxy handling). Over the last year, Holtmann and other OTC developers have been developing a replacement for the wpa_supplicant WiFi daemon called IWD (Internet Wireless Daemon). In the process, they have streamlined the entire Linux communications stack. “We decided to create a wireless daemon that actually works on IoT devices,” said Holtmann in the presentation called “New Wireless Daemon for Linux.” Marcell Holtmann at ELCE with chart showing the current Linux communications stack (left) and new, streamlined stack with IWD wireless daemon replacing wpa-supplicant (right) (click image to enlarge) The IWD is now mostly complete, featuring a smaller footprint and more streamlined workflow than wpa_supplicant while adding support for the latest wireless technologies. The daemon was also developed with the help of the OTC’s Denis Kenzior, Andrew Zaborowski, Tim Kourt, Rahul Rahul, and Mat Martineau. IWD aims to solve problems in wpa_supplicant including lack of persistence and limited feedback. “Wpa-supplicant doesn’t remember anything,” Holtmann told the ELCE audience in Berlin. “By comparison, like BlueZ, oFono, and neard [NFC], IWD is stateful, so whenever you repair the device, it remembers and restarts when you reboot. Wpa_supplicant does have a function that lets you redo the configuration network, but it’s so hackish and problematic that nobody uses it. Everyone stores this information at a higher layer, which complicates things and creates an imbalance.” Wpa_supplicant manages to be overly comprehensive while also failing to reveal key information. The daemon is difficult to use because it adds support for “just about every OS or wireless extension,” including many things that are never actually used, says Holtmann. “The abstraction system actually gets in your way.” Despite its capacity to “abstract everything,” wpa_supplicant does not expose much information. “You have to know a lot about WiFi and how things like parsing are done,” said Holtmann. “I just want to connect, not read a 2,000-page document to find out I have to use a pushbutton method to gain my credentials.” Other limitations with wpa-supplicant include its dependence on blocking operations, in which the system must ask each peripheral for confirmation of operations before it moves on to ask other systems. This leads to “a system just waiting for something to happen,” says Holtmann. Wpa-supplicant has other complications like “exposing itself to user space in at least four different ways,” said Holtmann. These include the antiquated D-Bus v1 and still problematic D-Bus v2, which “swallows states,” as well as a binder interface and CTL, “which is great for users, but for a daemon is horrible.” To make up for the limitations of D-Bus v2, the overall wireless stack long ago spawned an abstraction layer above D-Bus and below ConnMan called gSupplicant. While this helped offload work from ConnMan, the latter was still overloaded.   Reducing Complexity With the addition of IWD, Holtmann and his team removed GSupplicant entirely. It also replaced other user space interfaces with a single updated D-Bus layer. In addition, the new stack removed inoctl and lib Netlink (libnl), which Holtmann called “a blocking design that can’t track family changes.” Libnl was replaced with Generic Netlink, which does offer family discovery. Holtmann also eliminated wireless extensions (wext) because “they’re broken and hopefully they will someday be removed from the kernel,” he said. The new wireless stack retains cfg80211 and nl80211 (Netlink), although the latter has been upgraded and pushed upstream. The OTC team developed a new Embedded Linux Library (ELL) that features tables, queues, and ring buffers to reduce the complexity of IWD while still providing basic building blocks for netlink and D-Bus. “We extended ELL with cryptographic support libraries instead of using OpenSSL, which is huge, and is not an easy interface,” said Holtmann. “In a lot of cases you need only 10 percent of OpenSSL, so we went a different route and used random numbers using the getandom() system call, with no problems with boot up time.” Finally, for ciphers and hashes Holtmann used AF_ALG, which he defined as “an encrypt interface for symmetric ciphers into the kernel.” With ELL and AF_ALG in place, the developers could eliminate OpenSSL, as well as gnuTLS and InternalTLS. The team also added tracing support for nl80211 with the help of a tool called iwmon. “Now we can start scanning and selecting networks,” said Holtmann. “We can do active and passing scanning and SSDID grouping, and support open networks, We can connect to open access points and W2 and WPA/RSN protected access points. We have simple roaming, experimental D-Bus APIs, and EAPol, and ELL logging for D-Bus and Generic Netlink.” Holtmann went on to discuss new support for enterprise WiFi technologies like X.509 certificates and TLS. Recent kernels have improved X.509 support, so the OTC team is exploiting the kernel’s keyrings to better manage certificates. Future tasks include finishing up enterprise WiFi and developing a debug API. The developers are also looking at possible integrations with Passpoint 2.0, P2P, Miracast, and Neighborhood Aware Networking (NAN). Once IWD is complete, Holtmann and the OTC will address 802.15.4, bringing improvements to 802.15.4 compliant wireless protocols like ZigBee, 6LowPAN, and Thread. If you can make it to Portland, Oregon on Feb. 21-23 for the North American edition of the Embedded Linux Conference, Holtmann will revise his wireless daemon talk with updates. He will also give a presentation on Bluetooth 5, as well as a talk about using Zephyr on the BBC micro:bit.

More like this Here's how the MacBook Pro stacks up against the PC Surface Book i7 vs. MacBook Pro: Fight! Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro: Is it worth buying? Video Reality check: Apple Watch vs. Pebble Time (vs. no smartwatch at all) Apple is used to criticism from PC partisans, but with its first major redesign to the MacBook Pro line in years, it found itself unexpectedly taking fire from its own fan base. The new laptop was underpowered, Mac users complained, lacked ports that people actually use, had low-to-zero serviceability, and that “improved” butterfly keyboard still wasn’t that great.  The point that seems to uniformly burn pro users is the maximum amount of RAM: just 16GB of LPDD3/2133. The reason for the limit? Apple said it saves power, which lets them make the MacBook Pro thinner. I won’t pass judgment on that decision (though I think PC makers are also too concerned with thin sometimes), but I will say there’s a pretty easy way Apple could satisfy its unhappy performance-minded customers: Bring back the MacBook Pro 17. Yes, Apple once sold a giant 17-inch MacBook Pro, which it discontinued in 2012. Five years on, it's even easier to build a powerful laptop than it was back then. Bringing back an unapologetically big, beefy MacBook Pro 17 could be just what Apple needs to make its laptops great again. Here's what we'd put in it. AMD Could a Ryzen make its way into a future MacBook Pro? Quad-core or more The Macbook Pro 17 should have a high-end Intel or AMD-Ryzen-based quad-core at a minimum. People say CPU performance doesn’t matter, but it does. The crowd that would actually buy and use a portable workstation needs to get work done. This means a quad-core or more. While it wouldn’t be a first—PCs have sporadically been available with six-core CPUs for years—Apple could cause much jealousy if it scored access to a low-power version of a next-gen Intel or AMD CPU with more than four cores. Big, fat GPU I think people looking at the MacBook Pro 15 should pony up for the higher-end Radeon Pro 460, because the entry-level GPU is a bit underwhelming on pure horsepower. Yes, it’s great on power consumption, but more performance on a primarily performance-minded laptop is generally better. For the MacBook Pro 17, Apple should look into a higher-wattage GPU that gets it into the GTX 1070 class. That doesn’t mean Nvidia-only, as AMD is expected to launch its next-gen Vega GPUs this year. The point is to go for the gusto with a hotter, more powerful chip. A fat GPU isn’t just about gaming: GPUs today handle video encoding and a spate of compute-based tasks. Giving up some thinness or battery life to accommodate a faster GPU would pay real dividends. Crucial Using standard DDR4 SO-DIMM modules would cost battery life, but at least allow a MacBook Pro to hit 32GB or more. Load up on RAM Apple’s decision to use LPDDR3 rather than DDR4 was driven by the company’s decision to make it thin. The company says it did it to save power, because LPDDR3 uses less than plain old DDR4. Apple could have used DDR4 like everyone else, however, and just put in a larger battery to accommodate it. An added bonus: more RAM. The largest LPDDR3 RAM modules that work with Skylake CPUs (such as in the MacBook Pro) accommodate just 8GB of RAM, while those for DDR4 can take up to 16GB. Had Apple gone with DDR4, its two RAM modules could have given users a nice 32GB of memory. To be fair to Apple, no previous MacBook Pro has hit the 32GB mark either, but clearly the backlash says customers want more. The cost, on paper anyway, doesn’t look that bad: While LPDDR3 has a sizable advantage in standby power consumption, active use shouldn’t cost more than 5 percent to 10 percent, according to Intel. Either way, it’s clear that Apple’s customers want a laptop that offers at least 32GB. Storage is great, but... One area you can’t kick Apple for is storage performance. The company makes its own SSD controllers and they cook, with OS X-based storage benchmarks posting 3GBps reads and 2GBps write range. If we were to be downers, though, we’d say NVMe PCIe M.2 drives offer similar performance, and they work on an industry standard. The one improvement we’d ask from Apple is to follow industry standards on the MacBook Pro 17. Oh, and because the chassis will be larger—offer the option of two M.2 drives, and maybe even a 2.5-inch drive for bulk magnetic storage. IDG iFixit says you can fix the trackpad, but the rest of the MacBook Pro 15 is a lost cause. Repairability is green computing I’m not sure, but I think iFixit gave the new MacBook Pro 15 a negative-1 in serviceability. OK, I’m kidding, but iFixit did give it a 1, which might as well be a negative-1. Not only is the RAM soldered to the motherboard (which has been the norm for superthin Ultrabooks for some time), but Apple has now chosen to weld the SSD’s chips to the motherboard too. While some don’t think that’s a big deal, consider that the GPU, CPU, RAM, and NAND are all mounted to the same board. If any of those items failed, you’d be looking at replacing all four. In warranty, that’s not a big deal. Out of warranty, you might as well throw it away. The most green policy Apple could adopt is to offer upgrade- and repair-friendly designs rather than pursue thin, disposable designs. That means following industry standards as much as possible. Adam Miller More ports would be great on any future MacBook Pro. Many ports in a storm One weakness of the MacBook Pro 15 is clearly the number of ports, and further, the lack of port diversity. The laptop gives you four USB Type C / Thunderbolt 3. Period. With the AC adapter in one port and an external monitor in another, you have two ports left. Plug in your Logitech adapter for a mouse and keyboard, and you now have one port left. Plug in a gigabit ethernet adapter, and you’re done. You now have to constantly pull devices to plug in a card reader or USB thumb drive. And you’ll need dongles for sure. USB Type C is great, but it ain’t that great yet. Apple may be showing more of that courage by dropping USB Type A, but it’s an overreach. So please, Apple: On the MacBook Pro 17, give everyone a couple more ports, and the diversity of port selection that the MacBook Pro line has always been known for. A big battery In its pursuit of thin, Apple actually reduced the size of the battery in the MacBook Pro 15 from the previous model’s by almost 25 percent. The good news—and something Apple doesn’t really get enough credit for—is the company managed to keep battery life rather good for a quad-core, 15-inch laptop, with 9 hours of video run time. But here’s the thing: A bigger battery means more run time. Would a quarter of a pound really have killed MacBook Pro 15 users? Who knows—but on the MacBook Pro 17, it’s about performance and battery life, so go all the way and drop in the maximum 99.5 watt-hour gas tank. IDG Apple’s Butterfly key design isn’t as good as the design of previous keyboards. A real Apple keyboard The last feature Apple should put in the MacBook Pro 17 is a real Apple keyboard. You know, the kind of keyboard that let every MacBook user say with an air of superiority why Macs are so much better than PCs. With the newest MacBook Pros, PC laptop users don’t hear that bragging anymore. Instead you hear, “well, you get used to it,” or “I know it’s hard to believe, but I actually like it. No seriously, I do.” That’s quite a turnaround. For the MacBook Pro 17 to make Mac laptops great again, the company needs to return to the real Apple keyboard.

Name: Subject: Message: What is Android Things? – Gary explains Features Newsby Gary Sims3 days ago 6 474 17 Recently Google announced its new Internet of Things initiative based on Android, the aptly named Android Things. It was back in May 2015 that Google announced Project Brillo as its IoT operating system, but having looked at the feedback it received from developers about Brillo, Google decided to ditch it and create Android Things. By adding Android to the name, Google is emphasizing that developers are able to use familiar Android SDKs, APIs and services including the Google Cloud Platform. Android Things is only a preview at the moment and there is much to be done, however enough of the final operating system is working so that developers can start creating Android Things based projects. Hardware Android Things supports three boards: the Intel Edison, the NXP Pico i.MX6UL and the Raspberry Pi 3. Support is coming for the Intel Joule and the NXP Argon i.MX6UL. The first thing you will notice is that these boards use a mixture of Intel and ARM based CPUs and that both 32-bits and 64-bits are supported. The minimum amount of RAM is 512MB and all the boards support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Android uses the Linux kernel at its core and Linux is a full multi-tasking operating system with virtual memory support. This means that Android Things needs a processor that supports virtual memory, in other words a processor with a full MMU. For ARM processors this means something from the Cortex-A range and not a microcontroller from the Cortex-M range. The reason I mention this is that there are lots of IoT products that use microcontrollers and therefore have less memory, less flash storage, use less power, and use less complex operating systems. By opting to use Android and Linux then Google aiming at a particular segment of the IoT market and is automatically excluding itself from the other segments. Whether this is the right decision remains to be seen. The most popular board of the currently supported three is the Raspberry Pi. It is cheap, well known and easy to acquire. I also happen to have one (or maybe more) floating around here so I took Android Things for a spin using my Pi! Booting The first step is to download the correct Android Things image for your board. For the Pi that means downloading the .img file (which is wrapped up in a .zip file) and writing it to a microSD card. Then you insert the card into the Pi, connect up the monitor (via HDMI) and then connect the power. Android Things takes about 90 seconds to boot on the Pi 3. First you are shown some boot information (as text) in a similar vain to Linux booting, this is replaced after a few seconds with an Android Things loading screen which shows three pulsating dots (to show that it is working). Finally this is replaced by an Android Thing splash screen, which tells you about the status of the Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections and little else. A minute and a half is quite a long time for an IoT device to boot, I can imagine lots of scenarios were such a long boot time could lead people to think something is broken, especially it the product doesn’t include a display of any kind. Having said that, the level of complexity (and hopefully the abilities) of products based on Android Things will be similar to that of mobile devices rather than “simpler” microcontroller based systems. Connecting The next step is to connect to the Pi. This is done over Ethernet. Plug in an Ethernet cable that is connected to the same network as your development PC and then use adb to connect. You can download adb as a standalone kit directly from Google. The Raspberry Pi will multicast the hostname “Android.local” so you can connect to the board using the following command: adb connect Android.local
 Once the connection is established the splash screen will change to reflect the new status. It is also possible to connect via Wi-Fi, but to do so you first need to connect via Ethernet. To connect your board to Wi-Fi use the following command: adb shell am startservice \
 -n com.google.wifisetup/.WifiSetupService \
 -a WifiSetupService.Connect \
 -e ssid <Network_SSID> \
 -e passphrase <Network_Passcode> If you are connecting to an open Wi-Fi connection then you don’t need to use the passphrase argument. You can check the connection by looking at the splash screen or using adb shell ping 8.8.8.8 to verify that the board can connect to the Internet. The good news is that the board remembers the Wi-Fi connection details, which means that after the initial set up you can connect via Wi-Fi without using Ethernet. Developing Before you begin building Android Things you need to update your SDK tools to version 24 or higher, as well as update your SDK with Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher. Likewise, Android Things apps must target Android 7.0 (API level 24) or higher. At the moment the Android Things APIs aren’t part of the Android SDK, so you need to declare the Things Support Library dependency in your app by adding the dependency artifact to your app-level build.gradle file: dependencies {
 ...
 provided 'com.google.android.things:androidthings:0.1-devpreview'
} Also you need to add the Things shared library entry to your app’s manifest file: <application ...>
<uses-library android:name="com.google.android.things"/>
...
</application>
 Every Android Things app must declare an activity in its manifest as the main entry point after the device boots. The intent filter must contain the following attributes: Action: ACTION_MAIN Category: CATEGORY_DEFAULT Category: IOT_LAUNCHER For ease of development, this same activity should include a CATEGORY_LAUNCHER intent filter so Android Studio can launch it as the default activity when deploying or debugging. Google has some example code on its Create an Android Things Project page. There are two main types of Android Things app, ones without a display and those with displays. For the latter, you can build apps with the same UI toolkit available to traditional Android applications. However there are some differences, for example Android Things does not include the system status bar or navigation buttons, which means the app has full control over the visual user experience. Where Android Things differs from normal Android is that it can control peripherals and read sensors. Anything from temperature sensors through LCD displays and on to servo motors can be used by Android Things. This interaction is done via the General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) ports which you find on boards like the Raspberry Pi. The system service used by Android Things to manage peripheral connections is the PeripheralManagerService. This service handles not only simple GPIO but also interfaces like Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), which is a common method used by servo motors; The Inter-Integrated Circuit (IIC or I2C) bus, often used by sensors, actuators, accelerometers, thermometers, LCD displays, and much more; the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), which is used by things like external non-volatile memory and graphical displays; and good old fashion serial ports (UARTs), for use by complex peripherals such as GPS modules and XBee radios. App development should be familiar to anyone with Android Studio experience. The code tree is the same as for a normal Android app using familiar files like AndroidManifest.xml along with Java code and XML files for the layout. Gradle is used to build the projects and Android Studio is able to send the resulting app over the network to your Android Things board. Since Android Things is a specialized version of Android, only one app runs, the app that has been flashed over to the board. Whenever you boot the board it will start running that app. This is an essential difference between a general mobile device (like a smartphone) and an “embedded” Internet of Things device. Google has posted a bunch of Android Things sample projects on GitHub including a simple GPIO example, a sample UI, a smart doorbell (that uses a camera along with Firebase) and a weather station. Problems The key feature of Android Things is that it is based on the normal Android that we know and love. The idea is that Android developers can branch out into IoT and build some interesting products, maybe in conjunction with a mobile app. Or maybe there are existing Android apps that would work well as standalone devices. As a minimum there is lots of code out there that can be reused and repurposed for Android Things. However this compatibility with Android comes at a cost. The system requirements for Android Things devices are quite high when compared to microcontroller based devices and operating systems like mbed OS. Does my refrigerator really need a quad-core processor and 512MB of RAM? Of course there are advantages to having such processing power at your finger tips, maybe more computing will occur on the devices (like facial recognition, voice processing and parts of the AI infrastructure). However if these devices end up integrating with the cloud, which they will as they are Internet of Things devices, then there isn’t such a strong case for extra computing power at the point of user interface. I know that this is a preview, but the issue of device life-cycle doesn’t seem to have been addressed by Google at all. At the moment to configure the Wi-Fi you need to use adb, hopefully Google has something special in mind, maybe even a reference app for handling device deployment or even a generic app which can “talk” to any Android Things device. Which leads to the issue of authentication, something that is non-existent in Android Things at the moment. But as I said, this is a developer preview… One thing that I found annoying about my time testing Android Things is that the adb connection kept dropping. I would connect, work with Android Studio, upload the app etc. But then after a few minutes the connection would drop, which meant I was constantly using the command line to re-connect to the board. This obviously isn’t a workable solution in the long term and I hope Google sorts it out. Wrap-up The technology behind Android Things is well established and well known by developers across the world. Together with access to popular hardware platforms like the Raspberry Pi, Android Things could be a winning formula. However the high level of system requirements and the current lack of deployment infrastructure could mean that other platforms offer more for less. Ultimately time will be the judge, if IoT device makers opt for Android Things then it will be a huge growth market for Google, not in terms of the actual devices, but in terms of the cloud services that these devices use.

First was her sleeping bag for those sleeping rough in 2015, which was fireproof and waterproof, with reflective panels for increased visibility. The Duffily Bag was produced on a larger scale by a Dublin charity and has gained interest globally. Last year, she developed a nappy that could show when babies were sick. Caolann Brady The first ever female winner of SciFest, 2016 was quite the year for Kildare native Caolann Brady. Her project, Hum Your Way to Better Health, focused on the natural treatment of asthma through humming and breathing techniques, as opposed to using inhalers and nebulisers. With 175 subjects, Brady tested their breathing before and after humming at various pitches. On average, a 45-minute respiratory improvement came from this practice, compared with using an inhaler. Caolann Brady was named the overall winner of SciFest 2016.

Maria Louise Fufezan and Diana Bura Maria Louise Fufezan (17) and Diana Bura (16) won last year’s Young Scientist competition thanks to their project looking at animal feed and roundworm proliferation. The duo followed that prize up with third place at the European leg of the competition last September. Their study was entitled: An Investigation into the Effects of Enzymes Used in Animal Feed Additives on the Lifespan of Caenorhabditis Elegans, which is a nematode (roundworm) found in temperate soil environments. Remarkably, this was the first time Fufezan and Bura entered the exhibition. Lauren Murphy Separate to the BTYSTE but also last year, Loreto Secondary School Balbriggan student Lauren Murphy represented Ireland at Intel’s International Science and Engineering Fair with her incredibly simple, yet effective, smart rehabilitation device, which she invented to aid multiple sclerosis sufferers. Noticing the ‘clenched fist’ problem that her father – and many MS sufferers – regularly had, she created a tangible aid to encourage greater hand dexterity.

Renuka Chintapalli Renuka Chintapalli won an award for her individual project at BTYSTE 2016. She was also the only Irish regional finalist at the Google Science Fair last year. With her sights set on becoming a doctor, Chintapalli’s research analyses the anti-cancer abilities of garlic, and was accepted for publication in the International Journal of Nutrition and Cancer. She has also identified a new protein suspect in the biology of oesophageal cancer. Chintapalli spoke about her BTYSTE project to an audience of 160 international health professionals at last year’s Future Health Summit.

Shauna Flynn DCU PhD research student Shauna Flynn has set herself no easy task: ensuring that Moore’s Law continues to hold true. The winner of the inaugural Inspirefest ResearchFest competition, Flynn is working to find a faster, cheaper way of making transistors even smaller, as Moore’s Law comes up against the wall of what’s possible. With funding from the Irish Research Council and Intel, the Dublin native is using block copolymers to form patterns on the surface of silicon wafers. These patterns can then be used to make transistors, with the potential to more than triple the number of transistors on chips. Luke Byrne Wicklow student Luke Byrne, who attends Coláiste Chraobh Abhann in Kilcoole, has developed a new product to solve a problem that vexes many: tangled headphones. Headphone Helpers use a silicone band to stop them from becoming tangled. For his clever design, Byrne was named the winner of last year’s Student Enterprise Awards, run by the Local Enterprise Offices. Wicklow teenager Luke Byrne.

Matthew Hewston, Fergus Munday and Luke Sheridan Matthew Hewston, Fergus Munday and Luke Sheridan are the co-creators and co-founders of Squeazy, an educational toy based around the Cartesian Diver experiment, which demonstrates Archimedes’ principle of buoyance. The simple toy was created to make learning about science more fun. Squeazy was initially developed by the young classmates during transition year. The trio took that initial idea and ran with it, and have since won the National Student Enterprise Awards and pitched on the RTÉ show Junior Dragons’ Den. Matthew Hewston pictured with Squeazy.

Annie and Kate Madden Co Meath sisters Annie and Kate Madden are the creators of FenuHealth, a business that makes horse feed more appetising for racehorses, using fenugreek herbs and spices. It all began when Kate did a Young Scientist project in 2014 on whether Mars bars help horses to go faster. They followed this up a year later with their fenugreek product, which they described as a supplement designed to get horses to eat their food. The pair, who attend Loreto College, St Stephen’s Green, have since sold thousands of units of their product to horse trainers in Europe, the Middle East and the Far East.

Scroll down for video  Like a champ! Tom Brady performed everyday tasks like a champion in the first Super Bowl LI commercial, released Thursday by Intel First look: Sure, anyone can brush their teeth. But not everyone gets a first-person, 360-degree replay after they do it First, the New England Patriots quarterback woke up like a champion.

He stood in front of the mirror with a toothbrush gripped firmly in his right hand and vigorously lathered toothpaste over his million dollar smile. But thanks to the full range of the camera angles, the would-be ordinary appeared epic with up close and personal snapshots of the entire process, including Brady's cowlick on the back, upper-left area of his head. Dental hygiene: Then, the four-time Super Bowl winner brushed his teeth like a champion Step one: He stood in front of the mirror with a toothbrush gripped firmly in his right hand Step two: Then he vigorously lathered the toothpaste over his million dollar smile Seeing it all: Brady showed up close and personal snapshots of the entire process, including his cowlick on the back, upper-left area of his head Next, the three-time Super Bowl Most Valuable Player made his famous 'Brady Cakes' pancakes like a champion.  He flipped one perfectly in the pan, but even pros make mistakes now and then.  The flapjack got away from him when it came time to move it to the stack he was collecting on a plate on the counter, crashing to the floor next to his pooch. Breakfast! Next, the three-time Super Bowl Most Valuable Player made his already famous "Brady Cakes" pancakes like a champion Uh oh! He flipped one perfectly in the pan, but even pros make mistakes now and then Slippery sucker! The flapjack got away from him when it came time to move it to the stack he was collecting on a plate on the counter Brady moved swiftly to grab the breakfast item off the floor before his dog could snatch it up, invoked the five-second rule and stuffed the delicassie in his mouth. And Intel's 360 technology showed every crumb drop from every angle as he devoured the breakfast food.  The commercial ends with Brady about to do one more thing like a champion, but the camera cuts as he closes the door to his bathroom, leaving just a little bit of mystery in tact for the professional footballer. Five second rule! Brady moved swiftly to grab the breakfast item off the floor before his dog could snatch it up, invoked the five-second rule and stuffed the pastry in his mouth What a view! Intel's 360 technology showed every crumb drop from every angle as he devoured the breakfast food The reason Brady got to do everything from his everyday life in such grand style was to showcase what Intel has partnered with Fox Sports to bring to the big game. With the help of 38 cameras installed in Houston's NRG stadium, broadcasters will be able to pause any moment from live play of Super Bowl LI and view it in 3D from all angles, according to Intel. Viewers at home will also be able to use the same technology to 'be the player.'  What's the point again? The reason Brady got to do everything from his every day life in such grand style was to showcase what Intel has partnered with Fox Sports to bring to the big game They'll get to experience the game from the point of view of the athletes on the field, by choosing their own moment of live game play to freeze and see from the player's perspective. This will be the first time a product that is advertised during the Super Bowl will also be a part of the production of the game. Super Bowl LI will be played on February 5 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.

Twitter Facebook Back from dead: Intel's Atom chip, in Panasonic's $2,189 Android tablet Panasonic's Toughbook FZ-A2 uses an Intel Atom chip and runs Android 6.0 Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 13 January, 2017 08:19 - - - - print email Comments Intel is phasing out Atom chips from mobile devices and has scaled back Android development for such devices. But Panasonic has come out with a new tablet with an Atom chip and Android 6.0 anyway. Panasonic's new Toughbook FZ-A2 has a crazy starting price of US $2,189, and its Atom x5-Z8550 chip is a big problem. Atom chips are almost disappearing from tablets, especially devices with Android. There are also questions on whether the Toughbook will get upgraded to the newer Android 7.0, code-named Nougat. Panasonic didn't provide a response to the query. Panasonic's release of the new Toughbook with Android is an interesting move, especially as other PC makers abandon Atom and excitement around Android tablets fade. Dell last year stopped selling Android tablets -- which had x86 chips -- and won't be delivering OS upgrades to its existing Venue devices. Last year Lenovo started offering the Atom x5-Z8550 chip in its Yoga Book 2-in-1, which can be purchased with Windows or Android. The Yoga Book is unique as it replaces a hard keyboard with a virtual keypad, much like on tablets. At the time, Lenovo had to turn to Atom as the chip was ready for Android. But now, Intel is focusing on Windows, and promoting low-power Core, Pentium, and Celeron chips for tablets and 2-in-1s. The chipmaker continues to work with Google on Chromebooks and IoT devices using the Brillo OS, which is based on Android. Most Android tablets have chips based on ARM architecture, which dominates the mobile market. Panasonic's Toughbooks are known for their rugged features. The Toughbook FZ-A2 is water resistant and can withstand a 1.2-meter drop. The tablet is not targeted at average users. It's for enterprise users and field workers who use tablets in harsh conditions. Panasonic also offers rugged tablets with Windows. The Toughbook FZ-A2 has a 10.1-inch screen with a 1920 x 1200 pixel resolution. The tablet offers nine hours of battery life. The battery is replaceable. With all its aging technology, the tablet is keeping up with a USB Type-C port, a USB 3.0 port and Wi-Fi. The tablet can be bought with 4G LTE capabilities. It also has Bluetooth 4.2.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 12, 2017 at 8:08PM A few days ago, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) formally unveiled its seventh-generation Core processor family for desktop computers, known as Kaby Lake. With the launch came new chips from Intel as well as new motherboards using the company's new Z200-series motherboard chipsets (the top of the line ones targeted at high-end personal computers are known as Z270). The main new feature that came with the Z270 chipset is support for the company's new Optane memory technology. Optane is the marketing name for the company's upcoming 3D XPoint memory technology, a new type of memory that's supposed to be much faster than the NAND flash used to build today's solid state storage drives. 3D XPoint memory chips, which Intel markets as Optane. Image source: Intel.  Intel's marketing pitch for Optane is simple: a small Optane-based solid state drive can be installed into a system alongside a traditional hard disk drive to deliver "[solid state drive]-like speed and [hard disk drive] capacity." Image source: Intel.  This all sounds like a cool idea, and in theory, could boost Intel's PC dollar content share while also helping the hard disk drive makers. Let's look at how it could do so, if the technology works as advertised (a big "if"). The advertised value proposition The value proposition, particularly for desktop personal computer users, goes something like this. Hard disk drives, which are produced primarily by Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), are generally very inexpensive on a per-gigabyte basis. To put this into perspective, it costs about $260 to purchase a 1-terabyte solid state drive for a notebook or desktop computer (one can spend much more for faster/better quality drives, though). A 4-terabyte hard disk drive (that's four times the storage capacity as the solid-state drive mentioned above), runs only about $163 as of a recent check. This means that the cost per gigabyte (or, more generally, cost per unit of storage capacity) of hard disk drives is still substantially lower than those of solid state drives, even as the latter's cost has come down considerably over the years. For users who require lots of storage space for, say, high-resolution videos, video games (a single modern triple-A game can take up over 100 gigabytes of space on a computer disk drive), or other large programs, building systems with all flash storage can be prohibitively expensive. At the same time, solid state drives are much faster than hard disk drives, so users may want to keep performance-sensitive applications on a solid-state drive, while relegating the remaining files and programs to higher-capacity but slower hard disk drives. The value proposition that Intel and its partners are advertising goes something like this: A small, but very fast Optane-based solid state storage drive (Intel says Optane is substantially faster than traditional NAND flash) acting as a "cache" to a large hard disk drive can allow a system to enjoy similar storage performance to one that's equipped with NAND-flash based storage drives for a much lower overall cost.  Potential winners and losers If the technology works as claimed and sees significant adoption, then there could be winners and losers. Among the potential winners, I see Intel, as it would be able to gain content share in personal computers by selling Optane-based solid state drives (Intel does not supply hard disk drives today, and while it does build consumer NAND-flash solid state drives, its share in the consumer market isn't high). The hard disk drive makers, too, could benefit. If Optane combined with hard disk drives really delivers the performance of all-flash desktop computers for a much lower price, then this could erode the value proposition of all-flash storage setups in some cases, potentially slowing the shift from hard disk drives to solid state drives in desktop personal computers. The losers would be vendors of solid state drives, as Optane Cache + hard disk drive could reduce demand for traditional flash-based solid state drives. A big caveat There have been lots of schemes like what Intel is proposing with its Optane caches done in the past, so this isn't exactly new. Hard disk drive makers have (and in some cases still do) offer hard disk drives with small NAND flash caches built in to try to deliver performance that's close to that of pure solid state drives. In 2011, Intel's Z68 desktop platform included a technology called Smart Response Technology (SRT) that allowed users to pair small flash-based storage drives with large hard disk drives to try to achieve solid state drive-like speed on the cheap.  Per AnandTech's testing, SRT didn't deliver "the same performance as a large dedicated [solid state drive]" but it could allow users to "turn any hard drive into a much higher performing storage device." What could potentially make the Optane-based version of this concept more interesting than previous efforts is that instead of pairing a small NAND-flash based solid state drive with a large hard disk drive, Intel is pairing Optane technology (which Intel says is much faster than NAND flash-based drives) with hard disk drives to try to get NAND-flash solid state drive-like performance. It'll be interesting to see how this technology fares in the real world and, perhaps more importantly, if system builders and consumers ultimately adopt it. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 12, 2017 at 8:08PM A few days ago, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) formally unveiled its seventh-generation Core processor family for desktop computers, known as Kaby Lake. With the launch came new chips from Intel as well as new motherboards using the company's new Z200-series motherboard chipsets (the top of the line ones targeted at high-end personal computers are known as Z270). The main new feature that came with the Z270 chipset is support for the company's new Optane memory technology. Optane is the marketing name for the company's upcoming 3D XPoint memory technology, a new type of memory that's supposed to be much faster than the NAND flash used to build today's solid state storage drives. 3D XPoint memory chips, which Intel markets as Optane. Image source: Intel.  Intel's marketing pitch for Optane is simple: a small Optane-based solid state drive can be installed into a system alongside a traditional hard disk drive to deliver "[solid state drive]-like speed and [hard disk drive] capacity." Image source: Intel.  This all sounds like a cool idea, and in theory, could boost Intel's PC dollar content share while also helping the hard disk drive makers. Let's look at how it could do so, if the technology works as advertised (a big "if"). The advertised value proposition The value proposition, particularly for desktop personal computer users, goes something like this. Hard disk drives, which are produced primarily by Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), are generally very inexpensive on a per-gigabyte basis. To put this into perspective, it costs about $260 to purchase a 1-terabyte solid state drive for a notebook or desktop computer (one can spend much more for faster/better quality drives, though). A 4-terabyte hard disk drive (that's four times the storage capacity as the solid-state drive mentioned above), runs only about $163 as of a recent check. This means that the cost per gigabyte (or, more generally, cost per unit of storage capacity) of hard disk drives is still substantially lower than those of solid state drives, even as the latter's cost has come down considerably over the years. For users who require lots of storage space for, say, high-resolution videos, video games (a single modern triple-A game can take up over 100 gigabytes of space on a computer disk drive), or other large programs, building systems with all flash storage can be prohibitively expensive. At the same time, solid state drives are much faster than hard disk drives, so users may want to keep performance-sensitive applications on a solid-state drive, while relegating the remaining files and programs to higher-capacity but slower hard disk drives. The value proposition that Intel and its partners are advertising goes something like this: A small, but very fast Optane-based solid state storage drive (Intel says Optane is substantially faster than traditional NAND flash) acting as a "cache" to a large hard disk drive can allow a system to enjoy similar storage performance to one that's equipped with NAND-flash based storage drives for a much lower overall cost.  Potential winners and losers If the technology works as claimed and sees significant adoption, then there could be winners and losers. Among the potential winners, I see Intel, as it would be able to gain content share in personal computers by selling Optane-based solid state drives (Intel does not supply hard disk drives today, and while it does build consumer NAND-flash solid state drives, its share in the consumer market isn't high). The hard disk drive makers, too, could benefit. If Optane combined with hard disk drives really delivers the performance of all-flash desktop computers for a much lower price, then this could erode the value proposition of all-flash storage setups in some cases, potentially slowing the shift from hard disk drives to solid state drives in desktop personal computers. The losers would be vendors of solid state drives, as Optane Cache + hard disk drive could reduce demand for traditional flash-based solid state drives. A big caveat There have been lots of schemes like what Intel is proposing with its Optane caches done in the past, so this isn't exactly new. Hard disk drive makers have (and in some cases still do) offer hard disk drives with small NAND flash caches built in to try to deliver performance that's close to that of pure solid state drives. In 2011, Intel's Z68 desktop platform included a technology called Smart Response Technology (SRT) that allowed users to pair small flash-based storage drives with large hard disk drives to try to achieve solid state drive-like speed on the cheap.  Per AnandTech's testing, SRT didn't deliver "the same performance as a large dedicated [solid state drive]" but it could allow users to "turn any hard drive into a much higher performing storage device." What could potentially make the Optane-based version of this concept more interesting than previous efforts is that instead of pairing a small NAND-flash based solid state drive with a large hard disk drive, Intel is pairing Optane technology (which Intel says is much faster than NAND flash-based drives) with hard disk drives to try to get NAND-flash solid state drive-like performance. It'll be interesting to see how this technology fares in the real world and, perhaps more importantly, if system builders and consumers ultimately adopt it. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

But Panasonic has come out with a new tablet with an Atom chip and Android 6.0 anyway. Panasonic's new Toughbook FZ-A2 has a crazy starting price of US $2,189, and its Atom x5-Z8550 chip is a big problem. Atom chips are almost disappearing from tablets, especially devices with Android. There are also questions on whether the Toughbook will get upgraded to the newer Android 7.0, code-named Nougat. Panasonic didn't provide a response to the query. Panasonic's release of the new Toughbook with Android is an interesting move, especially as other PC makers abandon Atom and excitement around Android tablets fade. Dell last year stopped selling Android tablets -- which had x86 chips -- and won't be delivering OS upgrades to its existing Venue devices. Last year Lenovo started offering the Atom x5-Z8550 chip in its Yoga Book 2-in-1, which can be purchased with Windows or Android. The Yoga Book is unique as it replaces a hard keyboard with a virtual keypad, much like on tablets. At the time, Lenovo had to turn to Atom as the chip was ready for Android. But now, Intel is focusing on Windows, and promoting low-power Core, Pentium, and Celeron chips for tablets and 2-in-1s. The chipmaker continues to work with Google on Chromebooks and IoT devices using the Brillo OS, which is based on Android. Most Android tablets have chips based on ARM architecture, which dominates the mobile market. Panasonic's Toughbooks are known for their rugged features. The Toughbook FZ-A2 is water resistant and can withstand a 1.2-meter drop. The tablet is not targeted at average users. It's for enterprise users and field workers who use tablets in harsh conditions. Panasonic also offers rugged tablets with Windows. The Toughbook FZ-A2 has a 10.1-inch screen with a 1920 x 1200 pixel resolution. The tablet offers nine hours of battery life. The battery is replaceable. With all its aging technology, the tablet is keeping up with a USB Type-C port, a USB 3.0 port and Wi-Fi. The tablet can be bought with 4G LTE capabilities. It also has Bluetooth 4.2.

Often, these are bare-bones systems that ship without an operating system or even all the required components, but the new NUC6CAYS model popping up in online stores now is a ready to run Windows 10 machine. And for everything that the preconfigured Intel NUC6CAYS has (Intel will also release a bare-bones version), it's an attractively affordable option. Intel's recommended customer price is $215 (converts to AU$297 and £175), but right now you can find it online at Amazon and Newegg for around $230 (converts to AU$318 and £187). It has an HDMI port that supports 4K.Photo by Intel NUCs, around since 2012, are basically one step up from a Compute Stick.

Intel’s platform uses a system of HD cameras positioned around a sporting venue along with servers to capture and create a 3D rendering – from multiple angles--  of the on-field action.    RELATED: Intel Acquires Replay Technologies   “We tasked Intel to push their amazing Intel 360 Replay technology to the limit of what it could do, using their array of cameras circling the stadium to synthesize a player’s view on the field,” said Michael Davies, FOX Sports SVP of Field & Technical Operations.   “The cameras, backed up by a huge bank of Intel computing power, allow a moment to be recreated in 3D space, so that a ‘virtual camera’ can be placed at the player’s eye line -- not unlike how limitless camera views can be created in video games,” Michael Davies, Fox Sports’s SVP of field and technical operations, said in a statement.  “This broadcast enhancement is like no other -- it literally brings the audience down to the viewpoint of the player at the critical decision-making moment. What other choices did he have? Was his sight blocked? It all looks much different from field level, and can assist our announcers in describing what actually happened on the field.”   This video from the Foster Farms Bowl game between Indiana and Utah illustrates the POV feature that will be employed for Super Bowl LI.    Fox Sports said its production for Super Bowl LI, set for Feb. 5 at NRG Stadium in Houston, will utilize three production trucks and more than 30 cameras (including the use of Super Motion and 4K cameras) to deliver more than 20 hours of programming a day from “Discovery Green” in the city, and 70-plus cameras to cover the game itself.  Want to read more stories like this?

However, with Kaby Lake Intel is shaking up its Pentium-class processors a bit by introducing the first Pentium CPUs in years to feature Hyper-Threading technology. The last Pentium processor to feature hyper threading was the Pentium 4, which has been retired for many years now. Since then, the Pentium brand has been used for Intel’s low-end processors with fewer features. With Kaby Lake, this feature set is changing, with multiple Pentium SKUs being introduced that support hyper threading, meaning Pentium-based systems will have additional virtual cores on top of the physical ones. There are some additional improvements coming to Kaby Lake Pentiums though, including a 100MHz clock speed boost compared to last generation’s Skylake chips. There is also support for Intel’s Memory Protection Extensions, TSX-NI instructions and more. Those features are more likely to impress enterprise users or developers though, rather than regular system building customers. Prices won’t be rising at all, which is probably partially due to the fact that AMD is gearing up to take on the CPU market once more. This isn’t the only shake up we’ve seen Intel make in the low end with Kaby Lake though, this generation also brought along the first Core i3 with an unlocked multiplier, making them easier to overclock. KitGuru Says: While Intel might not be convincing many Skylake Core i7 or Core i5 owners to upgrade, with changes like these, we may see more low-end CPU users looking to make the jump this generation.  Similar Posts Categories Tags Related Related Tags: Intelkaby lakenews Categorized Under: CPU Polls Your next gaming screen should be?

And it really tried. The idea was a good one: Create a core computing module that could be surrounded with different cases and accessories so it could be customized for any use and reconfigured as needed. The idea was so good, but the core technology so flawed, that the concept has been bouncing around for nearly 20 years. Finally, with the Intel Compute Card, Intel may have finally gotten it right. With a lot of revolutionary things, the idea significantly leads the ability for technology to make it real. But, if the idea is good enough, it hangs in there until the technology can catch up. Let’s talk about the problems and promise of a true modular computer. IBM’s Revolutionary Modular Idea Today, the idea of a core module with computing capability doesn’t seem that revolutionary to all of us walking around with smartphones. But back in the 1990s, when we thought laptops at five pounds were incredibly light, desktop computers were these huge beige boxes that sat on desks, and the Simon smartphone was compared to a brick, it was pretty amazing. The idea was that you needed something more flexible, and if you could spread the cost of the core technology (processor, graphics, memory and storage) across a number of form factors, you could create something that was far more cost-effective than the combination of laptop/desktop/PDA that we had. Realize that, then, desktops cost in the $2K range, laptops in the $3K range, and PDAs like the Apple Newton were around a grand. That means to have one of each would set you back around $7K, but if you could reuse those core components you could get something very similar, and your data would automatically move between forms, for something closer to $4K, for a whopping $3K savings. It looked good on paper, but IBM at the time was bleeding money and had just had a series of revolutionary PC products flop in market. Even though IBM CEO Louis Gerstner seemed to like the concept, he killed it. And, to be clear, it likely wouldn’t have worked because, to get the module small enough, you had to make some rather massive performance tradeoffs, so you ended up with a desktop that was slow, a laptop that was slow, and a PDA that had impressive performance but no battery life. Dell’s Secret Success One of the things that we rarely talk about is Dell’s very successful imbedded computer business. This is on point because for around a decade, Dell has been selling what amounts to a modular desktop computer into industries like health care, and made billions doing it. Basically, for industries where computing is needed as part of the solution, Dell has one designed to fit into the solution and then handles support of the computing unit. This allows the company with the solution to focus on the part it is expert at, while Dell handles the part with the computer, lowering the price not only of the solution but of the support, as well. This unit is massively successful. Intel’s Compute Card However, a lot has changed in the last 15 years. As a result of the massive move to mobile, Intel can build a processor with decent battery life and low cost for the core module (about the size of a thick credit card). In addition, form factors have exploded as vendors have added computing power to everything from cars to vacuum cleaners, all of which could benefit from a common core computing module and operating platform. This means you get a computer with decent performance in a form factor in line with a smartphone that then can be imbedded in a variety of solutions and, with appropriate cloud backup and restore services, removed and replaced by the user or support tech in a matter of moments if there is a problem. In addition, because these things are now solid state, their failure rate is a fraction of what it was when we used rotating media. While I doubt we’ll see these in smartphones or even in regular PC solutions at first (though they would make an interesting desktop alternative, particularly in places where security requires the machines be removed and/or destroyed quickly), they will likely find themselves in even more interesting places than Dell’s solution did. Given that Dell has the organization already in place to use something like this, Dell is, at least initially, likely to be the biggest beneficiary. HP and Lenovo will clearly be working on this as well. Wrapping Up: IBM’s Old Idea Is New Again It is interesting to see the PC industry evolve. In this case, from large dedicated PCs to small card-like devices that can be built into a variety of increasingly connected devices in all shapes, sizes and colors. The old IBM team should be proud; their idea has morphed from something interesting to something almost magical. Now it will be up to their successors to see if they can do some incredibly interesting things with it. I’m betting they will.

Frohlich and Evan Comen, 24/7 Wall St. 1:12 p.m. ET Jan. 12, 2017 Outside a Samsung Electronics office in San Jose. (Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) After a decline in 2015, U.S. patenting activity rose to a record high in 2016. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted 304,126 patents last year, up from 298,407 in 2015. The increase was largely driven by West Coast technology companies, including Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Boeing, IBM, Intel, Google, and Microsoft. According to a 24/7 Wall St. analysis of data provided by Information for Industry (IFI) Claims Patent Services, Korean conglomerate Samsung Electronics was granted the most patents in 2016. Including its major subsidiaries, Samsung was awarded more than 8,500 patents, slightly higher than IBM’s 8,088 awarded patents. To identify the 25 most innovative companies, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the companies with the 1,000 highest total number of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office grants in 2015 from IFI Claims Patent Services. IFI produces these data based on the entity listed as holding the patent. In order to arrive at a figure that more closely reflects a company’s total, 24/7 Wall St. combined the grants awarded to a company and its subsidiaries. It is important to note that while IFI Claims Patent Services provided the data on USPTO grants, 24/7 Wall St. aggregated the grants of multiple entities under the same parent corporation. This number is an estimate only as it excludes any patent-holding subsidiaries of a company that do not share the company’s name, and it does not include companies outside of the top 1,000 patent grantees. These are the most innovative companies. 1.

The Most Innovative Companies More on the most innovative companies Tech companies and others spend hundreds of millions, and often billions, of dollars to discover the next big thing and gain an advantage over competitors. Based on the number of patents awarded in 2016, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the most innovative companies. In an interview with 24/7 Wall St. Larry Cady, senior analyst with IFI Claims, explained that patenting activity tends to increase at companies based in countries with strong economies. Because the U.S. economy is doing well, patent activity at U.S. companies increased last year. By contrast, with Japan’s economy flagging in recent years, patents awarded to a number of Japanese companies, including Canon, Honda, Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba, and Toyota, decreased in 2016. Last year, about half of all patents were granted to U.S.-based companies, with the remainder awarded primarily to Asia-based corporations as well as companies operating in European nations such as Germany and Scandinavian countries such as Sweden. The fact that foreign companies are seeking U.S. patent grants underscores the extraordinary demand for access to the U.S. market — the largest in the world. Most Japanese companies perform their work in Japan but still file U.S. patents. Many years often pass before companies gain value from research investments, even when the research results in a patent grant. As Cady noted, “Not all those developments are going to be earth shattering.” Allocating resources to research and development is for this reason a highly strategic decision, and companies leverage patent portfolios in a variety of ways. In addition to searching for breakthrough technologies, for example, companies will develop a large patent portfolio as defense against litigation. For this reason, “one of the drivers of patenting is litigation,” Cady said. The most frequently patented technologies are in the categories of computers, transmission of digital information, wireless communication networks, and pictorial communication. According to Cady, the high patenting activity in these areas is due to their novelty. “Any kind of new and emerging technology that has a lot of potential value in the future is going to see a lot of patenting.” While it is reasonable to expect less patenting activity in more mature industries, this is certainly not always the case. For instance, although cars have not changed considerably in the past several decades, patents granted to companies in the auto manufacturing sector rose substantially last year. While a patent in a newer high tech field like artificial intelligence may represent a major scientific breakthrough, recent patents in the more staid automobile industry reflect relatively small improvements. Cady acknowledged the growing interest in self-driving cars, but noted these developments have not yet moved the needle in patent grants. 24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

It's Now Possible To Disable & Strip Down Intel's ME Blob Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 12 January 2017 at 02:00 PM EST. 40 Comments Many free software advocates have been concerned by Intel's binary-only Management Engine (ME) built into the motherboards on newer generations of Intel motherboards. The good news is there is now a working, third-party approach for disabling the ME and reducing the risk of its binary blobs. Via an open-source, third-party tool called me_cleaner it's possible to partially deblob Intel's ME firmware images by removing any unnecessary partitions from the firmware, reducing its ability to interface with the system. The me_cleaner works not only with free software firmware images like Coreboot/Libreboot but can also work with factory-blobbed images. I was able to confirm with a Coreboot developer that this program can disable the ME on older boards or devices with BootGuard and disable Secure Boot. This is all done with a Python script. Those unfamiliar with the implications on Intel's ME for those wanting a fully-open system can read about it on Libreboot.org. ME_Cleaner has been tested with boards ranging from Nehalem to Skylake with ME engines ranging from 6.0 to 11.x. With the exception of some Ibex Peak boards and not yet testing Broadwell mobile systems, ME_Cleaner is working as outlined via this matrix. Those wishing to learn about ME_Cleaner for trying to eliminate Intel's Management Engine form your system as much as possible can visit the GitHub project site to learn more. 40 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The culprit is the debugging interface of the CPU that can be accessed through USB. Positive Technologies discovered that on some Intel CPus the debugging interface is accessible through USB 3.0. This allows specially prepared USB sticks to take full control over the computer. With full control over the computer it’s possible to install malware of eavesdrop on activity on the computer without detection of security software. It’s also possible to brick the PC because the debugging interface makes it possible to fully overwrite the BIOS. The bug is relatively easy to exploit as no special equipment is required, according to the researchers. However, attackers do need physical access to the system and the bug only appears to be only present on Skylake U CPUs that are only used in NUCs and Ultrabooks. On older CPUs this was not possible because the debugging interface could only be accessed using a special (expensive) device. The security researchers demonstrated their method (video) during the 33rd Chaos Communication Congress held in Hamburg, Germany.

SUBSCRIBE Super Bowl LI advertisers: Here are the brands gearing up for game day Marketing Land is keeping track of this year's Super Bowl LI brands, with updates as new advertisers and campaign details are announced. Amy Gesenhues on January 12, 2017 at 1:00 pm More With less than a month before Super Bowl LI’s kickoff, brands are gearing up to take the field in hopes their campaigns will have a lasting effect on their advertising goals throughout the rest of 2017. Today, Intel released a 30-second spot scheduled to air during Fox’s Super Bowl broadcast on Sunday, February 5. The ad, featuring NFL MVP Tom Brady, showcases Intel’s 360-degree replay technology — the same technology Fox will be using when it airs the game. While we are starting to see more announcements around this year’s Super Bowl brands, advertisers haven’t been as quick to share their Super Bowl ads or teaser ads this year compared to Super Bowl 50. Last year, both Wix and Butterfinger had released teaser ads before the start of the year. According to Adweek, Butterfinger has already confirmed it will not be advertising in this year’s game, nor will Doritos, Mini USA, SunTrust and Toyota — all brands that showed up for last year’s Super Bowl. For now, here is a list of brands that have signed up to play. Super Bowl LI Advertisers 84 Lumber Audi Avocados from Mexico Buick Busch Febreze GNC GoDaddy Honda Intel Kia Motors Lexus Mercedes-Benz Mr. Clean Skittles Snickers Turbo Tax WeatherTech Wix We will be updating this list as more brands make announcements and more campaign details become available — so be sure to bookmark it to stay on top of Super Bowl LI ad news.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 12, 2017 at 12:42PM Earlier this month, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) released a whole slew of chips as part of its seventh-generation Core processor family. The chipmaker had previously released a handful of seventh-generation Core processors aimed at ultra-low power laptops late last year, but waited until early January of this year to roll out chips appropriate for a broader range of personal computers, including desktop computers. Image source: Intel.  Intel's desktop personal computer lineup consists of chips sold under the Celeron, Pentium, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 brands, in order of pricing, performance, and features. Intel's Pentium and Celeron desktop processors are not branded as "Core" but are, at least for desktop computer-oriented products, based on de-featured variants of its workhorse Core processor designs.   As part of the de-featuring, Intel would reduce frequencies (higher is better), disable portions of the graphics processors (making them less capable of handling 3D graphics workloads, like video games), and even turn off features fundamental to the processor cores.  One such feature is called hyper-threading (HT), Intel's marketing term for a feature more generally known as simultaneous multithreading (SMT). This allows a processor core's resources to be better utilized in some cases, as HT makes each processor core appear to software as multiple processor cores (two, in the case of Intel's chip designs).  Image source: Intel.  This is a feature that helps speed up applications that can take advantage of multiple processor cores, and can also aid in allowing systems to better handle several tasks concurrently. In its desktop processor product line, Intel had traditionally reserved HT for its dual-core Core i3 processors as well as its quad-core Core i7 processors, disabling the feature in its mid-range Core i5 and low-end Celeron and Pentium processors. However, as PC World's Gorgon Mah Ung points out, Intel's seventh-generation Pentium processors now include this feature. Let's take a closer look at the potential business reasons why Intel is finally bringing this feature to those lower-cost chips. An easy, margin-neutral way to boost performance Hyperthreading is a technology that's fundamentally built into all of Intel's Core architecture based processors; Intel's marketing department simply chooses to disable it in certain models for market segmentation reasons. Image source: Intel.  This means that chips with the technology enabled don't carry a fundamentally higher cost structure than ones that don't. The idea behind Intel's market segmentation practices is simple: It wants to give customers incentives to purchase higher-end products by reserving features and functionality for higher-end chips to keep its average selling prices as high as possible. At the same time, though, Intel needs to be sure that it delivers additional performance at established price points each year so that computer makers can offer faster computers without raising prices on consumers.  Intel enabling Hyperthreading on the lower-end Pentium chips is a way for the company to increase performance on these chips without ballooning its cost structure, which could translate into either price hikes or gross profit margin reductions.  It also serves to further differentiate the company's Pentium offerings from the even lower-end Celeron processors, which still -- per Intel's ARK product page -- come with HT disabled.  The catch PC World sought industry analyst Kevin Krewell's input on Intel's move here, and he brought up a good point (his analysis is paraphrased by PC World): One issue for Intel, Tirias Research analyst Kevin Krewell noted, is the lack of air between its pricier Core i3 and Pentiums. For example, the dual-core 3.9GHz Core i3-7100 costs $117 in volume and has Hyper-Threading and graphics. The dual-core 3.7GHz Pentium G4620 costs $86 to $93, has Hyper-Threading and HD 630 graphics. For that roughly 25% increase in price, all the customer gets is about a 5-percent performance boost. While it may be the case that the lower price-to-performance ratio of the lowest end Core i3 relative to the Pentium G4620 could impact the appeal of the i3 chip to those who buy chips directly to build/upgrade their own computers, most chips are sold as part of pre-assembled personal computers. Typical consumers probably don't know (or care) about these "speeds and feeds," and thus may find value in picking Core i3-based systems for a couple of reasons: System vendors tend to bundle better system components around faster processors, so even if a customer might not necessarily think the extra processor performance is worth it, the Core i3 systems are likely to offer better features elsewhere; and Intel has done a good job of establishing that its Core brand is a premium one relative to Pentium/Celeron (which have been relegated to budget personal computers for a while). This means that a customer who isn't paying attention to the speeds and feeds may believe that even the lowest-end Core i3 processor will deliver a significantly better user experience than the best Pentium processors.  What investors should watch Intel typically reports the changes in both unit shipments and average selling prices of its notebook and desktop processors separately in each quarter on year-to-date, year-over-year, and sequential bases. Investors interested in seeing if Intel's new strategy has a significant impact on product mix should pay attention to the changes that Intel reports in its desktop platform average selling prices in the coming quarters.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Image Credit: Intel There was a time when computer chip makers had no interest in car electronics. But times have changed as self-driving cars and the artificial intelligence used to pilot them have taken off. Now those cars are set to consume a huge amount of computing power and generate a ton of data to be processed in the cloud, internet-connected data centers. And that’s why Intel is excited about self-driving cars. It is pushing forward with technologies such as AI, computer vision, 5G wireless connectivity, and infotainment centers in vehicles. At CES 2017, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas last week, Intel said it had developed 5G infrastructure chips that will bring connectivity to self-driving cars, and it also said it was working with BMW on cars of the future. And it bought a stake in the mapping firm Here. Doug Davis is senior vice president and general manager of the automated driving group at Intel. I caught up with Davis at CES 2017 to discuss Intel’s announcements, including its new Intel Go brand for cars. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview. Above: Doug Davis is head of the automated driving group at Intel. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VentureBeat: Autonomous cars are big this year. Do you have any news at the show on that front? Doug Davis: We announced a new brand called Intel Go. It’s intended to comprehend what we’re doing from an autonomous driving standpoint. Within that, this week we announced a development platform that spans from our Intel Atom product family all the way to the Intel Xeon product family. It’s a development platform for 5G development. It’s (field programmable gate array) FPGA-based, so it allows developers to get started now on 5G for automotive applications. There’s also a software development kit that spans from the car to the cloud, to get developers up and running on those kinds of applications. The other thing we announced this week that’s directly attributable to what we’re doing in the autonomous space is our 5G modem. It’s the first modem device available for 5G. It’s the second half of 2017. VB: Every autonomous car is going to need one, basically? Davis: I wouldn’t say you can’t do an autonomous vehicle without 5G. A lot of the development on cars that are already out on the road is done on 4G LTE technology. But as we look at mainstream deployment, if you’ve been hearing from all the different OEMs, they’re all gravitating to about 2021 as a time frame they’re shooting for. You look at the timing of 5G, it’s very similar. As we get autonomous vehicles on the road, we’ll go from being drivers to passengers. As passengers we’ll have a lot of spare time. We can do work, do some shopping, watch our favorite series from whatever service we like to watch. That 5G bandwidth will be able to support the end-to-end artificial intelligence that’s necessary for these vehicles. It’ll be able to supply us with broadband connectivity for the things we want to do in the car. But it’ll also have the latency, the speed, to be able to support what’s called “V-to-X.” Vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to infrastructure, vehicle to pedestrian. 5G will support that as well. As we look at when these mainstream fleets of autonomous vehicles begin to get out on the road and the timing for 5G, we think it’ll be an important capability to combine together there. In the meantime we’ll see development happening on 4G technologies, obviously. VB: In autonomous cars, Jen-Hsun Huang says they have a three-year head start at Nvidia. Davis: But if you think about it, we have our 5G development platform now. You can put that in a car and begin doing development work. They’ll both have a long development cycle, but their timing is very similar. VB: They got into a cycle of announcing car supercomputer chips. A couple of them are out there now already. For Intel, what’s the road map? Have you put any word out as to which kind of processor will be your main processor for these applications? Davis: I can say, “Yes, and…” When we think about autonomous driving, it’s not just one chip. An autonomous vehicle will become an artificial intelligence implementation. To be able to put these cars on the road, especially when you think about putting large fleets on the road or making them consumer vehicles, you need to be able to build a model of the vehicle’s behavior. You’ll do that in the data center. That becomes your trained model, built using massive amounts of data. That trained model will then be deployed into the car, the inference that sits in the vehicle. That inference then defines the behavior of the car. But the car will also be collecting lots of data and sending it back to the data center. When we think about this, the data center, the network infrastructure, and the vehicle are all important elements of delivering the solution. The connectivity part of it is very important. Training in the data center will happen on Xeon, Xeon Phi FPGAs. We’ll have accelerator devices to accelerate certain algorithms via what we’re doing with Nirvana. If you think about what’s happening in the network infrastructure, they’re moving the software-defined networks with certain functions that get virtualized in the network. We’re delivering Atom through Xeon technologies to support that. Above: Intel believes that AI will be a huge part of car computing in the future. Image Credit: Intel In the car — everybody wants to talk about fully autonomous vehicles, but there will be an evolution from driver assist L3 all the way up to L4 and L5. We have products that support that capability. From a compute standpoint, it ranges from Atom for driver assist functions now up to Xeon for fully autonomous. But FPGAs play an important role in that. We have FPGA technology that scales accordingly. We’ve talked a lot about communications with that connectivity part that will sit in the vehicle. When we think about these things, it’s much more than just a chip. It’s the ability to deliver an end-to-end artificial intelligence implementation. You think about all those things I just described, nobody else in the industry has that breadth of assets. VB: You have the car-makers and their suppliers, and all the startups in the space. Who do you work with? Have you set up all those relationships? Davis: We described the range of companies. There are the OEMs building cars. There are tier one suppliers providing them, typically, with the compute elements that go into the car. Intel would be considered a tier two. We supply products and technologies to the tier ones. That’s the role we play in the industry. We’re also very mindful and respectful of our OEMs that we work with. For those that are to a stage where they’re ready to talk about who they’re working with — of course, we’re thrilled to make those kinds of announcements. We’ve talked about the work we’re doing with BMW and Baidu. Delphi recently acknowledged they’re working with us on the solution they’re building for the OEMs. But today, if you think about all the different autonomous vehicles in development, there are more than 200 based on Intel technology now. We have engagements with many OEMs, many tier ones, but we’re not naming those companies unless they’re at a stage where they’re ready to talk about it. VB: I was chatting with ARM a bit. They were saying that the ecosystem is changing a lot. In the microcontroller era, everybody had some very specific function they were doing. The suppliers would handle that — chips for the brakes or whatever. It would stay in that section. But now it’s more general-purpose computing and software that spreads across the whole car. No single supplier can be so narrow anymore. Davis: Obviously our focus, up until recently, has been around infotainment. We’ve done quite a bit for the past several years around driver assist and autonomous technologies, but the infotainment space is an interesting one. We’ve been advocating a technology road map that says you can start to consolidate numerous functions in our microprocessor. We have entertainment and navigation in that center stack, the screen that sits in the middle of the dash. Then the instrument cluster is becoming a display. Rear-view mirrors are becoming a display. The outside mirrors will ultimately become a display. Rear-seat entertainment includes displays. We’ve been advocating for quite some time — why can’t you have all these systems running on a single microprocessor with an operating system that provides a level of robustness and reliability that’s necessary, and then virtualize those workloads on top of that microprocessor? Above: The Intel Go platform will span from the car to the cloud. Image Credit: Intel If you get a chance to go by the Delphi booth, they have a great demo in there using our Intel Atom processor 3900, the Apollo Lake. They have a cockpit, if you will, where they’re running the infotainment system and the instrument cluster on one Apollo Lake processor. They can reboot the infotainment system and the instrument cluster remains fully functional, despite the fact that you’re rebooting the entire infotainment platform. If the system has a significant problem, it has the ability to still sustain the necessary level of performance. You don’t lose the instrument cluster. It’s a great demo. It shows exactly what you described in this space. They’re even talking about the ability to drive seven different displays simultaneously with one microprocessor. They have a cool cockpit where they’ve taken the instrument cluster and the infotainment system, and then this little clock display down here. They’re multiple displays stacked together. The one on top is fully transparent, so the instrument cluster is three-dimensional. Your infotainment platform is three-dimensional. The little clock is three-dimensional. Each of them is two screens sandwiched together. These gauges really look like physical objects. It’s one of the coolest things I’ve seen. Sorry, but I’m a little excited about it. [laughs] VB: You had your BMW announcement here. Davis: Wednesday morning, Intel and BMW and Mobileye had a press event at BMW’s booth. We talked about the progress we’ve made over the last six months. We announced the partnership back on July 1. This was a report on the progress we’ve made. We’re making great progress on the development of the platform we’ve described, and on this whole notion of how we can work together with other OEMs and tier ones. We said at the beginning that we wanted that to be a state-of-the-art platform that could be used by others in the industry as well. The work that we’re doing isn’t just limited to BMW. We’re continuing that development to enable that capability. We talked a bit about the work that’s going on. We defined this to a level of detail. There are 19 different work streams that define all the effort to make that happen. We also talked about the number of cars that are being built and put on the road in 2017. We’ll have as many as 40 cars on the road being used to do this development work. If you think about the number of autonomous vehicles out there now, that’s a pretty big number. We’re making good progress. Above: Intel Go Image Credit: Intel We announced the stake and the work we’re doing with Here. There’s really two objectives there. The first is to be able to work together with them on the data center technologies and capabilities they’re developing to be able to create, deliver, and update high-definition maps, and then the way in which they’ll be deployed to vehicles on the road. From an Intel perspective, there’s a lot of technology around the data center and how that gets optimized, and the way in which these maps can be delivered through network service providers. In the data center, Here will maintain these high-definition maps of, essentially, the planet. But when you’re in an autonomous vehicle, you probably don’t need a map of the whole planet in your car if you’re only driving around Vegas. Those cars will get updates based on their location. If you think about driving from Vegas to Phoenix, you’ll get updates of those maps as your trip progresses. The way in which those maps get deployed through the networks will be important. We’ll work together with them to figure out how you build and optimize and deliver these maps, as well as the way in which the car downloads and uses them. The other part is working together with OEMs as far as how they implement the maps within their cars, integrating that into their autonomous vehicles.

Nvidia was saying that just in AI alone, they’re working with 1,500 startups, and it seems like a lot of those are in cars. Davis: When we step back and think about AI, it will span a lot of different applications: health care, manufacturing, drug development, all kinds of things. We’re building an artificial intelligence capability as a company, an end-to-end artificial intelligence capability. The car just happens to be a very complex, comprehensive implementation of artificial intelligence that will be very visible, because we interact with cars on a daily basis. I don’t know about exact numbers. I haven’t heard a number like that. But it’s clear in the industry that it’s a hot area. A lot of startups, a lot of development. I think there will be a lot of technology investment in that space for a while. Part of it — I always say these things happen when they become economically viable. We’ve all talked about AI for a very long time, but we’re reaching a point where you have the compute and storage capacity in the data center to cost-effectively go do this broad range of AI implementations. You have the ability to deploy those cost-effectively through the networks. Thanks to Moore’s Law, we have the ability to put enough compute and storage in a device to deploy these kinds of solutions. AI has been around a long time, but it’s a confluence of those things, as well as all the software we need to fuel it. It’s kind of like the internet of things. I like to say that the internet of things is an overnight sensation that’s 20 years in the making. It’s because the compute, the connectivity, the cost of sensors, all those things have finally reached a point where it’s economically viable to implement them.

SUBSCRIBE Intel’s Super Bowl LI ad turns NFL MVP Tom Brady’s daily routines into epic experiences The 30-second spot showcases Intel's 360-degree replay technology, the same technology Fox Broadcasting will use during the game. Amy Gesenhues on January 12, 2017 at 12:15 pm More Intel has recruited Super Bowl veteran and MVP Tom Brady for its 30-second “Brady Everyday” Super Bowl ad scheduled to air during Fox’s broadcast of the game on February 5. The spot features Tom Brady doing his usual daily routines, but with the added experience of Intel’s 360-degree replay technology — the same technology that will be used by Fox during the Super Bowl broadcast. Brady is just brushing his teeth or fixing a pancake, but Intel’s 360-degree replay effects make his most mundane tasks look larger than life. “For the first time, a company is airing an advertisement during the Super Bowl that is actually part of the broadcast and part of the game itself,” said Intel CMO Steve Fund in a release announcing the brand’s Super Bowl campaign. Fund said it was a “true example of innovative marketing” and that Tom Brady was the perfect partner for the brand because, “… he exemplifies high performance and is one of the best quarterbacks of all time.” Intel will also bring a new “Be the Player” viewer-experience to this year’s Super Bowl broadcast, using the 360-degree replay technology to “freeze a moment” during the game so that it can be seen from the player’s viewpoint. “The technology can bring a viewer onto the field from the quarterback’s position to see what it’s like to catch the snap, see the options and feel the pressure of the line rushing toward them,” reports Intel. As part of the campaign, Intel has also launched a site where NFL fans can create their own frame of Tom Brady to add to user-generated videos. Intel says it will create an online gallery of the best images created.

Josh Miller/CNET Wearable Tech by Scott Stein January 12, 2017 8:59 AM PST @jetscott Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS A Vive headset was lowered over my face, and a rifle placed in my hands. The cleared-out room space around me was ready for me to take on a few waves of attackers. All around me, I saw enemies coming. I ducked, I aimed, I ran towards a wall and tried to hide. And it was pretty amazing stuff, maybe the best time I had in Las Vegas over a busy CES week. All because I wasn't tripping over any wires. Wireless dongles are here (if you're willing to pay) TPCast's wireless adapter for the Vive (with a version also coming for the Oculus Rift) is very real, and it really works. It's arriving in the second quarter of this year, and it streams audio and video to the PC-connected Vive headset, removing the last tether between my VR gear and the rest of the physical world. Going wireless with Vive means no tripping when turning, and it works with no lag.Photo by Josh Miller/CNET It's the best example of wireless VR I've ever seen, and it turns the Vive into a true Holodeck experience. But, at $300 for a snap-on thing that sits on your head and also requires a separate battery pack on a tether, it's gear on top of gear. The battery lasts either two or five hours, depending on how big the battery pack you buy. TPCast's solution is one of several coming this year: another, an Oculus/Vive wireless adapter from KwikVR, is also coming (I didn't get a chance to try KwikVR at CES, though). These gadgets are building onto existing hardware. But, amazingly, it really works well. I didn't feel any lag, and being totally cable-free changed the way VR felt. I was still smothered in a helmet and other gear, but it felt more relaxed, more natural. All I could keep thinking was, when will this be built into the actual headset? Last year's solution to wireless PC VR was strapping on a backpack PC. This year, it's an expensive wireless dongle. A better answer might not be coming anytime soon. More advanced wireless tech like WiGig, that could handle this level of wireless video and data throughput, isn't here quite yet, and it's unclear what building such powerful wireless into a headset would mean for adding bulk or batteries. New cameras, like Google Tango, could make mobile VR more...mobile.Photo by James Martin/CNET Mobile wireless: Just add movement In mobile VR, wireless has already been available: slot your phone in, and you're ready. But mobile VR currently lacks walk-across-the-room positional tracking, or "six degrees of freedom." That means you can't lean forward, or go for a stroll. Instead, with Gear VR or Daydream, you sit and turn your head. But it's coming, thanks to possibilities from Google's depth-sensing Tango cameras combining with Daydream View VR in phones like the Asus Zenfone AR. Qualcomm's vision for mobile VR powered by its new Snapdragon processors allows for walking around too, provided you have a wide-angle lens on your phone. In Qualcomm's Power Rangers demo, walking around was halfway decent. If a cheap phone VR headset let me walk around like this for a few basic apps, I'd be satisfied in a pinch. It's not great, but it works. Intel's Project Alloy is a VR headset worth waiting for We tried Intel's all-in-one VR headset that doesn't need cables or a computer and lets you roam freely in the real world... Just watch out for walls. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 1:40 Close Drag Putting the whole PC on your head: Intel's Project Alloy In more advanced PC and console gaming VR, cutting the cord is more complicated, because all the processing's done on a big box somewhere else, not on your face. So, what about just taking it all and wrapping it around your skull? Intel has a number of VR and AR initiatives, from creating VR content like immersive 3D video to Project Alloy, a headset that promises to capture real-world data with embedded cameras, then blends that into virtual reality. Project Alloy isn't like HoloLens. Instead of the HoloLens' see-through visor that projects images so they seem like they're floating in real space, Alloy looks like a regular VR headset, with no see-through element. It's bulky, too. But Alloy is a full Windows PC, built on Intel's Kaby Lake chips. It's compatible with Windows Holographic, Microsoft's cross-platform initiative to support multiple VR, AR and mixed-reality devices in the next Windows 10 update this year. It's a reference design for how mixed (or, per Intel, "merged") reality headsets could be built on Windows hardware. I played a simple shooter demo during my time at CES in Las Vegas, where I held a small wireless motion remote and aimed at flying drones as I ran around a little base station on some sci-fi planet. Project Alloy could track my walking with its built-in cameras and sensors, offering six degrees of freedom via its cameras along with tilt and gyro sensors. Alloy could also scan my room with its cameras, theoretically adding my furniture and room dimensions into VR. But it doesn't seem like it'll happen in real-time. The room scan had already happened before my demo started, and I was in a prepared demo room with a table and sofas that were set by Intel. Even then, the objects showed up as rough polygon blobs, not realistic things. I wasn't convinced it would really merge reality and VR in ways that could happen in real time dynamically. And as a wireless demo, Project Alloy didn't seem like it was delivering VR at anywhere near the smooth graphics of what's already available on Vive or Oculus Rift. That's not a surprise, considering Alloy has nowhere near the graphics power of a VR-ready desktop PC. But it did give me a new appreciation for what HoloLens already does. Microsoft's wireless stand-alone mixed-reality headset has been in developer's hands for months, and it does a pretty good job overlaying graphics and games into the real world -- and tracking motion in any space. You probably won't be tetherless yet VR is on its way to wireless this year in some exploratory ways, but I don't see any evidence that it'll be really ready in great products for a while. But, clearly, lots of companies are trying to get there from a lot of different directions at once. There are plenty of indications that will change, and TPCast's adapter could be a magic solution for a lot of people. But you'll need expensive dongles, patience, or be ready to experiment with funky new phones or hardware. Polished wireless VR might be a 2018 thing. But it's going to happen, and it'll be great when it gets here.

Intel is using Tom Brady to help show off its 360-degree replay technology. The tech giant today rolled out a new advertisement featuring the Patriots quarterback that shows 360-degree angles of Brady going through a morning routine — like brushing his teeth and cooking pancakes. “Intel’s 360-degree technology makes anything look epic,” the narrator says. The 360-degree replays will be utilized during next month’s Super Bowl (the commercial will also air during the big game). Intel will use 38 cameras, all 5K, to help create the 360-degree replays. The cameras help digitize the entire playing field and, along with the help of algorithms and computing power, create a 3-dimensional view of the action. Each replay clip will last 15-to-30 seconds and use 1 TB of data. Intel did the same for last year’s Super Bowl, as well as the NBA All-Star Game and the MLB All-Star Game. Intel said it will also for the first time utilize 360-degree replay to show point of view from a player’s perspective. From Intel’s press release: “Be the Player” uses Intel 360 replay technology to freeze a moment in the game and see the field from the player’s standpoint. The technology can bring a viewer onto the field from the quarterback’s position to see what it’s like to catch the snap, see the options and feel the pressure of the line rushing toward them. Commentators can share a new level of insight into the gametime decisions players have to make, as well as give an entirely new perspective to fans. Some of the technology that makes it all work comes from Intel’s acquisition of Replay Technologies in March of last year. Jeff Hopper, general manager of immersive experiences at Intel, called 360-degree replays the “best technology in live sports.” For more than a year, Intel has made a serious effort to bring its technology into the sports world. At CES in Las Vegas earlier this month, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich appeared on stage at multiple events and talked about sports. "By 2019, the technology will be advanced enough that we’ll put you in the QB’s helmet and you’ll watch the game,” says @intel CEO. #CES2017 pic.twitter.com/gk4ElBxV97 — GeekWire (@geekwire) January 6, 2017 Krzanich also led the company’s press conference, which took attendees on a virtual reality tour. One demo included a live-look at a college basketball game, showing the fruits of Intel’s Voke acquisition last year. Intel also has partnerships with sports companies like New Balance and media giants like ESPN. It also tapped Michael Phelps, who was just at CES for Under Armour, for a recent commercial that has more than 3 million views on YouTube.

We round up the rumours about new iMacs, including the theory that new iMacs will feature AMD Radeon Polaris graphics chips and might even be VR-ready. Latest: Tim Cook hints at the future of the Mac desktop, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac by Ashleigh Macro | 12 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will Apple release new iMacs in the UK? Will Apple update its iMac desktop line to add Intel Kaby Lake processor chips, and what other specs, design changes and new features should we expect in the next generation of iMacs? How much will the new iMacs for 2017 cost? Apple last updated its iMac line on 13 October 2015, bringing Retina-class screen resolution to the smaller Macs for the first time and equipping the larger models with new Skylake processor chips. Before that, you had to go back more than two years - if you don't include the cheaper iMac which Apple launched in June 2014 - to the last proper new iMac update, in September 2013, when Apple added Haswell processors, new graphics, next-gen Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options. (For more information on that update, read our review of the 2013 iMacs.) So much for Apple's iMac updates over the past few years. Right now we're looking ahead to the next iMac launch - what we hope will be an early-2017 iMac update. In this article we round up all the speculation about Apple's next iMac update: when new iMacs will be released in the UK, new iMac prices, tech specs and new features to expect, any leaked photos and videos that appear online, and all the other new iMac rumours that are fit to print. Updated, 22 December 2016, with comments from Apple CEO Tim Cook about the future of the Mac desktop Read next: Where to buy iMacs in the UK | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iMac deals UK New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Launch date When will new iMacs come out? Early in 2017, we hope, but we had been confidently expecting an iMac update in late 2016 and that came to nothing. (A contact told us, under condition of anonymity, that the Mac Pro would be updated before the end of November 2016, and we reasoned that it would make sense for Apple to announce at least a minor update to the iMac at the same time. But the year ended with no word on new Mac desktops.) The Best Buy leak discussed in the processor section of this article, which emerged at the start of October 2016, strongly suggests that the retailer has had advance warning of an imminent launch and posted a listing slightly too early by mistake - although it's also possible that this was a speculative listing created on the basis that it would probably be needed at some point. New iMac 2017 release date: Apple CEO hints at future of the iMac In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important.  A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell.  New iMac 2017 release date: What does previous launch history tell us? The last iMac update was in October 2015. Apple's yearly cycle is built around three major press events: autumn - usually September (new iPhones and iPads); spring - usually March (new iPhones and iPads, sometimes MacBooks and watches); and summer - usually June (WWDC - operating system updates, and occasional hardware). But that doesn't mean the company stays quiet the rest of the year. Mac updates can be folded into the big three events, but they're often launched at their own smaller launch events. The iMac update in 2015 got its own announcement, a few weeks after the iPhone 6s reveal. But bear in mind that, unlike the yearly or event twice-yearly update events we're used to for iOS devices, desktop Mac refreshes have frequently come several years apart. WWDC 2017 (which will take place in June next year) is therefore a possibility, and we may have to wait even longer than that. New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Specs We'll add leaked details about the tech specs of the new iMacs to this section as we hear them. Here's what we know so far. New iMac 2017 specs: Processor Apple skipped Intel's much-delayed Broadwell processors and went straight from Haswell to Skylake for the 2015 update. Skylake uses the same 14nm manufacturing process as Broadwell, but brings even greater CPU and GPU performance, along with reduced power consumption. But what chips will appear in the next set of iMacs? Clearly that will depend on their launch date and the hardware that's available at the time. After 2015's Skylake, the next round of Intel processors, which started going into mass production in late 2016 and is still being rolled out, is Kaby Lake; this will be followed by Cannonlake (Cannonlake was due to be next, but it's been delayed until the second half of 2017). Then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019, for those who enjoy this sort of thing. Kaby Lake uses a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake, but Cannonlake switches over to a more accurate 10nm process. If Apple does manage an iMac update before the end of 2016 the machines could feature Kaby Lake processors, but remember that Apple skipped Broadwell and delays are common in the chip sector - so we're not banking on anything. Intel started shipping its Kaby Lake processors in July 2016, and the chips offer support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. It's therefore now possible that Apple will squeeze Kaby Lake chips into the next iMac update, but by no means guaranteed, given Apple's past behaviour. Some of the Kaby Lake chips aren't expected to ship until very late 2016 or more likely early 2017, so be prepared for a wait. Read more on MacRumors. Processor models The specific model of Kaby Lake processor we're expecting to appear in the next iMac is the i7-7700. And as luck would have it, Tom's Hardware has got hold of what they understand to be a pre-release sample of that chip. Naturally they promptly overclocked it and put it through rigorous speed tests. Those speed tests found that the i7-7700 (or rather the i7-7700K - the K in the name denoting that the clock multiplier has been unlocked to allow for overclocking) was capable of 4.2GHz under normal circumstances, and 4.8GHz when overclocked. Serious speed which, as BGR observes, would give the new iMac bragging rights over the rival Surface Studio, launched before the relevant Kaby Lake chips became available. Micosoft could always launch an updated Surface Studio with Kaby Lake, of course, although that might hack off the early buyers. Evidence for Kaby Lake Back in October 2016, the US retailer Best Buy leaked a listing for a new iMac, and it had a Kaby Lake chipset - a "7th Gen Intel Core i7 processor". As Technobuffalo points out, this isn't necessarily genuine: an employee could have created this as a placeholder until official information is available. But slip-ups of this kind more often happen because a retailer has been given advance warning of an imminent launch and somebody sets it live too early by mistake. We'd say - based on this and other clues - that a Kaby Lake iMac is looking like a decent bet for launch in the near future. In November 2016, further evidence emerged that sheds light on the prospects of a Kaby Lake iMac. Intel briefly made documents available on its website, intended for PC manufacturer partners rather than consumers, that detail specs of new Kaby Lake processors - and Anandtech spotted and grabbed them. The documents detail 11 new processors, including seven i5 chips and three i7s; 10 of them are designated for desktop use and one is for worktop. There's still no sign of the Kaby Lake laptop processors we expect to use as part of a MacBook Pro update in early 2017. AMD processors We expect Apple to choose Intel-based CPUs, but there's a chance AMD could also make an appearance in certain iMac models. With the new AMD Zen processor, we hope to see the CPU make an appearance in a lot of high-end machines, given its tremendous processing power. The new processor boasts 8 cores and 16 threads - a massive amount of raw processing power. Given the suggested price tag of the Zen CPU, we expect it either to be in the top-spec iMacs or be an upgrade option. The inclusion of other AMD processors is also not far-fetched, as we still see it being an option for cheaper iMac models. New iMac 2017 specs: Graphics chips It's believed that Apple's next generation of iMacs (or its higher-specced models, at least) will feature graphics chips from AMD's Polaris set, which were announced at the start of 2016. WCCF Tech reports that AMD won the contract last October but was only able to get confirmation from additional sources in April 2016. The contract is for two chipsets: Polaris 10 (previously known as Ellesmere) and Polaris 11 (previously known as Baffin), and WCCF Tech says these processors will appear in "new desktops and notebooks from Apple, which the company plans to bring to market later this year". With the MacBook and MacBook Air having recently seen updates, and the Mac mini highly unlikely to incorporate a discrete graphics unit, the remaining candidates are the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro. MacRumors reasons that the power range of these chips makes Polaris 11 a strong fit for the MacBook Pro, while Polaris 10 suits the iMac. The Polaris chips offer improved graphics performance compared with previous generations (as much as twice the speed per watt) and potential reductions in both power consumption and waste heat. They are built using a 16nm or 14nm FinFET production process, compared to 28nm on AMD's earlier chips, which means that the chip maker can fit more transistors in a given space (which makes the chips ideal for ultraportable laptops and ultraslim desktops - the latter fitting recent iMac designs) and, because the transistors are closer together, less power is needed to move a signal across them. Apple's current iMac line-up features AMD Radeon graphics chipsets as standard in the 27-inch models. The 21-inch models come with integrated Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics. Read next: New Mac Pro rumours | New Mac mini rumours New iMac 2017 specs: Virtual reality Talking about graphics architecture can be a little dry, but the Polaris rumour discussed above has a sexier element to it: VR. AMD has consistently talked up its Polaris graphics chips as a way of bringing VR within the reach of a wider market of PC users. At present Macs are basically unusable for VR, as we discuss in our articles Can you use Oculus Rift with Mac? and How to use a Mac for VR, and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey specifically cited underpowered Mac GPUs as the reason why the company was focusing on Windows: "People have said, 'Why don't you support Macs? So many people have Macs.' It's true. A lot of people have Apple hardware, especially in the laptop space. But the GPUs in those, they're not even close to what we're pushing for our recommended spec." But adding Polaris GPUs to the iMac could change Luckey's mind. AMD's Roy Taylor thinks the company's new GPUs are about to massively expand the available market for VR. "AMD has just completed the shrink to 14nm [with Polaris]," he said. "This means we can produce GPUs that will run the minimum spec of VR at a lower cost, in larger volume, consuming less power and running faster. That means in the second half of this year and going forward, more people will be able to run those headsets." Visit WCCF Tech for more info. VR remains a niche topic in tech - the number of people actually willing to shell out for the whole shebang remains small, even if casual gamers who try the Vive or the Oculus Rift tend to love it - but it gets a lot of press at the moment. And it can't be nice for a company that prides itself on the quality of its products to hear them disparaged as "not even close" to being up to a task. As Jim Lynch on CIO colourfully phrases it, "As far as VR goes, it's not something that I have paid much attention to, but it certainly couldn't hurt for Apple's computers to be able to do it adequately... If VR lights a fire under Apple's rear end and gets the company to put out a pro version of the iMac, then it will be a good thing for all users." New iMac 2017 specs: Flash storage We'll repeat our hope, expressed this time last year while waiting for the 2015 update, that Apple makes flash storage standard across the entire range of iMacs. At present the 27-inch iMacs get a Fusion Drive by default (Fusion Drives are a high-performance hybrid blend of flash and conventional storage) and the 21.5-inch models can add them as a build-to-order option for an extra £80. We think it should be offered as standard in all Apple's desktops. The current 21.5-inch iMac range is crippled somewhat by its hard drives, which are a lot slower than the flash drives used in all of Apple's laptops - to the extent that Mac laptops with similar processors will perform noticeably better than the equivalent iMac because of their faster SSD drives. Read next: Best external SSD flash drives for Mac New iMac 2017 rumours: Could the iMac replace the Mac Pro? In our roundup of rumours about the next Mac Pro, we discuss the possibility that Apple is planning to wrap up that line - and one way such a move could work is by ramping up the top spec of the iMac line so that it meets the needs of professional users, rendering the Pro irrelevant. TechRadar has speculated about the specs of a theoretical 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling. All of this is certainly a possibility. But while the Mac Pro doesn't appear to be tearing up trees commercially, it was never a line that was about making money. The Mac Pro is a flagship product, a niche offering and a positioning exercise - a way of reassuring Mac buyers that Apple is still a company that makes products for pro users. In some senses it's like the Apple Watch Edition: a glamorous, unnecessarily expensive aspiration point that passes on some of its stardust to the more affordable diffusion lines below.

(Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group) By Jimmy Golen | January 12, 2017 at 7:14 am BOSTON (AP) — Have you ever wanted to know what Tom Brady sees as he stares down a pass rush, scans the field for an open receiver … or brushes his teeth in the morning? This year’s Super Bowl broadcast could be just what you’re looking for. Thanks to a 360-degree replay technology called “Be the Player,” Fox TV broadcasters will be able to show a play from virtually any spot in the stadium within minutes of the action taking place. The spin-around-and-zoom “freeD” system has been used at other sporting events – including the NBA and MLB All-Star Games and the Olympics – but this will be the first that takes the extra step and shows events from the athlete’s perspective. “The difference here is you would be able to go in and see from his vantage point what the player actually saw,” said Zac Fields, a senior vice president for graphic technology and integration at Fox Sports Group. “It’s something that most of us have never been able to see before. The vantage point that most of us have on TV is really different than what the guys see on the field. That’s what the promise of this technology is.” Intel is rolling out the new technology at this year’s Super Bowl, and promoting it in an ad that will feature Brady in his everyday life – waking up, making breakfast, brushing his teeth – with the tagline: “Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic.” As the Patriots quarterback snarfs down a pancake, the camera spins around to a new angle and shows the crumbs falling from his mouth. And, if New England makes it to the Feb. 5 Super Bowl in Houston, there will be even more opportunities to see things from Brady’s perspective. “It’s something that fans have always dreamed about: ‘What did Tom see when he threw that pass?'” Jeff Hopper, the general manager of strategy and marketing for the Intel Sports Group, told The Associated Press in advance of the announcement. “Everyone wants to be the player, to see what it’s like to see it from that point of view.” To make the “Be the Player” video possible, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras in a perimeter inside NRG Stadium, creating what Hopper calls “a volumetric capture of everything that’s going on on the field.” The cameras are connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a special control room, where a half-dozen Intel producers, working with one from the Fox Sports broadcast, can pick out and package the replays that will be used in the broadcast. The massive amount of data – about 1 terabyte per 15-30 second clip – allows producers to position a “virtual camera” anywhere it wants – including, virtually, inside a player’s helmet. (Early versions even toyed with superimposing a facemask on the screen, though that has apparently been dropped.) It will take about two minutes to produce the clips, meaning it’s not yet ready for instant replay but could, for example, be available to show a new view of a touchdown by the time the teams are done with the extra point or kickoff. In an interview in Boston’s Back Bay this week, Hopper said there could be up to 20 “Be the Player” replays, though ultimately it is up to Fox to decide how to use it. “It will depend upon the story you are trying to tell,” Fields said. “It’s not something we’re planning on using because it is a new bell and whistle. It is a storytelling tool, and that’s how we’re planning to utilize it.” Right now, use of the system is limited to big events: It took about a month to retrofit the stadium in Houston with all of the equipment needed for the freeD data capture. Also, each 15-30 clip consists of about 1 terabyte of data. But Hopper said new stadiums are already being built with the cameras in mind. “Anyone who’s building a new stadium now is saying, ‘What do we need to do to make it freeD ready?'” he said. “Because everyone sees it as the future.” Eventually, Hopper said, the technology will not be limited to storytelling. Teams and leagues are hoping to mine the data to improve performance. In the X-Games, Hopper said, the athletes were eager to figure out how high they jumped and use that information to tune their techniques – or just brag about big air with the competition. In time, coaches will be able to use the video to see what their player saw, instead of relying on overhead shots of the field. And, as the turnaround time quickens, the technology would also help replay reviews by giving officials the ability to freeze the action and zoom in at any angle to look, for example, to see whether a player’s knee was down before the ball popped out. “We’re working with pretty much the entire sports world,” Hopper said. “All the leagues, all the teams. I don’t think there’s anyone that we’re not. We can’t do them all, but we’re talking with them all.” And Hopper envisions a sports world where every fan will be able to immerse himself in the game on his phone or a virtual reality headset – not just view the shots curated by a TV producer sitting in a trailer next to the stadium. “That’s good; I think it’s interesting. But the transformative nature of what we’re working on is: Everybody gets to do it themselves,” Hopper said. “Ultimately you’ll be able to be on the field, with the players – the best players in the world.” Tags:  Sports Buzz Jimmy Golen Subscribe Today!

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature An indie/retro/moba box in your pocket Home Hardware Voyo 1 Mini PC Can you use a pocket-size PC as a games machine? By Alec Meer on January 10th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit The PC is dead, long live the PC, etc. By which I mean ‘a big box that sits underneath your desk’ is an increasingly inaccurate definition of PC. The concept is heading off in all sorts of directions, from patently ridiculous laptops to transforming tablets to all-in-one giant touchscreens to surprisingly games-capable laptops to yes, big boxes under your desk but also small boxes on top of your desk. And, as I’m looking at today, teeny-tiny boxes that just about fit into the back pocket of your trousers or can slip behind your TV. Can a $235/£188, 12x12x3cm box really work as a PC? And, more pertinently, can it possibly be any kind of games machine? The box in question is a VOYO V1 Mini PC. Similar boxes from other firms are available, and I’m using this one as an example rather than the be-all and end-all of this sort of thing. Inside it contains an Intel Pentium N4200, aka an Apollo Lake – the latest iteration (and reportedly last gasp of) the Atom ultra-mobile, system-on-a-chip range that powered netbooks and, indeed, lesser versions of teeny-tiny PCs like this. The numbers: quadcore, clockspeed that shifts between 1.1 and 2.4GHz depending on load, paired with 4GB of DDR3 and, on this model, a 128GB SSD plus bonus, confusing extra 32GB drive. (There’s also space to fit an extra laptop-sided drive of your choosing inside). Not big numbers, but not terrible numbers either – not for £188. Doing some research while waiting for the thing to arrive, I read some claims that the N4200 performs on a par with some of the Core i3 chips that we see in cheap laptops. Though I don’t own one of those to benchmark against it, using Windows 10 on this thing certainly feels very similar to my experience of recent £300-400 laptops. Eminently usable, in other words – lag here and there, takes noticeably longer to open applications than a mid-spec PC does, and once in a while it chokes for half a minute. Also, Task Manager invariably shows 100% CPU usage – even when it doesn’t seem troubled by it – so clearly it’s working flat out. But I used it as my work machine for a couple of days and, though I missed the comparative immediacy of my main PC’s task management, there was none of the screaming and weeping that characterised the half-year I spent using a netbook for work. (I will note before I forget that I had to turn off Windows Defender whenever I wanted to do any significant, such as Photoshop or games, as it alone uses 30-60% of processor time near-constantly. It’s an insufferable bastard even on a ‘proper’ PC, but it really does a number on the poor wee N200. For example, with it on my Steam download speeds halved, 4K video on YouTube turned jerky, and it made the difference between Inside running pleasantly at 30 frames per second and 12 with it on. If you’re tempted by a box like this, get in the habit of turning Defender off, or replace it with some alternative anti-malware app.) Anyway – that aside, for browsing, working and video-watching (1080p and 4K files and streams, though 4K Netflix is locked out on anything other than Intel’s latest Kaby Lake range of CPU), there’s not much to complain about, bar a little extra waiting before you get going. Though sometimes the inverse is true – it’s quicker and quieter to resume from sleep than any other PC I’ve owned. That’s systems-on-a-chip for ya, I guess – certainly, it’s pleasant to just tap the single button on the front (or keyboard if you’re using a USB one) and have it spring straight to life like a phone would. This isn’t really our bailiwick I realise, but I have been using it as a mini-media centre on the family TV. I was one of those idiots who bought a Smart TV (albeit a discounted factory outlet one) a couple of years ago, and though it’s a decent enough screen, it was a terrible mistake in every other respect. BBC iPlayer only works 50% of the time, it doesn’t recognise half the codecs I need it to if I’m streaming a file from my main PC, the UI is polluted with nonsense streaming services that not even their creators use and there’s no way to install Amazon Prime Video on it. (I don’t really use that, but I have a Prime account because next-day childcare supplies are easier than the long trek down and up a big hill to the nearest supermarket). Basically, the not-really-smart-at-all-is-it TV is locked into video tech from a few years back, and will only become increasingly infuriating as time progresses. Using a bluetooth keyboard and mouse to control the Voyo is a fiddlier solution than big fat buttons on a remote control, but it’s counter-balanced by the fact that this is a PC and thus I can install or update whatever I need. Which – we’re here at last! – includes games. Now, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. The N4200 includes Intel integrated graphics, but far short of even the broadly 3D-useless fare found in a full-fat Intel CPU, even though it shares the Skylake GPU’s architecture. The GPU’s called the HD Graphics 505, it runs at 750 MHz and shares system memory. Do not expect great things. In fact, if it’s a 3D game from the last two to four years, rule it out entirely unless it’s lo-fi or otherwise minimalist. This sounds as though it’s a death knell for the Voyo/N4200 as a games machine, but no, not at all. Because the CPU itself is fairly capable, there’s a whole world of 2D games, older AAA and retro that it is totally happy with. For example, of the 24 games in our best-of-2016 advent calendar, the Voyo can comfortably* handle the following: INSIDE Sorcery! The Curious Expedition hackmud Darkest Dungeon Burly Men At Sea Owlboy Duskers Thumper (Our game of the year) Devil Daggers * By this I mean ‘at least 30 frames per second on minimum settings, but in fully 2D stuff it’s running faster and looking better than that. It can also just about handle Civ 6 and Overwatch, depending on whether you can handle playing at 20-25 frames per second at sub-720p. It’s not as bad as it sounds, though it’s definitely not how I’d choose to play. I haven’t tried the other 3D stuff on the list yet, partly due to download sizes and partly due to a certainty that I’d be wasting my time. However, here are some other, off-list games which fall into the Comfortably category: Invisible Inc Dota 2 Team Fortress 2 World of Warcraft AM2R FTL Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines Quake Odallus: The Dark Call X-COM: UFO Defense Proteus Day Of The Tentacle Remastered The Binding Of Isaac: Afterbirth Kentucky Route Zero Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga (And depending on your personal threshold for acceptable framerates, you can get 15-20 frames out of XCOM 1, which I personally didn’t find too bad for a turn-based game. I also get between 15 and 25 on Skyrim which sometimes feels OK and other times does not. Extensive tweaking and modding may be able to get it close to 30, though). So on and so on. As you can see, pretty much anything 2D is a dead cert, while anything 3D from the last decade or before should be OK, plus a few ringers from more recent times. No, you’re not going to play DOOM or Hitman or Dishonored 2 or even XCOM 2 on it, but this is still a PC that just about fits into a pocket yet can play many thousands of cool videogames. In a horribly, cheesy way, one might call this the IndieBox. But one most certainly should not. The other thing I’ve been using it for is as a retro emulator, due to having recently fallen down an ‘oh god so many modern games are so long and complicated and self-regarding so 90s Nintendo games suddenly seem highly appealing after years of Ninty abstinence’ rabbit hole. RetroArch is a fine, fine application that acts as an all-in-one emulator for any console that can be successfully emulated, though is at its best for NES, SNES, Megadrive, N64 and PSX. I haven’t bothered with the latter two as yet, but it’s been glorious on the Voyo for GBA and SNES games, hooked up to the TV with a wireless gamepad. There are all sorts of bespoke or single-platform retro boxes around these days, but you can’t beat the all-purpose nature of the PC, and I would say that both price and performance are right for this one if that’s the kind of gaming you want to do on it. Only you get all this amazing 2D/older 3D stuff from Steam, GoG, itch etc too. I’ve used both an older (full-size) PC and a Steam Link to try and achieve similar, but either space and noise are an issue or there’s just a bit too much fiddle and compromise involved. This wee thinger fits the bill very well. Sure, you could achieve similar on a cheap laptop or a more powerful second-hand machine for similar money. But it won’t go in your back pocket or tuck behind a couple of books, will it? There’s one major exception to my fondness for this thing, which is that it’s surprisingly noisy. Not noisy-noisy, but the fan is very noticeable and a little more high-pitched than I’d like with it whenever it’s doing anything intensive. If you’re just, say, tapping words into a CMS, it’s silent, but videos and games or loading applications into memory spool it up and, in a quiet room, it’s always there in the background. If I had the time/patience, I might crack it open and try and fit a larger, therefore quieter fan to it. I’d stick another 4GB of RAM into it while I was there, which is possible but requires total and possibly scary disassembly. (An extra hard drive only requires taking off the bottom side, however). I also wish it had built-in WiFI and Bluetooth – there’s an adaptor for the former included, but you’ll need to supply the latter yourself, and if you have both that’s two of its three USB ports gone. That aside, it’s hard to argue with. It’s cute, its blantantly Mac Mini-aping style is pleasant to behold and yeah, it’s totally a usable Windows 10 PC. For £100 it would be a no-brainer, for £150 it’d still feel OK as a secondary PC/media centre/indie-retro games console – or even for a box you can sling in your pocket/bag and take it round your mate’s to play Dota or League of Legends. For £190 though, it’s moving beyond random indulgence and into ‘need to really rationalise this purchase’ territory, although I should mention that it does come with Windows 10 pre-installed, which sweetens the deal. But yeah, currently just slightly too expensive to feel comfortable as a suck-it-and-see purchase. There will be more boxes like this, perhaps some that much cheaper, and on the other side of the scale Intel are putting their new full-fat Kaby Lake CPUs into teeny PCs, which will cost more but be more capable. This type of PC is here to stay, I think. And with PC gaming such a broad church now, they’re going to make for lovely mini-consoles.

Well, of course, if you want to play latest AAA graphic games such as Tomb Raider or Witcher 3 in 1080p at very high to ultra-super-duper-max then you need expensive hard-ware. Still it seems a lot is a sales-pitch by companies, and the people who test stuff on a regular basis, of course they will notice the difference. But let’s be honest – as average user, if you have an “ok PC” and you play say Witcher 3 in medium to high at around 30-40 fps without, or very few, hick-ups and don’t have the direct comparison, you won’t notice the difference. I recently built on office PC from scratch parts, old PSU, a 7950, external harddisc. Bought a cheap mobo and an i3, plus SSD as boot media and 16 GB memory (I didn’t save on the latter 2), and voila, I can play any “simple” game at max settings at 60 fps, I can play Wicher 3 or Dark-Souls III at satisfying settings and fps, so I am good with that. The i3 has an Iris chip built in which also works fine for the majority of smaller titles (ok, not Witcher 3, but anyway). And as media-PC, currently, I have a ras.Pi2 and works fine with hdmi streaming from my NAS. So again, alot of the fancy hardware for the average Joe is just a sales-thing from the hardware producers.

It’s similarly specced to the box in the article but not much bigger than a cigarette box. Similar to the Intel compute stick, it plugs straight into a hdmi port. I’m very impressed with it for what it is. I plugged it into a little chinese projector and had system shock 2, deus ex etc running at 1080p down scaled to the projectors native resolution of 800×400. Considering I bought it just as a retro machine to play old pc games from my teens it’s done the job admirably. There’s some good youtube videos on how to squeeze the most out of integrated graphics, and once it was all configured I could run anything up to around doom 3 in 1080p. If you dropped that to 720p you’d probably cope fine with half life 2 and others from around that era. I was skeptical because there’s barely any info or reviews of the t08 online but it’s worked out really well so far Log in to Reply 10/01/2017 at 23:42 alison says: I don’t think I have ever read a hardware article on RPS, and tbh I only skimmed this one too. But I should comment because I have been a “low spec” gamer for a long, long time. Back in 2002-ish I gave up on traditional desktop computers and since then have always gamed on SFF PCs. First was the Mini-ITX. Back then the only manufacturer was VIA, and their CPU wasn’t even Intel. It was the laughing stock of computers, but it ran Deus Ex and Counter-Strike acceptably. Later I moved to the Alienware 11″ laptop, back when they still cared about making smallish computers. But in the smartphone era that got too big too, so I moved to a Lenovo Miix 11″ tablet. I am still using that tablet today, along with an Alienware Alpha in the corner of the room bought solely for the purpose of Steam streaming to the tablet. I can barely grasp how anyone would buy a “big” computer for gaming these days. The Alienware Alpha has a laptop NVidia chip that is several years old, but I can still play (via streaming) the latest games in 1080p in high or ridiculous graphics settings. When I was playing games direct from the tablet I could still happily play 3D games from several years ago in 720p or 800×600. Occasionally it was jerky (which is why I bought the Alpha), but the ergonomics balanced that out. I play everything in my bed, lying on my stomach. Sitting at a desk to play computer games seems like a weird thing people only did… well, 15 years ago before laptops got gud. Anywho. Point is. If you want portable gaming and you don’t mind low res on last-gen games, just get a tablet. And 1080p will work fine on adventures and other 2D games. But if you desperately want to play games on your television (who the fuck owns a television in the 21st century!?), then just get an Alienware Alpha. Or put a real computer in your closet and attach a stick of chewing gum with wifi to your television, because Steam streaming rocks all ass.

You have an initial outlay once, and then all you do is incrementally upgrade one or two components once every few years. The last time I upgraded my “big” computer was plugging a new graphics card in about 2 years ago, and before that a new CPU about 5 years ago. It still runs all the latest games at their highest settings in 1080p. It’d probably struggle with 4k, but seeing as I haven’t got, nor have any intention to buy, a 4k screen that’s irrelevant to me. “Sitting at a desk to play computer games seems like a weird thing people only did… well, 15 years ago before laptops got gud.” Well, yes if you only play casual games on a tablet or with a controller in your living rooms. Anything beyond that, i.e. requiring a keyboard is pretty damn uncomfortable if you’re not sitting at a desk. And laptops are damn expensive and even then don’t match the performance of a mid-range desktop PC, so unless you’re short on space make no sense at all unless you’re actually going to be travelling with them. “But if you desperately want to play games on your television (who the fuck owns a television in the 21st century!?),” Errr, most people that live in something bigger than a bedsit??

I run Kodi on it, but it’s pretty much useless for games. It’s hobbled by the lack of decrete graphics card. It does have 8 GB RAM, an SSD, and most importantly a gigabit network port though. And this allows me to run Steam In-Home Streaming. Which I’ve been consistently impressed with. Frankly, with a strong enough signal, it’ll run on wifi – I use my HP Stream netbook/mini laptop for this with slower games. OK, it blocks up your gaming PC, but if this isn’t an issue, streaming in general – I think NVIDIA has a similar tech – makes these little machines into genuine gaming systems.

This year’s Super Bowl broadcast could be just what you’re looking for. Thanks to a 360-degree replay technology called “Be the Player,” Fox TV broadcasters will be able to show a play from virtually any spot in the stadium within minutes of the action taking place. The spin around and zoom “freeD” system has been used at other sporting events — including the NBA and baseball All-Star Games and the Olympics — but this will be the first that goes the last step and shows things from the athlete’s perspective . “The difference here is you would be able to go in and see from his vantage point what the player actually saw,” said Zac Fields, a senior vice president for graphic technology and integration at Fox Sports Group. “It’s something that most of us have never been able to see before. The vantage point that most of us have on TV is really different than what the guys see on the field. That’s what the promise of this technology is.” Intel is rolling out the new technology at this year’s Super Bowl, and promoting it in an ad that will feature Brady in his everyday life — waking up, making breakfast, brushing his teeth — with the tagline: “Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic.” As the Patriots quarterback snarfs down a pancake, the camera spins around to a new angle and shows the crumbs falling from his mouth. And, if New England makes it to the Feb. 5 Super Bowl in Houston, there will be even more opportunities to see things from Brady’s perspective. “It’s something that fans have always dreamed about: ‘What did Tom see when he threw that pass?'” Jeff Hopper, the general manager of strategy and marketing for the Intel Sports Group, told The Associated Press in advance of the announcement. “Everyone wants to be the player, to see what it’s like to see it from that point of view.” To make the “Be the Player” video possible, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras in a perimeter inside NRG Stadium, creating what Hopper calls “a volumetric capture of everything that’s going on on the field.” The cameras are connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a special control room, where a half-dozen Intel producers, working with one from the Fox Sports broadcast, can pick out and package the replays that will be used in the broadcast. The massive amount of data — about 1 terabyte per 15-30 second clip — allows producers to position a “virtual camera” anywhere it wants — including, virtually, inside a player’s helmet. (Early versions even toyed with superimposing a facemask on the screen, though that has apparently been dropped.) It will take about two minutes to produce the clips, meaning it’s not yet ready for instant replay but could, for example, be available to show a new view of a touchdown by the time the teams are done with the extra point or kickoff. In an interview in Boston’s Back Bay this week, Hopper said there could be up to 20 “Be the Player” replays, though ultimately it is up to Fox to decide how to use it. “It will depend upon the story you are trying to tell,” Fields said. “It’s not something we’re planning on using because it is a new bell and whistle. It is a storytelling tool, and that’s how we’re planning to utilize it.” Right now, use of the system is limited to big events: It took about a month to retrofit the stadium in Houston with all of the equipment needed for the freeD data capture. Also, each 15-30 clip consists of about 1 terabyte of data. But Hopper said new stadiums are already being built with the cameras in mind. “Anyone who’s building a new stadium now is saying, ‘What do we need to do to make it freeD ready?'” he said. “Because everyone sees it as the future.” Eventually, Hopper said, the technology will not be limited to storytelling. Teams and leagues are hoping to mine the data to improve performance. In the X-Games, Hopper said, the athletes were eager to figure out how high they jumped and use that information to tune their techniques — or just brag about big air with the competition. In time, coaches will be able to use the video to see what their player saw, instead of relying on overhead shots of the field. And, as the turnaround time quickens, the technology would also help replay reviews by giving officials the ability to freeze the action and zoom in at any angle to look, for example, to see whether a player’s knee was down before the ball popped out. “We’re working with pretty much the entire sports world,” Hopper said. “All the leagues, all the teams. I don’t think there’s anyone that we’re not. We can’t do them all, but we’re talking with them all.” And Hopper envisions a sports world where every fan will be able to immerse himself in the game on his phone or a virtual reality headset — not just view the shots curated by a TV producer sitting in a trailer next to the stadium. “That’s good; I think it’s interesting. But the transformative nature of what we’re working on is: Everybody gets to do it themselves,” Hopper said. “Ultimately you’ll be able to be on the field, with the players — the best players in the world — whatever sport that is, whether it be soccer, football or cricket, whatever. You’ll be able to be part of the action. I don’t think you can get any more immersed.” ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Tags: ap, be the player, Fox, nfl, Super Bowl, tom brady Top Videos TUESDAY NEWS IN A RUSH: 10 things in 60 seconds and A-TownTV NewsMinute Police: Beating on video began after friendly encounter — VIDEO CLIPS OF COPS FRIDAY NEWS IN A RUSH: 10 things in 60 seconds and A-TownTV NewsMinute WEDNESDAY NEWS IN A RUSH: 10 things in 60 seconds and A-TownTV NewsMinute WEDNESDAY NEWS IN A RUSH: 10 things in 60 seconds and A-TownTV NewsMinute View more Top Videos Aurora Sentinel Local news, sports & entertainment News Opinion Sports Guide Events Colorado Table Markets & Events Recipes Dining Pure Colorado Sustainable Living Drink American Buffet Aurora Magazine The Lifestyle magazine for the greater Aurora region Home Features Check Please About Us Email Newsletters Daily Headlines Prep Sports FindIt!

Tech Industry by Terry Collins January 12, 2017 6:00 AM PST @terryscollins Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Will fans get to see New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady avoid tackles in 360-degree replays during the Super Bowl LI telecast? Photo by Getty Images Imagine seeing up close how NFL quarterback Tom Brady avoids a linebacker barreling down on him as he throws a game-winning touchdown pass -- or how he scarfs down a pancake. Intel is giving a glimpse of its new 360-degree replay technology called "Be The Player," debuting at this year's Super Bowl LI by featuring Brady in a funny 30-second commercial. The New England Patriots star is seen waking up, brushing his teeth and making breakfast, complete with the tagline: "Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic." And just as the ever-competitive Brady beats his dog to devour a pancake that falls to the floor, the camera spins around to show crumbs falling from his mouth. "This feature is going to be the football fan's ultimate dream," said Jeff Hopper, general manager of strategy for Intel's Sports Group. "It's going to be like if you're right on the field seeing why Brady threw that pass, right from his point of view." That's if Brady's heavily favored New England Patriots can make it all the way to Super Bowl LI in Houston on Feb. 5. The team must first beat the upset-minded Houston Texans in an AFC divisional playoff game on Saturday. "I'm excited for the potential of this incredibly unique 360 replay technology to transform the viewing experience for sports fans," Brady said Thursday in a statement. The 360 replays, which are already used in National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball games, could be the star of the Super Bowl. The replay feature comes as the NFL is trying to boost ratings after last year's big game in the heart of tech-rich Silicon Valley, attracted 112 million viewers, a reported 2 percent dip from the previous two years. Overall, NFL TV ratings are down this season as many fans are turning to streaming games online or simply just watching highlights. To bring "Be the Player" to life, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras inside Houston's NRG Stadium, creating a "volumetric capture," Hopper said. The cameras will be connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a control room where a half-dozen Intel producers will be working with Fox Sports, which is airing the game, to sort out which replays to show. "The magic will start in the control room that will then take fans right onto the field and inside the players' head," said James Carwana, general manager of Intel's Sports Group. Only the biggest plays, expected to be around 20, will get the 360-degree treatment, Carwana added. With each replay using about 1 terabyte of data, it could take up to two minutes to get the replays ready for broadcast. But after testing the technology across 15 stadiums during the NFL regular season, Carwana said he knows it will be worth it.

From glitchy displays to subpar battery performance and eventually receiving a negative recommendation from the Consumer Reviews. Many consumers were asking why Apple even bothered releasing the laptop in the first place. A lot of fans were banking on Apple releasing the MacBook Pro with an Intel Kaby Lake processor. However, due to delays from Intel’s side, Apple was forced to release the laptop with the current Skylake. Now, rumors have it that Apple is gearing up for the MacBook Pro 2017 release as the Kaby Lake processors become available in the market. Intel has finally officially unveiled the seventh generation processor to come out of its foundry. The Kaby Lake was formally introduced during this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES). According to Intel, availability of the new processors will be some time in the first quarter of the year. This announcement led many to believe that Apple is now considering re-releasing the MacBook Pro this year. The MacBook Pro 2017 is said to feature the latest Kaby Lake chip from Intel. Not only that, the laptop is also rumored to get a new display – a much better one – on its release. MacBook Pro 2016 (via apple.com) According to Digitimes, market watcher IHS Markit made it public that Apple will proceed with the indium gallium zinc oxide display panels this year. These metal oxide or IGZO panels are to be used for notebook devices, possibly the MacBook Pro 2017. The report also mentioned that Sharp will be the major supplier of Apple for the said display, with deliveries starting mid-2017. The new MacBook Pro 2017 could benefit from the new display owing to its increased power efficiency. This is due to the inherently high electron mobility of the semiconductor material. This may result in increased display brightness and a much wider color gamut. IGZO displays may pave the way for a much longer performing MacBook Pro 2017. Perhaps with the use of the display technology, Apple may be able to extend battery life by a couple of hours on average. This is highly probable with the combination of the more efficient Kaby Lake processor and the metal oxide display. Although Apple has yet to comment on the MacBook Pro 2017 release, many believe that it will happen some time in September this year.

For the NFL championship game Feb. 5 in Houston, Fox will use technology developed by Intel to produce the “Be the Player” enhancement, a feature that displays a POV perspective from any player on the field without ever having a physical camera attached to the player. (Pictured above is an example of the QB’s view captured at last month’s Foster Farms Bowl matchup between Indiana and Utah.) Intel’s 360 Replay technology synthesizes a player’s view to let plays be recreated in 3D space. For Super Bowl LI, Fox Sports and Intel are using an array of 38 cameras positioned around NRG Stadium to capture the video necessary to generate the POV replays. Each 15-30 second clip, which will take about two minutes each to compile, eats up around 1 terabyte of data. Related Fox Builds Live Commercial Concept for Super Bowl “From the beginning, seeing and breaking down the play from the player’s point of view is the undiscovered country of sports broadcasting,” said Michael Davies, Fox Sports senior VP of field and technical operations. “This broadcast enhancement is like no other — it literally brings the audience down to the viewpoint of the player at the critical decision-making moment.” Fox Sports says it may use up to 20 “Be the Player” replays during the Super Bowl. The broadcaster’s Super Bowl LI production will use three production trucks and more than 30 cameras to deliver more than 20 hours of programming daily from Discovery Green in Houston, in addition to the more than 70 cameras at NRG Stadium covering the game. Intel will air a 30-second ad during Fox’s Super Bowl LI telecast featuring New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to promote the 360 Replay technology. In the spot, “Brady Everyday,” Brady’s boring morning routine — brushing his teeth, eating pancakes — is transformed into epic, highlight-worthy moments with the Intel tech. (Watch the full commercial on YouTube here.) In addition, Intel has teamed with Brady on a promo inviting fans to to create their own frame of the NFL star to add to a user-generated video at experiencemore.intel.com. Intel will post the best images of Brady online and will release the winning video on Super Bowl Sunday. Meanwhile, Fox Sports in November teamed with GoPro to offer the first POV camera perspectives from the hats of referees working the Big Ten Championship Game.

(AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead AMD stock has turnaround potential, but not much else By Ryan Fuhrmann, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 9, 2017, 10:20 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead 10 Best Stocks for Retirement Investors Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead Recent Posts: Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a “Hold” at Best Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is a Zombie, But the Cure Is Coming View All Posts Back in 2011, semiconductor chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NYSE:AMD) generated about $100 million in free cash flow. Since then, it has bled cash. On an earnings basis, AMD stock was also last profitable in 2011. Those are two pretty long dry spells. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Sales also haven’t moved much for the better part of a decade. In addition, Advanced Micro Devices has a fair amount of debt (around $2 billion), and has accumulated $7.3 billion in deficits on the balance sheet. This indicates it hasn’t generated a cumulative positive return for AMD stock owners since it was founded in 1969. The profit outlook for Advanced Micro Devices is pretty grim. Analysts are projecting a loss of 23 cents per share for the company’s full year (AMD reports its fourth quarter on Jan. 17). But 2017 could see a return to profitability, as analysts expect 6 cents in earnings for the year. A recent investor presentation on AMD’s website does tout that the company is a leader in “visual” computing that includes gaming, artificial intelligence and virtual/augmented reality. It is a claim-to-fame that resembles why rival Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is popular among investors right now. I recently covered why Nvidia’s stock has been on fire. NVDA also sells chips that power the gaming and AI space, but also data centers. The greatest hype surrounds its autonomous car initiative, including the Nvidia Drive PX 2 in Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) autos. 10 of the Worst Values on Wall Street The upside for AMD is that it also operates in growing areas of the market. It has sold chips to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) for its Xbox and Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) for its PlayStation, but is well behind Nvidia in gaming. Advanced Micro Devices Lags Intel Badly Advanced Micro Devices says it is also a “strong No.2 in computing”, but has struggled for years to successfully compete against industry titan Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel is expected to report sales of around $59 billion this year. AMD stock will log just over $4 billion in sales, making it about 7% the size of Intel. Advanced Micro Devices has lagged Intel for years now. The race was much closer around 2000, but Intel has moved forward and AMD stock has not. Obviously, Intel is much larger and can easily outspend Advanced Micro Devices in research and development. Last year, Intel invested $12.1 billion in R&D, qualifying it as one of the largest spenders on R&D in the world. AMD spent less than $1 billion, and its annual R&D spend has fallen in recent years. Advanced Micro Devices is said to be at least a couple of years behind Intel in terms of technology.  AMD is just rolling out 14-nanometer chips while Intel has had the technology for a couple of years now. Advanced Micro Devices also doesn’t have the strength to produce its own chips any longer. Instead, it has to pay outside parties to do so, which increases costs. The market share differential says it all. Intel’s computing market share is nearly 88%, while AMD’s is only 12%. Intel has also been increasing its share recently.

Intel Think an NFL star's morning routine is boring? Well, it kind of is, but not when viewed through Intel's 360-degree replay technology. That's the story the tech brand is telling in its Super Bowl spot from mcgarrybowen starring New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. In the 30-second ad, "Brady Everyday," the four-time Super Bowl champ brushes his teeth and whips up a batch of pancakes, but Intel's replay technology, which will be featured in Fox's broadcast of the Big Game, turns these tasks into epic moments. "People typically show the athlete in the uniform and on the field," said Steve Fund, svp and CMO at Intel. "We wanted to do something different. We're making these everyday things look heroic and interesting because that's what our technology does. The idea is, if we can make him look epic brushing his teeth, wait until you see how we can use the technology in the game." Intel has its fingers crossed that the Patriots and Brady will appear in the Super Bowl, as they're currently favored to do. "If he's playing in the game, that would be awesome," Fund said. "We wanted to get the biggest name in the game, and someone who symbolizes performance and what our brand stands for." People can also visit a website to design their own videos featuring frames of Brady throwing a football to be aggregated into an online gallery and video compilation released on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 5. Last year, Intel integrated its replay technology into the Super Bowl broadcast and ran an ad just prior to kickoff. This year's spot will run during the game. The brand recently teamed up with another sports icon, Michael Phelps, who appeared in ads hot off his incredible performance at the Summer Olympics. "Our association with sports allows us to connect performance with Intel," Fund said. "We're trying to get people to think differently about Intel. It's still thought of as a PC microprocessor company, and we're trying to change perceptions through efforts like this."

Tech Industry by Terry Collins January 12, 2017 6:00 AM PST @terryscollins Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Will fans get to see New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady avoid tackles in 360-degree replays during the Super Bowl LI telecast? Photo by Getty Images Imagine seeing up close how NFL quarterback Tom Brady avoids a linebacker barreling down on him as he throws a game-winning touchdown pass -- or how he scarfs down a pancake. Intel is giving a glimpse of its new 360-degree replay technology called "Be The Player," debuting at this year's Super Bowl LI by featuring Brady in a funny 30-second commercial. The New England Patriots star is seen waking up, brushing his teeth and making breakfast, complete with the tagline: "Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic." And just as the ever-competitive Brady beats his dog to devour a pancake that falls to the floor, the camera spins around to show crumbs falling from his mouth. "This feature is going to be the football fan's ultimate dream," said Jeff Hopper, general manager of strategy for Intel's Sports Group. "It's going to be like if you're right on the field seeing why Brady threw that pass, right from his point of view." That's if Brady's heavily favored New England Patriots can make it all the way to Super Bowl LI in Houston on Feb. 5. The team must first beat the upset-minded Houston Texans in an AFC divisional playoff game on Saturday. "I'm excited for the potential of this incredibly unique 360 replay technology to transform the viewing experience for sports fans," Brady said Thursday in a statement. The 360 replays, which are already used in National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball games, could be the star of the Super Bowl. The replay feature comes as the NFL is trying to boost ratings after last year's big game in the heart of tech-rich Silicon Valley, attracted 112 million viewers, a reported 2 percent dip from the previous two years. Overall, NFL TV ratings are down this season as many fans are turning to streaming games online or simply just watching highlights. To bring "Be the Player" to life, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras inside Houston's NRG Stadium, creating a "volumetric capture," Hopper said. The cameras will be connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a control room where a half-dozen Intel producers will be working with Fox Sports, which is airing the game, to sort out which replays to show. "The magic will start in the control room that will then take fans right onto the field and inside the players' head," said James Carwana, general manager of Intel's Sports Group. Only the biggest plays, expected to be around 20, will get the 360-degree treatment, Carwana added. With each replay using about 1 terabyte of data, it could take up to two minutes to get the replays ready for broadcast. But after testing the technology across 15 stadiums during the NFL regular season, Carwana said he knows it will be worth it.

(Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images) Print Email Joe Giglio | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Joe Giglio | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 12, 2017 at 9:00 AM, updated January 13, 2017 at 3:37 PM comments It's the most wonderful time of the year, NFL fans. With Wild Card weekend in the books, the 12-team tournament to crown a Super Bowl champion has been whittled down to eight--giving us the best weekend of football all year: Saturday Seattle Seahawks at Atlanta Falcons, 4:35 p.m. Eastern, FOX Houston Texans at New England Patriots, 8:15 p.m. Eastern, CBS Sunday Pittsburgh Steelers at Kansas City Chiefs, 8:20 p.m. Eastern, NBC Green Bay Packers at Dallas Cowboys, 4:40 p.m. Eastern, FOX Throughout every week of the regular season, NJ Advance Media's football experts made picks vs. the spread for every single game. We'll continue that through the postseason. Have you ever wanted to know what Tom Brady sees as he stares down a pass rush, scans the field for an open receiver ... or brushes his teeth in the morning? This year's Super Bowl broadcast could be just what you're looking for. Thanks to a 360-degree replay technology called "Be the Player," Fox TV broadcasters will be able to show a play from virtually any spot in the stadium within minutes of the action taking place. The spin around and zoom "freeD" system has been used at other sporting events - including the NBA and baseball All-Star Games and the Olympics - but this will be the first that goes the last step and shows things from the athlete's perspective . "The difference here is you would be able to go in and see from his vantage point what the player actually saw," said Zac Fields, a senior vice president for graphic technology and integration at Fox Sports Group. "It's something that most of us have never been able to see before. The vantage point that most of us have on TV is really different than what the guys see on the field. That's what the promise of this technology is." Mock Draft Intel is rolling out the new technology at this year's Super Bowl, and promoting it in an ad that will feature Brady in his everyday life - waking up, making breakfast, brushing his teeth - with the tagline: "Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic." As the Patriots quarterback snarfs down a pancake, the camera spins around to a new angle and shows the crumbs falling from his mouth. And, if New England makes it to the Feb. 5 Super Bowl in Houston, there will be even more opportunities to see things from Brady's perspective. "It's something that fans have always dreamed about: 'What did Tom see when he threw that pass?'" Jeff Hopper, the general manager of strategy and marketing for the Intel Sports Group, told The Associated Press in advance of the announcement. "Everyone wants to be the player, to see what it's like to see it from that point of view." To make the "Be the Player" video possible, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras in a perimeter inside NRG Stadium, creating what Hopper calls "a volumetric capture of everything that's going on on the field." The cameras are connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a special control room, where a half-dozen Intel producers, working with one from the Fox Sports broadcast, can pick out and package the replays that will be used in the broadcast. The massive amount of data - about 1 terabyte per 15-30 second clip - allows producers to position a "virtual camera" anywhere it wants - including, virtually, inside a player's helmet. (Early versions even toyed with superimposing a facemask on the screen, though that has apparently been dropped.) It will take about two minutes to produce the clips, meaning it's not yet ready for instant replay but could, for example, be available to show a new view of a touchdown by the time the teams are done with the extra point or kickoff. Giants JPP: 'I'm not signing a one-year deal' In an interview in Boston's Back Bay this week, Hopper said there could be up to 20 "Be the Player" replays, though ultimately it is up to Fox to decide how to use it. "It will depend upon the story you are trying to tell," Fields said. "It's not something we're planning on using because it is a new bell and whistle. It is a storytelling tool, and that's how we're planning to utilize it." Right now, use of the system is limited to big events: It took about a month to retrofit the stadium in Houston with all of the equipment needed for the freeD data capture. Also, each 15-30 clip consists of about 1 terabyte of data. But Hopper said new stadiums are already being built with the cameras in mind. "Anyone who's building a new stadium now is saying, 'What do we need to do to make it freeD ready?'" he said. "Because everyone sees it as the future." Eventually, Hopper said, the technology will not be limited to storytelling. Teams and leagues are hoping to mine the data to improve performance. In the X-Games, Hopper said, the athletes were eager to figure out how high they jumped and use that information to tune their techniques - or just brag about big air with the competition. In time, coaches will be able to use the video to see what their player saw, instead of relying on overhead shots of the field. And, as the turnaround time quickens, the technology would also help replay reviews by giving officials the ability to freeze the action and zoom in at any angle to look, for example, to see whether a player's knee was down before the ball popped out. "We're working with pretty much the entire sports world," Hopper said. "All the leagues, all the teams. I don't think there's anyone that we're not. We can't do them all, but we're talking with them all." And Hopper envisions a sports world where every fan will be able to immerse himself in the game on his phone or a virtual reality headset - not just view the shots curated by a TV producer sitting in a trailer next to the stadium. "That's good; I think it's interesting. But the transformative nature of what we're working on is: Everybody gets to do it themselves," Hopper said. "Ultimately you'll be able to be on the field, with the players - the best players in the world - whatever sport that is, whether it be soccer, football or cricket, whatever. You'll be able to be part of the action. I don't think you can get any more immersed." (The Associated Press contributed to this report.) Joe Giglio may be reached at jgiglio@njadvancemedia.com.

Show More When Microsoft held an event last October, everyone thought it was prepping to announce the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 or Surface Book 2. Instead, we got the new Surface Studio, Windows Creative Update and a beefed-up Surface Book i7 with Performance Base. The Performance Base addition brought a redesigned keyboard base to the device, while the tablet display remained the same. With the hope of swaying creative professionals away from Apple, these internal updates include an NVIDIA GPU, a 6th generation Intel Core i7 processor and a 1TB hard drive. I've used the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base regularly for the last month, and there's a lot that I love about the it. Even though it's a device targeted at creative professionals, it's a notebook that will suit anyone that values performance. Unmatched performance This should come as no surprise, but the performance on the updated Surface Book i7 has been consistently impressive. But when I talk about performance, it's important to remember that I'm not an artist, a 3D video editor or even a heavy gamer. Pushing the limits of my notebooks typically means I'm 100 tabs deep in Google Chrome or I'm rehashing my youth by playing The Sims 4. But the Surface Book happily encourages my pathological level of browser tabs without a single complaint. And light gaming was more enjoyable; everything ran faster and smoother than on my HP Spectre x360, which houses a 6th gen Intel i7 processor and integrated graphics. I wouldn't say it's worth spending over $3,000 on a notebook just to browse the internet with wild abandon and occasionally play The Sims 4 on the highest settings, but I can say my experience with the Surface Book this past month has truly spoiled me. If you need that level of performance, the Surface Book i7 is a strong contender and offers best performance you can get in this class of 13-inch notebooks. And, when you consider what it packs under the hood, it's incredibly thin and lightweight. [ Related story: Macbook Pro vs Surface Book i7 ] Portability While Surface Book i7 with Performance Base is a compact device for the performance it delivers, compared to other, less powerful 13-inch notebooks, it is kind of a beast. The display is a bit taller than your average 13-inch display, and with the dual cooling fans to support the improved GPU, it's slightly thicker and heavier than even the original Surface Book. And since I'm not someone who realistically needs that level of performance daily, I'd be more apt to grab the Surface Pro 4 if I'm travelling. The size and form factor are what would prevent the Surface Book from replacing my need for another device. But that's because my average workday consists of a steady Wi-Fi connection, the Microsoft Suite, Slack and, on rare occasion, Adobe Photoshop Elements. For me, carrying this updated Surface Book i7 on a work trip would feel excessive. I just don't need that level of performance on an average day and it would be too expensive to replace if stolen or damaged. If I needed to use 3D software or other high-powered design and editing software as part of my job, I I would be excited to travel with the Surface Book. It's certainly light and compact for someone who needs that level of performance, but for the average business user, or at least in my case, the Surface Pro 4 offers more than enough in a smaller package. [ Related story: 10 most popular hybrid tablet stories of 2016 ] It's not a tablet There's always a caveat to hybrid devices; they promise you both a tablet and notebook experience, but the truth is that they always fit more into one category. With its built-in trackpad and full Windows 10 OS, the Surface Pro 4 feels more like a notebook, while the iPad Pro, running iOS 10 and lacking a track pad, feels more like a tablet. They each fit different needs -- some people need a notebook more often than a tablet and vice versa. While the iPad Pro and Surface Pro 4 share more overlap in each category, the Surface Book is almost entirely a notebook that happens to have a detachable display. Without the keyboard dock, the tablet feels cumbersome and, since it lacks the kickstand on the Surface Pro 4, you can't just prop it up. Personally, I haven't found a need to use the Surface Book display as a tablet, and the same goes for my HP Spectre x360. I rarely find myself using either device in tablet mode, but I do frequently interact with the touch displays. I can see how if you were an artist, designer or worked in the field, the detachable display might be a bonus when combined with the Surface Pen. But for my personal needs, I'd be more inclined to reach for my iPad Air 2 or Surface Pro 4 before the Surface Book display. The little things There are so many minimal, thoughtful features that stand out on the Surface Book. The design is unique -- and love or hate the hinge, it's still a sleek device. Most of all, I appreciate that Microsoft nods to the industrial-chic design popularized by Apple without mimicking it the way other manufacturers have. Beyond the overall design, I also can't say enough good things about the Surface Book keyboard -- an often-overlooked feature on notebooks. It has the perfect key travel and the chiclet keys are spaced out just enough to make it comfortable to type. The Surface Book's trackpad offers just the right amount of responsiveness, especially compared to the hyper-sensitive trackpad on my HP Spectre x360. Battery life on the device is also unmatched -- thanks to the second battery. You can easily get through the day on one charge with light use. With heavier use, or if you're using battery draining peripherals like a wireless mouse, you can still get a solid six to eight hours before looking for an outlet. Buy now or wait it out? With so many hybrid rumors on the horizon for 2017, I can't help but wonder if the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base is just a taste of what we might see in the purported Surface Book 2. The updates in this case were purely internal and focused on packing in as much performance as possible. In the near future, there's the potential for 7th-generation Kaby Lake Processors and possibly even more graphics cards to choose from. Right now, the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base is so close to being the do-it-all notebook that can handle your work, editing, entertainment and gaming needs. But, considering the cost of this device at just over $3,000, I would say it's worth waiting to see what Microsoft has in store for the next Surface Book update. It reminds me of when the first Microsoft Surface was released -- the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base feels more like a taste of what's to come.

Here’s everything we know about the iMac 2017 UK release date, price and specification rumours. With Intel's new Kaby Lake processor announcements at CES 2017, new iMacs surely must be coming soon By Marie Brewis | 12 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Intel has announced Kaby Lake processors that we will likely see in Apple iMacs, but how long will we have to wait? A new iMac is hotly tipped for March 2017. Here’s everything we know about the iMac 2017 UK release date, price and specification rumours.  Also see: New MacBook Pro  iMac 2017 UK release date rumours: When is the iMac Pro coming out? New iMac UK release date: March 2017 (TBC)  Apple held a special event on 27 October in which it was expected to unveil new Macs. Chief among those Macs, following a Best Buy slip up that saw a Kaby Lake-powered iMac listed for sale, was a new iMac family. This didn't happen, but we're still fairly confident new iMacs are coming soon - with the next possible launch date March 2017. A Q1 2017 release date is all the more likely following Intel's Kaby Lake processor announcements at January's CES. We'd expect to see the S-Series desktop chips (7500/7600/7700K) in the 27in iMac, although there is no clear upgrade path for the 21.5in iMac - we'll just have to wait and see. Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated on an internal Q&A session that, "Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." iMac 2017 UK price rumours: How much is the iMac Pro?  According to Best Buy, if accurate, a 27in iMac with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive will cost $3,199.99. This appears to be slightly higher than the current 27in iMac with 32GB RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive, though of course we don’t know exactly what other upgrades this model includes (and whether or not it is merely placeholder text).  Over in the UK the current 21.5in iMac starts at £899 or £1,199 with a 4K display, while the 27in 5K model starts at £1,449, both direct from Apple. We would expect prices to remain roughly the same.  iMac 2017 specification rumours: Is the iMac Pro any good?  Following that Best Buy leak, it’s highly likely the new iMac will feature a processor upgrade to Intel’s latest Kaby Lake family. The listing also mentioned a 27in 5K display, 32GB of memory and a 2TB Fusion Drive, with the model priced at $3,199.99. It could be placeholder copy, but why bother to update the processor? We’d really like to see this Fusion Drive rolled out as standard across the range.  Apple could well turn to AMD once again for its graphics solution, with Polaris 10 a prime candidate. It offers improved graphics performance (naturally), plus potential reductions in power consumption and waste heat. More exciting, though, is that these new graphics chips would for the first time bring VR potential to the Mac.  We’ve seen Apple bring the Pro name to its iPad line-up over the past year, and we’re anticipating that the iPad mini will also get a Pro makeover next week. One rumours circulating online is that the iMac will also get Pro treatment, and we could be about to see a sufficiently powerful iMac Pro to replace the Mac Pro.  Content continues below For more new iMac rumours see our sister site Macworld.

After quietly unveiling some of the lower powered U-series 7th Generation Kaby Lake processors in September, Intel this week rolled out the full line of dozens of Linux-friendly Kaby Lake processors at the CES show in Las Vegas. The product line includes dual-core Y-series parts for 2-and-1s and compute sticks that run at a low 4.5W TDP, as well as more dual-core U-series models with 15W and 28W TDPs. The previously revealed U-series chips re already being tapped by Congatec’s Conga TC175 and MSC’s MSC C6C-KLU COM Express Compact modules. Intel chart showing 7th Gen family (left) and U-series processor (click images to enlarge) Intel also unveiled a new range of mostly quad-core H-series mobile Core and Xeon E3 CPUs with 35W and 45W TDPs. Rounding out the launch are 16 quad- and dual-core S-series desktop-class models with TDPs ranging between 35W and 91W. As part of the announcement, Intel teased a new Kaby Lake ready Intel Compute Card form factor that partially updates the Intel Compute Stick. In addition, Intel announced four NUC mini-PCs featuring dual-core, U-series Kaby Lake processors, one of which — the Intel NUC Kit NUC7i7BNH — represents a new hardware design and is available for presale. Intel 7th Gen Kaby Lake SKUs: Y-, U-, and H-series (left) and S-series Source: Intel via AnandTech (click images to enlarge) Intel’s Kaby Lake roll-out was only one of many other announcements at CES. These included new virtual reality collaborations, the Intel 5G Modem, and plans to acquire 15 percent ownership of the HERE location technology firm. Intel jumped further into automotive by unveiling its Intel GO technology for autonomous driving, as well as a related collaboration with BMW Group and Mobileye that aims to deliver self-driving cars by 2021. The companies plan to develop an “open platform for autonomous driving.” Intel’s soft pedaling of its flagship processors is not surprising given several independent benchmarks that show only slightly greater CPU and GPU performance than the 6th Gen Skylake, with modest improvements in power efficiency and other functionality. This was more or less expected given that the 7th Generation is the third generation of processors using Intel’s 14nm process, albeit slightly improved to a “14nm+” process. So while Kaby Lake is highly optimized compared to the 5th Gen, 14nm Broadwell, it’s not much of an improvement over Skylake. Profile view of 4.5W Kaby Lake Y-Series CPU (click image to enlarge) Although Kaby Lake did “squeeze an extra 8-10% out of Skylake in equivalent power envelopes,” according to ExtremeTech, the publication questioned whether it might be “time for a new x86 architecture.” Ars Technica found the new Kaby Lake desktop models, such as the Intel Core i7-7700K, to be a “disappointment,” leading to the rhetorical question: “Is the desktop CPU dead?” The publication did like the fact that some of the 15W U-series processors add Intel Iris Plus graphics, which “promise as much as a 65 percent performance boost over older Intel HD graphics.” The publication also praised the new 45W H-series chips for enabling overclocking. AnandTech took the deepest dive, and was somewhat less critical, while still concluding “For the most part, Kaby Lake doesn’t do much new.” Most of the improvements came in power efficiency. “What used to get you 3.0 GHz last year now gets you 3.3 GHz, which means saving time doing work or saving money burning less power,” says the story. AnandTech also looked into features like the speedy new Intel Optane caching memory and SSD technology supported by Kaby Lake, as well as the improved 10-bit video decoding. The story examined the subset of U-, Y-, H-, and S-series chips imbued with vPro security technology, as well as the expanded use of overclocking, especially in regard to the Core i3-7350K, Intel’s first ever unlocked Core i3. If the response to Kaby Lake was muted, it is perhaps because of the greater improvements announced at CES with two other major processors. First, there’s AMD’s Ryzen family of high-end, x86-based gaming processors, including an 8-core, 16-thread model. Let the overclocking begin. Receiving even more attention is Qualcomm’s 10nm fabricated, ARM-based Snapdragon 835, which is 35 percent smaller and claimed to use 25 percent less power than the Snapdragon 820. The octa-core SoC runs half of its Kryo 280 cores at 2.45GHz, and the other half at 1.8GHz. The Snapdragon 835 features an Adreno 540 GPU with up to 25 percent improved rendering, as well as a new Hexagon 682 DSP. The SoC provides support for low-power LPDRR4X RAM, Category 16 LTE, 802.11ad WiFi, and Bluetooth 5.0. Benchmarks will await shipments due this spring.   Further information Intel’s 7th Gen Core “Kaby Lake” processors appear to be shipping now. More information may be found in Intel’s 7th Gen Intel Core briefing and in-depth fact sheet.   Related posts: Intel NUC mini-PCs set sail on Kaby Lake COM Express modules build on Intel's Kaby Lake Intel ditching tick-tock, shifting to three-stage CPU… Intel's Kaby Lake arrives on COM Express Compact at up… Intel Compute Card standard to turbocharge CE devices Kaby Lake board lineup includes a Mini-ITX SBC and two COMs Intel reveals Broxton Atoms with Gen9 GPUs Tough Skylake box PC has four GbE and eight USB ports 10-core MediaTek Helio X30 SoC to include two Cortex-A73… "Apollo Lake" Atoms to offer graphics-rich… (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Here is the Fora team’s guide to the most promising firms to keep an eye out for in 2017: 1. Arklu The year gone by was a successful one for the Donegal-based toymaker. In July it was announced as the winner of Google’s latest Adopt a Startup program for Ireland and it also signed a publishing deal with children’s books giant Penguin in mid-October, with the first books set to be launched in May 2017. Nuritas 28 Source: Sebastiaan ter Burg Some interesting names have put their money behind the biotech startup, which is isolating active ingredients in food that can help improve human health. Billionaire Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, Bono, and The Edge have all dipped into their pockets to fund the company, founded by Nora Khaldi, and the young firm has already discovered a peptide that has the capacity to kill the bacterial infection known as MRSA. Deposify 28 Source: Deposify This fintech startup likes to think of itself as ‘PayPal for deposits’. Earlier this year it raised over a million euro in venture capital funding and also signed a deal with Irish property management startup Property Button, which has the potential to bag Deposify nearly €3 million a year in revenue. In 2017, the payments company’s service will be used in roughly 50,000 deposit transactions in the UK and Ireland, which together are worth up to €100 million. Movidius 28 Movidius founders Sean Mitchell (left) and David Moloney. Source: Maxwell Photography One of the bigger success stories from last year, the chip designer made the news when it was confirmed the company was going to be purchased by Intel in a deal worth at least €300 million. Intel said that the Irish company will help speed up its work in emerging technology markets, such as artificial intelligence and Internet of Things. Intercom 28 Source: Intercom The four Irishmen behind customer service startup Intercom saw their company hit new heights in 2016. After completing a series C round of $50 million in funding, total investment in the startup now stands at $115 million. It is thought to be closing in on so-called unicorn status – a venture capital-backed startup priced at $1 billion or more. The company also opened a new Chicago office and ran a series of events, called ‘Inside Intercom’ across the world to showcase its tech products. Chopped 28 Source: Shane O’Neill Photography Healthy fast-food chain Chopped had a busy year opening more outlets across Dublin, while also spreading its wings outside the capital by opening in Newbridge, County Kildare. The company’s co-founder Brian Lee told Fora earlier in the year it is now eyeing up an expansion to the UK in 2017. Wyldsson 28 Source: Joe Keogh Photography This food startup achieved what many before it have failed to do – it ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund a new product line. It actually reached its funding goal twice over, surpassing its €5,000 target to wind up with just over the €10,000 mark. Teamwork 28 Source: Gerard McCarthy The Cork software firm made a lot of noise in 2016 by opening a new office (complete with slide), launching an incubator for SaaS startups and announcing plans to hire 50 new staff to fill up the new space. The company is also hiring for a senior software engineer out in Sofia, Bulgaria, which hints that further expansion at the company’s operations could lie overseas. XSellco 28 Source: Xsellco The e-commerce software firm XSellco, which was founded by Hostelworld founder Ray Nolan, poached two senior employees from Irish travel startup Boxever and media company Storyful during the past year. The startup has also grown its headcount from 6 to 40 employees since 2015. Cohort 28 Next year looks like it could be a big one for Cohort, the latest company being cooked up by serial tech entrepreneur Eamon Leonard. According to his Twitter feed, the company, which is developing an app to help people make better use of their network, reached a funding milestone recently, which means it’s likely that a full version of the app could be released before long. BHSL 28 Source: BHSL Founded by Jack O’Connor, a poultry farmer-turned-entrepreneur, BHSL has developed technology that turns chicken manure into a source of fuel and heating for farms. The company recently announced that it completed €13 million in UK sales this year and appointed ex-Kerry Group chief executive Denis Brosnan as chairman, with O’Connor telling Fora it will be hunting for €7 million in funding to help boost its global sales in 2017. Digit Game Studios 28 Source: David Donoghue It has been a quiet year for Digit Games Studios on the announcements front, but the games developers that produced the popular Kings of the Realm app-based game have been busy working on a new Hollywood-based title that is set to be released in 2017. Voxpro 28 Source: Voxpro Since Cork-based Voxpro switched tack from being a paging company to operating specialized call centers for international clients a few years back, it has been on a huge expansion drive – and it kept growing fast in 2016. The firm announced in November that it is planning to hire over 2,000 people during the next 12 to 18 months, which will take its workforce to 3,000 globally. Voxpro is also one of the few Irish companies to have developed a major presence in the US, and with its hiring drive that looks set to swell. Carrick Therapeutics 28 Source: Carrick Therapeutics This firm was one of the biggest surprise packages of last year. Virtually nothing was known about Dublin-based Carrick Therapeutics when it made the huge announcement that it had raised a whopping $95 million to fund cancer research. The company has some serious backers behind it including Woodford Investment Management, led by Neil Woodford, regarded as one of the UK’s best fund managers. The company is now getting to work on treatments for colon and breast cancer, and will hopefully make some more noise in 2017. Inflazome 28 Source: Nick Bradshaw While it might not sound quite as impressive next to Carrick’s $95 million, the €15 million raised by Irish health startup Inflazome is not to be sneezed at. The company is looking to develop treatments for chronic inflammatory diseases and has one of Ireland’s brightest scientists, Trinity College professor Luke O’Neill, on board. O’Neill told us during the year that he is hopeful of selling the company at some point, so one to keep an eye on. GP Wood 28 Source: GP Wood It might not garner the attention like the next hot tech startup, but 2017 could be a big year for Cork timber processor GP Wood. The low-key company is one of the most successful in its area and has just sunk €14 million into a major sawmill upgrade. GP Wood is looking to top its pre-recession heights in 2017, and if all goes well it will double in size in the coming years, which would cement its position as one of Ireland’s biggest manufacturers. Providence Resources 28 Source: Finbarr O’Rourke 2016 was a poxy year for Providence and for most Irish resource-exploration companies. Like the rest of the industry, the Dublin-based firm was struggling with low oil prices and had to suspend its shares at one point as it grappled with its debts. However, the firm managed to raise €66 million by selling shares in what was essentially a company-saving exercise. Providence recently struck a deal to drill off the coast of Ireland in the hope of making a major oil find – and while commercial oil projects in Ireland are currently non-existent, this looks like as good a prospect as there is out there. Cartoon Saloon 28 Angelina Jolie is backing Cartoon Saloon Source: AP/Press Association Images. Irish animation has been booming lately, and Cartoon Saloon has been one of the companies leading the charge. It has already produced critically acclaimed and Oscar-nominated movies in the form of Song of the Sea and the Secret of Kells. We’re expecting big things and a big fuss when the next feature film it’s working on, the Breadwinner, which is being backed by Hollywood A-list actress Angelina Jolie, premieres in September. Rubicoin 28 Source: Rubicoin The fintech startup, founded by Emmet Savage and John Tyrrell, wants to turn legions of average Joes into savvy stockholders, and it raised €1.2 million in 2016 with a hit list of five international markets to target. Valitacell 28 Source: YouTube Early-stage Dublin medtech startup Valitacell, which produces a kit that speeds up the process for making biological drugs, is gearing up to trial its product with two of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. Towards the end of 2016, the company also took home the overall prize in InterTradeIreland’s annual Seedcorn competition, giving it a significant publicity boost coming into the new year. Showtime Analytics 28 Source: Akai-Cas At the end of last year, the startup that provides data analytics services to the cinema industry made the headlines when it netted €1.2 million from Alibaba Pictures, a group associated with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The deal gives Showtime Analytics a foothold in the growing Chinese cinema sector, which has been tipped to soon overtake the US as the world’s largest movie market. Wicklow Wolf 28 Source: Philip Leonard The Wicklow-based craft brewer has plans to bring its popular line of beers international in 2017 after it received a €2 million round of investment in October. The company will also be increasing its production 15-fold in the coming year to keep up with demand from domestic and foreign markets. Version 1 28 Source: Maxwell Photography Last year, Version 1 completed two acquisitions, bringing the total number of companies it has acquired to seven since it was founded in 1996. The company also took part in the Irish Stock Exchanges IPO-Ready program, which hints at the possibility of a public listing sometime in the future. The firm’s co-founder, Justin Keatinge, earlier this year told Fora the business was aiming for €1 billion in turnover within 10 years. Genomics Medicine Ireland 28 Source: Conor McCabe Photography Ltd This Irish healthcare startup is partly bankrolled by Starbucks’ head honcho Howard Schultz and, although it was only founded in 2015, it raised a $40 million series A round last year. The company is researching the genetic causes of conditions such as Alzheimer’s and multiple sclerosis and will soon announce its first collaboration with an Irish hospital. Teckro 28 Source: Teckro This startup had been operating under the radar for a while before shooting to prominence last year when it raised $6 million from Founders Fund, the same venture capital fund to back Facebook, SpaceX, and Airbnb. The Limerick-based company is using the funding to build its product-development team. Beautifi 28 Source: Beautifi Dubbed the JustEat of Irish salon bookings, Beutifi made a splash last year when it bought one of its biggest rivals, SalonAddicts, as part of an aggressive move into the UK. The company, which first launched in mid-2014, stated the sale would allow it to grow revenues from €2 million to €10 million by the end of 2016. Brown Bag Films 28 Source: YouTube The Oscar-nominated Irish film studio went on a major hiring drive after it opened its new flagship studio in Smithfield. The company already has a studio in Manchester and an office in Los Angeles, and numbers at the Irish base are set to swell to 255. The growth in staff numbers will help the company take on further production contracts, like the one it signed to create children’s television show Gilbert and Allie. UrbanVolt 28 Source: Naoise Culhane This startup, which installs energy-efficient lights for businesses free of charge and splits the money from the energy savings, signed some big deals in 2016. UrbanVolt only started trading in April, but it has already received backing from Irish rugby international and investor Jamie Heaslip, while during 2016 it signed a €30 million funding deal with Swiss sustainable energy private equity firm Susi Partners.

Print Email Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com By Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on January 12, 2017 at 6:10 AM, updated January 13, 2017 at 4:22 PM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- In a statement released Wednesday evening, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper essentially confirmed the CNN report that Donald Trump, Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer had derided as "fake news." CNN had reported that President-elect Trump's last security briefing had included a two-page summary of a 35 page dossier making unverified claims that Russia had compromising financial and personal information on Trump.  CNN never reported details of what the accusations were because the claims were unverified.   Hours after the CNN report was published, BuzzFeed published the entire 35 page dossier that had been compiled by a credible former MI6  agent who had spent his career working in Russia as a British spy. After Trump accused the Intelligence community of leaking news of the Intel briefing, Clapper released a statement Wednesday saying he had the opportunity to speak with Trump again that evening, "to discuss recent media reports about out briefing last Friday." Clapper said he expressed to Trump "profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press."  He said he told Trump he does not believe  the leaks came from within the Intelligence community.    Referring to the two-page summary in the Friday Intel briefing, Clapper said, "part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security." The Washington Post has also reported that a two-page summary of the allegations was included in Trump's Friday Intel briefing.   "A U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the nature of the summary "was fully explained" to Trump on Friday and "put into context," reported the Post. According to the Post, Clapper, FBI director James Comey, CIA director John Brennan and NSA director Mike Rogers, all had agreed that the summary needed to be included in the briefing to Obama and Trump on the results of the investigation into Russian hacking.    The group felt they had no choice but to make Obama and Trump aware of the information because the dossier had already been circulated in recent months among the media and members of Congress, "even before the IC became aware of it," Clapper said in his statement.   They feared the dossier would be published in the press before Obama and Trump were made aware of it, and the Intel agencies would look negligent and uninformed. Trump himself confirmed the CNN report when he blasted the IC accusing them of leaking what was discussed in the Friday briefing.  In his press conference he said the only people in his office who even knew the briefing took place would not have said anything. The statement from Clapper and Trump, and the Washington Post story mean that Kellyanne Conway was really the one reporting fake news when she said on  Seth Meyers' show that Trump was never briefed on the allegations.   She continued to spread fake news when she later claimed in an interview with Anderson Cooper that Trump never was briefed on the dossier.  Trump's press secretary Sean Spicer also spread fake news when he conflated what CNN had reported with what BuzzFeed published. Trump spread fake news again when he labeled CNN "fake news" and praised other news organizations.   The New York Times reported the same story CNN did, but the Times went into more descriptive detail in summarizing the allegations than even CNN did.    Trump's ticked at CNN because they broke the story that he was given the two-page summary, not because what they reported was fake, because it wasn't. The question is who in the U.S. government leaked to the press that the two-page summary was in the brief, and why did they leak it?    Clapper asserted to Trump that he doesn't believe the IC leaked it.    But who else could have known about the summary besides the CIA, FBI and the NSA? Did someone in the IC leak it as payback for Trump denigrating the IC?    Was it leaked to send a message to the press that it's a legit story that should be given more attention.     Clapper in his statement said he emphasized to Trump that the dossier "is not a U.S. Intelligence Community  product." He adds, "the IC has not made any judgement that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely on upon it in anyway for our conclusions"   Which makes it all the more unusual that the IC still felt they needed to brief Obama and Trump on the information. In reading part of the 35 page dossier, what struck me was how in sync some of the allegations were with Trump's comments on Putin and Russia on the campaign trail and since his election.   The allegations also line up with Paul Manafort's involvement in the Trump campaign and his sudden departure. Trump's press conference wasn't a press conference.   It was Trumptantrum in which the father of fake news declared war on real journalism after he spent eight years spreading his bogus Obama birther story. While Trump has routinely attacked the U.S. free press, the U.S. Intelligence agencies and war heroes like John McCain, he's never said a negative thing about former KGB officer Vladimir Putin.   If you haven't wondered why, you should start to if you care about the integrity of the office of the presidency.

There were important announcements from two of the most established chip suppliers in the auto sector, NXP and Nvidia – the former particularly closely watched because it will soon be part of Qualcomm. Its launches reminded the industry how strategic an acquisition it will be, bringing significant depth and breadth to its new parent’s auto offering, surrounding the core Snapdragon modem/processor with many other car-related chips, and adding valuable connections with the car industry and its channels. NXP adds to Qualcomm’s dowry The main CES launch by NXP was a software defined radio (SDR) solution for IVI systems called the SAF4000. This claims to be the world’s first one-chip system covering all global audio broadcast standards, including AM/FM, DAB+, DRM(+) and HD. The primary benefit is to slash hardware costs, as car radio systems generally require bulky circuit boards and six separate integrated circuits – whereas the SAF4000 is the size of just a fingertip. Other companies provide a single RF front end to all these standards, but this is the first to deliver an entire system-on-chip (SoC), rather than offloading some of the processing to a device CPU. This is part of NXP’s wider push to simplify the connected car device ecosystem by replacing multichip systems with compact RFCMOS chips, which will drive down costs and encourage mass uptake. That will complement Qualcomm’s existing presence in some Android Auto IVI systems, as well as its constant drive towards greater integration. “The step from multichip discrete to a one-chip RFCMOS solution is a true quantum leap for the industry,” said Torsten Lehmann, general manager Car Infotainment and Driver Assistance at NXP. “One-chip means a significantly smaller hardware footprint, easier development and simple worldwide integration with the ability to receive multiple different digital, as well as analog, radio standards and to switch between them via software. Centralized infotainment head units, distributed radio/audio systems, as well as smart antenna solutions are perfectly supported by this new one-chip family.” Qualcomm’s $47bn acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, once it closes, will push the US firm into lead place in the auto chip market and third place in the overall global semiconductor industry. NXP says its radio designs are in 19 of the top 20 Tier 1 automotive offerings, adding up to over 500m car radio deployments in the past 10 years. It also claims that its i.MX multimedia app processors have been deployed in over 65m vehicles. Qualcomm launches Drive Data Qualcomm itself, which unveiled an automotive variant of its Snapdragon SoC (the 820A) at CES 2016, followed up this year with new X16 LTE modems for next-gen auto applications; a customer win in Volkswagen IVI systems for the updated Snapdragon 820Am; and a partnership with Panasonic to develop a next-gen Android-based IVI system for vehicles, using the Snapdragon 820Am running Android 7.0. The Panasonic concept was on display at CES. More important to the US chip giant was the launch of the Drive Data Platform, which is Qualcomm’s brand for its sensor-fusion platform for collating and acting on all the sensor inputs that are generated by a vehicle, ranging from cameras to radar and lidar. The Drive Data Platform is based on the Snapdragon 820Am, and will make extensive use of the Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine (SNPE), to use machine learning and AI techniques to enhance its data processing abilities – allowing the car to identify what it sees via those sensors. More details are due to be announced after CES, but this sounds like the first step down a very significant road for Qualcomm. Drive Data highlights the fact that chip giants need to provide full platforms, not just silicon, in order to dominate the IoT. With Nvidia well ahead of the game in supporting intelligent and driverless cars via an AI-driven big data system, Drive Data states Qualcomm’s intention of going up against that rival, as well as Intel, in the intelligent car data platform game – not to mention other contenders from outside the chip industry, such as Google, Tesla, Baidu and Uber. Audi divides its favours Nvidia itself is already a powerhouse in the connected car, and is particularly looking to harness its GPU-based computational/AI platform to power the driverless vehicle. At CES, is touted new partnerships with Here, Audi, ZF and Zenrin as stepping stones to auto dominance. Audi was spreading its favors between Qualcomm and Nvidia. With the latter, it announced a collaboration to put the world’s most advanced AI-driven car on the road by 2020 – a claim that has probably irked Google’s newly minted Waymo division (see inset). Before 2020, Audi will be using Nvidia’s Drive PX 2 platform and DriveWorks software. The partners had an Audi Q7 SUV at CES, running demos of in which passengers were driven around while sitting in the backseats, with no driver. Nvidia’s PilotNet deep neural networks are the basis for the car’s ability to see and understand the driving environment, providing machine vision, object recognition and allowing the Q7 to adapt to the demo’s changing road surfaces and lane markings, with a simulated construction zone detour. Car makers extend their wireless partnerships Fiat-Chrysler (FCA) and Alphabet’s new Waymo division announced a partnership to work on an Android-based reboot of FCA’s Uconnect operating system – possibly the first iteration of a complete version of Android for vehicles. FCA also showed off its new concept autonomous vehicle, Portal, at CES. It has worked with the Panasonic Automotive Advanced Engineering team to create a user experience with facial recognition and voice biometric software, to identify who is in the vehicle at any one point to customize the environment for them with music, lighting, vehicle temperature, heated or cooled seats and so on. The experience is powered by Panasonic’s Cognitive Infotainment (PCI) platform, which will be trying to eat into an AI-driven market currently led by Google and IBM. Ford is integrating its Sync IVI system with Samsung Gear S2 and S3, so that wearable owners can be given notifications, such as parking alerts, by their car. Ford has also implemented high speed in-car WI-Fi hotspots into its 2017 models, powered by AT&T’s LTE service. The Sync Connect system can allow up to 10 connected devices in any one car. Mercedes will integrate Google Assistant into its 2017 models and expects to see customers communicate with their cars through Google Home, in a similar way to Ford’s Amazon Alexa-based system (see separate item). Nvidia and Audi first graced CES together some seven years ago, in a partnership that gave birth to the latter’s MMI navigation system and virtual cockpit, powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. The latest announcement sees Audi promise to roll out its new A8 sedan, which it claims will be the world’s first Level Three automated vehicle. This will allow drivers to turn their attention away from the road and allow the system to control the car and monitor the environment, with the expectation that the human driver will respond only to a request to intervene. Audi’s zFAS system is the heart of its autonomous vehicles, and is built around Nvidia silicon (though there is speculation that the ties may be loosening because of Intel’s MobilEye deal—see below). For the new A8 car, the zFAS platform will be using Nvidia’s Tegra SoC and software, but it’s noteworthy that the Q7 that is being demonstrated is using the entire Drive PX 2 system, and not just a chip and code. Other Nvidia moves at CES Also on the self-driving front, Nvidia said that ZF, a major provider of equipment to the commercial vehicle and trucking industry, is the first top tier auto supplier to make a self-driving computer based on the Drive PX 2 commercially available. Called the ZF ProAI, the unit uses the Drive PX 2’s AutoCruise configuration, which should allow companies to build self-driving vehicles, ranging from trucks to warehouse forklifts. The unit processes inputs from multiple sensors, including cameras, lidar, radar, and ultrasonic sensors, which help the vehicles locate themselves locally on a map of the wider world. And speaking of world maps, Nvidia also announced a deal with mapping firm Here, once part of Nokia and now owned by a consortium of German auto makers, to expand the capabilities of cars powered by Nvidia tech. The new partnership sees Here use Nvidia’s MapWorks AI tech to improve its HD Live Map, with Nvidia developing a localization technology for HD Live Map as part of its DriveWorks software – which will allow automakers using the Drive PX2 computer to integrate the Here localization. The third part of the agreement sees the pair collaborate on incorporating real-time updates into the IVI systems, so that occupants can see the changes dynamically. “HD maps are essential for self-driving cars,” said Jen-Hsu Huang, Nvidia’s CEO. “Here’s adoption of our deep learning technology for their cloud-to-car mapping system will accelerate automakers’ ability to deploy self-driving vehicles.” Despite the Here deal, Nvidia also announced a deal with Zenrin, a Japanese mapping company, to jointly develop another cloud-to-car system for self-driving cars, with the Drive PX 2 and DriveWorks software being paired with Zenrin’s mapping platform – in a pretty similar arrangement to Here’s. “Zenrin’s big data includes road images and point-cloud data captured by mapping-survey vehicles,” said Koji Haraguchi, head of R&D at the mapping firm. “Combining Nvidia’s AI technologies and Zenrin’s big data will enable us to provide wider coverage of HD maps to automotive manufacturers with a dramatically shorter lead time.” Intel takes 15% stake in Here If Nvidia was not being exclusive, neither was Here, which has also got far closer to Intel since the holiday. This is symptomatic of more than just a battle with Nvidia for a particular platform, however important – Intel wants to undermine its rival’s entire GPUbased approach to AI and big data platforms, whether for connected cars, the IoT or enterprise cloud. If it can push its own architectures - which are focused on microprocessors, specialized AI chips and FPGAs rather than GPUs - as superior solutions, it could weaken the whole Nvidia philosophy in key areas of deep learning, such as autonomous vehicles. There is a long way to go with that strategy, since the GPU-based approach has so far proved to be a powerful and relatively simple one for high end AI-driven platforms. But Intel is putting many of the pieces in place to attack Nvidia’s areas of strength. This was the thinking behind the recent acquisition of Nervana, which had already mounted a credible challenge to Nvidia’s CUDA software, which powers its GPUs, with its own Neon cloud service, and is set to launch a deep learning accelerator chip on the drawing board, and set to launch next year. Intel has also acquired Movidius to expand its machine vision capabilities, and now taken a stake in Here. The companies which acquired Here from Nokia - Audi, BMW and Daimler – have reduced their one-third stakes to 25% each, selling 15% of the total to Intel and another 10% to a group of Chinese companies (Tencent, NavInfo and GIC). Intel and Here say they plan to develop a “highly scalable proof-of-concept architecture that supports real time updates of high-definition maps for highly and fully automated driving as well as explore opportunities in IoT and machine learning.” For Intel, this is a fairly straightforward way for it to secure the mapping and locational data that it needs to power its automotive ambitions, while adding a lot of contextual richness to the data sets. With a little dot-joining, one can spot patterns leading to the deal, such as Intel’s previous partnerships with Mobileye and BMW to build a fleet of fully autonomous cars by 2021. Indeed, at CES, Here announced its own deal with Mobileye – another of the prominent companies making specialised, optimised chips for AI and IoT functions, and so potentially strengthening Intel’s platform against Nvidia’s. The importance of the Mobileye deal Intel’s partnership with Mobileye, augmented by a new deal last fall with Delphi, is so important in the connected car world that some are calling it the Wintel of that market, because it could combine the smaller firm’s excellent and specialized vision algorithms with a more advanced processor roadmap than its own. Daniel Galves, Mobileye’s chief communications officer, recently told EETimes about the possible division of labor between its own technology and Intel’s, saying: “The Mobileye SoC will run all sensor processing software (8-camera surround view by Mobileye, radar/lidar processing by Delphi), localization mapping by Mobileye REM, and sensor fusion will run. On the Intel SoC, all driving policy (reinforcement learning algorithms for path strategy by Mobileye) and driving control (driving behavior software by Delphi’s Ottomatika) will run.” That is before Intel has even unveiled its expected automotive system- on-chip, based on multiple Xeon cores, which could combine with Mobileye’s EyeQ chip, which supports computer vision in the ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) which Mobileye dominates. There has already been speculation that Intel has struck a real blow at Nvidia with its Mobileye and other partnerships. Nvidia was at the heart of the Audi zFAS – a centralized assistance controller the German carmaker is developing with Delphi and Mobileye, which also uses FPGAs from Altera, now part of Intel. If Altera will open doors for Intel in some unfamiliar markets, supporting optimized coprocessing for tasks with which standard x86 CPUs struggle, that will also squeeze some other chipmakers with a longer history in machine-to-machine and automotive. Mobileye, for instance, has traditionally worked with STMicro, but may now be hedging its bets with its Intel partnership. And now Here is part of the web too, announcing its own deal, to integrate data from Mobileye’s automotive machine vision sensors into Here’s Open Location Platform (OLP), using Mobileye’s Global Roadbook (GLRB) as a data layer. This is designed to increase the accuracy of the OLP, by adding contextually up-to-date landmark and roadway information pulled from vehicles using Mobileye’s sensors – the eyes of many of the most advanced semi-autonomous cars on the market. These vehicles will be piping the Road Segment Data (RSD) generated by Mobileye’s REM technology to the Here cloud, which will then be able to be shared with other vehicles using Here’s Live Map platform. As Here’s CEO, Edzard Overbeek, put it: “A real time self-healing and HD representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms. As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate Here’s ambitions in this area, but support the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud, and everything else connected.” Intel Go This is the latest step in Intel’s automotive transition, which has seen the division emerge from the IoT wing in the past year or so. That division is now getting its own brand, called Intel Go, which will revolve around new developer kits for automakers, based on its Atom and Xeon processors. Under the Go brand, Intel said at CES that it was launching two new developer kits for auto makers looking to add a brain to their vehicles. With a variant based around the low-power Atom processor, and another with a far more powerful Xeon backed up by new Arria 10 FPGAs, Intel is pitching the designs as the answer to all automotive computational needs – for sensor fusion to decision making. The new Intel Go Automotive SDK is Intel’s answer to the software side of the picture, while the Go Automotive 5G Platform aims to provide the V2X communication requirements, and to be the first commercial ‘5G’ world modem (see separate item). The new Go kits are going to be rolled out in a fleet of 40 BMW cars this year, as part of the test platform for the fleet with Mobileye and Intel. Towards the 5G car Of course, nobody could escape that ‘5G’ label, even in the car sector where 4G standards for wireless connectivity are not yet fully supported – last week saw tests based on the new LTE-V specifications, but there are all kinds of disputes between the 3GPP approach, the Wi-Fi community’s 802.11p and the DSRC specialized protocol. More of that potential industry split in an upcoming issue, but we can be sure that 5G, for all the hopes that it will prove to be an umbrella for many connectivity specs, will not really manage to neutralize all the politics behind these varying standards. But as long as 5G is not commercially real, participants from the car and wireless industries can keep their visions alive. For instance, PSA Group, owner of Peugeot and Citroёn, has partnered with Orange and Ericsson to work on "Towards 5G" car platforms based for now on the emerging LTE-V standard and on virtualization, but with a view to creating a roadmap towards 5G-based Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) to support smart and autonomous vehicles. Their pilot project sits outside similar efforts by the Qualcomm-driven 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), although Ericsson is part of both efforts. Orange will provide the spectrum and cellular network for the trial sites; Ericsson the radio and distributed, virtualized core network; and PSA will define the requirements, scope and user experience and provide technical validation. “Connected IoT services are a crucial way to enhance the user experience for our customers, who today demand unprecedented levels of comfort and convenience as well as personalized services in their vehicles,” said Carla Gohin, VP of research, innovation and advanced technologies at PSA.

Thanks to a 360-degree replay technology called "Be the Player," Fox TV broadcasters will be able to show a play from virtually any spot in the stadium within minutes of the action taking place. The spin around and zoom "freeD" system has been used at other sporting events — including the NBA and baseball All-Star Games and the Olympics — but this will be the first that goes the last step and shows things from the athlete's perspective . "The difference here is you would be able to go in and see from his vantage point what the player actually saw," said Zac Fields, a senior vice president for graphic technology and integration at Fox Sports Group. "It's something that most of us have never been able to see before. The vantage point that most of us have on TV is really different than what the guys see on the field. That's what the promise of this technology is." Intel is rolling out the new technology at this year's Super Bowl, and promoting it in an ad that will feature Brady in his everyday life — waking up, making breakfast, brushing his teeth — with the tagline: "Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic." As the Patriots quarterback snarfs down a pancake, the camera spins around to a new angle and shows the crumbs falling from his mouth. And, if New England makes it to the Feb. 5 Super Bowl in Houston, there will be even more opportunities to see things from Brady's perspective. "It's something that fans have always dreamed about: 'What did Tom see when he threw that pass?'" Jeff Hopper, the general manager of strategy and marketing for the Intel Sports Group, told The Associated Press in advance of the announcement. "Everyone wants to be the player, to see what it's like to see it from that point of view." To make the "Be the Player" video possible, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras in a perimeter inside NRG Stadium, creating what Hopper calls "a volumetric capture of everything that's going on on the field." The cameras are connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a special control room, where a half-dozen Intel producers, working with one from the Fox Sports broadcast, can pick out and package the replays that will be used in the broadcast. The massive amount of data — about 1 terabyte per 15-30 second clip — allows producers to position a "virtual camera" anywhere it wants — including, virtually, inside a player's helmet. (Early versions even toyed with superimposing a facemask on the screen, though that has apparently been dropped.) It will take about two minutes to produce the clips, meaning it's not yet ready for instant replay but could, for example, be available to show a new view of a touchdown by the time the teams are done with the extra point or kickoff. In an interview in Boston's Back Bay this week, Hopper said there could be up to 20 "Be the Player" replays, though ultimately it is up to Fox to decide how to use it. "It will depend upon the story you are trying to tell," Fields said. "It's not something we're planning on using because it is a new bell and whistle. It is a storytelling tool, and that's how we're planning to utilize it." Right now, use of the system is limited to big events: It took about a month to retrofit the stadium in Houston with all of the equipment needed for the freeD data capture. Also, each 15-30 clip consists of about 1 terabyte of data. But Hopper said new stadiums are already being built with the cameras in mind. "Anyone who's building a new stadium now is saying, 'What do we need to do to make it freeD ready?'" he said. "Because everyone sees it as the future." Eventually, Hopper said, the technology will not be limited to storytelling. Teams and leagues are hoping to mine the data to improve performance. In the X-Games, Hopper said, the athletes were eager to figure out how high they jumped and use that information to tune their techniques — or just brag about big air with the competition. In time, coaches will be able to use the video to see what their player saw, instead of relying on overhead shots of the field. And, as the turnaround time quickens, the technology would also help replay reviews by giving officials the ability to freeze the action and zoom in at any angle to look, for example, to see whether a player's knee was down before the ball popped out. "We're working with pretty much the entire sports world," Hopper said. "All the leagues, all the teams. I don't think there's anyone that we're not. We can't do them all, but we're talking with them all." And Hopper envisions a sports world where every fan will be able to immerse himself in the game on his phone or a virtual reality headset — not just view the shots curated by a TV producer sitting in a trailer next to the stadium. "That's good; I think it's interesting. But the transformative nature of what we're working on is: Everybody gets to do it themselves," Hopper said. "Ultimately you'll be able to be on the field, with the players — the best players in the world — whatever sport that is, whether it be soccer, football or cricket, whatever. You'll be able to be part of the action. I don't think you can get any more immersed." ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Did Packers get away with holding on Aaron Rodgers' game-saving throw? 445 messages7%74%19% 2017 Honda CR-V Central Iowa Honda DealersSponsored Congress Members Join John Lewis in Boycott of Trump's Inauguration 101 messages6%62%32% Man Who Shot Wife Claimed She Killed Herself Over Body Image Issues 194 messages5%62%33% #2 of 10 Most Popular News Galleries of 2016: 9/11: Then and now - 15 years later 862 messages5%56%39% Marijuana Millionaire #2 MONEY MORNINGSponsored Protesters Take to the Streets Across the Country 25 messages7%61%32% Obama on Trump: ‘Don’t underestimate the guy, because he’s going to be 45th president of the United States’ 1497 messages6%67%27% Seldom-called penalty is very costly for Cowboys in first-quarter drive 347 messages7%68%25% Cornell University Reveals Body Slimming Miracle Applecider Magic BulletSponsored ‘Hidden Figures’ Prevails as ‘Monster Trucks,’ Ben Affleck’s ‘Live by Night’ Bomb at Box Office 1525 messages6%68%26% #8 of 10 Most Popular News Galleries of 2016: Deadly attack at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport 884 messages9%12%79% Heartbreaking and Joyful Reunion for 18-Year-Old Kamiyah 3 messages0%67%33% Why Mechanics Keep Old And Dead Batteries?

This year’s Super Bowl broadcast could be just what you’re looking for. Thanks to a 360-degree replay technology called ”Be the Player,” Fox TV broadcasters will be able to show a play from virtually any spot in the stadium within minutes of the action taking place. The spin around and zoom ”freeD” system has been used at other sporting events – including the NBA and baseball All-Star Games and the Olympics – but this will be the first that goes the last step and shows things from the athlete’s perspective . ”The difference here is you would be able to go in and see from his vantage point what the player actually saw,” said Zac Fields, a senior vice president for graphic technology and integration at Fox Sports Group. ”It’s something that most of us have never been able to see before. The vantage point that most of us have on TV is really different than what the guys see on the field. That’s what the promise of this technology is.” Intel is rolling out the new technology at this year’s Super Bowl, and promoting it in an ad that will feature Brady in his everyday life – waking up, making breakfast, brushing his teeth – with the tagline: ”Intel replay 360 makes anything look epic.” As the Patriots quarterback snarfs down a pancake, the camera spins around to a new angle and shows the crumbs falling from his mouth. And, if New England makes it to the Feb. 5 Super Bowl in Houston, there will be even more opportunities to see things from Brady’s perspective. ”It’s something that fans have always dreamed about: `What did Tom see when he threw that pass?”’ Jeff Hopper, the general manager of strategy and marketing for the Intel Sports Group, told The Associated Press in advance of the announcement. ”Everyone wants to be the player, to see what it’s like to see it from that point of view.” To make the ”Be the Player” video possible, Intel has installed 38 separate 5K resolution cameras in a perimeter inside NRG Stadium, creating what Hopper calls ”a volumetric capture of everything that’s going on on the field.” The cameras are connected by five miles of fiber optic cables to a special control room, where a half-dozen Intel producers, working with one from the Fox Sports broadcast, can pick out and package the replays that will be used in the broadcast. The massive amount of data – about 1 terabyte per 15-30 second clip – allows producers to position a ”virtual camera” anywhere it wants – including, virtually, inside a player’s helmet. (Early versions even toyed with superimposing a facemask on the screen, though that has apparently been dropped.) It will take about two minutes to produce the clips, meaning it’s not yet ready for instant replay but could, for example, be available to show a new view of a touchdown by the time the teams are done with the extra point or kickoff. In an interview in Boston’s Back Bay this week, Hopper said there could be up to 20 ”Be the Player” replays, though ultimately it is up to Fox to decide how to use it. ”It will depend upon the story you are trying to tell,” Fields said. ”It’s not something we’re planning on using because it is a new bell and whistle. It is a storytelling tool, and that’s how we’re planning to utilize it.” Right now, use of the system is limited to big events: It took about a month to retrofit the stadium in Houston with all of the equipment needed for the freeD data capture. Also, each 15-30 clip consists of about 1 terabyte of data. But Hopper said new stadiums are already being built with the cameras in mind. ”Anyone who’s building a new stadium now is saying, `What do we need to do to make it freeD ready?”’ he said. ”Because everyone sees it as the future.” Eventually, Hopper said, the technology will not be limited to storytelling. Teams and leagues are hoping to mine the data to improve performance. In the X-Games, Hopper said, the athletes were eager to figure out how high they jumped and use that information to tune their techniques – or just brag about big air with the competition. In time, coaches will be able to use the video to see what their player saw, instead of relying on overhead shots of the field. And, as the turnaround time quickens, the technology would also help replay reviews by giving officials the ability to freeze the action and zoom in at any angle to look, for example, to see whether a player’s knee was down before the ball popped out. ”We’re working with pretty much the entire sports world,” Hopper said. ”All the leagues, all the teams. I don’t think there’s anyone that we’re not. We can’t do them all, but we’re talking with them all.” And Hopper envisions a sports world where every fan will be able to immerse himself in the game on his phone or a virtual reality headset – not just view the shots curated by a TV producer sitting in a trailer next to the stadium. ”That’s good; I think it’s interesting. But the transformative nature of what we’re working on is: Everybody gets to do it themselves,” Hopper said. ”Ultimately you’ll be able to be on the field, with the players – the best players in the world�- whatever sport that is, whether it be soccer, football or cricket, whatever. You’ll be able to be part of the action. I don’t think you can get any more immersed.” — For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL 0 Shares 360-degree replays at Super Bowl a taste of what’s next UP NEXT : 360-degree replays at Super Bowl a taste of what’s next UP NEXT :

ISSN 2330-717X Home News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology Health Misreading Trump, Putin And US-Russian Relations – Analysis Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Photo montage from Wikipedia Commons sources. By Michael Averko January 12, 2017 The ongoing biases against Russia lead to new matters to refute. Matching the gross one-sidedness of her Washington Post (WaPo) employer, Kathleen Parker’s January 6 essay “If Obama Is a Muslim, Is Trump a Russian Spy?“, overlooks some damning points running counter to her faulty slant. Donald Trump has taken back his comments that questioned whether Barack Obama is American born. For its part, The WaPo continues to denigrate Russia in a factually challenged manner. (The use of the crank Propornot website and the false claim of a Russian hacking of the Vermont power grid being prime examples, along with continuous top heavy anti-Russian op-ed pieces and news reports.) Parker suggests a double standard favoring Muslim bashing over her presented claim of Russian mischief against the US. She describes Russia as an “enemy”. Her overlooked hypocrisy concerns the select outrage over anti-Muslim stances (real and hyped), while being soft on the frequent instances of bias against pro-Russian advocacy. Lacking specifics, Parker’s “proof” against Russia is the faith based US Intel report, which unlike her doesn’t refer to Russia as an “enemy”, while claiming a concerted Vladimir Putin approved Russian government effort to support Trump by defaming Hillary Clinton. Regarding that report, the mind reading point about the Russian government and Russia’s mass media preferring Trump over Clinton is in the no kidding and so what category. Trump has openly sought better US relations with Russia, as Clinton was the preferred choice of the anti-Russian neocons. The January 8 exchange between Fox News host Chris Wallace and Trump’s Chief-of-Staff Reince Priebus included the latter saying in the beginning that “he thinks” that Trump accepts the claim of Russian hacking of Democratic Party emails. Wallace’s persistent questioning led Preibus to change course later on in the discussion, saying that the president-elect accepted the Intel take of Russian hacking. In any event, Trump (for now) doesn’t seem to believe that this matter should cloud the effort to improve US-Russian relations. There’s a difference between hacking from the Russian government and Russian hackers who hack en masse, independent of the Kremlin. For several years, there’ve been reports of hacking from Russia, the US and elsewhere against ordinary Americans and others throughout the world. Ideally, there should be conclusive proof that the Russian government used a third party to advance their purported cause, as has been suggested in some circles. With confidentiality respected, a CNN host privately asked how I could consider Julian Assange’s take over US Intel? For the record, I didn’t specifically say such. Is Assange less biased than the Democratic Party utilized CrowdStrike, that has also essentially been used to promote negativity towards the counter-Euromaidan rebels in Ukraine? CrowdStrike has ties to the Atlantic Council – a group that has been overly partisan against Russia. I’m not alone in believing that the trustworthiness of US Intel is compromised by its politicized element and a past that has been found to not always be honest. This politicization was noted last week by Fox news host Brett Baier, who said that Trump’s criticism of Intel has been misrepresented. Opposing politically driven and questionable Intel claims doesn’t necessarily belittle the need for accurate Intel and recognizing that not everyone associated with that grouping has the faulty slants of John Brennan, James Clapper, Malcolm Nance and Michael Hayden. (Nance and Hayden are former US Intel personnel, who’re frequent US mass media talking heads.) There’s ample reason to seriously question if the released Democratic party emails (however done) made a difference in the outcome of the 2016 US presidential result. To date, I’m unaware of any poll revealing that the released Democratic Party emails had significantly changed the outcome of that vote. The Democratic Party should be faulted for having a lax cyber security regimen, along with saying some ethically challenging things. Not to be overlooked are the numerous instances of US government meddling in the elections of other countries  and the reality of major powers (perceived allies and otherwise) spying on each other. On January 3, there were two segments featuring different perspectives on the released Democratic Party emails in question. Fox News’ Sean Hannity, had a lengthy one on one with Assange, that brought up the criminal charges made against the WikiLeaks founder. The PBS NewsHour segment with CIA Director John Brennan, included this quote from him: “We see what he has done in places like Crimea and Ukraine and in Syria. he tends to flex muscles, not just on himself, but also in terms of Russia’s military capabilities. He plays by his own rules in terms of what it is that he does in some of these theaters of conflict. So I don’t think we underestimated him. He has sought to advance Russia’s interests in areas where there have been political vacuums and conflicts. But he doesn’t ascribe to the same types of rules that we do, for example, in law of armed conflict. What the Russians have done in Syria in terms of some of the scorched-earth policy that they have pursued that have led to devastation and thousands upon thousands of innocent deaths, that’s not something that the United States would ever do in any of these military conflicts.” Own rules as in what Turkey has done in northern Cyprus and the Clinton led NATO in Kosovo? It was a shameful example of journalism on the part of PBS to let Brennan’s comments go unchallenged. PBS had earlier run a pro-CrowdStrike feature. It’s not as if there aren’t any expert cyber security/ intelligence sources offering a different perspective. As for the devastation of thousands of civilians during war (raised by Brennan), consider some past US actions like what happened in Japan during WW II, the Cold War activity in Southeast Asia, as well as post-Cold War actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. The collateral damage emphasis has been hypocritically applied. Along with the subjectively dubious comments of Hayden and Nance, the above excerpted comments from Brennan are indicative of a (past and present) politicized element within US Intel. Among Russia friendly circles, some kudos has been given to Fox News’ Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Like their employer, these two individuals have a preference for Trump over the Democrats. However, like many pro-Trump sources, Hannity and Carlson maintain some of the anti-Russian biases, as The WaPo and some others speak of a possible unknown money trail linking Trump to Russia. Trump has had known business interests involving China and some predominately Muslim countries. That aspect hasn’t prevented him from saying things that aren’t favored in these countries. There’re other Americans besides Trump who favor improved US-Russian relations in opposition to the neocon/neolib preference. Pat Buchanan serves as an example of an anti-Communist patriotic American, who second guesses the negative image of Putin and Russia. There’s also the community of anti-Communist White Russians in the US and elsewhere, which have a good number opposed to the current hostility towards Russia. From a more left leaning perspective, Stephen Cohen and some lessor known individuals aren’t anti-American in believing that the US (from its interests) shouldn’t be so antagonistic towards Russia. American foreign policy realists include disagreement with the need for having unfriendly US-Russian relations. An example of the ongoing bias is the obligatory “Putin is a thug” disclaimer frequently bandied about. As has been confidentially acknowledged to me, some well meaning folks do this as a means to soften criticism against their commentary, which otherwise goes against the neocon/neolib slant. Talk about “self censorship”. From a distance, Putin (IMO) doesn’t come across as being more mean spirited than Clinton, John McCain and some others who disparage him. With the pro-Trump/anti-Russian leaning people in mind, was Trump elected for being a nice guy? The personal insults against Putin are hypocritically petty. Upon a reasonable objective and comprehensive overview, the litany of negative claims against him are quite suspect. Yet, they keep getting uncritically rehashed in a way that exhibits a lack of diversity in US mass media and body politic. Short of providing greater attention to the likes of Lindsey Graham and McCain, the provocative name calling and other forms of posturing against Putin/Russia haven’t worked. It’s not in America’s best interests to use Russia as a political football to get at Trump and cater to anti-Russian advocacy. Trump should be accorded the opportunity to pursue better US-Russian relations. My last Strategic Culture Foundation article of January 1, counters the presentation of Obama and his predecessors (Bill Clinton and GW Bush) seeking to pursue that endeavor.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 11, 2017 at 7:13PM At the J.P. Morgan 15th Annual Tech Forum, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) client computing group (CCG) chief Navin Shenoy offered up some insights about his business unit, the company's largest by revenue.  Image source: Intel.  Near the end of his presentation, Shenoy talked about Intel's chip manufacturing strategy, exuding confidence that the company's manufacturing technology is the "best in the world." As part of this discussion, he took the time to explain how the technology that Intel calls 14 nanometers is more like what its competitors -- Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) -- call 10 nanometers (smaller is generally believed to be better). He then offered the following commentary with respect to its upcoming 10-nanometer technology (emphasis mine): "I'm confident that when 10 nanometer -- our 10 nanometer -- comes out, and this is something that maybe we should rename it, I don't know, we'll think about that, but when our 10 nanometer comes out, we will have a clear density advantage, and a clear performance and power advantage versus what others in the industry have." I agree, and even suggested that Intel do just that back in October. Since this is something that Intel seems to be considering now, it would be wise to just do it. Here's why.  Lots of benefit, little risk/effort In the past, when Intel had a full-generation lead in manufacturing technology over its peers, it was easy for the company to stick to its own naming schemes, even if it served to undersell the characteristics of the underlying technology.  For example, Intel's 14-nanometer technology was generally ahead of what its competitors were calling 14/16-nanometer technologies. The chipmaker may have been able to score some additional marketing points by rebranding its technology as 10-nanometer to make this superiority clear, but -- at the time -- that naming methodology didn't create the perception that Intel is a generation behind.  If Intel could get to market with future technologies (10 nanometer, 7 nanometer, etc.) at the same time as its competitors got to their respective technologies going forward, then Intel could leave its naming scheme unchanged -- again, short-changing itself, but not giving competitors opportunities to say that they are ahead. But that's not going to be the case going forward. Intel's 14-nanometer technology will be the company's only production-worthy technology over the next year. Its competitors, on the other hand, will ramp up their respective 10-nanometer technologies in 2017, and Taiwan Semiconductor plans to ramp up its 7-nanometer technology beginning in early 2018, right around when we will see Intel bring its 10-nanometer technology to market.  Intel will then go from squandering a potential marketing point, but at least appearing competitive, to flat-out looking as though it is a generation behind. Intel's competitors will surely use this against the chipmaker as they craft their own marketing messages, which are likely to be carried far and wide by the tech press.  The easiest argument for renaming Intel's marketing/PR team will have two basic options for how to educate people about how the company isn't actually a full generation behind what its chip manufacturing peers (and their customers -- Intel's direct competitors) are fielding.  Intel can rename its technologies to accurately reflect their competitiveness.  Intel can spend undue time and energy arguing that its technologies are competitive despite being branded in such a way as to suggest that they are behind the curve.   One of these options is a very easy solution to the problem that has virtually no downside. The other is much more complicated, has the potential to come off as damage control, and might not even work (Intel's attempts to explain why its 14-nanometer technology is superior to competing 14/16-nanometer technologies have often fallen on deaf ears in the tech community).  If Intel loses a single chip sale because it refused to do something as simple as renaming its manufacturing technologies, then that would be a wholly unnecessary destruction of shareholder value.  Do the right thing, Intel: Rename your future manufacturing technologies, beginning with your next-generation 10-nanometer technology.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Announcement  ⋮  Hardware AMD Zen Architecture For Ryzen and Naples Processors Will Last Four Years on 14nm – Future Zen+ Revisions To Improve Architecture By Hassan Mujtaba Posted Jan 9, 2017 124Shares Share Tweet Submit AMD has confirmed that their Zen CPU architecture for Ryzen processors is expected to last four years. It took AMD four years to develop Zen and it will take another four for Zen to complete its shelve time. AMD Zen Based Ryzen Processors Expected To Last Four Years In an interview with PCWorld, Mark Papermaster confirmed that Zen will feature a four year lifespan. He mentioned that AMD will not follow Intel’s Tick-Tock model and instead go for Tock, Tock, Tock. This means that AMD will be planning to offer future revisions of Zen with an improved architecture to increase performance and efficiency. AMD will be featuring future revisions on Zen on their consumer, server and workstation processors. When asked how long Zen would last, compared to Intel’s two-year tick-tock cadence, Papermaster confirmed the four-year lifespan and tapped the table in front of him: “We’re not going tick-tock,” he said. “Zen is going to be tock, tock, tock.” via PCWorld A tock cycle represents a new architecture while a tick cycle represents a process shrink along with architecture improvements. Intel has dropped this in favor of the PAO Cadence (Process-Architecture-Optimization). AMD is going to follow with the Tock, Tock, Tock cycle which means the next two generations of Zen will come with an improved architecture rather than a process shrink. This also confirms that AMD will be sticking with 14nm for a while. AMD will stick with the 14nm node and jump ship to the 7nm process after 2020. AMD Zen To Be Replaced With Zen+ and Zen++ Cores In The Future? So what comes after Zen? In previously shown slides, AMD calls the core after Zen as Zen+. Zen+ is going to lift the IPC and efficiency further but there’s also a third tock which we are going to call Zen++ (not an official name). If we look at the past, Bulldozer had a revision known as Piledriver. There was also Steamroller and the Excavator microarchitecture after that. The construction of all the cores had one thing in common, they were derivatives based on the original Bulldozer design. But the latter two were a Tick-Tock cycle since Steamroller was based on 28nm rather than 32nm (Bulldozer / Piledriver). Intel on the other hand has totally dropped the Tick-Tock cycle and gone with a new plan. They have launched Broadwell (process shrink or Tick), Skylake (architecture upgrade or Tock) and Kaby Lake (optimized microarchitecture or a half Tock). But they will have a second optimized node based on 14nm launching in 2017 known as Coffee Lake. So Intel is stuck with 14nm on the desktop front for some time too. This puts Zen in a pretty good launch position against Intel’s offerings. The 10nm processors from Intel won’t be ready for desktops and there are rumors that Intel may entirely skip 10nm for desktops in favor of the 7nm process on Ice Lake or Tiger Lake chips. What those improvements will be, of course, is anyone’s guess. But Papermaster said he’s a believer in architecture improvements that go beyond simple manufacturing, something he’s previously referred to as “Moore’s Law Plus.” via PCWorld Next Generation AMD CPUs And APUs WCCFTech AMD Raven Ridge AMD Gray Hawk AMD Summit Ridge AMD Bristol Ridge Product Architecture Zen Zen+ Zen Excavator Process Node 14nm 7nm 14nm 28nm CPU Cores Up to 4 Up to 4 Up to 8 Up to 4 GPU Architecture Vega Navi N/A Caribbean Islands TDP TBA TBA 65W-95W 35-65W Socket AM4 AM4+ AM4 AM4 Memory Support DDR4 & HBM DDR4 & HBM DDR4 DDR4 Launch 2H 2017 2019 Q1 2017 October 2016 AMD Radeon RX 470 and RX 460 Officially Detailed AMD Zen To Last Several Generations of Consumer, Workstation and Server Processors AMD’s CEO and President, Lisa Su, also confirmed that Zen will last three to five years with itself and its ZEN+ successors. Advertisement I think Zen is the first of a multi-year strategy so you know again you ask me what are my thoughts around the company I think AMD at our core we are a high performance computing company and so you know Zen is a from scratch architectural design, for those of us who do those you know it takes a lot of work. It’s a multi-year effort but I think it’s a multi-year effort that we can see coming to fruition. And so what datacenter customers want from us is one we want you to be competitive and two we want a long term roadmap. And so we’ve really talked about Zen+, Zen follow ons, as you know a three to five year view of what’s needed to be successful in the datacenter. via Wccftech AMD doesn’t see any major threats from Intel that may affect Zen’s launch. It was met with great response at the showcases from the PC gaming and enthusiast community. Ryzen is shaping up to be the processor series that AMD and PC gaming fans have long been waiting for. The future Zen+ cores will ensure that performance of Zen based chips keeps going up and will deliver the best efficiency possible. Wccftech AMD Naples AMD RYZEN Market Enterprise Desktop Microarchitecture Zen Zen Cores 32 8 Threads 64 16 Base TBA 3.6Ghz (F3 Stepping) Turbo TBA 3.9Ghz (F3 Stepping) 4.0Ghz (F4 Stepping) L1 Instruction Cache 32 KB x 32 32 KB x 8 L1 Data Cache 64 KB x 32 64 KB x 8 L2 Cache 512 KB x 32 512 KB x 8 L3 Cache 512 MB 16 MB Two Future AMD Features Are Debuting in PS4 Pro; Watch Dogs 2 & Mass Effect Andromeda Run @1800P AMD ZEN CPU Architecture and X370 AM4 Platform Details Highlighted AMD Ryzen processors will feature up to 8 cores and 16 threads with the Zen architecture. The processors will deliver up to 40% IPC gains and great performance increases over Bulldozer CPUs. All Ryzen processors come with new boost technology that are part of the SenseMI feature set. The Ryzen processors also feature a fully unlocked multiplier across several variants which would support overclocking on the new AM4 motherboards. If you would like more details about the Zen architecture, here’s the link. AMD SenseMI Technology: Pure Power – more than 100 embedded sensors with accuracy to the millivolt, milliwatt, and single degree level of temperature enable optimal voltage, clock frequency, and operating mode with minimal energy consumption; Precision Boost – smart logic that monitors integrated sensors and optimizes clock speeds, in increments as small as 25MHz, at up to a thousand times a second; Extended Frequency Range (XFR) – when the system senses added cooling capability, XFR raises the Precision Boost frequency to enhance performance; Neural Net Prediction – an artificial intelligence neural network that learns to predict what future pathway an application will take based on past runs; Smart Prefetch – sophisticated learning algorithms that track software behavior to anticipate the needs of an application and prepare the data in advance. As for the platform itself, AM4 X370 will be top of the line. Aside from the budget friendly B350 and A320 chips, the X370 PCH will offer increase PCIe lanes and increased storage / connectivity features. AMD has planned a total of 16 new AM4 motherboards which will be available at launch through their partners. The boards are detailed in our post here. The platform itself looks fantastic but the processors are the key component for AMD. We know some numbers in regards to performance and efficiency, but we can’t wait for these chips to actually hit the market. The expected arrival date of Zen based processors and the AM4 platform is Q1 2017 (February-March).

There has been so much unveiled that it would take weeks to disassemble and dissect all of it - but this is why we have our 'Best of CES 2017' awards, and this article. Below we list the products and tech that were lucky enough to get our award.     Let's kick things off with the CPU and GPU side of things:   CPU: AMD has impressed not just us, but gamers and consumers throughout the world with their next generation Ryzen CPUs. We're looking at 16-threaded CPUs that should hopefully come in at half the price of Intel's competing processors, offering new technologies like SenseMI - a self-overclocking, self-adjusting processor that learns how you use your system and predicts your next movement. Expect much more from us here at TweakTown on Ryzen in the coming weeks and months.   GPU: You have to hand it to Radeon Technologies Group, the upcoming Vega GPU architecture is beyond exciting. High Bandwidth Cache. HBM2 technology. The Vega GPU architecture itself. We're looking at 4K 60FPS performance in games like DOOM with all the graphical bells and whistles turned on. AMD is returning to the high-end in a very, very big way.   Motherboards: AMD wins our 'best CPU technology of CES 2017' but Intel went on the offensive with Kaby Lake and their motherboard partners with a near unlimited range of Z270 motherboards. GIGABYTE's new Z270X-Gaming 9 motherboard will be my new desktop gaming PC motherboard of choice, but ASUS impressed yet again with its high-end ROG Maximus IX Formula Z270. And so did ASRock with its new Z270 Taichi, and MSI with its beautiful Z270 XPOWER Gaming Titanium - all worthy choices for your new Kaby Lake CPU.   Laptop: Dell and Razer had some great laptops shown off at CES 2017, and this is why I've chosen two. Dell first as their next-gen XPS 13 and XPS 15 laptops are already here, with some of the higher-end SKUs shipping soon. Dell updated the new XPS 13 and XPS 15 with Intel's new Kaby Lake processors, continued the use of their beautiful edge-to-edge 1080p/4K display (the 4K option is an additional $300). The higher-end XPS 15 can even be configured with NVIDIA's new GeForce GTX 1050.   The second laptop worth mentioning is the ambitious Project Valerie from Razer, which has not 1 - but 3 damn 17-inch displays. I don't know how Razer continue to do it, but they do.   SOC/Mobile Tech: Qualcomm, by a long shot. The company unveiled their next-gen Snapdragon 835 processor, which is poised to take over the mobile market in smartphones and tablets later this year. Not only that, but we're getting our first teases of 5G technology - which is going to blow the world away. Qualcomm said during its CES 2017 press conference that current 3G and 4G technologies were designed before they knew what people would do with their smartphones - you know, before Netflix, YouTube, Facebook, and so on - 5G, is ready for it all. It's ready for 4K 60FPS streamed to your phone, and at up to 1Gbps. Yikes.   Not only that, but the new Snapdragon 835 processor is built on the 10nm process - meaning Qualcomm is the first to hit the 10nm node, which is an impressive feat. Qualcomm is the company I'm most excited for out of everyone from CES, as they'll have more of an impact on the entire planet and billions of consumers with their new processors, 5G technology, and more.   TV: LG is the leader in TV technology, it's that simple - and the South Korean giant continued that dominance with the unveiling of their latest W-series 4K OLED HDR-capable TV. An impressive feat, with a near impossibly thin bezel, and beautiful image quality - it's the new TV to beat in 2017.   Living Room: NVIDIA's new Shield TV. I use NVIDIA's current-gen Shield all the time, it's an amazing device - but NVIDIA doesn't stop, so it made the new Shield even better. It's HDR-capable, 4K-capable (like the current-gen Shield), has the Shield Remote in the box (versus being an accessory), and has Google Assistant built-in. You can search for shows on Netflix by talking to it, and Google Assistant responds with much more realistic, human responses.   Keyboard: Corsair has been killing the peripherals game for years now, and heck - I'm typing up this post on their Vengeance K95 RGB keyboard. It's a pleasure to use, but the new K95 RGB Platinum keyboard? Oh gosh. That reminds me, I've got to email Corsair and ask for some new keyboards...   Monitors: Holy crap was CES 2017 a massive year for displays... NVIDIA went the whole hog and unveiled two totally next generation gaming displays: 4K resolution, 144Hz refresh rate, G-Sync refresh technology... and HDR. They sound great on paper, but in person the ASUS ROG Swift PG27UQ and the Acer Predator XB272-HDR are absolutely stunning. It will redefine what you think is a high-end monitor, and some. You simply need to see it in person to believe the leap it represents.   General Tech: NVIDIA's advancements (AI Car) in self-driving car technology are always fun to see at CES, but it scares me to think where we'll be at CES 2018, 2019, 2020 and beyond - scares me, in a good way.   Qualcomm also gets awarded for its impressive 10nm processor technology.   VR: HTC Vive, as always - it hasn't changed. Oculus were nowhere to be seen at CES. They're probably scared, but HTC has been killing the VR scene with the Vive - if you haven't got one, you need to try it. The future of VR is going to be huge.   Storage: Kingston wants us all to have 2TB on a USB stick with their impressive new DataTraveler USB 3.0 flash drive. 2TB in your pocket allows for hours upon hours of 4K footage, emergency (and fast) storage, and so much more.

The other is much more complicated, has the potential to come off as damage control, and might not even work (Intel's attempts to explain why its 14-nanometer technology is superior to competing 14/16-nanometer technologies have often fallen on deaf ears in the tech community).  If Intel loses a single chip sale because it refused to do something as simple as renaming its manufacturing technologies, then that would be a wholly unnecessary destruction of shareholder value.  Do the right thing, Intel: Rename your future manufacturing technologies, beginning with your next-generation 10-nanometer technology.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The patches address vulnerabilities in the Merlin@home Transmitter, St. Jude Medical's remote monitoring system of implantable pacemakers and defibrillator devices. The security updates from St. Jude Medical arrived on the same day that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team issued separate statements detailing the vulnerabilities and advice for healthcare providers, patients and caregivers. "The FDA has reviewed information concerning potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities associated with St. Jude Medical's Merlin@home Transmitter and has confirmed that these vulnerabilities, if exploited, could allow an unauthorized user, i.e., someone other than the patient's physician, to remotely access a patient's RF-enabled implanted cardiac device by altering the Merlin@home Transmitter," the FDA said in its statement. "The altered Merlin@home Transmitter could then be used to modify programming commands to the implanted device, which could result in rapid battery depletion and/or administration of inappropriate pacing or shocks." The vulnerable medical IoT devices were originally found by security researcher MedSec in August 2016. MedSec partnered with investment research body Muddy Waters Capital and released a paper to the public disclosing the device vulnerabilities; the security flaws include flaws in the encryption of the radio frequency protocol used by the Merlin@home Transmitter remote monitoring system, as well as a backdoors to the devices. At the time, St. Jude Medical denied the vulnerabilities' existence and subsequently filed a lawsuit against MedSec and Muddy Waters for defamation through false medical device security findings. The lawsuit remains ongoing. St. Jude Medical has been criticized for not addressing the vulnerable devices for five months since the initial disclosure, being called "a particularly aggressive and hostile vendor" in a statement by Justine Bone, CEO and director at MedSec, based in Miami. A separate statement from Muddy Waters also harshly criticized St. Jude Medical for the patches, saying "the announced fixes do not appear to address many of the larger problems, including the existence of a universal code that could allow hackers to control the implants." The statement from St. Jude Medical emphasizes the "extremely low cybersecurity risks" this vulnerability poses to the medical devices, and it advises users of the Merlin@home Transmitter to ensure it is powered on and connected to the internet so it can receive the automatic patch download. The bigger picture of vulnerable devices The FDA's guidance on handling the St. Jude Medical device vulnerabilities follows closely on the heels of its more general medical device cybersecurity guidance. Internet-connected devices are a growing security concern, and the FDA has focused on both general IoT device security and, specifically, medical IoT device security. "In today's world of medical devices that are connected to a hospital's network or even a patient's own internet service at home, we see significant technological advances in patient care and, at the same time, an increase in the risk of cybersecurity breaches that could affect a device's performance and functionality," wrote Suzanne Schwartz, M.D., in a FDA blog post from Dec. 27, 2016. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also addresses the security risks associated with internet-connected devices with a recently launched contest to create a tool to protect home IoT devices. In other news: The Email Privacy Act was reintroduced on Jan. 9 by U.S. Reps. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.). The act, which updates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), requires all government agencies to obtain a warrant to search citizens' electronic communications. Previously, under the ECPA, the government could search any email older than 180 days stored on a third-party server without a warrant. "As a result of Congress' failure to keep pace with technological developments, every American is at risk of having their emails warrantlessly searched by government agencies," Polis said in a statement. "The Email Privacy Act will update, and bring our archaic laws into the 21st century, and protect Americans' Fourth Amendment privacy rights, whether they're communicating through pen-and-paper mail or email. Americans justly demand this level of privacy, and I remain confident that the bill will swiftly pass Congress." The bill unanimously passed the House of Representatives in 2016 419-0, but it didn't make it to the Senate Judiciary Committee for a vote. Juniper Networks issued an advisory for a flaw in SRX Series firewalls that are upgraded using the partition option. The issue affects devices that are upgraded from Junos OS releases prior to 12.1X46-D65, but upgrading to a version of the OS without the flaw won't fix the problem. The flaw allows root logins without a password. While upgrading to an unaffected OS doesn't get rid of the flaw, according to the security bulletin, "the symptoms are immediately obvious after an affected upgrade and may be remediated by rebooting the device post-upgrade." GoDaddy had to revoke more than 6,000 SSL certificates on Jan. 10 as a result of a software bug. GoDaddy learned of the bug on Jan. 6, though it was inadvertently introduced in July 2016. The bug affected approximately 6,100 GoDaddy customers -- less than 2% of the certificates issued since July 2016. "In a typical process, when a certificate authority like GoDaddy validates a domain name for an SSL certificate, they provide a random code to the customer and ask them to place it in a specific location on their website. When their system searches and finds the code, the validation is complete," explained Wayne Thayer, GoDaddy's vice president and general manager of security products. "However, when the bug was introduced, certain web server configurations caused the system to provide a positive result to the search, even if the code was not found." GoDaddy is reissuing the certificates -- 8,850 in total -- at no cost to the affected customers. On the same day the annual ESET security report praised the Microsoft Edge browser for having no exploits in the wild, two Edge vulnerabilities were reportedly added to the Sundown exploit kit. The two vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2016-7200 and CVE-2016-7201, include issues with the Chakra JavaScript scripting engine in Edge. They were first reported by Google Project Zero and were fixed by Microsoft in November 2016. However, a proof-of-concept exploit was posted Jan. 4 by security firm Theori, and the security researcher known as Kafeine confirmed the exploits are being added to the Sundown exploit kit. The timing is unfortunate, since ESET's "Windows Exploitation in 2016" report sang high praises of Edge, reading "It is worth noting that in the last year, no vulnerabilities have been found for the Edge web browser that are known to have been exploited in the wild. From our point of view, this situation with Edge was predictable, because, unlike IE11, Edge keeps modern security features turned on by default."

In a new ad posted Friday to YouTube, the computer technology maker pitches its “360 Replay Technology” — which the company said combines images from multiple high-definition cameras into seemless footage. The ad will air during the Super Bowl. Advertisement The apparent result gives viewers dramatic, swooping pans of athletes in action (it “makes anything look epic,” says Intel’s announcer in the ad), or in the case of this ad, Brady’s toothbrushing regimen. Sadly, it doesn’t appear Brady is wearing his specially designed athletic recovery sleepwear in the new ad.

It’s not a state of panic or anything like that for Oklahoma in the secondary, but you can feel the urgency from defensive backs coach Kerry Cooks. After a season where OU’s secondary didn’t play up to the standard Cooks had set in 2015, the goal is obviously to get back to that mark or be even better than what it was in 2015. One way Cooks seems to be doing that is by attacking the secondary without any position in mind for a lot of the recruits. It’s not about being a cornerback or a safety or a nickelback. It’s about being a defensive back that brings a variety of weapons to the table. You can see that in someone like OKC John Marshall’s Justin Broiles, now officially enrolled at OU and living in Norman. And you can see that in Cooks’ two latest offers made during the first day of the contact period Thursday. http://www.scout.com/player/193614-russ-yeast?s=73 Greenwood (Ind.) Center Grove ATH Russ Yeast (committed to Louisville) Yeast was a beast at the Under Armour All-America Game. Suppose the question here is going to be where does Yeast want to play? If he wants to stick on offense, then the Cardinals are his best bet. If he’s OK with looking at defense, then the Sooners should have a shot. Yeast is 5-11, which is right in line with the type of kids Cooks has been eyeing during the last year. Cooks is expected to visit Yeast early next week, and then we should all have a better idea of where things stand. http://www.scout.com/player/211191-sam-barnes?s=73 Richmond (Texas) George Ranch CB Samuel Barnes With Jaylon Johnson going out the door, it was back to finding a defensive back for Cooks. Heading into the week, all eyes were on Barnes. And boom, just like that, the offer was made to the 6-foot-1 athlete who has been racking up the offers here lately. Barnes said he didn’t have his visit schedule finalized when contacted by Sooners Illustrated on Thursday afternoon. It does feel like OU will get a visit from Barnes. And with the way OU has operated this recruiting cycle, next week would feel like the weekend. Sooners seem to want to have as much of this class done by the final weekend as humanly possible. “Reserve your spot” has carried the day with this cycle, and it will again here. Right now? These are the two defensive back prospects. The Sooners will definitely not take both of them so whoever is willing to make the call first, is going to be rolling with the band.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Baylor Adds Athletic OL Jason Moore Watch: Packers edge Cowboys on last-second FG Pac-12 Battle for Speedy WR Travell Harris?

Predictions, Pt. 4: Great Expectations for Blockchain, AI, and Robotics January 13, 2017 by Jacqueline Prause 128 January 13, 2017 by Jacqueline Prause 128 Cognitive is the new “smart.” Use cases mushroom around blockchain distributed ledger technology. Finance gets excited about robotics process automation.  And for the kids, augmented reality livens up K-12 education. Those were some of the amazing predictions shared by the experts who appeared this week on Coffee Break with Game-Changers  2017 Predictions Special – Part 4 presented by SAP. Host Bonnie D. Graham asked 16 leading experts, academics, and business influencers what they see in their crystal ball for 2017. Each person was given just two minutes to share their predictions for what the next year holds for their industry, business, the world, and technology. Here’s what they had to say: 1. 2017 is about breaking the hype bubble around digital transformation on two major fronts: getting to meaningful use cases and consolidating technology. For meaningful use cases, Go-to-market and the business models around Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are the biggest challenge. The hyper-focus is going to be on use cases that can scale. For consolidating technology, this year is about stopping the insanity with IoT platforms. We’re at the peak of platform proliferation. – Jason Shepherd, Director of Strategy and Partnerships, Internet of Things (IoT), Dell 2. There are four big game-changers in 2017: Artificial Intelligence (AI) will help us think of cognitive as the new “smart”; augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) will go mainstream; 5G technologies will be on the road in autonomous self-driving vehicles; blockchain technology will gain broader adoption. – Bridget Karlin, Managing Director, IoT Strategy and Technology Office, Intel Corporation Cognitive is the new ‘smart,’ predicts Intel’s Bridget Karlin for 2017. 3. AI is going to go mainstream in 2017, both in ways you can see and in ways you can’t. We know that over half of corporate executives are investing heavily in artificial intelligence. It’s showing up in visual search; enterprise operations with cognitive computing and semantic matching; retail assortment planning and offer management; and semantic recognition. – Jeff Goldberg, Managing Director for Retail in North America, Accenture 4. Manufacturers are increasingly embedding sensors and technology into their products to make them smart. More of these devices are communicating with, controlling, or reacting to one another. This will continue in a big way, but most importantly, small to midsize businesses and manufacturers will start to gain a true competitive advantage from this technology. This will lead to an escalation of data collecting, analyzing, and sharing at these businesses. 2017 will be a big year for data management. – Jeff Doneghue, Director, Product Lifecycle Management & Engineering Services, BUNN 5. 2017 is going to be a phenomenal year in IoT. Cost will go down due to narrow-band IoT. IoT is going to be exposed in terms of high-value solutions to enterprise and industrial users. As a result, more things will be connected and the value – not the cost – of those things will increase. That’s going to ultimately drive a lot more data. You’ll see increased interest in deeper analytics, machine learning, and AI. With this sea of data, we’re going to need to create value quicker. – Fred Yentz, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Telit 6. There’s going to be a big increase in location-based marketing. Companies are going to start to leverage all kinds of sophisticated tools. They’re going to be able to track your mobile to the point that they know exactly what you’re going to be doing at what time; they’re going to know what context you’re going to be in – whether you’ve just entered a store or if you’ve just finished brushing your teeth. This will give the marketers the ability to target you in a very personalized fashion. Privacy will get pushed further behind. – Lil Mohan, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Marketing, University of Chicago Booth Graduate School of Business 7. My prediction is that organizations are going to focus much more attention on what Google calls ZMOT, Zero Moment of Truth. They’re going to train sellers to focus on delivering great experiences and engagement throughout the buying process. Sales leaders will need to make a greater investment in training and coaching their people to develop into the consultative, problem-solving, solution collaborators that buyers are expecting. – Barbara Giamanco, President, Social Centered Selling 8. In 2017, we’ll see more robotics coming into the supply chain area. We’ll also see more centralization and creation of centers of excellence in the supply chain due to lack of talent and the need to concentrate key capabilities and skills into more central positions. – Tanguy Caillet, Executive Director, EMEIA Center of Excellence for Supply Chain and Analytics, EY 9. I’m really excited about augmented reality in education, particularly in the K-12 world. There was an announcement by Google of being able to do some projects in a museum that allow you to use augmented reality in a Pokémon Go-like format. That could have huge, far-reaching effects with education of younger kids. – Charlie Cole, Chief Digital Officer, TUMI 10. There’s no doubt that healthcare reform is going to be a topic this year. Medical identity theft is an $84 billion dollar a year problem. Payment fraud is another problem. Also, electronic medical records have 10 percent duplicate records. A combination of these issues is creating a disturbance in the quality of data that physicians have at the point of care. Solving these problems is going to have to be the focus this year if we’re really going to get serious about value-based care. – Thomas Foley, Global Health Solutions Strategy Manager, LenovoHealth 11. In 2017 we’ll see the launch of autonomous cars. They’ll first appear in cities around a shared-ride model or shared-car model, and also in heavy transportation. – David Fowler, Senior Director for Services Marketing, SAP America 12. Excitement is coming to the world of finance. We’ll see more things like robotics process automation and cognitive learning capabilities helping to speed up mundane activities like entering invoices. – Srikanth Tamma, Senior Manager, Technology Practice, Deloitte Consulting 13. Small businesses are optimistic about 2017. Two studies show: businesses that plan, track, and monitor grow 30 percent faster than those who don’t; and 60 percent of businesses that fail were profitable when they failed. Business technology can make it much easier to plan and, most importantly, monitor cash flow. I predict that in 2017 we’ll see more small businesses moving all or part of their accounting and business processes to the cloud. – Linda Hamilton, CPA 14. Customer experience and design will be recognized by more companies. The word to watch is “convergence” – meaning online and offline convergence, hardware and software convergence, analog and digital convergence. For example, companies that are creating analog services will add some digital aspects, and companies offering an offline service will add some online aspects, too. – Janaki Kumar, VP and Head of Design and Co-Innovation Center, SAP Labs Palo Alto 15. Blockchain distributed ledger technology will mature. There will be a lot of little breakthroughs this year, and recognition of its broader applicability is going to grow. Today people associate it with Bitcoin and payment technology, but there are so many ways to put the technology to use. Walmart uses blockchain to establish authentication and traceability in its food chain; a French financial services company started a blockchain project to establish compliance with customer rules; and there’s an anti-counterfeiting blockchain service that can be used for authenticating diamonds and luxury goods. – Robert Kugel, CFA, Senior Vice President and Research Director, Ventana Research 16. HR needs to begin the evolution of not just using the term “cloud technology” but will also need to show the value to their organizations and how they will leverage that technology. – Tony Cusat, VP Operations, Globalview, ADP You can hear the full show at SAP Game-Changers 2017 Predictions – Part 4 SAP Game-Changers Radio 2017 Predictions Special – Upcoming Show For dozens of other insightful predictions that can impact you and your business in 2017 and beyond, listen to all five episodes of SAP’s Game-Changers Radio 2017 Predictions Special.

WhatsApp, its owner Facebook or even the US government can access user messages due to an encryption loophole discovered in the application, The Guardian newspaper reported, citing a security expert at the University of California, Berkeley. “If WhatsApp is asked by a government agency to disclose its messaging records, it can effectively grant access due to the change in keys,” Tobias Boelter told the newspaper. The security backdoor involves the application resending offline users' messages with new encryption keys, unknown to both senders and receivers. The rebroadcasting theoretically allows WhatsApp or Facebook to tap into conversations to read single messages or entire conversations, according to the researcher. © Photo: Collage Germany Bans Mass Data Exchange Between Facebook, WhatsAppBoelter stressed that the feature is not inherent in the WhatsApp Signal protocol, adding that Facebook was warned of the backdoor undermining user privacy but responded stating this was expected and was not being addressed. WhatsApp, which is used by around one billion people, has been at the center of a privacy controversy since being acquired by Facebook in 2014. The social network at first pledged not to interfere with the existing privacy rules and to minimize the number of advertisements, but privacy policy changes came about in 2016, allowing more data sharing between the two platforms. The data sharing was halted after the European Union charged Facebook with providing misleading information on its merger with WhatsApp. ...

You could get a double dose of Tom Brady at the super bowl if his patriots make it to the super bowl you'll see him on the field throwing touchdown passes but also see him during the commercial breaks making pancakes and brushing his teeth. Intel 360 replay makes anything look epic. Reporter: Just over three weeks to go till game day and getting our first look at a super bowl commercial. Literally anything. ??? Reporter: Tom Brady stars in this ad for Intel showing off its 360-degree replay technology. Wait till you see it in the game. Reporter: Super bowl ads are expected to be $5 million for a 30-second spot. Companies are prereleasing ads to get the most bang for their buck. If they get people talking about their ad early it's got Tom Brady who's football royalty. Reporter: Own others revealing enough to keep us hungry. Snickers has "Star wars" guy, Adam driver. I will finish what you started. Companies advertising like Snickers with their creative ads are trying to tap into popular culture and a certain zeitgeist. He's eating doritos. Reporter: Some are skipping the game altogether. Don't expect to see staples like doritos or butterfinger but Intel is hoping to score with Tom Brady whether he's on the field or not. Enough, they get it. You're loving that, weren't you, stra? I wanted to hit him. You still want to hit people? For old time's sake. Intel, the first time they advertised in the super bowl technology used during the broadcast that 360. I guess Brady is not afraid of jinxing himself. It's great. He has four rings. He's all right.

HTC also launched its latest range of handsets, the U Play and U Ultra, which can tell owners what to wear and when to set their alarm through an intelligent assistant called Sense Companion. In weirder news, the Hushme mask promised to block the sound of a wearer's voice when on the phone to prevent bystanders eavesdropping.  Here's a roundup of some of the best gadgets that also caught our eye this week:  Smartphone that can read fat content Chinese television manufacturer Changhong has teamed up with molecular sensing experts to create a mobile phone that can analyse the fat content of food and people, as well as the chemical make up of of physical products. The Changhong H2 can help owners pick the sweetest punnet of strawberries Credit: SCiO  The Changhong H2 smartphone has an in-built SCiO sensor, a near-infrared spectrometer, that can detect molecule types by bouncing light off a physical product or liquid.  It can provide the properties of food, drinks, medication and human bodies to help consumers authenticate their pills and eat healthily. For example, users can check how sweet strawberries are before buying them and monitor their body fat. The phone also has a 16-megapixel camera and fingerprint sensor.  Wireless 'merged reality' headset  The latest VR headset to enter a busy field is Intel's Project Alloy, a prototype of a 'merged reality' device that combines scans of objects in the real world with those in the virtual. It has been designed for a wireless experience that will let users play VR games and move around the room without a tether.  Project Alloy is a 'merged reality' headset that's completely wireless Credit: Getty Intel is teaming up with major headset manufacturers to produce the device, with production expected towards the end of this year. In a demo of the system, the company showed how Alloy can transform objects in a room into obstacles in a game to help gamers immerse themselves. It is one part of the chip maker's future-gazing projects that utilise 5G communications.  Turn your Apple Watch into a monitor  If you place the Apple Watch on its side while charging, it displays the time in a way that’s easy to read in the dark, but the sight of the watch attached to its charger isn’t exactly elegant. Accessories company Elago has a neat solution: a stand that looks like the original Macintosh. The accessory makes a mini-monitor out of an Apple Watch Credit: Elago Pop the charger round the back and clip the watch’s strap around the stand, and you’ve got a miniature version of the iconic computer, which was released in 1984. Unfortunately, you can’t change the Apple Watch’s sleep screen to make it match the Macintosh's retro cool. App to help keep New Year's resolutions The Nagbot chat bot was created to help people keep up their New Year's resolutions. It sends periodic nagging messages to guilt-trip and remind users to stick to their goals. Nagbot helps users keep their resolutions Credit: Nagbot For example, it will ask if they have performed a task they said they would. When it gets a positive response it praises the user, but sends abuse in the event of a negative.  Nagbot is accompanied by an app where users can check their progress over time.  ces 2017 weirdest gadgets   Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Gadgets Mobile phones Apple Watch Apple Show more Technology latest 14 Jan 2017, 11:00pm Comment: Fake news on Facebook probably isn't that influential, until it bubbles out into the open James Carson Premium 14 Jan 2017, 3:04am Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton leaving after 13 years for top role at Snapchat firm 13 Jan 2017, 4:42pm Could buying Twitter and shutting it down be Mexico's answer to Donald Trump? 13 Jan 2017, 4:21pm Nintendo Switch to be released on March 3 at UK price of £280 13 Jan 2017, 1:07pm WhatsApp messages could be read by exploiting security backdoor 13 Jan 2017, 11:04am Nintendo shares drop as high price of Switch console dismays investors Gallery 13 Jan 2017, 11:01am Gallery: From The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to Shenmue 3: the 40 most anticipated video games of 2017 12 Jan 2017, 4:25pm Nintendo Switch: 6 questions to be answered 12 Jan 2017, 12:59pm HTC U phone tells owners to wear extra clothes if it's cold 12 Jan 2017, 11:06am Peace sign selfies could let hackers copy your fingerprints 12 Jan 2017, 10:28am Facebook is working on ways to read thoughts, job adverts suggest 03:39 11 Jan 2017, 4:54pm Nintendo Switch: Price, release date and everything else we know 11 Jan 2017, 2:00pm Instagram to show more adverts by putting them in Stories 11 Jan 2017, 1:07pm Comment: Why are robots still so rubbish?

If at all, very few people want a manual gearbox. Pounding a clutch back and forth in rush-hour traffic in a city like Lagos for instance, may be hellish for many motorists. Sector statistic shows that only 3.9 per cent of cars sold in U.S. were built with manual transmissions. In fact, in 20 years to come it may not be out of place to say that knowing how to manually drive a car may not be necessary at all. Radar, lidar, GPS, odometry, and computer vision may be all that car owners require to get their cars moving. Driverless car, otherwise called autonomous or self-driving car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. It uses advanced control systems to interpret sensory information. The control systems help it to identify appropriate navigation paths, obstacles and relevant signage. Google and General Motor, same organisation that first introduced automatics transmission to the market in 1940 may have been in the news, when it comes to driverless cars than any other organisation but demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars did not start with them. The development date back to the 1920s and 30s but what could be called the first truly autonomous cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University’s Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich’s Eureka Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organisations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Until recently, self driving cars seemed like a dream that can only become feasible in decades to come. But the innovation is fast becoming a reality. More than a fiction, it appears set that the development will alter the future of mobility. Most carmakers and technology giants, including Co-founder of Google, Eric Schmidt believe that your car should drive itself. “It’s amazing to me that we let humans drive cars… It’s a bug that cars were invented before computers,” Schmidt said. Transportation entrepreneur, who co-founded Zipcar, Robin Chase, shares Schmidt opinion. He is optimistic that driverless cars are “three-and-a-quarter years away”. This is in line with projections that years of trials on city streets, may translate to the possibility of having the innovation on roads by 2020. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) said levels of autonomous driving technology begin from zero to five. Level zero is no assistance. Level two is the level at which all semi-autonomous systems on the road are at currently. Level three extends to “some driving modes but handle elevated levels of automated driving in given parameters. At level four, almost full driverless is attained but it is limited to “some driving modes.” Level five is full autonomy. With some vehicle already driverless partially, recent timeline of self-driving cars shows Volvo releasing 100 self-driving cars on public roads in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2017, a self-driving car startup that spun-off from Google late last year, Waymo, will be deploying its fleet of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans onto public roads for the first time later this month. Ford will release an autonomous car without a steering wheel, brake or throttle pedals, designed for ride-sharing by 2021. Toyota’s Research Institute, formed in 2015, aimed at rolling out cars with semi-autonomous features in 2020. BMW and Mobileye confirmed they would test 40 self-driving vehicles on the road by the second half of 2017. Nissan-Renault already announced Seamless Autonomous Mobility. Tesla also started installing hardware that can enable full autonomy. General Motors is expected to gain an advantage in the self-driving car space by conducting tests in snowy conditions. A Chinese internet company referred to as the Google of China, Baidu will test self-driving cars on public roads soon. Tesla is also looking at driving from Los Angeles to New York 2017 with its self-driving Tesla. Semi-autonomous Hyundai recently navigated on local streets around the Las Vegas Convention Center alongside other vehicles. Should self-driving car becomes a reality, the automotive sector will witness series of changes. One of such development will be witness in safety. Experts believe that humans are no good at driving as such the innovation would drastically reduce the 1.2m people killed every year on roads worldwide. Cars will park themselves, there will be free time, congestion is also expected to reduce. If congestion reduces, building new roads may be necessary. Highways Free time it’s planning to release Automobile industry think self-driving vehicles will be on the road by 2020 or before, says Richard Holman, head of foresight and trends at General Motors driverless vehicles are now nearing the live phase Yet we have barely begun to think about how they will revolutionise our lives, revamp our cities — and destroy tens of millions of jobs. pipe dream relegated to a far-off decade in the future. But then, last week, Ford announced that in 2021 it’s planning to release an autonomous car without a steering wheel, brake or throttle pedals, designed for ride-sharing. Just a few days later, Volvo and Uber made public their partnership to develop a driverless car. Now, it seems autonomous cars aren’t just a fanciful future prospect but rather something tangible — and a real part of mobility in the near future.The Ford and Volvo/Uber announcements, though, highlight the different approaches each company working on autonomous driving technology is taking. For example, some, like Audi, are introducing autonomous systems slowly into their products to indoctrinate their buyers to the tech. Others, like Ford, are jumping straight to driverless cars. Accordingly, we’ve compiled an alphabetical autonomy timeline encompassing the announcements and plans of the leaders in the space. What’s more, we’ve underlined the technology that each company aims to utilize to drive its driverless cars. SAE automated driving levels The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) said levels of autonomous driving technology begin from zero to five. Level zero is no assistance. Level two is the level at which all semi-autonomous systems on the road are at currently. Level three extends to “some driving modes but handle elevated levels of automated driving in given parameters. At level four, almost full driverless is attained but it is limited to “some driving modes.” Level five is full autonomy. to “all driving modes . Level 1 is defined by systems like collision mitigation braking that automatically brake if a collision is imminent. . These include acceleration, braking and steering assistance. ” By that, it means the car can— like on a freeway during the daylight. However, it’s expected that the human driver can take over driving duties, if asked. SEE ALSO: Mercedes’ new all-electric Maybach coupe concept puts Tesla to shame Level 5 takes full autonomy to “all driving modes.” That means the car is fully capable of driving itself anywhere in any condition, from a snowy, moonlit road to an unmapped desert. It should be noted that, at this point, Level 5 is theoretical. One Audi representative went so far as to describe it as “mythical.” It’s unlikely we’ll see Level 5 autonomous driving in our lifetimes. Audi 2016 — Level 2: Audi’s Level 2 “Traffic Jam Assist” system is available on the 2017 Audi A4 and Q7. The system uses steering input to keep the car in its lane. What’s more, it allows the driver to take his or her hands off the wheel in slow-moving traffic for 15 seconds at a time. However, the driver can’t check out or turn attention away from the road, as he or she must intervene immediately if prompted by the car. 2018 — Level 3: Audi pledges to be the first carmaker to introduce Level 3 autonomy to the road with its next generation A8 full-size sedan. The A8 will debut Audi’s Traffic Jam Pilot system. It will handle accelerating, braking and steering up to 35 mph. However, there are many parameters and limitations to engaging Traffic Jam Pilot. It will need to have no fewer than two cars ahead of it and it will need to recognize, based upon information GPS and other outward-facing sensors, that it is on a freeway. Its cameras will also detect whether the road is clear enough for ideal operation. It won’t be activated on a snow-covered road, for example. The car will also require specific driver conditions before Traffic Jam Pilot can be engaged, too. It will need to detect a driver in the driver’s seat. What’s more, the car will include a camera-based driver awareness system that will look to see if the driver is awake and not incapacitated in some way (suffering a pulmonary embolism, for example). 2020/2021 — Level 3 Plus: Two or three years after the first application Level 3, Audi will roll out what it’s roughly defining as “higher” Level 3. That means it will take the capability of Traffic Jam Pilot and extend it up to full freeway speeds. It will require the same freeway verification from GPS and other sensors before it is engaged. Audi will include in each car an event data recorder Additionally, with Level 3, Audi will include in each car an event data recorder (think an airplane’s black box). It will record the driving data directly preceding a collision, should one occur. Don’t worry, Audi won’t be recording all your driving data. The event data recorder will be constantly deleting the data it collects, if a collision doesn’t take place. Late 2020s — Level 4: Full highway and urban autonomy. These functions will only be allowed in pre-mapped and geofenced areas. That means these cars will not be able to drive autonomously everywhere. You couldn’t ask the car to autonomously drive from Los Angeles to New York, for example, unless the route were mapped and programmed. Tech: GPS, LIDAR (Light Imaging, Detection And Ranging), short- and long-range radar, and no fewer than two digital cameras will be needed for Audi’s autonomous cars. In total, Audi’s autonomous cars will have around 24 sensors with almost 360-degree redundancy. In addition, the cars will include redundant steering and braking systems. BMW 2016 — Level 2: With the all-new 7 Series, BMW introduced several new Level 2 technologies: Traffic jam Assistant and driverless automated parking. Traffic jam Assistant can follow the car ahead on the highway and can read lane markings and add corrective steering to keep the car in its lane. This system works from 0 to 43 mph. European versions of the new BMW 7 Series feature a self-parking function that doesn’t require a driver inside the car. With the car’s key fob, a driver can exit the vehicle and direct the car into a parking spot. However, that function is not available here in the U.S. Tech: Radar, digital cameras. 2021 — Level 4: Marking its 100th birthday earlier this year, BMW announced that it has also pegged 2021 as the year during which it will unveil a fully autonomous car. It’s called iNext and not only will it be autonomous, it will also be intelligent, lightweight and the “next generation of electro-mobility,” according to BMW chairman of the board Harald Krüger. The flagship iNext autonomous car will be created in collaboration with Intel and MobilEye. Although BMW has not yet specified any other dates for unveiling autonomous driving systems for its cars, the trio (BMW, Intel and MobilEye) have said they will create platform-based “future-proof” test cars by 2017 in order to hit the stated 2021 goal. This platform will tackle, as BMW puts it, “‘eyes off’ (Level 3), ‘mind off’ level (Level 4)” ‘driver off’ (Level 5).” Tech: BMW hasn’t indicated specifically which tech will drive drive its autonomous cars, except Intel Atom and Xeo processors. Ford 2019 — Level 2: In 2019 (or within three years of 2016), Ford plans to introduce two Level 2 autonomous systems: Traffic Jam Assist and Fully Automated Parking. Confusingly, Ford’s Level 2 system will carry the same name as Audi’s Level 3. Traffic Jam Assist, like other Level 2 systems on the road today, will follow a car ahead in traffic and control braking and acceleration as well as steering to keep the car in its lane. Tech: Radar, digital cameras and ultrasonic sensors. 2021 — Level 4: Ford announced in August that in 2021, it will have driverless ride-sharing cars without a steering wheel, or brake or accelerator pedals. Unlike Audi and Nissan, which are slowly ramping up autonomy step by step from Level 2 to 3 to 4, Ford is jumping several steps and going right to 4. While there could be many reasons for this, presumably price is the leading factor. At first, the cars will be prohibitively expensive to sell in Ford showrooms Since it’s five years out, Ford doesn’t yet know what platform these cars will ride on, what they’ll look like or what will power them (gasoline or electrified powertrains). Ford did divulge that these cars will not be initially available for purchase by customers. That could change, however, as the cost of the onboard tech goes down. Likely, at first, the cars will be prohibitively expensive to offer up in Ford showrooms. And because Ford is keen to make autonomy available to the masses as quickly as possible, it doesn’t want to keep the tech relegated to extremely expensive luxury vehicles like Audi’s flagship A8. It’s important we understand why these Ford steering wheel-less cars are Level 4 and not Level 5. As we discussed earlier, Level 5 is defined by the SAE as a car’s ability to drive autonomous in ‘all driving modes.’ The Ford cars simply won’t be able to do that. They’ll only be allowed to operate in 3D-mapped, geofenced locations. Imagine, then, that these will operate in a few heavily mapped urban environments. So, unless you live in one of the first markets for the Ford autonomous cars, it’s unlikely they’ll be a regular part of your life in the near future. Tech: LIDAR, radar, digital cameras, 3D maps, 4G connectivity and, according to a Ford representative, possible vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) communication technology. Honda 2016 — Level 2: Unlike the luxury brands on this list, Honda has pushed its Honda Sensing suite of autonomous driving technologies down into its most affordable models, including the $20,440 Civic Sedan. Honda Sensing includes Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) that follows the vehicle ahead, and Lane Keep Assist (LKAS), which uses a forward-facing camera that watches lane markings to keep the vehicle in its lane. Honda Sensing also includes Forward Collision Warning, Collision Mitigation Braking, Lane Departure Warning and Road Departure Mitigation Further bucking the trend of other systems on this list, Honda Sensing can be activated at any speed. Although it’s not locked to highways and freeways by GPS- or camera-based data, it’s recommended for use on freeways and not backroads or urban environments. 2020 — Level 3: By 2020, Honda aims to have basic automated highway driving from “on ramp to off ramp.” Honda is being very conservative with its promised automated timelines beyond that, however. As such, it is hesitant to give specific dates for fear of missing them due to unforeseen technical or legislative hurdles. That said, Honda contends it is at the forefront of automated vehicle research. Honda has divulged, though, that by 2020 it also wants to integrate Wi-Fi-based vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technology into its vehicles. Allowing cars and infrastructure to communicate with one another will add an extra level of automation. 2040: Ultimately, no matter where its automated tech is, be it Level 3 or 4, Honda aims to have no crashes in Honda or Acura vehicles by 2040. Tech: Radar, digital cameras, Wi-Fi-based V2V and V2X. Kia 2020 — Level 3: Kia announced at CES 2016 that it is launching an autonomous driving sub-brand called “DRIVE WISE.” Additionally, the Korean carmaker benchmarked 2020 as the date by which it would introduce its first semi-autonomous tech. Although Kia is in the fledgling stages of developing its semi- and full-autonomy tech, it’s already named some of the systems. They include Highway Autonomous Driving (HAD), Preceding Vehicle Following (PVF), Emergency Stop System (ESS) and Traffic Jam Assist (TJA). 2030 — Level 4: Kia also announced that by 2030 it would be ready to introduce full autonomy. These include systems it’s calling Urban Autonomous Driving (UAD) and Autonomous Valet Parking. Tech: HAD relies on radar and cameras. UAD utilizes GPS and exterior sensors to identify the car’s position on the road. It also will rely on live traffic updates. Like Audi, Kia’s Driver Status Monitoring (DSM) system in its autonomous cars will monitor the driver’s face and if it detects he or she isn’t paying attention, the car will move to the side of the road and come to a stop. Benz interiorMercedes-Benz 2016 — Level 2: In 2013, Mercedes released its first Level 2 automated driving system, called DISTRONC PLUS with Steering Assist, which we tested on the Mercedes-AMG C63 S last year. Since then, the German automaker has released its newest and more robust Level 2 system, DRIVE PILOT, which debuted on the 2017 E-Class. DRIVE PILOT is fairly robust for a Level 2 autonomous system. Like Honda Sensing, it can control braking and acceleration at or above regular highway speeds. It also allows the driver to go hands-free for as long as 60 seconds at a time up to speeds of 81 mph. Distinctively, DRIVE PILOT can autonomously change lanes, if a driver indicates a lane change with the turn signals. Of course, if it detects a car in the other lane, it won’t carry out the maneuver. The 2017 E-Class is the only production car that has been granted an autonomous driving license in Nevada. That means, DRIVE PILOT is far more capable than Mercedes allows it to be in its current form. However, Mercedes engineers have retarded the capabilities of DRIVE PILOT for the E-Class to ensure drivers understand that they are ultimately responsible for the safe operation of the car. Additionally, the all-new E-Class is also the first production car to include V2V technology. At first, this means all new E-Classes will be able to communicate important road and driving information to one another. In the future, as other cars receive the tech, this means E-Classes will be able to communicate with other cars as well — not just its brand mates. In addition to cars, Mercedes is testing autonomous semi trucks here in the U.S. and in Europe. In fact, it has been sending “platooning” fleets of self-driving semis across Europe this year with the intention of integrating driverless tech into commercial trucking in the near future. Tech: Radar, digital cameras, and V2V. Nissan 2016 — Level 2: Nissan announced earlier this year that by 2020, it will have not just one but 10 fully autonomous models on sale. It also laid out its roadmap for how it will get there, adding a new level of autonomy every two years. This year, the Japanese automaker will introduce its first Level 2 system called ProPILOT. This system will be first introduced to the Japanese market in the new Serena minivan. Nissan will then introduce it to the European marked in 2017 in the Qashqai crossover. Nissan hasn’t yet said when the tech will be debuted for the U.S. market. At this level of ProPILOT, the car will have what Nissan is calling “single-lane control” in heavy, stop-and-go traffic on highways. 2018 — Level 3: Two years later, in 2018, Nissan will introduce ProPILOT 2.0 with “multiple-lane control.” ProPILOT 2.0 will add autonomous lane changes to the ProPILOT capabilities. 2020 — Level 4: By 2020, Nissan plans to reveal ProPILOT 3.0 with “intersection autonomy.” This will take Level 4 autonomy into the urban centers. Although Nissan hasn’t specifically divulged it, it’s likely that — as with Audi and Ford — these cars won’t be able to go anywhere. Instead, ProPILOT 3.0 activation will be limited to heavily mapped areas. Tech: Similar to other carmakers, ProPILOT and its variants will rely on radar, digital cameras and hi-def mapping technology. A Nissan representative admitted detailed maps will be required for ProPILOT 3.0, which indicates it, too, will be limited in its operational availability. Tesla 2015 — Level 2: Late last year, Tesla unveiled the now infamous Level 2 Autopilot system, which is part of a suite of driver assistance systems. These include Autosteer, Auto Lane Change, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Side Collision Warning and Autopark. Setup Timeout Error: Setup took longer than 30 seconds to complete. Autopilot has been implicated in several crashes around the globe since its debut. Most notably, a Tesla driver died in a crash in Florida in early May with Autopilot engaged. He was reportedly watching a Harry Potter DVD while his Model S was operating in Autopilot mode. Until Mercedes released its DRIVE PILOT, Tesla’s Autopilot was the only semi-autonomous system on the market that allowed for autonomous lane changes. This is not its only distinction, however. Autopilot is, from the driver’s standpoint, the most robust system currently on the market. It’s that robustness that’s gotten Tesla in trouble, though. Specifically, Consumer Reports recently called on Tesla to disable and rename Autopilot until it was made safer. Notably, Autopilot is in public beta-testing. In fact, Tesla is the only carmaker beta-testing autonomous tech on the public. All other carmakers relegate testing to its engineers and employees. Tech: Radar and a digital camera 2018 — Level 4: Tesla won’t confirm the exact timing of Level 4 autonomous driving or the tech sensors that will drive higher levels of autonomy. However, Elon Musk said in late 2015 that Tesla was two years away from full autonomy. Tech: It’s unclear what tech Tesla plans to add to its cars to enable higher levels of autonomy. That said, during the launch of Autopilot, Elon Musk revealed the company was gathering hi-def digital maps with its cars. Likely, this information will be utilized to implement Level 4 autonomy in future products. Volvo 2016 — Level 2: For the 2017 model year of its vehicles, like the S90 sedan, Volvo introduced Pilot Assist, a semi-autonomous driving system. Like other Level 2 systems, it follows traffic ahead and keeps the car within its lane. Though, that’s not the only news Volvo has made in the autonomous driving realm for 2016. This summer, Volvo Cars and ride-sharing service Uber announced they were joining forces to develop autonomous driving cars. 2017 — Level 4: Intriguingly, Volvo is skipping Level 3 and going straight to Level 4. However, it won’t be a broad-scale rollout — at first. The Swedish carmaker has said it will have 100 autonomous cars testing on the roads Beijing in 2017, as a part of its Drive-Me program. Volvo plans to lease autonomous cars to customers in Sweden that year as well. These cars will be Level 4. Like so many other brands, the first autonomous Volvo cars will only be able to drive themselves on highways known to the GPS system. This is more than an estimation, though. Volvo has already detailed what its self-driving car interface will look like. What’s more, Volvo has even announced that it is working with Ericsson to stream your favorite shows in the dashboard of your autonomous car in the future. Think its Concept 26 autonomous car interior, but in real life. 2020 — Though Volvo will be achieving Level 4 before 2020, it has made two projections for that year. First it aims to offer autonomous cars to the public — likely on a broader scale than in 2017. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it has long promised that no one will be killed or seriously injured in a Volvo by 2020. Of course, autonomy is the ultimate safety system. So, it makes sense that large-scale implementation of Level 4 autonomy would intersect with that safety benchmark that year. Tech: Volvo has openly listed the tech that will allow its future cars to drive autonomously. They include (but are not limited to) trifocal cameras, ultrasonic sensors, surround view cameras, surround radar, long-range radar and combined radar and camera units.

And this year was no exception, with thousands of pieces of new technology making their debut in Las Vegas. After approximately 50,000 steps over the course of four days, we have picked out the best of the best on show at . From brilliant laptops to amazing automotive technology this is our choice of the products which wowed CES, and which we think will be some of the finest things to buy this year. Best of show: Amazon Alexa Having made its debut on the Amazon Echo, Alexa was everywhere at CES. Whether you were looking at a simple wall-mounted speaker or a multi-thousand dollar television Alexa was likely to be built in. How useful Alexa will be when it's part of your car we're not sure, but clearly Amazon's approach of making Alexa open and getting into as many devices as possible is working. Best laptop: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon The fifth generation of the X1 Carbon ThinkPad takes the reliable, bullet-proof feeling design of its predecessors and adds a smaller bezel which brings the laptop closer to a 13in design's size despite having a 14in screen. And, at 1.12kg, it manages to include a battery which lasts a long, long time – like 15 hours or more. This is a beautiful, well-crafted machine which will run all day. What more can you want? Best computer peripheral: HP OMEN X35 Curved Display Curved displays aren't new, but HP's OMEN X35 Curved certainly represents a new benchmark for monitors for gamers or anyone who wants incredible performance from their display. It's also one of the first monitors to adopt Nvidia's G-Sync technology, designed to reduce tearing when a lot of things are happening on screen. In a category which some might claim lacks innovation, HP has managed to create a product which everyone will lust after. Best VR/AR product: Intel Project Alloy High-quality augmented reality is computationally tough, which is why Intel's Project Alloy is so impressive. Not only does it give you what Intel calls a “mixed reality” experience, capable of replacing real world objects with digital ones that you move around it does so with a completely self-contained headset. What's more, when we had a chance to test it out, we found it comfortable to wear. It's not ready for production yet - battery life is definitely an issue - but it's a glimpse of a really amazing future. Best tablet: Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 The XPS 13 was pretty-much everyone's favourite laptop of last year, thanks to its combination of excellent design, long battery life, and a beautiful edge-to-edge screen. Now Dell has created a version of it that's a tablet too, one which makes the case for having a separate laptop and tablet harder to make. It's thin, light and well-balanced enough to make a great tablet, while also being a sleek, well-designed laptop. What more could you want? Best fitness tech: Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F20 Last year's Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10 (snappy name, eh?) was an impressive first attempt at the smartwatch, but the new F20 version fixes the obvious omissions (GPS) and adds some great fitness features (downloadable maps, a more rugged design) to create a great fitness-focused smartwatch for the outdoor life. And if your hike is really long, you can switch the screen to monochrome mode and get a month's battery life out of it - enough to take you up Mount Everest and down again. Best automotive tech brand: BMW It's getting to the point where CES is becoming an important automotive show in its own right, with most of the major manufacturers there. This year's stand-out car maker was BMW, which demonstrated its HoloActive Touch interface system. This combines a gesture control system with touchscreens and tech similar to that of head-up displays to create a whole new interior layout. It's all very “Minority Report” - but you're going to be able to buy it before too long.

According to multiple sources, this dossier had been obtained by many news outlets and was the talk of the town among Washington people who are “in the know” on these kinds of things. There is now a raging debate about whether or not Buzzfeed should have made these documents available to the general public – with most of the big media publications coming down on the side of “no.” Kevin Drum examines both sides of the argument and ultimately comes down on the side of “yes,” Buzzfeed was right to publish the dossier, as does Vanessa Gazari, writing for the Columbia Journalism Review. Within Gazari’s argument is an example of why – regardless of where you stand on the journalistic merits – I have so little patience for the pearl-clutching about this from big media. Several aspects of the mainstream media’s reaction demand further scrutiny. Some critics seem to be saying that unless the information in an intelligence briefing or other leaked document can be independently verified by reporters, it shouldn’t be published. But did reporters independently verify all the allegations against Hillary Clinton and her allies contained in the emails released by WikiLeaks? An October story in The Hill details the allegation that Donna Brazile passed a debate question to the Clinton campaign, and contains this caveat in the fourth paragraph: “The emails, which have been made public in batches by WikiLeaks, have been largely unconfirmed and are believed to have been stolen by Russian intelligence.”…Why was it acceptable to publish that story based on an email, and not documents whose content intelligence officials considered important enough to share with the president and president-elect? I can think of another example. In April of last year, the NYT published a story titled, “Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal” that was largely based on information from the book “Clinton Cash” by Peter Schweitzer – who worked for Steve Bannon’s Government Accountability Institute at the time. I’ve written previously about how Bannon and his pals weaponized stories that were fed to the mainstream media. In this case, the NYT took the bait and ran with it. The contents of that article wound up in a Trump ad during the 2016 campaign with allegations of “pay for play” against Clinton, which were ultimately debunked at FactCheck.org. Beyond the practice of publishing unverified rumors that suggest pay for play, we here at the Washington Monthly were pretty outspoken during the election about the way outlets like the NYT covered stories on the Clinton Foundation and her emails. Here is the kind of thing we heard pretty regularly back then: Does the new batch of previously undisclosed State Department emails prove that big-money donors to the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation got special favors from Mrs. Clinton while she was secretary of state? Not so far, but that the question arises yet again points to a need for major changes at the foundation now, before the November election. Let’s re-write that and see if it fits in the current situation: Does the new batch of previously undisclosed reports prove that the Trump campaign coordinated their efforts with Vladimir Putin and the Russian government? Not so far, but that the question arises yet again points to the need for major changes in the incoming administration. The constant refrain we’re hearing from major media outlets right now about why they didn’t release this dossier is that they haven’t been able to verify the information. What I would like from them is an accounting of the time, effort and money they have invested to do so. As of yet, none of them have proven the information contained in the reports to be false (other than saying that it was a different Michael Cohen who travelled to Prague last summer). What we don’t know is whether the information can’t be verified or if they’ve even tried. We currently have a lot of information about what Russia did to influence this election and how both Trump and his team have not only praised Putin, but built much of their foreign policy in a way that would benefit him. The possibility that ANY of the information contained in that dossier might be true would make the whole Watergate fiasco (which brought down a president) look like child’s play. Nothing is more important right now than getting to the bottom of this one. So spare me your pearl clutching, major media…it’s time to get to work on this story!

Credit: Panasonic More like this The new faces of tablets Battle lines drawn as Chromebooks, Windows PCs renew rivalry at CES Panasonic's 5-inch 'handheld tablet' redefines tough Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Intel is phasing out Atom chips from mobile devices and has scaled back Android development for such devices. But Panasonic has come out with a new tablet with an Atom chip and Android 6.0 anyway. Panasonic's new Toughbook FZ-A2 has a starting price of $2,189, and its Atom x5-Z8550 chip is a big problem. Atom chips are almost disappearing from tablets, especially devices with Android. There are also questions about whether the Toughbook will get upgraded to the newer Android 7.0, code-named Nougat. Panasonic didn't provide a response to the query. Panasonic's release of the new Toughbook with Android is an interesting move, especially as other PC makers abandon Atom and excitement around Android tablets fade. Dell last year stopped selling Android tablets -- which had x86 chips -- and won't be delivering OS upgrades to its existing Venue devices. Last year Lenovo started offering the Atom x5-Z8550 chip in its Yoga Book 2-in-1, which can be purchased with Windows or Android. The Yoga Book is unique as it replaces a hard keyboard with a virtual keypad, much like on tablets. At the time, Lenovo had to turn to Atom as the chip was ready for Android. But now, Intel is focusing on Windows, and promoting low-power Core, Pentium, and Celeron chips for tablets and 2-in-1s. The chipmaker continues to work with Google on Chromebooks and IoT devices using the Brillo OS, which is based on Android. Most Android tablets have chips based on ARM architecture, which dominates the mobile market. Panasonic's Toughbooks are known for their rugged features. The Toughbook FZ-A2 is water resistant and can withstand a 1.2-meter (47-inch) drop. The tablet is not targeted at average users. It's for enterprise users and field workers who use tablets in harsh conditions. Panasonic also offers rugged tablets with Windows. The Toughbook FZ-A2 has a 10.1-inch screen with a 1920 x 1200 pixel resolution. The tablet offers nine hours of battery life. The battery is replaceable. With all its aging technology, the tablet is keeping up, with a USB Type-C port, a USB 3.0 port and Wi-Fi. The tablet can be bought with 4G LTE capabilities. It also has Bluetooth 4.2.  To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

It adds the first touchscreen that any Mac has had, updates to new(er) Intel processors and AMD graphics, and makes a swathe of behind-the-scenes usability changes. It's the sum total of those small changes, though — not the new processing power or the not-exactly-amazing battery life — that make the new MacBook Pro a worthwhile purchase if you're considering one. What Is It? The late-2016-into-2017 Apple MacBook Pro is the first design refresh in four years for the most powerful portable notebook that Apple currently produces. It's thinner and lighter than the now very outdated MacBook Air, aggressively abandons old connection standards in favour of USB Type-C across the board, and upgrades to a brighter and more colourful display and a much, much larger Force Touch trackpad. And, of course, it runs macOS. You're able to buy a MacBook Pro from a starting price of $2199 in Australia for an entry-level 13-inch model, which you can spec up to $2999 for the top 13-inch or as much as $4249 for the best possible 15-inch variant. That $2199 won't get you the new MacBook Pro's most talked-about feature, though; the cheapest Touch Bar-enabled MBP is $2699 in Oz. 13-inch models get a Core i5 CPU and 256GB or 512GB SSD as default, while the 15-inchers have Core i7s; you can spec any machine up to an i7 and larger SSD, though, although the best processors and 2TB SSDs are restricted to 15-inch only. The Touch Bar is an interesting compromise between a touchscreen laptop display — as seen on Apple's direct competitor from Microsoft, the Surface Book — and good ol' fashioned keyboard buttons. It replaces the old row of 12 function keys on the previous MacBook Pro with a fully customisable, touch-sensitive OLED panel with TouchID. It's still an interesting move by Apple not to make the Pro laptop touch-enabled across its entire screen, but that's a move that would require significant work on its macOS operating system as well as on the hardware level. Those USB-C ports are all multipurpose, too — you can use them all for charging, for data, or video, or any other transfer standard that USB-C supports, as long as you have the right cable or a dongle. Apple claims up to 10 hours of battery life from all of the different MacBook Pro 13- and 15-inch models in its regular wireless web browsing tests, but it's worth noting that the new 87-Watt power adapter that connects over USB-C will charge the laptop much faster than its predecessor. I'll go into detail on my varied experiences of the MacBook Pro's off-charger battery life performance later on, but I will say now that when you visit a charger to top up you'll get plenty of battery reserve back very quickly. What's It Good At? The biggest and most important updates to the new MacBook Pro, I think, aren't under the hood: they're on the outside. Most obvious is the noticeable improvement in usability that the new MacBook Pro's keyboard and trackpad bring. It's absolutely true that there's a not-exactly-shallow learning curve to using the Pro's incredibly short-travel keyboard, which it has inherited from the 12-inch retina MacBook, but once you're used to the key positioning, it's a joy to use. I can blast through emails and longer articles — like this review — at a greater speed and with greater accuracy on the MacBook Pro's keyboard than on the Logitech mechanical keyboard that I use on my desktop PC daily. The Touch Bar is an interesting development, and while it definitely feels like a first-generation device — it's not incredibly high resolution, it doesn't have bespoke controls in every app — it's also a very very smart idea. Having a fully customisable panel in front of your fingerprints means keyboard autocomplete and autocorrect is instantly as easy as it is on an iPhone, choosing an emoji from the list that pops up is simple, and apps like Photoshop that have integrated Touch Bar support do it very well. Being able to choose a colour by swiping your finger across the panel is a quantum leap over a keyboard. And the larger trackpad is equally as important. It's massive, and that helps a lot for general navigation around MacOS as well as gestures like pinching and zooming around apps like Maps. The new screen, too, is much brighter, and that's a godsend whenever you're working anywhere that you can't control the lighting within. It's two thirds brighter than the last generation at 500 nits, and that level also means it's one of the brighter easily-portable laptops out there. If you need a notebook that you can work on while you're out in a cafe, while you're sitting outside, while you're travelling on a train or a bus on the way to work in the morning, the MacBook Pro kicks ass. It supports DCI-P3 wide colour and has two thirds more contrast than the last generation, but what you need to know is that it just looks good. Being smaller and thinner and lighter means that the MacBook Pro — and remember this is a Pro, with a full-fat Intel processor and fast storage and discrete graphics on the 15-inch model, not the lightweight Core M of the 12-inch MacBook — is actually portable. It's the first iteration of the MacBook Pro that I'd actually carry to work and back with me every day, in the same way that I've been doing currently with the Surface Pro 4. You don't make the usual sacrifices of thin and light laptops, either — for example, the MacBook Pro has speakers that don't sound terrible. What's It Not Good At? Over the past couple of weeks of road-testing, the battery life of the MacBook Pro has been... mediocre. Not abysmal, but just not particularly impressive. It's understandable, though: the new MacBook Pro has more going on than the old one ever did. A lot of that comes from the extra power required by that massively bright 500-nit screen and the Touch Bar and the better backlighting of the redesigned keyboard, as well as the more powerful processor and new discrete graphics. With the screen at high brightness and wireless working away actively, I've seen battery life in the region of five hours, half of Apple's testing. For what it's worth, recharging that battery with the fast USB-C charger happens quickly. Apple's timing for the update of the MacBook Pro means that it uses Intel's sixth-generation Skylake mobile processors, rather than the seventh-generation Kaby Lake chips that are starting to appear in competitor notebooks post-CES. That's a pity, because the new chips are both more powerful and more energy-efficient. That doesn't make the MacBook Pro any less good, but it does mean that there will be competing machines from the likes of Razer and Dell and Lenovo that may have superior battery life or more outright grunt. The switch to Thunderbolt 34 and USB Type-C is a Good Thing, and I won't hear anyone else say otherwise. I'm not blinkered enough to think that it's not going to be a difficult thing, though, for anyone considering an upgrade that still has a legacy device that they need to plug in regularly. Anything with a standard USB connector will need an adapter, any non Thunderbolt 3-compatible monitor will need a converter on its cable. It's possible to upgrade other components of your setup when you buy a new MacBook, but that's just an extra cost to consider. And it's one small price to pay for the relentless march of technology, but have you noticed that the new MacBook Pro doesn't have that beautiful glowing Apple logo on the top of its lid any more? I miss it. Should You Buy It? The new MacBook Pro is, in so many ways, a huge and quantum improvement over its predecessor. It's smaller and thinner and lighter and has a brighter screen and a better keyboard and a bigger trackpad and more powerful processor and you can unlock it with your fingerprint. If you've used a MacBook Pro from the last generation or two generations ago, every one of these improvements should be useful to you in some way. But the road to the future is paved with difficulties and failures along the way. You have the potential to use the new MacBook Pro's batter faster than you could on the older models. The Touch Bar still feels like a work in progress, and you'll probably have to wait for your favourite Mac app to make the best possible use of it in the months and years to come. You'll need new cables or bulky dongles, for now at least, to use those Thunderbolt 3 ports. It's worth it, but it's not an entirely painless upgrade. This story originally appeared on Gizmodo Comments NegativeZero @negativezero Jan 13, 2017, 6:08am They're very nicely engineered laptops but are still ridiculously expensive for the hardware that's in them, and with more and more companies making well-engineered laptops in the same style that have vastly better hardware for the price, it's really hard to justify unless you're really enamored with OSX. Reply 1 luffy_luck @luffy_luck Jan 13, 2017, 9:12am I agree. The MPB are nice, but I don't have 3k laying around for this hardware. For this price I can buy a decent laptop and build a good desktop... Reply 0 NegativeZero @negativezero Jan 13, 2017, 10:25am $3599 AU for a model that actually has a discrete GPU in it, though what it has is an anemic Radeon 450. At least you don't have to drop 4 grand to get the GPU now, I guess. Reply 0 LadyVile @ladygrace Jan 13, 2017, 11:13am This is an ad not a review. Reply 0 stevothegodamneddevo Guest Jan 13, 2017, 12:53pm sorry, no! I was a long time OSX apple hardware buyer/user but having spent $3.5K on building my own PC (m.2, 1080gtx, acer predator monitor, ssd, water cooling) I will never go back to buying such outrageously priced hardware from Apple ever again. Yes, i bought a desktop, this is a laptop, but nevertheless, it is outrageous! The new un-cool will be those suckers still buying into this crap. Reply 0 stevothegodamneddevo Guest Jan 13, 2017, 1:01pm forgot to mention... if you are reading this Apple, i'll be purchasing a surface book pro... at ~$1300, that's the price point for a decent laptop for the work I do. Reply 0 rammo123 @rammo123 Jan 14, 2017, 1:35pm for anyone considering an upgrade that still has a legacy device By "legacy device" do you mean 99.99% of all devices currently on sale? I'm a long time Apple fan but they've delved waaaay to deep into dongle hell with this one. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Packing a lot of power in a small package, HP has released an updated version of its HP ZBook 15u, a mobile workstation with prices starting at $1,079. While going to a mobile form factor often means sacrificing power versus traditional desktop workstations, the ZBook 15u offers a number of high end performance features. Buyers have a choice of Intel’s Core i5 or i7 processors, up to 32GB of memory, AMD FirePro graphics chips and up to 2TB of storage. The Windows 10 Pro notebook includes a 15.6-inch FHD touch or 4K UHD non-touch display. Mobility traditionally hasn’t been a top request for engineers, designers and others users of high-powered PC workstations. “There are millions of engineers who don’t see the light of the day,” Jon Peddie, president of Peddie Research, told eWEEK. “But there are also still plenty of folks who need to get out and about like architects going to a job site or someone working on an airplane. Even being able to easily move your system from the third floor to the fifth floor for a presentation is useful.” For these users Peddie says mobile workstations like the ZBook 15u are ideal. Traditionally, Peddie says mobile workstations have been underpowered versus their desk-bound systems, or very expensive to match that power. But he says HP and its chief rival Dell now offer powerful mobile workstations at a good price. “When you think about $1,079 for the HP, gosh you can easily pay more for a MacBook,” said Peddie. For users on the go, the system includes HP Fast Charge enabling a quick recharge of up to 50 percent battery life in just 30 minutes. The ZBook 15u also includes a number of security and manageability features including the HP Sure Start Gen3 which monitors in-memory BIOS watching for rootkit malware infections, recovers the platform without intervention, restores the BIOS to a custom state, and, according to HP, and is enterprise-ready for centralized management. The unit’s embedded Trusted Platform Module (TPM), Smart Card Reader and optional Finger Print Reader are designed to help secure data, e-mail and user credentials. The mobile workstation comes preloaded with HP Remote Graphics Software for remote collaboration, HP Performance Advisor for optimal performance and HP Velocity for more reliable and fast network performance. On the reliability front, HP says it put the ZBook 15u Mobile Workstation through 120,000 hours of testing as part of the company’s Total Test Process. HP said the mobile computer is designed to pass MIL-STD 810G standards. MIL-STD 810G is a military specification required for devices to be approved for use by all departments and agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense and is often used to benchmark commercial products as well. For transferring data and connecting to other devices, the ZBook 15u includes a number of ports including a USB 3.1 Gen 1 port and DisplayPort 1.2.

In an interview, Biden said neither he nor Obama asked U.S. intelligence agencies to try to corroborate the unverified claims that Russia had obtained compromising sexual and financial allegations about Trump. "I think it's something that obviously the agency thinks they have to track down," Biden said. He added later, "It surprised me in that it made it to the point where the agency, the FBI thought they had to pursue it." Vice President Joe Biden gestures while speaking at a ceremony honoring 15 Detroit entrepreneurs, Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017, in Detroit. The entrepreneurs earned Motor City Match grants to open or expand their business in the city.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) In the hourlong session with The Associated Press and other news outlets, the vice president was sharply critical of Trump for publicly disparaging intelligence officials, saying Trump was damaging U.S. standing and playing into Russia's hands. He also took umbrage at Trump's comments accusing intelligence agencies of allowing the information to leak publicly and drawing a comparison to "living in Nazi Germany." "The one thing you never want to invoke is Nazi Germany, no matter what the circumstances," Biden said. "It's an overwhelming diversion from the point you're trying to make." Biden said that in the briefing he and Obama received from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and others, there were "no conclusions drawn" from the uncorroborated dossier, which was produced in August and then released publicly this week by the media. Biden said it was "totally ancillary" to the purpose of the meeting, which was to brief Obama on a report he ordered documenting Russian interference in the U.S. campaign. "As a matter of fact, the president was like, 'What does this have anything to do with anything?'" Biden said. He said intelligence leaders responded by saying "Well, we feel obliged to tell you, Mr. President, because you may hear about it. We're going to tell him," referring to Trump. Biden said intelligence leaders told him and Obama that they couldn't say whether or not the allegations were true or untrue. He said there was "hardly any discussion" about the allegations in the briefing. "Neither the president nor I asked for any detail," Biden said. But he added of the dossier: "I've read everything." Trump has vehemently denied the allegations included in a dossier about close coordination between Trump's inner circle and Russians. The dossier also included unsubstantiated claims about unusual sexual activities by Trump, attributed to anonymous sources. The Associated Press has not authenticated the claims. Trump has denied them. The FBI has been working to corroborate the details in the dossier, although it's unclear how long that investigation has been running or how many resources are assigned. FBI Director James Comey has declined even to acknowledge the investigation publicly in line with FBI protocol. The dossier was compiled by a former Western intelligence operative and had been circulating among news organizations and intelligence agencies in Washington for months. Its existence became known publicly following reports the intelligence community had briefed Trump on the dossier. In the interview, Biden criticized Trump's rocky relationship with intelligence officials. The president-elect has publicly challenged their assessment about Russia's role in the election and suggested they have skewed evidence. Trump has received the President's Daily Brief, the highest-level intelligence document produced in the United States, a few times but has insisted he doesn't need it daily and suggested he knows more than intelligence leaders. Biden said it would be a "genuine tragedy" if Trump refused the daily intelligence briefing presidents traditionally receive. To illustrate his point, Biden took out the black tablet computer he uses to read his daily briefing and showed it to reporters as he sat next to a crackling fireplace in his office, just steps from the Oval Office. He said it is password-protected and includes a feature he uses to ask questions about the intelligence that are responded to the same day. Biden said at least five foreign leaders have already contacted him expressing concern over Trump's second-guessing of U.S. intelligence agencies. "It is really very damaging in my view to our standing in the world for a president to take one of the crown jewels of our national defense and denigrate it," Biden said. "It plays into, particularly now, the Russian narrative that America doesn't know what it's doing." After nearly half a century in public office, Biden will exit the national stage next Friday, although he plans to stay active in Democratic politics and work on policy issues at a pair of institutes he's developing at the University of Delaware and the University of Pennsylvania. He also plans to continue with the cancer "moonshot" effort he launched after his son died. Biden was full of praise for his successor, Vice President-elect Mike Pence. He said he's been sending Pence memos with his advice on how to handle certain relationships, such as with Iraqi and Ukrainian leaders, and on "the things that could explode most easily." He said Pence had been receptive to his advice but had less time these days to speak to Biden due to the heavy role he's playing in setting up Trump's administration. Biden said he's made his national security adviser, Colin Kahl, available to Pence but hoped Pence would quickly name a national security adviser of his own. "It would be better if they had been in a better position where he actually had somebody that Colin could sit down with every morning," Biden said. ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP In this Jan. 11, 2017, photo, President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. The outgoing president somberly ruminated about the fragility of democracy and earnestly implored Americans to reject corrosive political dialogue. Fourteen hours later, the incoming president staged a defiant and frenetic news conference at his gilded New York City tower, dismissing critics, insulting reporters and likening the country¿s intelligence officers to Nazis.

Eurocom, a developer of upgradable notebooks, has refreshed its Tornado F5 notebook with the latest Intel Core processors. Since it's in the upgrading mood, the company also took the opportunity to add Nvidia's top-end graphics cards to the mix. The new processor options for the Tornado F5 include Intel's Core i7-7700K, Core i7-7700, and Core i5-7600K units. Those two unlocked K-series CPUs might seem like odd choices for a notebook, but Eurocom lets users mess with the overclocking options in the UEFI. For graphics horsepower, buyers can fill the machine's MXM 3.0 graphics slot with Nvidia's GTX 1060, GTX 1070, and GTX 1080 cards, or go retro with the previous-generation GTX 970M or GTX 980M. Those components fit into a 15.6" laptop that's 1.59" (4 cm) thick and weighs 6.5 lbs (or 2.9 kg). The base model of the Tornado F5 comes with a 1920x1080 display, upgradeable to a 4K monitor for an additional $100. Both displays support Nvidia's G-Sync technology. The notebook has four memory slots that can take as much as 64GB of DDR4 clocked as high as 3200 MT/s. For storage, the Tornado F5 has two M.2 slots and room for a 2.5", 9.5-mm-tall drive. Prices for Eurocom's Tornado F5 can vary quite a bit based on its many configuration options, but go as low as $1,330 for a model with a Core i5-7600K and a GTX 970M. A model with a Core I7-7700K and a GTX 1070 can be had for just about $2,000.   Tags: CPUs Graphics Mobile computing User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani will advise President-elect Donald Trump on private-sector cybersecurity, the president-elect’s transition office said Thursday. Giuliani’s appointment comes one day after Trump doubled down on a pledge to launch a 90-day cyber review immediately after he takes office. It’s not clear who will lead that review or if it will be focused solely on government or will include critical infrastructure sectors or the broader private sector. Trump has suggested at various times both the Pentagon and the intelligence community will play a role. » Get the best federal technology news and ideas delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here. The president-elect argued in a press conference Wednesday the U.S. government has “no defense” against cyberattacks and is “run by people that don’t know what they’re doing.” Giuliani “will be sharing his expertise and insight as a trusted friend concerning private-sector cyber security problems and emerging solutions developing in the private sector,” according to a statement from the transition team. Giuliani was an avid supporter of Trump during the campaign. Trump will also be hosting occasional meetings with senior corporate executives to discuss “hacking, intrusions, disruptions, manipulations, theft of data and identities, and securing information technology infrastructure,” according to the release. Those meetings will not result in a formal report or consensus, the transition team said. It’s unclear from the announcement whether Giuliani will be leading the meetings. One goal of Giuliani’s work will be to prioritize cyber vulnerabilities based on input from the private sector and “solve those important ones first, and bring to the president and to his administration the things the private sector are doing,” he told reporters after the announcement. “It’s as if our offense has gotten way ahead of our defense," Giuliani said. “The president-elect is very much aware of this." Giuliani compared the group’s goal as bringing together cancer researchers from various places to work together on a cure. He described Russia’s hacking of Democratic political organizations, which intelligence officials say were aimed at boosting Trump’s electoral chances, as “obviously very notorious,” but part of a wider slate of cyber threats from China, Iran, North Korea and criminal networks. Giuliani is CEO of Giuliani Partners, an international security consulting firm that does cyber work, and is on leave from a position as chair of the cybersecurity, privacy and crisis management practice at the Greenberg Traurig law firm. Giuliani Partners recently announced a deal with BlackBerry to use software developed by the mobile phone company to assess the cybersecurity of government and corporate clients. BlackBerry was long the leader in supplying mobile devices to government, but its popularity has waned in recent years, partly because of concerns about the company’s long-term financial stability. “As the use of modern communications and technology has moved forward at unparalleled speed the necessary defenses have lagged behind,” Trump’s transition team said. “The president-elect recognizes that this needs immediate attention and input from private sector leaders to help the government plan to make us more secure.” recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT Remove Cloud IT “Blind Spots” with Application Visibility Data Analytics Bring Transportation Infrastructure into the Future Agile, OSS and Cloud Strengthen Government’s Mission This Database Can Help Government Transition FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    President-elect Donald Trump was "very happy" to hear from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on Wednesday night, and to hear the Intel chief agrees there should be no leaks occurring, incoming presidential counsel Kellyanne Conway said Thursday. "Why intelligence officials or other people are leaking to the media, rather than making sure that the president-elect and President [Barack] Obama himself, are briefed on sensitive information, I think is really the point here," Conway told NBC's "Today" anchor Matt Lauer, while refusing to comment about whether she herself believes a negative report alleging Trump's ties with Russia came from the intelligence community. "What I believe doesn't matter," Conway said. "Here's what does matter: What matters is that the president-elect had a briefing by the four top intelligence officers in our nation last week. We were very happy to receive them here at Trump Tower and for the president-elect and vice president-elect to get that briefing. No sooner do they have that, people are leaking information." Clapper, she continued, has emphasized the intelligence community is giving "no credibility and voracity to the fake news documents, and that's important here." However, she did not answer directly whether Trump believes Clapper's comments. "You'll have to ask him what he believes," Conway said. "What he believes is we are at a fraught time that we have leaks of sensitive information on political purposes. We agree, as do all Americans, that's dangerous stuff. Our hands are tied because we can't discuss private, sensitive information. And yet, others are doing it." Conway also discussed Trump's plans for his businesses, saying Thursday "legal experts are happy with what he's doing," and he is making "enormous sacrifices. The holdings of this successful businessman, over decades is unprecedented for our presidency." Trump, she said, will step away from all to do with the Trump Organization, but Lauer said Trump is making it sound "like his plan of avoiding conflict of interest is 'trust me.'" "That's not fair at all," she told Lauer. "He had his lawyer up there yesterday. Anybody can pull the information. She read the whole statement publicly. "Why always the presumptive negativity against Mr. Trump when he is trying to comply with the law and satisfy any ethics concerns that people have? He is making an enormous sacrifice here." MSNBC chief legal correspondent Ari Melber, also on the program, said he does not think Conway was being accurate by saying people are being presumptively negative. "I have never as a lawyer or a reporter, heard of a concept you would take something bad like a gift, and say you will accept it, process it, and donate it later," Melber said. "If it's bad, don't take it. "If it's not bad, if that's their argument, this is normal business, fair market value, they shouldn't have to donate it in the first place. We don't know who Donald Trump owes. He comes to Washington owing no one." Trump should release his tax returns and information about all outstanding debts, Melber continued, and he thinks Trump's plan to add an ethics adviser is "meaningless." "This is a person that would be hired and fired by Donald Trump," Melber said. "The Office of Government Ethics does exist as a different layer, and there's lawyers at the Justice Department more independent. We're seeing not any collaboration with them, as past presidential administrations have done."

The Intel Community Has It Rachel Stoltzfoos Reporter 10:44 AM 01/12/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP   Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina November 8, 2016. REUTERS/Chris Keane    5418707 U.S. intelligence officials included a “disinformation” report on the Clinton Foundation in briefing materials prepared for Donald Trump, but unlike the explosive allegations against Trump, that batch of rumors has not made it into the press. Intel briefers included the documents on both Trump and Clinton in the briefing materials they prepared regarding Russian meddling in the election, reports NBC News. Although neither document made it into an oral briefing to Trump, the briefers wanted them available in order to contrast analyzed intelligence with unverified “disinformation” campaigns. While the dossier of explosive rumors regarding Russian dirt on Trump made it into print Wednesday, little is publicly known about the unsubstantiated allegations regarding the Clinton Foundation. News the FBI opened investigations into both the Clinton Foundation and Trump’s alleged ties with Russia came to light during the presidential campaign. The dossier on Trump was compiled by a former British spy who was paid by both Republicans and Democrats to dig up dirt regarding Trump and Russia. The salacious report made the rounds in Washington and was brought to the attention of the U.S. intelligence community, but neither the intel community nor motivated journalists were able to verify any of its claims. Journalists held off on writing about the dossier, since it was totally unsubstantiated, until CNN used news of its inclusion in the briefing materials Tuesday to bring it to public attention. Buzzfeed then published the full document, and a flurry of damaging headlines for Trump followed in The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and other prominent news outlets. Totally lost in the furor over these reports, however, is talk of the Clinton Foundation dossier. Its existence alongside that of the Trump document further derails the narrative first constructed by CNN that the intel community is worried in particular about the explosive allegations against Trump. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper decried leaks to the press from the top secret briefing in a statement Wednesday, and said categorically the intelligence community has not made a judgment as to the veracity of the Trump dossier. “We did not rely upon [the dossier] in any way for our conclusions,” Clapper said, also putting into question CNN’s report that it was used by intel officials to justify their conclusion that Putin wanted Trump to win.

This is the all new ASRock Z270 Gaming K6 Fatal1ty edition with nice black/red looks and an AURA RGB LED system that can be controlled from the EUFI BIOS. ASRock enhanced a thing or two on this motherboard, including an easier to tweak environment, dual M2 slots, enhanced audio and two Gigabit jacks from Intel. Kaby Lake processors for the desktop platform have been released and even though you'd think it is an all new chip, it is however merely a respin seen from Skylake, meaning both series processors are Socket 1151. This also means that IF you are in the market for a new series 7000 processor, your H170 or Z170 motherboard can be compatible with Kaby Lake after a motherboard BIOS upgrade. The new series Kaby Lake processors are fairly energy efficient, still as powerful as they have been for years. If you are interested in new technologies like Intel Optane, you will however need to upgrade to a Z270 and H270 range motherboard. This new Z270 platform offers supports for Optane SSDs and offers supports for slightly faster DDR4 memory.      As you are going to find out, Gaming K6 Fatal1ty edition proper looking motherboard with black and red color elements. The motherboard has been fitted with the latest that technology can house like up-to 3866+ MHZ XMP DDR4 memory, the fastest NVMe PCIe and M.2. storage unit support (two of them) and some really nice looks.  The K6 thus comes with two M.2. slot. The steel armored PCIe slots pop out, and ASRock improved on the Realtek 1220 audio codec by using Nichicon capacitors for this 7.1 channel audio ready setup, as well as a Creative Labs Sound Blaster Cinema 3 software suite bringing a 120 dB SNR to this platform.       Much like pretty much all other motherboard anno 2017, RGB LEDs are here as well. ASrock once again did it clever though, no nagging forced to load up software in windows, no you can control it from the BIOS. Obviously there is a lot more going on, what we like for example is that this motherboard offers two Intel Gigabit Ethernet jacks. Armed with that Z270 chipset this motherboard offers three x16 slots: 1x PCIe 3.0 x16and three 3.0 x1. But yeah. But let's get on with the review, next page please.

In addition, these AMD Ryzen processors are the company’s entry-level CPUs that aimed to take on Intel’s i3 and i5 CPUs on the desktop. AMD Ryzen CPU: An Affordable Quad-Core, Unlocked, 45W CPU Despite being placed in the entry-level tier of Ryzen processors, these quad-core CPUs are still similar to their high-end brethren. These entry-level CPUs are going have an unlocked multiplier, as well as full support for overclocking using an X370 and B350 chipset. It is important to realize that B350 and X370 chipset are both AM4 motherboards. Hence, these CPU lineup is expected to be the most potent gaming chips in their tier. Intel’s entire i3 and i5 lineups cannot be overclocked due to their locked multiplier. And this is where the entry-level AMD Ryzen CPU comes in. AMD Ryzen CPU Efficiency When it comes to power efficiency, these quad-core Ryzen CPUs are expected to be very efficient at around 45 watts. In addition, these processors will sport a base clock speed of 3.4GHz or even higher. At the present time, it’s not clear whether AMD will offer eight core and six core Ryzen CPUs with simultaneous multi-threading disabled. Furthermore, reports suggest that the company won’t be offering any Ryzen SKU with less than four cores. Hence, this would give the consumer the best value for their money. AMD Ryzen CPU Release Date The said processor lineup is expected to hit the shelves before March 3, according to a report from the website Anandtech. This is a very good news for the people who are looking forward to AMD’s latest processors. Additionally, AMD’s new processors should hopefully bring competition in the CPU market.

Several of these shifts have happened at Las Vegas’ annual CES trade show, offering hints of what we’ll see in the coming year. But at CES 2017, some of the most important VR projects were downright unpleasant — and that may not be a bad thing. In the fall of 2016, Microsoft VP Terry Myerson took a pointed swipe at the year’s freshly released batch of virtual reality headsets, casually dubbing them “less immersive accessories” compared with a new Microsoft project. Why? Because, Myerson claimed, Microsoft had perfected inside-out tracking: a nascent technology that could make VR vastly more convenient and accessible, by getting rid of external tracking systems. Now, inside-out tracking seems set to become the big VR trend of the year, though it might still make you a little dizzy. Inside-out tracking isn’t just a geeky specs bump; in fact, it could be one of virtual reality’s great equalizers. High-end headsets currently use external cameras or sensor setups to let people move around in VR. More affordable mobile systems, meanwhile, have no positional tracking at all. Inside-out tracking inverts the traditional setup: you put sensors on the headset itself, and they read cues like depth and acceleration, translating it into virtual motion. So high-end users wouldn’t need a camera-studded VR room, and mobile users could do far more with their headsets; they might even get less motion-sick in the process. In order to prepare for a big leap forward, VR had to take a step back Unsurprisingly, Microsoft wasn’t the only company interested; Oculus, for example, had already introduced an inside-out prototype called Santa Cruz. And at CES last week, the idea seemed to be taking off in earnest. Chip maker Qualcomm featured inside-out tracking on mobile headsets with a Power Rangers movie tie-in. Intel showcased it in a new version of its “merged reality” headset Project Alloy. Smaller companies like Pico and uSens appeared with everything from algorithms to near-finished hardware. A handful of major manufacturers, including Lenovo and Asus, revealed VR headsets they’d been working on with Microsoft. Many of these products are set for release later this year, making them more than an early experiment. But in order to prepare for a big leap forward, virtual reality had to take a few steps back — to the days of clunky prototypes and rough tech demos. Qualcomm’s tracked mobile headset For all their flaws, existing high-end VR systems are great at creating small worlds you can walk around naturally. But self-tracking headsets often haven’t reached that point. Unfortunately, making a VR headset that works on its own in an ordinary room is tough. It’s one thing for an external camera to find an LED embedded in the Oculus Rift, or for sensors on a headset to pick up on clear external markers. (The Vive actually uses inside-out tracking, but it only works with two carefully placed laser towers in the area, which doesn’t offer much freedom.) It’s another to have a computer look at the world and calculate position based on nebulous signals like depth and acceleration, without a fixed point of reference. “It’s like the invention of the mouse.” Still, for Youssri Helmy, CEO of machine vision company Eonite, inside-out tracking is a non-negotiable part of VR’s future. “It’s got to happen,” he says. “We think it's crucial. It's like the invention of the mouse with the GUI.” At CES, Eonite demonstrated 3D mapping software that headset makers can use to add inside-out tracking, as long as they include a depth sensor and motion-detecting inertial measurement unit (IMU). Helmy thinks that this kind of tracking is almost always preferable to external systems — “We as humans are inside-out only, right?” he quips when I ask about it. Eonite’s CES demo was innovative, but limited. Using sensors taped to an HTC Vive — without the laser tracking boxes — I could walk around a living room with the same rough dimensions and furniture placement as the real hotel suite. If I looked straight ahead at the walls, it felt almost as good as normal Vive tracking. If I looked down at the floor, though, the headset would lose its place and jolt me several meters away. Helmy says the demo was using a narrower-than-usual camera — something with a wider field of view would have solved the problem. But it was part of a running theme at the show: every inside-out, work-anywhere tracking system I tried involved some kind of awkward and revealing compromise. Eonite on an HTC Vive The three companies that seem best poised to crack inside-out tracking are ones that didn’t actually show it off at CES: Oculus, Microsoft, and Google. Oculus’ self-contained headset is the best I’ve ever tried; whether because of technical prowess or just well-controlled demo conditions, I never felt like I was sacrificing performance for freedom. Microsoft put excellent room-mapping capabilities into HoloLens, so it’s in a strong position to do the same for VR. And at CES, Google announced the first phone that includes both Tango depth sensing cameras and Daydream virtual reality, two systems that seem fated to merge. But Microsoft’s partners didn’t let anyone turn on the headsets they showcased, and Oculus sat CES out almost entirely. Google emphasized that its augmented and virtual reality elements “do not overlap or integrate” in current phones. The fact that these companies didn’t demo inside-out tracking last week could suggest that it’s still not ready for the public. And doing VR tracking badly can be worse than not doing it at all. Perhaps the most ambitious and best-performing new headset at CES was Intel’s third-generation Project Alloy, which is supposed to mix real-world elements with virtual ones. We’ve seen some creative proofs of concept on Alloy, going far beyond ordinary VR. At CES, its RealSense cameras also came close to matching the Rift or Vive. The whole thing is wireless, and setup just requires scanning the room with Alloy’s camera beforehand. But in exchange for Alloy’s free movement and lack of unwieldy wires, I had to give up my hands. Instead of fully tracked motion controllers like the Rift or Vive’s, I got a remote that rotated in place, imitating a gun. I could shoot fine, but it destroyed the illusion of having virtual arms. The headset could theoretically do full motion tracking, but only if my hands were in view of the cameras. uSens inside-out tracking at CES Where Intel showed off a wireless high-end VR alternative, Qualcomm was taking VR to the lower end, with mixed results. My first experience with its phone-based prototype was exciting, but fairly bad. I could move around a simple virtual rendering of Zordon’s cave from Power Rangers, but when I leaned forward, the world just spun around me, as if it wasn’t sure what I was trying to do. I’d take a few steps, and the cave would slide to match my position. Nothing was jittery or blurry in the demo, but the world didn’t feel real either, especially compared to the sophisticated Vive experiments I’d been playing at HTC’s booth a few hours earlier. I lost my hand to a wedding ring Qualcomm later said that the problem was low lighting conditions, and it worked better in a show floor demo, not the cocktail party where I initially tried it. But it still had trouble picking up on small movements, which are important for preventing nausea or playing games. The same thing happened with a headset from Pico — the hardware looked great, but its demo made me dodge lasers and spike traps in a virtual body that always felt out of sync with my real one, until I finally gave up, slightly disoriented. And occasionally, a company aims to solve far more tracking problems than it can handle. uSens, creator of the Impression Pi headset, came to CES with a demo that combined augmented reality, inside-out tracking, and hand controls: you could pick up objects in a totally virtual environment, then use a hand gesture to open a portal to the real world, all while walking around with no external trackers. But movement was ponderous, gestures were awkward, and my left hand kept disappearing, apparently because my wedding ring reflection confounded uSens’ sensors. Like Eonite, uSens is primarily selling software. “We want something that is a comprehensive solution that works across the different types of devices that people bring home,” says uSens market strategist Raj Rao, hence the combination of features. Even if it’s far from perfect now, Rao says that machine learning will improve the algorithm as more data points come in — including, presumably, my overly glittery hand. Even if nobody’s created the perfect self-tracking headset, though, it’s one of the most obvious leaps that virtual reality — especially mobile VR — can make this year. The first generation of headsets is already on the shelves, and owners may not want to upgrade just for a higher-resolution screen or slightly better performance. But they might be sold on ditching their external cameras, or getting a mobile device with a major new feature. Meanwhile, people who wrote VR off as either too inconvenient or too limited could give it another look. If CES is any indication, lots of companies will be making that pitch in the coming months. Right now, they just need the hardware and software to back it up.

Published on January 12, 2017. Most Popular Intel Corp. is kicking off its second Super Bowl appearance since 2010 and using Tom Brady to do it. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based technology company will air a 30-second spot starring the Patriots quarterback between the first and second quarters. The ad (above) is the first pre-released Super Bowl spot of the season. The commercial touts Intel's 360 replay technology which offers a full, 360-degree look at key moments in sports, by featuring could-be-epic actions like Mr. Brady yawning, brushing his teeth and eating pancakes off the floor as music swells off-camera. The 360-technology will also be used during Fox's broadcast for the second year in a row. "We're not just marketing to the biggest TV audience, we're marketing and advertising the technology that connects to our brand story and promise," said Steve Fund, senior VP-chief marketing officer at Intel. "Intel makes amazing experiences possible and is directing people to look for that technology in the game itself."

Mr. Brady follows in the spokesman footsteps of swimmer Michael Phelps who appeared in a campaign last year. The quarterback has also recently appeared in ads from Footlocker and Under Armour. Mr. Fund noted that consumers can expect to see more athletes in Intel's future marketing. "Aligning ourselves with sports and a sports personality is a great way to bring to life this idea of performance," he said. Intel worked with McGarryBowen on the campaign; a social endeavor that compiles user-generated videos will be handled internally and released by video on Feb. 5. A 30-second spot in Super Bowl LI is costing marketers around $5 million this year, according to reports. In 2015, Intel spent $88.9 million on measured media in the U.S., according to Kantar Media.

Using proprietary algorithms to analyze U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data, IFI CLAIMS accurately ranks global patent assignees by number of utility patents received each calendar year. 2016 saw 304,126 utility patent grants, the most on record in a single year, according to IFI CLAIMS. IBM again holds the #1 slot, which it has for 24 consecutive years, with 8,088 patents—up nearly 10 percent over 2015 and the most any company has ever acquired in a calendar year. The other Top 5 recipients remain unchanged from 2015 with Samsung at #2, Canon at #3, Qualcomm at #4, and Google again at #5. All of the patents generated by the IFI CLAIMS Top 50 are attributable to just 11 countries. The U.S. holds 41 percent of those patent counts followed by Japan at 28 percent; South Korea at 15 percent; Taiwan at 4 percent; Germany at 2.6 percent and China at 2.5 percent. At 17 each, the U.S. and Japan are tied for the most assignees in the Top 50. Asian companies, however, now represent 50 percent of the total Top 50 counts and occupy 26 slots. Japan has long been a dominant player in the U.S. ranking, but according to IFI’s 2016 U.S. Patent Trends & Insights, its patent activity appears to be shrinking a bit this year with 12 of its 17 Top 50 firms reporting patent count decreases compared to 2015. IFI data show that Brother, Canon, Denso, FUJIFILM, Honda, Panasonic, Ricoh, SELC, Sharp, Sony, Toshiba and Toyota all saw decreases. Fueled by IBM and a host of West Coast tech companies, the U.S. saw patent increases from 10 of its 17 firms on the list including Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Boeing, Cisco, Ford, IBM, Intel, Microsoft and Texas Instruments. Interestingly, Apple increased counts but remained at #11. Unchanged at 2835 grants, Google still held onto #5 with #6 Intel close on its heels by only 51 patents. “Although it was a bit of a down year for Japan, Asia as a whole continues to make impressive gains with U.S. patents,” said Mike Baycroft, CEO, IFI CLAIMS Patent Services. “American tech companies are similarly motivated but it will be interesting to see how this path plays out in five or ten years. At this rate, South Korea, China and Taiwan will likely capture an even larger share of the U.S. patent market.” Big gainers in 2016 include Nokia, up 74%; Hyundai up 39%; China’s Huawei Technologies, up 50%; Amazon, up 46%; and Intel, up 36% over 2015. The biggest mover, according to Larry Cady, Senior Analyst, IFI CLAIMS Patent Services, is #22 GlobalFoundries, up from #60 with an impressive 131 percent gain over 2015. Registered in the Cayman Islands with operations in Santa Clara, Calif., GlobalFoundries gained patent momentum from recent IBM semiconductor acquisitions to achieve 1,407 utility grants in 2016 compared to 609 in 2015. The company also provides free online access to the IFI CLAIMS Top 1,000 rankings, a multi-year analysis of the global patentees that receive the most U.S. utility grants. One of the oldest and most trusted patent analysis firms, IFI CLAIMS Patent Services is known throughout the world as the gold standard tabulator of U.S. and global patents. For more than 60 years, clients have turned to IFI to assist with patent analysis and more recently as a means of tracking “total portfolio ownership.” The company tracks patent data worldwide including the U.S., Europe, Japan and China.

Intel started offering Next Unit of Computing (NUC) mini desktop computers back in 2013 when we got a Sandy Bridge Celeron model using HD Graphics 2000. Things have moved on quite a way since then in terms of performance, connectivity, and even the size of more recent NUCs. But one thing NUCs have always been is a little bit expensive when compared to similar tiny PC offerings from other manufacturers. The latest NUC may change that perception somewhat. As The NUC Blog reports, listings have started appearing for the Intel NUC6CAYS, which is a preconfigured NUC using a 10W Apollo Lake quad-core Celeron processor running at 1.5GHz with HD Graphics 500. It is paired with 2GB of DDR3L-1600 RAM, a 32GB eMMC flash drive, and a copy of Windows 10 Home. The price? Only $232. Considering Windows 10 Home typically costs around $85 when bought separately, that's quite a cheap NUC. Yes, the storage and RAM is lacking, but then both are upgradeable. RAM can be increased to a much more respectable 8GB (a cost of roughly $40), and there's a 2.5-inch drive bay which will hold a 9.5mm hard drive or SSD and connects via SATA (6GB/s). So that's around $60 for a 1TB hard drive or maybe spend $70 and get a 240GB SSD depending on your needs. Related Intel Unveils Kaby Lake Processors for Desktops, Workstations Intel Unveils Kaby Lake Processors for Desktops, Workstations Other key features of this NUC include a Gigabit Ethernet port, 802.11ac dual band wireless, HDMI 2.0 and VGA, four USB 3.0 ports, three USB 2.0 ports, and a stereo microphone/headphone jack. Intel will also be releasing a barebones version of this NUC, which will obviously be cheaper. How much cheaper we don't know ($170 maybe?), but if you plan on running Windows 10 anyway, the preconfigured NUC6CAYS may end up being the cheaper option.

"Made up, phony facts.Too bad!" the president-elect tweeted. James Clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated. Made up, phony facts.Too bad!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017 Clapper said late Wednesday he had spoken with Trump about a unsubstantiated document claiming Russia has compromising information about the president-elect. ADVERTISEMENT “I expressed my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press, and we both agreed that they are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security,” Clapper said in a statement. BuzzFeed late Tuesday published the controversial document, which was allegedly compiled by a former British intelligence officer. It alleges that Russia’s government possesses compromising financial and personal information about Trump. It also claims people close to Trump kept in touch with Moscow during the 2016 presidential race. Clapper on Wednesday said the report had neither been authenticated nor leaked to the media by the U.S. intelligence community. “I emphasized that this document is not a U.S. Intelligence Community product and that I do no believe the leaks came from within the IC,” he said. "The IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we do not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions." The intelligence community released a report last week that concluded Russian President Vladimir Putin called for an influence campaign to help Trump win the 2016 presidential election. Trump has fiercely dismissed similar reports, arguing they are attempts to undermine his victory. — This report was updated at 7:55 a.m. Tags Russia, Donald Trump, national intelligence, spying, Politics, Republicans   View the discussion thread.

OpenGL 4.2 Now Exposed For Intel Haswell On Mesa 17.0 Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 12 January 2017 at 07:39 AM EST. 6 Comments Days ago we mentioned the patches were lining up to get Intel's Haswell to OpenGL 4.2 and this morning those patches have landed in Mesa Git ahead of the branching for the Mesa 17.0 release. ARB_vertex_attrib_64bit and ARB_shader_precision support have landed, clearing the extensions to take Haswell generation graphics hardware from OpenGL 4.0 to OpenGL 4.2 compliance. This comes just days after Haswell finally got OpenGL 4.0 support with the FP64 support landing. Mesa 17.0 will be exciting for those with these older Intel IGPs going form OpenGL 3.3 to OpenGL 4.2, albeit no major boosts in performance. The later OpenGL 4.3~4.5 extensions are also complete for Haswell, but only GL 4.2 is flipped on for now until verifying compliance, passing the OpenGL CTS, etc. But even having OpenGL 4.2 for Haswell is a big step forward and will allow more OpenGL Linux games to run with Haswell, at least in theory, the performance may be another story. This work landed just in time for the Mesa 17.0 branching this weekend and feature freeze while the stable Mesa 17.0 release is expected in February. There's been no changes for the Ivy Bridge support and given the time crunch probably won't see changes for 17.0.

White offers her impression of the Surface Book 2. Sarah K. White (CIO (US)) 12 January, 2017 20:44 - - - - print email Comments When Microsoft held an event last October, everyone thought it was prepping to announce the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 or Surface Book 2. Instead, we got the new Surface Studio, Windows Creative Update and a beefed-up Surface Book i7 with Performance Base. The Performance Base addition brought a redesigned keyboard base to the device, while the tablet display remained the same. With the hope of swaying creative professionals away from Apple, these internal updates include an NVIDIA GPU, a 6th generation Intel Core i7 processor and a 1TB hard drive. I've used the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base regularly for the last month, and there's a lot that I love about the it. Even though it's a device targeted at creative professionals, it's a notebook that will suit anyone that values performance. Unmatched performance This should come as no surprise, but the performance on the updated Surface Book i7 has been consistently impressive. But when I talk about performance, it's important to remember that I'm not an artist, a 3D video editor or even a heavy gamer. Pushing the limits of my notebooks typically means I'm 100 tabs deep in Google Chrome or I'm rehashing my youth by playing The Sims 4. But the Surface Book happily encourages my pathological level of browser tabs without a single complaint. And light gaming was more enjoyable; everything ran faster and smoother than on my HP Spectre x360, which houses a 6th gen Intel i7 processor and integrated graphics. I wouldn't say it's worth spending over $3,000 on a notebook just to browse the internet with wild abandon and occasionally play The Sims 4 on the highest settings, but I can say my experience with the Surface Book this past month has truly spoiled me. If you need that level of performance, the Surface Book i7 is a strong contender and offers best performance you can get in this class of 13-inch notebooks. And, when you consider what it packs under the hood, it's incredibly thin and lightweight. [ Related story: Macbook Pro vs Surface Book i7 ] Portability While Surface Book i7 with Performance Base is a compact device for the performance it delivers, compared to other, less powerful 13-inch notebooks, it is kind of a beast. The display is a bit taller than your average 13-inch display, and with the dual cooling fans to support the improved GPU, it's slightly thicker and heavier than even the original Surface Book. And since I'm not someone who realistically needs that level of performance daily, I'd be more apt to grab the Surface Pro 4 if I'm travelling. The size and form factor are what would prevent the Surface Book from replacing my need for another device. But that's because my average workday consists of a steady Wi-Fi connection, the Microsoft Suite, Slack and, on rare occasion, Adobe Photoshop Elements. For me, carrying this updated Surface Book i7 on a work trip would feel excessive. I just don't need that level of performance on an average day and it would be too expensive to replace if stolen or damaged. If I needed to use 3D software or other high-powered design and editing software as part of my job, I I would be excited to travel with the Surface Book. It's certainly light and compact for someone who needs that level of performance, but for the average business user, or at least in my case, the Surface Pro 4 offers more than enough in a smaller package. [ Related story: 10 most popular hybrid tablet stories of 2016 ] It's not a tablet There's always a caveat to hybrid devices; they promise you both a tablet and notebook experience, but the truth is that they always fit more into one category. With its built-in trackpad and full Windows 10 OS, the Surface Pro 4 feels more like a notebook, while the iPad Pro, running iOS 10 and lacking a track pad, feels more like a tablet. They each fit different needs -- some people need a notebook more often than a tablet and vice versa. While the iPad Pro and Surface Pro 4 share more overlap in each category, the Surface Book is almost entirely a notebook that happens to have a detachable display. Without the keyboard dock, the tablet feels cumbersome and, since it lacks the kickstand on the Surface Pro 4, you can't just prop it up. Personally, I haven't found a need to use the Surface Book display as a tablet, and the same goes for my HP Spectre x360. I rarely find myself using either device in tablet mode, but I do frequently interact with the touch displays. I can see how if you were an artist, designer or worked in the field, the detachable display might be a bonus when combined with the Surface Pen. But for my personal needs, I'd be more inclined to reach for my iPad Air 2 or Surface Pro 4 before the Surface Book display. The little things There are so many minimal, thoughtful features that stand out on the Surface Book. The design is unique -- and love or hate the hinge, it's still a sleek device. Most of all, I appreciate that Microsoft nods to the industrial-chic design popularized by Apple without mimicking it the way other manufacturers have. Beyond the overall design, I also can't say enough good things about the Surface Book keyboard -- an often-overlooked feature on notebooks. It has the perfect key travel and the chiclet keys are spaced out just enough to make it comfortable to type. The Surface Book's trackpad offers just the right amount of responsiveness, especially compared to the hyper-sensitive trackpad on my HP Spectre x360. Battery life on the device is also unmatched -- thanks to the second battery. You can easily get through the day on one charge with light use. With heavier use, or if you're using battery draining peripherals like a wireless mouse, you can still get a solid six to eight hours before looking for an outlet. Buy now or wait it out? With so many hybrid rumors on the horizon for 2017, I can't help but wonder if the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base is just a taste of what we might see in the purported Surface Book 2. The updates in this case were purely internal and focused on packing in as much performance as possible. In the near future, there's the potential for 7th-generation Kaby Lake Processors and possibly even more graphics cards to choose from. Right now, the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base is so close to being the do-it-all notebook that can handle your work, editing, entertainment and gaming needs. But, considering the cost of this device at just over $3,000, I would say it's worth waiting to see what Microsoft has in store for the next Surface Book update. It reminds me of when the first Microsoft Surface was released -- the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base feels more like a taste of what's to come.

Windows Vista reaches the end of its life on 11 April. John wants to buy a new PC to replace his slow 10-year-old Acer Aspire. The Lenovo Ideacentre 510S. Photograph: Lenovo Jack Schofield Thursday 12 January 2017 04.41 EST Last modified on Thursday 12 January 2017 04.42 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close I have a 10-year-old Acer Aspire T660 desktop with 640MB of memory and Windows Vista Premium installed. The whole system is getting slower and slower, including the instruction to print documents and/or photos to my HP printer/copier/scanner. I use the PC for email, online banking, word processing and spreadsheets (Microsoft Office), Skype and some games. Broadband here to the house is poor. Should I get another desktop PC or a laptop? How much do I need to pay for a faster replacement which gives me the facilities I have now? I am retired (I’m 78) so I probably have a limited number of years ahead to enjoy a good replacement. John You must have an enormous amount of patience to run Windows Vista in 640MB or even 2GB of memory, and your best investment would have been to add as much memory as your PC could handle – in this case, 4GB. Sadly, it’s too late for that: it’s not worth spending money on a machine that is at the end of its useful life. On the plus side, almost anything will be a huge improvement. Desktop or laptop? You already have a desktop PC so you have the space, and you might be able to reuse your existing keyboard, mouse and screen. Desktops have more space inside for cooling so they can run hotter, faster, cheaper processors than laptops. They are also much easier to upgrade and to repair. As a result, desktop PCs last up to twice as long as laptops – in my recent experience, eight to 10 years rather than four or five years – so they are much better value. Desktop PCs also have better ergonomics – you can use them without hunching over – and usually have better keyboards and bigger screens. All of those are particularly beneficial to older users like us. Different types of desktop There are many different types of desktop PC. The traditional tower system is the most flexible, but there are dozens of smaller towers, including slimline and small form factor (SFF) versions. There are also lots of mini-and micro-desktops that are not very expandable, and may use the same chips you would find in a laptop. They have their uses, but they sacrifice functionality for what they save in space. Then there are all-in-one PCs, where the computer electronics are behind the screen. With these, again, you may lose the chance to do easy upgrades and repairs. Also, if either the PC or the screen fails, you lose the whole machine. Specification Today’s standard mid-range desktops have 8GB of memory, a 1TB hard drive, a DVD/RW optical drive and Microsoft Windows 10. Many also have built-in card readers and Wi-Fi, though you’ll get much better performance with the Ethernet cable you’re using with your Acer. All mid-range desktops should therefore cost pretty much the same. The biggest variation comes from the price of the processor. Intel has two main designs: Atom and Core. The Core chips are the fastest, and usually, the higher the code number, the better – and the costlier. The Atom chips are variously branded Atom, Celeron and Pentium. The Pentium versions are generally, but not always, better. Other things being equal, go for the fastest CPU, because it will last longer. You can compare speeds by using Notebookcheck’s Comparison of Mobile Processors (CPU Benchmarks). You don’t need to bother with the numbers: the higher up the table, the better. Anything in the top 200 is good. (My own 2011-vintage desktop is still in the top 100.) I’d have doubts about anything that didn’t make the top 500, with the quad-core Pentium N3700 (519th) or J3710 being as low as I’d go. Possible desktops My current cheap recommendation is the Lenovo Ideacentre 510S. This is a traditional tower available in a vast range of specifications, with plenty of useful ports on the front. John Lewis has a version with an Intel Core i3-6100 processor, 8GB of memory, 1TB hard drive and DVD/RW for £299.95. The 3.7GHz Intel Core i3-6100 is remarkably quick for an i3 chip, and can be almost as fast as a Core i5-6200U. (Of course, it runs much hotter, but that doesn’t matter in a desktop.) PC World has the same Ideacentre 510S with 4GB of memory instead of 8GB for £259.99. This has a much cheaper Celeron G3900 processor, which is slower than the Core i3-6100 but still a good performer. Even if it had the same CPU, you’d be giving up £50-worth of memory to save £40. HP’s Slimline 411 range of desktops offers cheaper but much less powerful options. For example, you could get one with a Pentium N3700, 4GB of memory, 1TB hard drive and DVD/RW for £229.95 from John Lewis, or with 8GB for £299.99 from Argos. If you buy direct from HP, you can add 3 years of “pickup and return” service for only £29, which is a bargain. But the Pentium N3700 and (almost identical) J3710 really belong in cheap netbooks and Chromebooks, not in desktops. There are plenty of smartphones with faster processors than the Celeron N3050. You can certainly get fantastic value for money if you spend £180 to £230 on a desktop, but you can get much better performance for £299.99. Screen As mentioned, you could use your existing monitor with your new desktop PC. However, I would strongly recommend buying a new one: screens have improved a lot in the past decade. Look for something in the 22-24in range with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which is Full HD. The 21.5in AOC e2270Swhn would be a good choice if you want something cheap – it’s £79.99 at PC World – or try Amazon UK’s best seller, the BenQ GL2250HM, at £89.99 (21.5in) or £119.99 (24in). Even better, you could get a 22in Samsung S22F350 for £89.95 at John Lewis or £99.99 at Argos. Alternatively, go for the 24in Samsung S24F350 for £116.95 at John Lewis, or the S24F356 for £129.99 at PC World. (You won’t be surprised to hear that John Lewis is currently out of stock of both Samsungs.) Software If you have software on DVD, such as Microsoft Office, you can install it on your new PC. It’s a good idea to uninstall it from your old PC first. Windows 10 PCs also tend to come with a trial version of the current Microsoft Office, so uninstall that before you install your old copy. You can also uninstall whichever anti-virus product comes pre-installed on your new PC. Windows 10’s built-in Defender is good enough for most people, as long as you don’t turn off the SmartScreen filter or the cloud integration. Of course, you can always install a free alternative such as Avast, Avira, BitDefender, Sophos or a similar product. The major worry is your HP printer/copier/scanner. Windows 10 will install basic drivers that should work, but you will probably need to download a model-specific driver from HP’s website. If HP doesn’t provide a “full feature” driver, you will probably lose some scanning features, and possibly copy/fax features as well. If so, Hamrick’s VueScan is a third-party solution that works with a lot of old scanners. It’s not free, but there’s a free trial version. Have you got another question for Jack?

The idea here is that HD mapping will support localisation to within centimetres to help vehicles precisely position themselves on the roadway to enable more reliable autonomous driving. Here and Inter say Here HD Live Map gives vehicles the ability to ‘see’ obstacles beyond their immediate field of vision and receive real-time updates as environments change due to traffic, road conditions and other factors. Here reckons it needs significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms, which is where the Intel muscle comes in. Here is a big booster of driverless cars because of their possible impact on urban development. The company reckons the ability to park and drive more efficiently will lead to a vast amount of space being made available. In the US alone, autonomous vehicles could free up 5.7 billion square metres, it says. “This could be used for parks or, more likely, fast food outlets,” Here adds. “A surprising effect of the emergence of autonomous vehicles is the forecast that house prices will drop. … more space will now be available, with up to 20% more land set to be up for grabs in inner cities, meaning more housing and, in theory, a drop in prices,” says Here.   Tags: innovation, intel, technology, transport « AI in the economic spotlight / On eye on AI ethics » Post Info Search for: Sign up for brand-e.biz direct to your desktop Find out - do brands have the talent for showbiz Error, no Ad ID set!

Hyper-threading allows multiple threads to run on each physical core, increasing the amount of logical operating cores and improving parallel performance. All Kaby Lake Pentium processors will feature four logical cores based on two physical cores, including the low-TDP mobile-class chips. Intel’s 7th-generation Pentium processors feature less power than the Core range, but certain high-end Pentium chips still include Intel HD Graphics 630.

Stock cooler? It won't boost much. AIO cooler? Now we're talking. Custom water cooling? Yeah, baby. LN2? The sky is the limit. Obviously there's a 45W TDP in your way, but I'm sure we should expect a mainstream price on the 4-core Ryzen CPU when it launches in March.

Asus 2017 is the year of gaming. About a week ago, Acer unleashed the preposterous 21-inch Predator 21 X while Razer unveiled its three-headed monster called Project Valerie. It’s only fair and natural that Asus has decided to counter those two by launching its own gaming marvel, the small but powerful ROG GR8 II. The new Asus ROG GR8 II packs a lot of power but occupies very little space. While the GR8 II is slightly larger than its predecessor, the GR8, Republic of Gamers says it’s for the extra muscle. According to Asus, the 4-kilogram GR8 II is “the smallest VR-ready system money can buy.” Asus ROG’s new gaming PC is powered by the latest 7th generation Intel Core i7 or i5 desktop processor with a customised Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card and up to 32 GB of DDR4 RAM. It includes two USB 3.1 ports (Type-A and Type-C) four USB 3.0 ports. Two of the USB 3.0 ports are located at the front for easy connection of game controllers and peripherals. Republic of Gamers promises the GR8 II to be “super silent” at 23dB at idle. Two storage options are included: an expandable slot supporting up to an M.2 PCIe SSD and a 2.5-inch bay for additional drives. Sound quality enhancements are provided by SupremeFX alongside Sonic Studio III software with a new routing feature for streaming. The Asus ROG GR8 II furnishes two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort, which means users can turn it into their own Project Valerie and connect up to three displays for some serious immersive gaming. But unlike the Razer hydra, whose prototypes were reportedly stolen, the ROG GR8 II is an actual product and will go on sale starting the first week of February in the UK with an MSRP of £950 (AU$1,555).

It's Wednesday evening here in Washington where there was a lot happening all at once.  Here's the latest.    THE BIG STORY Empowered by President-elect Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump to continue using @realDonaldTrump account as president Trump’s healthcare plan will offer ‘insurance for everybody’: report Trump on outgoing CIA director: ‘Was this the leaker of Fake News?’ MORE, Republicans lawmakers are moving to gut the vast regulatory powers federal agencies enjoyed during the Obama administration. On Wednesday, the GOP-controlled House passed the Regulatory Accountability Act which puts a ceiling on the regulatory costs coming out of Washington by instructing federal agencies to craft the "least expensive" rules they possibly can. It passed 238-183 on a largely party line vote with five Democrats crossing the aisle. This would give Congress more control over federal agencies. "Some of the most significant decisions in Washington --- those that most affect the lives of the public --- are made by those who don't stand for election," House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said. "What happens when the EPA imposes rules that deprive people of their property rights? Or when the Department of Health and Human Services tries to force nuns to violate their religion? Or when the VA perpetuates a system that lets veterans die while they wait for care?" McCarthy asked. "The people can't vote out the bureaucrats who write rules at the EPA or at the Department of Health and Human Services. They can't vote out bad leaders at the VA," he added. "And these bureaucrats know it." Regulatory reform is a key part of Trump's economic agenda, and Republican lawmakers are working quickly to reshape the way in which regulations are developed before the president-elect takes office next Friday. McCarthy indicated the House would begin repealing specific regulations after the inauguration. Since the beginning of the year, the House has passed three regulatory reform bills that limit the authority of federal agencies.  Last week, lawmakers approved the Midnight Rules Relief Act, which blocks the Obama administration from publishing expensive rules at the last-minute before Trump takes over next Friday. While the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act gives Congress the power to reject rules it dislikes with a simple majority vote. With Trump about to enter the White House, Republicans are hopeful they can shove these regulatory reform bills through Congress. But they may run into resistance in the Senate, where Democrats could filibuster. The other bills passed Wednesday along with the Regulatory Accountability Act, include: --The Require Evaluation before Implementing Executive Wishlists (REVIEW) Act, which prevents federal agencies from issuing expensive regulations while they are facing court challenges. Once the legal battles are resolved, the rules could move forward. --The Separation of Powers Restoration Act, which would prevent courts from deferring to the regulatory interpretations of federal agencies, making it easier for rules to be challenged. Goodlatte said the current law "rubber stamps" regulations. --The All Economic Regulations are Transparent Act (ALERT) Act, which instructs federal agencies to publish costs estimates for rules they are working on while they are still in development. --The Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act, which instructs federal agencies to publish "plain language" summaries of their rules online, so the "public can understand what the agencies are actually proposing to do." --The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, which instructs federal agencies to account for not only the direct costs of their rules, but also the indirect costs and cumulative impacts they will have on small businesses.

Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) to be the director of the Central Intelligence Agency.    TOMORROW'S REGS TODAY Here's a sneak peak at Thursday's edition of the Federal Register. --The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) will propose new protections for giant manta rays. Giant manta rays are a threatened species, the agency said Wednesday. "We have determined that the giant manta ray is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout a significant portion of its range," the agency writes in the Federal Register. But the agency declined to list reef manta rays as endangered or threatened. The protections come in response to a petition from Defenders of Wildlife. The public has 60 days to comment.  While manta rays are getting new protections, the agency decided against new measures to help Alabama shad fish. The agency reviewed a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) to protect these fish, but declined to do so. "We conclude that the Alabama shad is not currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range and is not likely to become so within the foreseeable future," the agency says. The finding goes into effect immediately. --The State Department will propose new rules for foreign exchange students and their host families. The rules would address the summer work travel program. Among other changes, they would limit the number of times foreign students can participate in exchange programs and require them to be placed with a host family before arriving. The public has 45 days to comment.   NEWS RIGHT NOW  Booker testifies against Sessions at confirmation hearing  John Lewis recalls 'bitter fruits of segregation' at Sessions hearing  Sessions would have power to stop FBI investigations, says ex-attorney general  Trump's Labor pick to face protests from own workers  Live coverage: Tillerson's hearing for State  FCC takes aim at AT&T, Verizon over 'zero-rating' services Treasury sanctions top North Korean officials Chamber president urges focus on long-term benefits of tax reform Trump calls for 'new bidding procedures' with drug companies Interior proposes raising royalty rates on federal coal mining Six VW employees indicted in emissions scandal Gay teacher sues over firing from North Carolina high school - AP  Trump announces David Shulkin as pick for secretary of Veterans Affairs - NPR   BY THE NUMBERS 5: Proposed rules 14: Final rules (Source: Federal Register)   QUOTE OF THE DAY "The Federal Register is now the length of 80 King James Bibles," -- House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).

Jan 06, 2017 Law and Public Policy North America Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Supports K@W's Innovation Content Drive the streets of Silicon Valley and you’ll see disproportionate numbers of electric cars gliding around. The wonders of both computer technology and electric vehicle technology appeal to the same brainy, forward-thinking people. But when it comes to making the products more universally accepted, they are anything but similar. “Moore’s Law,” named for Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, postulates that microchip performance doubles every two years without an increase in cost. However, the same law that drives down the price of your iPhone does not apply to the lithium ion batteries that are at the heart of electric vehicle technology. John Paul MacDuffie, professor of management at Wharton, says battery technology has been slower to evolve. While electric cars have made meaningful progress in recent years, they have not yet reached the price point that will put them in most driveways around America. “The moment for a tipping point for electric vehicles is not here — yet again.” But there are also “some developments that make me think it’s not back to zero.” Wharton’s Mack Institute, where MacDuffie is director of the Program on Vehicle and Mobility Innovation, held a forecasting challenge in 2016 to predict when electric vehicles, as well as self-driving vehicles, will reach the point of mainstream adoption. The questions included projections of sales and covered such models as the Nissan Leaf, the all-time best-selling electric vehicle in the world. Relatively speaking, it’s a modestly priced electric vehicle which is benefitting from federal and state subsidies. But Leaf sales are dropping instead of increasing, clearly not at all what Nissan was expecting, MacDuffie notes. Meanwhile, Tesla has had more encouraging news. The company will come close to its projection of 80,000 units sold in 2016, MacDuffie says. Elon Musk’s company has been ambitious, projecting it will make 500,000 cars per year by 2018. “The industry may decide to back away from all the things they’ve been investing in for the last five-to-eight years.” –John Paul MacDuffie Another question in the forecasting challenge was about whether battery prices would drop to a certain level, and another was about policy changes, which largely stalled during a presidential election year, MacDuffie said. It turns out that, generally, for the questions on the challenge, “more of them have been trending toward the ‘no’ end of the answer rather than the yes.” The Mack Institute plans to do the challenge again this year. Three Stumbling Blocks There are three moving but related parts to the electric car purchasing value proposition, says Rahul Kapoor, also a professor of management at Wharton. Kapoor has been collaborating on the forecasting challenge with MacDuffie and Wharton management professor Philip Tetlock. The first is the price of the car itself. With cost-benefit analyses, that price is still high — for instance, the Tesla Model 3 will have a starting price of $35,000 — and gas prices are still relatively low, providing less financial incentive to go electric, Kapoor notes. The second is consumer “range anxiety,” which is the phrase used to capture concerns that drivers would be left stranded by the side of the road because the electrical charge on their car would not be strong enough to get them where they were headed. The Tesla Model 3 will have a range of about 215 miles, much more than models like the 2017 Nissan Leaf, which offers 107 miles of range. “You can solve the range anxiety problem,” Kapoor says. But “that’s raising the price of the car itself.” Sponsored Content: So, a significant development for electric vehicles recently has been the creation of models with longer ranges, says John Voelcker, editor of GreenCarReports.com, who acknowledges that the new Tesla model is a big improvement. The range of most electric cars has been enough to get to and from work and to do some errands, but “if I have to take my kid to the hospital in the middle of the night, I might not have enough battery. That just wipes out consideration.” But a 200-mile range may be enough to eliminate that range anxiety. The Chevy BOLT EV, a 2017 model, has a rated range of 238 miles. It isn’t high technology — it’s a much bigger battery, says Voelcker. The third challenge, according to Kapoor, is the charging infrastructure, which has not emerged as quickly as expected. In an article that Kapoor wrote with Ron Adner for the November edition of Harvard Business Review, “Right Tech, Wrong Time,” they note that it isn’t just the power or price of a technology that determines whether a product catches on. It’s also the “ecosystem.” For instance, while HDTV technology was developed in the 1980s, it took about 30 years to create the infrastructure to support that technology going into homes nationwide, they say. In this case, as good as electric cars have become, charging stations have not become universal, they write. Existing gasoline-powered cars, meanwhile, have shown “robust resilience” as they show better emissions performance, Kapoor says. Thus, the value proposition for electric vehicles is not improving at a high enough rate, at least for the mainstream market, he adds. In Voelcker’s view, a lot of people erroneously treat an electric car like a piece of consumer electronics. Lithium ion batteries are far different from microchips, he said. “You can solve the range anxiety problem. But that’s raising the price of the car itself.” –Rahul Kapoor Nevertheless, they will advance in efficiency much more quickly than gas-powered cars going forward, and there has been notable success in efficiency over the years, even if it so far falls short of sending electric cars into the mainstream. For example, in 2012 a Tesla with a 60 kilowatt-hour battery pack sold for $65,000; today, a 2017 Chevy Bolt EV with the same size battery pack costs about $37,000, before government incentives. “Now you can get the functional equivalent of a Tesla, from Chevy, for the price of a Nissan Leaf six years ago. That’s pretty rapid advance,” Voelcker points out. The most inexpensive electric cars are in the $20,000-$30,000 range, and Voelcker predicts that manufacturers will follow the Tesla model of offering a range of battery sizes. “There are people who think 100-120 miles really is fine.” Odds of Reversals? More generally, the electric vehicle industry has benefitted from government standards pushing for cleaner vehicles, as well as subsidies. Both have had the blessing of President Barack Obama, but observers say President-elect Donald Trump may be unfriendly toward such initiatives. The EPA enacted restrictive fleet mileage requirements during the Obama administration as it emerged from the automakers’ bankruptcy cases, MacDuffie notes. The requirements are that the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks, regardless of their power source, must be 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. If the new EPA administrator decides to back off from those goals, “it won’t happen immediately, but the industry may decide to back away from all the things they’ve been investing in for the last five-to-eight years,” MacDuffie says. Or they may decide they expect the political pendulum to swing back, and to continue those efforts, maybe only in their labs on a long-term basis, but to continue them nevertheless. “It may be more of a slowdown than a wrench in the works, full-stop.” Observers also say electric vehicle sales have benefitted from robust — and often inconsistent — government subsidies, including a federal tax credit of up to $7,500. Although Tesla has come under scrutiny for the subsidies that apply to its sales, the federal subsidy only covers the first 200,000 vehicles sold by any given company, MacDuffie points out. Last year Tesla sold roughly 50,000 vehicles. After this year, it will be getting close to the subsidy cap, he adds. Chevy, too, will be ineligible for subsidies over the limit before too long. Whither Subsidies? MacDuffie also explains that it is unclear what will happen to state subsidies in the Trump era. If a new EPA administrator wants to prevent states from doing anything to promote electric vehicles, “a lot of mischief could be done in that area. But there is a states’-rights logic to some of the opposition to the strong federal government role. It will be very spiky.” State-specific emissions requirements, such as those in California, are a “back-door” way for states to force automakers to innovate, regardless of what the federal government does, says Arthur van Benthem, a Wharton professor of business economics and public policy. Meanwhile, renewable energy in theory should mesh with Trump’s agenda, which includes creating high-skill jobs in the U.S., and rules that support renewable energy have proven popular to voters in states that supported Trump, he adds. What’s more, it would not be easy to cancel President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan and fuel economy standards that favor electric vehicles, according to van Benthem. While Trump’s administration could defund the EPA to make it harder to check compliance, “I don’t think it’s very likely most of these regulations will disappear from the books in the next couple of years,” he adds. “The problem is not that the car companies don’t want to build them, but that people don’t want to buy them.” –Morris Cohen Van Benthem also notes that the government may have been too aggressive in subsidizing electric vehicles, which have been treated as zero-emissions vehicles even though they run on fossil-fueled grid power.  There’s a good rationale for the government to support building up clean energy technology, but “we’ve probably gone a little too far in picking a winner and blindly subsidizing fully electric vehicles.” As far as subsidies go, “it’s more about the option value for the future than rewarding actual zero-emissions vehicles today,” van Benthem says. In the future, wind and solar could make up a larger share of grid power, which would help electric vehicles realize their zero-emission potential. The bottom line, however, seems to be that until the price of electric vehicles come down, people will be reluctant to buy them, since most are unwilling to pay a premium for green technology, according to Morris Cohen, a professor of operations, information and decisions at Wharton. People are driven to buy a car, he says, to get from one place to another. Still, Cohen is guardedly optimistic about the industry as more manufacturers offer electric vehicles, including some high-performance models. “Basically, the problem is not that the car companies don’t want to build them, but that people don’t want to buy them,” Cohen notes. “They’re more expensive for the same function of car.” Supports K@W's Innovation Content Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "When Will Electric Cars Go Mainstream?."

So the break even time should be a lot shorter for heavily used vehicles than for privately owned commuter cars which remain parked 95% of the time. Also, vehicles which always return to a home base every day negate the problems of charging and the need for roadside charging infrastructure. Heavy use and return to a home base every day is basically the description of a large fraction of the vehicles on the road: taxis, buses, delivery vans, car share, Uber, etc. The worlds largest manufacturer of EVs, BYD, seems to be focused on these types of vehicles. I think that EV makers could gain economies of scale with these sorts of fleet vehicles that might hasten the widespread acceptance of EVs. Xriva Zimmerman Ed, One of our cars is a Nissan LEAF, the other is a high end luxury minivan. Based on my experience as a EV owner for the last year, I agree with your points. I think EVs make sense now. But the public just doesn’t realise it yet. Here’s what I think will happen : Due to a bump in gas prices and/or regulatory changes MANY multi-car families will make one of their cars an EV. They will love it like our family does.

Some are starting to come together, but it looks like the battles will go on for a few more years By Stephen Lawson | Follow Senior U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Jan 13, 2017 10:05 AM PT Email a friend To Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From

Video Smart Cities: Barcelona A few brave souls predict IoT standards will start to gel this year, but making all those connected things work together still looks like a long shot. Two years ago, some industry analysts cautiously suggested that a vast array of IoT standards would merge into just a few beginning in 2017. If the internet of things in late 2014 was a cacophony of discordant musicians tuning up, it’s now reached the point where a few virtuosos are playing the same tune. But there’s still a lot of sheet music getting passed around. Two of the biggest rivals in IoT did find harmony last year. The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) was formed out of the AllSeen Alliance -- which used the Qualcomm-developed AllJoyn -- and the Intel-backed Open Interconnect Consortium. Previously, each group had been promoting its own way for devices to discover and learn about each other. In another promising sign, the IEEE p2413 standard, which will provide a unified approach to defining IoT architectures, may be finished this year, according to Oleg Logvinov, chairman of the p2413 working group. The standard is meant to span all industries plus consumer devices. It wouldn’t replace existing data formats but would reduce the amount of effort required to share data among them. Using what's already finished Some players are offering established technologies as common layers for interoperability. Last week at CES, the ZigBee Alliance announced Dotdot, which it calls a universal language for IoT. It’s an open application layer that handles the same kinds of things as OCF, but it’s based on the upper-layer protocol already implemented in many devices that use the ZigBee wireless network. Dotdot can already work with Thread networks. Sigma Designs, the main company behind Z-Wave networks, has released the Z-Wave interoperability layer to help developers integrate those networks with applications and services using cloud-based platforms like HomeKit. But there are still too many choices, for both developers and consumers, to make IoT simple and easy, industry analysts say. That will probably still be true 12 months from now, and maybe for two or three more years, they said. "I don't think we've gotten to the point where consolidation has made the lives of solution providers and application developers much easier,” Machina Research analyst Andy Castonguay said. “You still have a tremendous array of options out there." That’s kept consumer choices fragmented, too, which is one issue holding back smart homes, Avi Greengart at Current Analysis said. Most consumers won’t buy IoT gear until they see clear value, ease of installation, and ease of interoperability, he said. “Every major computing and silicon vendor is competing in this space, and there hasn’t been a consolidation around winners just yet. The market is kind of a mess right now,” Greengart said. Enter the lawyers Why is it so hard to agree on standards? "They're big companies, and they move slowly," said Mike Krell of Moor Insights and Strategy. Standards tend to raise intellectual property issues that bring armies of lawyers into the picture. Even breakthroughs in standards diplomacy aren't guarantees. Just because an impressive list of vendors, including Microsoft, Samsung, Cisco Systems, GE Digital, and Haier belong to OCF, that doesn’t mean they’ll all adopt the organization’s standard across all their products, Krell said. It’s common for big vendors to join many industry groups just to engage with and influence trends. There’s too much at stake in a potentially huge market for major companies to give up the chance to dominate home IoT, Greengart said. “I’m highly skeptical that 'co-opetition' in this regard will prevail over competition. And given than nobody knows what layer of the stack is going to be the most valuable one, everyone is fighting for their own,” he said. The common thread that will make smart homes work may turn out to be a system from one vendor, like Apple’s HomeKit, Greengart said. Apple is as well-positioned as any company to make that happen. But even though many manufacturers at last week’s CES show introduced products that use HomeKit, they didn’t play up that capability much, he said. Alexa, Amazon’s cloud-based AI platform that made a splash at CES, at least provides a single user interface, though Greengart said it’s not really a full IoT platform like HomeKit -- yet. There's even more work to do Even if part of the technology stack is standardized and life gets easier for developers and buyers, there are other hurdles to mass adoption of home IoT. Security, one of consumers’ biggest worries, has to be addressed across the board instead of one component at a time, as it is now, Machina’s Castonguay said. “We still are waiting for the market to develop an approach that would allow for a full, end-to-end, consistently updated and audited security approach,” he said. Then there’s the issue of how consumers will choose to buy IoT products. While most smart homes are do-it-yourself affairs today, carriers and cable companies may become the main sales channel, Krell said. But it’s still too soon to say. Some good news While things may be murky at home, there are glimmers of hope in another part of the internet of things. Last year, the 3GPP, which sets cellular standards, settled on two specifications for low-power versions of LTE. Those technologies, called Category M1 and Category NB1, will lead carriers to roll out specialized IoT services, Castonguay said. Both of the new technologies are slower than regular mobile data service but use less energy, so they’re compatible with small, battery-powered connected objects like sensors. As part of the LTE standard, these systems are relatively easy and economical upgrades to current networks. Another low-power, wide-area networking standard, LoRa, is gaining momentum with more national rollouts, Castonguay said. Comcast announced in October that it’s considering a nationwide LoRa network to serve enterprises. Some carriers in other countries already use the technology. Ingenu, a U.S. company with its own type of low-power network, is also making gains around the world, he said. Wherever IoT does reach mass adoption, it will be thanks to one or two technologies -- open or not -- that have somehow caught on with users. “Sometimes ubiquity is the most important part of a standard,” Greengart said.

The company is sticking with its Racing theme for the new boards, and is releasing three variants: the Z270GT8, Z270GT6, and Z270GT4. The Racing Z270GT8 is the top-of-the-range model. The board boasts six physical PCIe x16 slots, although Biostar doesn't specifically list support for SLI or CrossFire. The GT8 thankfully skips the questionably-useful SATA Express connector in favor of an M.2 socket and two U.2 ports. The M.2 socket has its own dedicated heatsink, too. The mobo has USB 3.1 Type-A and Type-C ports on the back panel, and supports quick-charging standards from both Qualcomm and Apple. Networking connectivity comes by way of an Intel I219-V Gigabit Ethernet controller. Biostar is clearly targeting the Z270GT8 at tweakers and tuners, as the board comes with a plethora of overclocking features including debug LEDs and a hardware dual-BIOS switch. The board even has a special switch to allow it to boot at temperatures below zero. There's also a handy "GT Touch" panel that lets users power on and reset the board, as well as select Speed or Eco presets. The audio circuitry is powered by a high-end Realtek ALC1220 codec. Biostar also includes RGB LED lighting (under the "Vivid LED DJ" moniker) and a 5050 connector for additional LED strips. The Racing Z270GT6 is a slight step-down from the GT8 board. It drops down to three physical PCIe x16 slots, one U.2 connector, and zero USB 3.1 connectors. The USB quick-charge functionality also goes away, and the audio codec gets downgraded to the Realtek ALC892. The GT6 does have a USB 3.0 Type-C port to make up for those cuts. Aside from those changes, this model is very similar to the GT8, down to the debug LEDs and GT Touch panel. Finally, the Racing Z270GT4 could be described as the microATX version of the GT6, as it shares most of its bigger brother's feature set. There's no heatsink on the M.2 slot this time around, and due to its size, there naturally aren't as many PCIe slots. However, where the GT6 only has DVI and HDMI outputs, the GT4 board actually has DVI, HDMI, VGA, and DisplayPort connectors. Biostar says the Racing Z270GT8 board will come as a bundle with a 256GB Intel 600p NVMe SSD for $330. The company bundles one of its own 240GB G300 SSDs with the Z270GT6 board for a final price of $210. The Z270GT4 instead gets a Vivid LED DJ-enabled fan as its bundled item, and will go for $130.   Tags: Motherboards User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Carrie Freeman is the managing partner of SecondMuse, responsible for the overall strategic direction and management of the company. Carrie is a thought leader on the roles and intersection of technology, sustainability, innovation and corporate responsibility. Prior to joining SecondMuse, Carrie worked for Intel Corporation as Director of Sustainable Business Innovation pioneering strategies such as a corporate impact investing fund and developing technology market solutions to solve global sustainability challenges. Carrie shares these poignant thoughts about the way we work. In the last century the world has seen an unprecedented expansion of economic activity that has generated material prosperity for many, but not for all. The prevailing approach to economic expansion is beginning to undermine the local and global ecosystems on which human health and well-being depend. The speed of global change can compound these challenges, but can also present opportunities to address them. At SecondMuse, we want to disrupt the prevailing system in a positive way by seeking out these opportunities in order to create a more just and equitable world. We believe in the oneness of humanity. As such, we actively promote the equality of all people and work towards the elimination of all forms of prejudice. We believe that all humans should have a life of dignity, beauty and abundance. We also believe that collective prosperity begins with authentic and organic connections. Inclusion: Human beings are born with the tools to do good and work together, so we take a human-centered approach to problem-solving. That means understanding that all humans, regardless of race, creed, gender, socio-economic status or nationality can make change happen. They must not only be heard, but sought out. Working together makes us stronger. Empathy: We are empathetic to those we try to help and listen with fresh ears to their stories. We then ask questions in order learn and understand. Attempting to change the world isn't easy, but the struggle to do so can bring out the best in people; their compassion, their strength, their intelligence and their joy. When we harness that human energy, we can indeed change the world together. Movement Creation: We define and convene changemakers and then create movements. We empower people to discover and mobilize around their shared ideas together. In this way, we give authentic people and ideas the space they need to inspire one another and perhaps become something that we may not have planned for them. Emerging Technology: As we build engagements and movements around our work, we turn to the power of big data and immersive media to create connections and intimate bridges between otherwise disconnected human experiences. Corporations and governments are turning to big data to improve the quality of life for their citizens and customers, as well as improving environmental conditions, public health, public service delivery and citizen engagement. Cutting-edge technologies, like virtual and augmented reality, are the kind of breakthrough innovations that will disrupt business as we know it. Thanks to social media and crowdsourcing storytelling campaigns, we can share stories across borders and invite people to look for a part of themselves in us, around the digital sphere. In this way, we create spaces for people to find their collective voice, and the resources for it to manifest into something great. At SecondMuse, we believe human beings possess intrinsic capacities for altruism and collaboration. Rather than focusing on just a small part of a larger problem, we look to systemic solutions, ways to fix not only one minor obstacle, but to alter the trajectory of the global infrastructure. We need big solutions for big problems. Tackling such a large task is daunting, but there are steps we can take to make our goals attainable. First we need to break down the organizational silos that so often inhibit progress. We do that by collaborating, creating a space for open dialogue, and encouraging universal participation. We must be honest and clear in all our interactions - with our partners, with the communities with which we work, and most important, with each other. We must be empathetic and see the world from other points of view, rather than just our own. We need to engage with people affected by global change and understand how their stories relate to the problems we are trying to solve. That requires listening to them, really listening without any preconceived notions and then asking questions that help us more deeply understand their environment and how their individual stories relate to the larger problems. That way, we possess a willingness to learn and understand. Finally, we need to create an environment where experimentation and creativity can flourish and touch all around us. We need to build the capacity to collaborate and innovate in all our partners, and in every step of our work.

The BOLT X is designed to enable a significant overclocking potential of components even in a space-constrained form-factor, and it should benefit those who need to have maximum performance in a minimum footprint. Over the past few years we have observed the culmination of several separate trends: compact computers with liquid cooling, with style and with serious overclocking capabilities. The new BOLT X from Digital Storm is the company’s next-generation SFF PC with a HydroLux LCS that features a number of upgrades aimed to advance its cooling performance  as well as improve the system in general. First off, the BOLT X has two 140-mm top mounted fans (up from two 120-mm fans in case of the BOLT 3, the predecessor). Second, it comes with an integrated stand that helps to minimize the amount of dust it sucks in through openings for cool air on the bottom. Third, it features a simplified open layout to make it easier to upgrade and service the PC. Just like the predecessors, the Digital Storm BOLT X can accommodate a Mini-ITX motherboard and one graphics card located beneath the mainboard to ensure proper cooling and compatibility with custom cards that have tall PCBs. With the BOLT X, Digital Storm will offer the Intel Z270-based platforms (so, they will support technologies like NVMe, Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 Gen 2, 802.11 ac Wi-Fi, etc.) along with various Intel Core processors powered by the Kaby Lake microarchitecture. As for GPUs, expect the PC maker to offer the latest graphics cards that will be available with its BOLT X — NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 10-series for now and whatever comes up next. At present, Digital Storm does not discuss the exact number of SSDs/HDDs that can be housed by the BOLT X chassis, but the PC will definitely support one high-performance M.2 SSD with a PCIe 3.0 x4 interface on the motherboard as well as a number of storage devices in a 2.5-inch form-factor. Following the latest trends, the boutique PC maker eliminated the ODD from the chassis completely, resulting in a perfectly flat front surface. One of the intrigues of the new BOLT X system is its PSU. In theory, Digital Storm can install almost any SFX power supply inside (except, perhaps, the SFX-L versions) to improve overclocking potential and/or support power hungry components. However, with the BOLT 3 the company only offers 400 W PSUs. Digital Storm will start selling BOLT X systems in the first quarter. Exact pricing will depend on actual configuration and will thus vary. At present, the company offers BOLT 3 systems starting at $1906, so the new versions are likely to start at approximately the same price-point.

Back to the drawing board for this one. Reply ddriver - Sunday, January 15, 2017 - link They could at least make it even thinner, being water-cooled and all. Then you could just hang it on the wall and don't worry about knocking it over and breaking it. From the looks of it, much is currently wasted space. If they have a custom psu in there they could have scrapped the casing so it doesn't add bulk. Then the whole unit could be like 2 inches thick.

Still, one of Thursday’s headlines: “Can the Rift Between Trump and the Intel Community Be Healed?” Nation31 people Trump may pick, has picked for Cabinet, top jobs Which seems to imply that this is a group of constituents seeking a voice in government, rather than government itself under the executive himself. advertisement | advertise on newsday Call it a profession, maybe. But a community? Practically, we’re talking about some 17 agencies with military forces, information-technology contractors and surveillance capabilities we might not even know about. Calling it a community also glosses over the bureaucratic tensions that form part of the Washington landscape. Much has been made in the past of behind-the-scenes rivalries between the FBI and CIA, between the NSA and the CIA. When James Mattis sat before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday for a confirmation hearing as defense secretary, he professed a “close relationship with the intelligence community” during his long military career. NationTrump's noteworthy tweets as president-elect The catchphrase serves a purpose. It softens edges. It implies a natural, consensual effort — and obscures the fact that we know different presidents will believe different advice and order research into different questions. @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff Largely, this “community” will have no choice but to be at Trump’s full disposal by next week and out of President Barack Obama’s hands. Then it will be Trump’s turn to deal as he wishes with unnamed officials he publicly taunted over the Russia controversy. And that isn’t the only weird phrasing of the season. Testifying Thursday at his confirmation hearing, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kansas) was asked about his independence. NationThe most controversial quotes from Trump's campaign “You have my commitment that every day I will speak truth to power,” Pompeo said. advertisement | advertise on newsday So here was a right-leaning Republican and designated CIA director using a phrase coined by the Quakers in 1955 with a pamphlet called: “Speak Truth to Power: A Quaker Search for an Alternative to Violence.” It promoted pacifism, in the belief that love trumps hate.

Consoles by Sean Hollister January 13, 2017 1:00 PM PST @starfire2258 Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS We get our hands on Nintendo's transforming Switch console It's a home console, it's a tabletop gaming system and it's a portable games tablet. It's the Nintendo Switch and after months of waiting, we've finally taken it for a spin. by Andrew Hoyle 1:21 Close Drag 2016 was supposed to be the year modular gadgets caught on. Phones like Google's Project Ara, the LG G5 and the Moto Z promised to let you upgrade your phone just by snapping on new parts. Intel's Thunderbolt 3 port paved the way to turn a thin laptop into a beefy gaming PC just by plugging in an external graphics dock. But several companies have already abandoned or scaled back their modular plans, assuming that we don't actually want what they have to sell. Project Ara was axed, with key team members migrating to Facebook. LG has given up on modular phones entirely, telling CNET that customers (and cellular carriers) weren't interested in the idea. And no one has yet built an inexpensive, broadly compatible external graphics dock for Thunderbolt-equipped laptops. (Motorola appears to be full steam ahead on Moto Mods, promising 12 new snap-on accessories per year, but a leak suggests that the company's upcoming Moto X may not include the feature.) Enlarge Image Nintendo's Joy-Con controllers slide right into the Switch console, and maybe other devices will do the same down the road.Photo by GIF by Sean Hollister/CNET What does any of this have to do with the new Nintendo Switch? It could be the last, best chance to prove people actually do want modular gadgets -- or the final nail in their coffin. The Nintendo Switch is a portable gaming system that uses modular parts to transform. Snap on a pair of controllers and pick it up like a gamepad, or snap 'em off to use as wireless motion controllers. Drop the tablet into a dock to connect it to your TV like a full game console, and snap the two tiny controllers together into a bigger gamepad that charges their batteries at the same time. Cool, no? While that may sound like a bold new idea, it's actually a lot like Nvidia's Shield tablet from 2014, or the Razer Edge tablet from 2013, each of which let you buy an optional gamepad, dock and cables so you could use them with a TV as well. Here's the key difference: The Nintendo Switch comes with everything you need in the box. Enlarge Image Here's everything you'll get in the box.Photo by Nintendo Unlike most modular gadgets (including every single one I mention above), you don't need to buy the parts separately. For $300, £280 or AU$470, it comes with everything you need to transform the Switch into each of its modes. It's the smartest thing Nintendo could have done, and a little surprising considering Nintendo is the company that stopped including power adapters with its latest handhelds. Including everything means Nintendo doesn't have to worry about whether you'll actually buy any of the modular pieces, decide how to market them or stock them on shelves. (You'll only need to buy replacements or extras for friends.) It means game developers can create games for the Switch without worrying about whether you'll be able to transform it into the right mode -- unlike software for, say, the old Wii Balance Board (which came with Wii Fit) or MotionPlus peripherals. 14 A closer look at the Nintendo Switch Heck, it might even mean accessory developers can build intriguing modular accessories for the Switch, knowing owners are already familiar with swapping on and off pieces of their console. It also can't hurt that the Switch is a Nintendo product, which (unlike pretty much every other modular product I've mentioned) will be widely known and recognized around the world. It's pretty much the perfect ambassador for modular gadgets. But that's a double-edged sword: if the Switch fails, it'll be held up as the ultimate example of how people don't want gadgets with pieces that pop off. If Nintendo doesn't make make modular work with the Switch, I doubt anyone will.

The PC version will get Epic Gun Game in the future. If you’re planning on playing Multiplayer this weekend, Infinity Ward has activated Double XP on all platforms until Monday, January 16 at 10am PT/1pm ET. Addressing concerns over the recent Quartermaster update, which added a ton of new content and potentially lowered content chances in supply drops, Infinity Ward said: Since the latest update… Players have the same chance to get a weapon out of a supply drop as they did before. Players have the same chance of getting a rare, legendary, or epic out of a supply drop as they did before. The player’s chance of getting a specific weapon from a supply drop was not demonstratively affected addition of MkII weapons. The addition of all this new content means fewer duplicates from supply drops. We understand that some players are concerned about how this affects their ability to earn salvage. Rest assured, we have plans, and are working on additional plans, to introduce new ways to earn salvage in the future. Infinity Ward also revealed that the January 31 patch for Infinite Warfare will update the camo quality. It will likely include support for the Sabotage expansion pack as well.

(Evan Vucci/Associated Press) In an interview on the “Today” show, Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Donald Trump, sounded very pleased with the reporting of NBC News. Like anyone in Trumpworld this week, Conway was attempting to delegitimize the now-famous dossier regarding Trump and Russia that has been circulating in government and media circles. Those who click on BuzzFeed links know it contains some dramatic allegations about the president-elect’s activities. And in her talk with Matt Lauer, Conway focused on establishing distance between her boss and this document: “Really, it was NBC News who broke the story yesterday — so, good for you — that it says on your website that Donald Trump was not briefed on this intelligence matter,” said Conway. At issue is a much-discussed briefing last Friday in New York including Trump and U.S. intelligence chiefs. The big shots were due to discuss allegations that Russia had hacked into U.S. institutions in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election. Though the briefing was heavily covered in the media, CNN on Tuesday afternoon shed brand-new light on the proceedings. “Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him,” reads the headline that drove a few frenzied days up and down the I-95 corridor. Under the bylines of Evan Perez, Jim Sciutto, Jake Tapper and Carl Bernstein, CNN alleged that both President Obama and President-elect Trump had been “presented” with documents including “allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.” Moments after that story landed, BuzzFeed went ahead and published the dossier in full, placing in the public realm allegations that other organizations, including CNN, deemed too unverified to release. President-elect Donald Trump found himself in "familiar territory" addressing reporters at his first news conference since winning the election, calling CNN "fake news" and Buzzfeed a "failing pile of garbage." (The Washington Post) The dossier is the work of a former British intelligence officer who started compiling the information as part of an opposition research project first for GOP groups opposing Trump and later for Democratic interests. The CNN reporting team noted that “US intelligence agencies have now checked out the former British intelligence operative and his vast network throughout Europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough to include some of the information in the presentations to the President and President-elect a few days ago.” CNN, furthermore, was initially silent on the question of whether the intelligence briefing verbally addressed the information, which came in the form of a two-page synopsis of the dossier and was appended to the intelligence community’s larger report on Russian electoral interference. “CNN has confirmed that the synopsis was included in the documents that were presented to Mr. Trump but cannot confirm if it was discussed in his meeting with the intelligence chiefs,” notes the article. On Wednesday morning, Cynthia McFadden of NBC News presented some new reporting on the matter. “What we know is that a senior U.S. intelligence official who was involved in the preparation for the meeting tells NBC that the president-elect was not briefed on this so-called two-page addendum of these allegations against him — that it was part of the briefing materials available to the briefers,” said McFadden on MSNBC, summarizing some reporting in an online story titled “Trump Wasn’t Told About Russia Memo During Briefing, Official Says.” “But it was not included because they believed it to be true. It was included for a different reason. It was included — should they feel they needed to explain to Mr. Trump the difference between analyzed intelligence and what they’re calling ‘unvetted disinformation.’ That it was available for that purpose and it never came up. Importantly, documents were never presented to Mr. Trump or his team.” More: “This was an oral briefing … and we are told definitively that this was not told to Mr. Trump at the time.” “Unvetted disinformation,” huh? No wonder Team Trump so adored the NBC News reporting. By one definition, “disinformation” means “false information deliberately and often covertly spread (as by the planting of rumors) in order to influence public opinion or obscure the truth.” An on-the-record statement from Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. quite pointedly shied away from endorsing or dissing the synopsis: “The IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions,” reads the statement in part. Here’s how the New York Times framed the intelligence community’s decision to include the synopsis: “The material was not corroborated, and The New York Times has not been able to confirm the claims,” notes the newspaper’s story on the matter. “But intelligence agencies considered it so potentially explosive that they decided Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders needed to be told about it and informed that the agencies were actively investigating it.” And the Wall Street Journal reported that the “allegations were deemed sufficiently significant by senior intelligence officials to summarize them in a two-page addendum” and that those officials felt that the president-elect should be apprised of them. So, does NBC News stand by the notion that the synopsis was included as a display of “unvetted disinformation”? The company declined to comment on the record for this story. Now to the question of whether Trump was briefed on the synopsis last Friday. On television Wednesday morning, McFadden said he wasn’t; the online story said that Trump was “not told about unverified reports that Russia has compromising information on him during last week’s intelligence briefing.” On the Wednesday night edition of “NBC Nightly News,” correspondent Hallie Jackson said, “A senior intelligence official with knowledge of the document tells NBC News Trump was never briefed about it.” Here’s a screenshot from from that edition of NBC News’s flagship program: Reince Priebus, the incoming Trump chief of staff, told the “Today” show that he’d attended the intelligence briefing, yet the first he heard of the dossier was when BuzzFeed published it. Last evening, however, CNN reported that Trump and FBI Director James B. Comey had a “brief one-on-one conversation at Friday’s intelligence briefing.” It was FBI Director Comey in a one on one who briefed PEOTUS Trump on that synopsis, we can now report. More here –> pic.twitter.com/hklsmquhEF — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 12, 2017 As it turns out, then, he was told about the matter. So did NBC News get it wrong? Not by its own account. “FBI’s Comey Told Trump About Russia Dossier After Intel Briefing,” reads the headline on an NBC News story from last night. Bolding added to display the most important word in the headline. To draw this critical distinction, the NBC News online report notes, “As NBC News has previously reported, Trump was not told about the contents of the dossier during the formal briefing.” Come on, NBC News! No one out there in newsland is drawing distinctions between some “formal” briefing and a one-on-one session that occurs in the same setting. Certainly Kellyanne Conway drew no such distinctions when she tweeted: From @nbc: Trump wasn't told about unverified Russia dossier, official says. Will TV anchors/networks correct story? https://t.co/kCPRsFu3vf — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) January 11, 2017 @sethmeyers @latenightseth it was FUN…& superFUN to have @NBCNews today agree/verify that Trump was NOT briefed on 2 pages. Hugs to baby! https://t.co/0mQEY5fiLz — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) January 11, 2017 A rule for the next four years: When the Trump people are touting your reporting, worry. CNN’s Tapper told the Erik Wemple Blog in a statement: “We were always confident in our reporting, multi-sourced, diligently and carefully told, and then matched by respected journalists at places such as the Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal. Sure, some others relied on sources who turned out to be wrong, and they got burned, and that’s embarrassing for them. For us, we’re going to keep doing our jobs.” Update: An NBC News spokesperson has responded with the following statement: “NBC News has been precise and accurate in our reporting every step of the way, at a time when precision and accuracy are at a premium.” opinions erik-wemple Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

But Casey Michel at The Daily Beast notes that “the past 18 months have seen a noted spike in information warfare” from Moscow “aimed at gulling the Bernie Bros and Occupy-besotted alternative-media set.” Green Party candidate Jill Stein, for example, was “feted” by the Kremlin at a December 2015 gala, where she unveiled a “pro-Putin stance.” Even today, “it remains unclear who paid for Stein’s trip to Moscow and her accommodations there.” Meanwhile, “The Nation’s [pro-Putin] coverage of Russian affairs is a national embarrassment.” Indeed, “Putin has cultivated dupes, fellow travelers and purblind fools among plenty of American progressives.” Mideast expert: The Man Kerry Left Behind John Kerry’s legacy as secretary of state “leans heavily towards failure,” asserts Michael Rubin at Commentary, with “hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced in Syria.” But the man “who should haunt the dreams of Kerry and his team” is former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who remains imprisoned and unheard from in Iran. During negotiations over the nuclear deal, when Kerry’s “leverage was greatest, he did not hold firm to demand Levinson’s return — or information about his ultimate fate.” Nor was his family even notified that when the US paid $1 billion to free five American prisoners. Kerry “made a conscious decision to leave a man behind. That decision represents the worst of the State Department.” Ex-CIA lawyer: Trump’s Right To Want Intel Changes Steven Cash, a former CIA lawyer, says President-elect Trump is right to aim to “dramatically downsize” the office of Director of National Intelligence. Writing in The Washington Post, he says even before 9/11, “there was concern that the structure of the US intelligence community was fundamentally flawed.” Since then, the DNI establishment [has] continued to grow” and a series of directors has “struggled mightily” against this bureaucracy. What we need, Cash says, is what was originally envisioned but went nowhere in Congress: “A slim, trim DNI” with “an admiral to lead a fleet” instead of “a new, ponderous ship and another captain . . . with a fancier uniform.” From the right: What Comey Probe Won’t Focus On The Justice Department inspector general will review FBI Director James Comey’s statements during the campaign regarding Hillary Clinton’s e-mails. While that’s “undoubtedly appropriate,” Andrew McCarthy at National Review says, it’s “worth noting what the IG will not be reviewing: the Justice Department’s conduct.” By which he means DOJ’s decision “not to open a grand-jury investigation, despite significant concrete evidence of criminal wrongdoing,” as well as “the multiple irregular immunity agreements . . . in a case in which no criminal charges were filed.” Nor will the IG look into why DOJ “allowed subjects of the investigation (who had been granted immunity from prosecution) to appear as lawyers for the main subject of the investigation — despite ethical and statutory prohibitions on such conduct.” In other words, “the decisions that actually tanked the Clinton investigation will not be scrutinized.” Political reporter: What Now for Post-Obama Dems? In his farewell, President Obama “made a passionate case” for his policies and civic vision. But Ronald Brownstein at The Atlantic says “his words won’t settle the Democrats’ difficult debate about his political legacy.” Yes, Obama “deepened the Democrats’ connection with a constellation of growing groups” and “a heavily urbanized new coalition.” But he “also narrowed the Democrats’ appeal, both demographically and geographically.” And “as Obama himself has recognized, Democrats cannot cede all that terrain and thrive.” The “one clear message of the Obama years is that Democrats cannot consistently control Congress or most state governments unless they compete better among white voters.” — Compiled by Eric Fettmann Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under barack obama ,  donald trump ,  editorial ,  hacking ,  james comey ,  john kerry ,  justice department ,  middle east ,  vladimir putin Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Buzzfeed just did Donald Trump a huge favor Read Next Buzzfeed just did Donald Trump a huge favor Most Popular This Week 1 Hell gets ready to welcome Charles Manson 2 Buzzfeed's Trump report takes 'fake news' to a new level 3 Giants blamed for trashing airplane after playoff blowout 4 Obese woman is now a stunning model thanks to 'teaspoon diet' 5 It's 'digital heroin': How screens turn kids into psychotic junkies 6 It's time to face facts: Obama's presidency was a failure Share Selection Columnists George F.

I'm building a PC with the following features: Motherboard: MSI Gaming H270 M3 CPU: Intel I7 7700 Ram: Corsair CMK16GX4M2A2400C16 Case: Fractal Design FD-CA-DEF-R5-BK Define R5 Video Card: Msi GTX 1060 GAMING X 6 GB PSU: Corsair CX650M CP-9020103-EU I ask you for advice. I would like to build a very quiet PC, I do not want to hear when it is working, if not the most of a slight hum when I'm playing. I was thinking about this model for the CPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D15S According to you may be fine for my configuration? Keep in mind you are not interested in overclocking. Thanks in advance!     Bokka View Public Profile Find all posts by Bokka     (#2) scatman839 Ancient Guru     Videocard: 7970m/970 Mini, KD55XD800 Processor: i7 3610QM/i5 6500 Mainboard: HM77/B150M-C Memory: 12GB D3/16GB D4 Soundcard: Via HD, x-530 PSU: 180w/RM650x 01-12-2017, 22:56 | posts: 12,752 | Location: Scotland If you upgrade to a RM650x then that psu will not spin the fan at all at lower loads, for example, mines never spins I believe, even when maxed out. And the 1060 apparently uses less power than the 970. The 7700k uses 20w more at load, but since a 1060 uses 20w less at load than a 970 I think the RM650x should be a silent psu for you. The gpu you chose will also turn the fan off at <60 degrees C. So the only main thing you need to look at is your cpu cooler and how loud the case fans might be. Also if you use a HDD.

Especially so if you don't remove the roof tiles like I did for the sake of the 240 radiator. I can hear a solid hum all the time probably because of that and the three ordinary HDDs inside the case. If you stick to SSDs only, it would remove significant noise as well, like Scatman said.     Kaarme View Public Profile Find all posts by Kaarme   (#4) Bokka Newbie   Videocard: Nvidia 660 GTX 2Gb Processor: Intel Core i5 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: 650W 01-13-2017, 00:12 | posts: 6 The CPU cooler "Noctua NH-D15S" is ok and quiet for my system?

Keep the case fans at 7v and they'll be rather quiet, at 5v they will be inaudible. If you're not that happy with the fans buy yourself some other ones, just google for quiet fans at under 100% speed. Better have more fans spinning lower to save on sound levels than have few case fans that run high rpm. The NH-D15S will be a good cooler, still the most silent thing cooling my old hot i7-950 I've ever tried. If you want to dig into it, I can only recommend silentpcreview.com a very good site that does the most comprehensive sound tests I've seen so far, for stuff like case fans. They're all about silent computing, learned quite a few things there.     fantaskarsef View Public Profile Find all posts by fantaskarsef   (#7) Bokka Newbie   Videocard: Nvidia 660 GTX 2Gb Processor: Intel Core i5 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: 650W 01-13-2017, 09:40 | posts: 6 Thanks a lot for the replies!!!     Bokka View Public Profile Find all posts by Bokka   (#8) Agent-A01 Ancient Guru     Videocard: 980Ti SLI H20 Processor: i7 5930k 4.7GHz H20 Mainboard: ASUS X99-A Memory: G.Skill 4x8GB 3200C12 Soundcard: Xonar Phoebus-PC360/HD598 PSU: EVGA P2-1200W 01-13-2017, 16:27 | posts: 8,566 | Location: USA Noctua is way overkill for a 7700.

I have a kfa2 gtx 1050. I have been with her since November. I realized one thing and thought it was something of the Intel stock sink, but it is not. The gpu works with the automatic profile between 55-60% fan speed. The problem is that at 57% it generates a buzz or vibration. While at 58% up that sound disappears. The graph is fairly quiet less when it is at 57%, which is noisier even than at 65% fan speed. How can i fix this?. Is it reason to just make noise in that range of rms?     elpollodiablo31 View Public Profile Find all posts by elpollodiablo31     (#2) Agent-A01 Ancient Guru     Videocard: 980Ti SLI H20 Processor: i7 5930k 4.7GHz H20 Mainboard: ASUS X99-A Memory: G.Skill 4x8GB 3200C12 Soundcard: Xonar Phoebus-PC360/HD598 PSU: EVGA P2-1200W 01-12-2017, 21:33 | posts: 8,566 | Location: USA Force the specific fan speed via MSI AB and try to isolate the buzzing location? If it's the plastic rattling on the heatsink, you could put some double sided tape under it to dampen the noise. I had such an issue on a 780ti evga cooler.     Agent-A01 View Public Profile Find all posts by Agent-A01   (#3) elpollodiablo31 Newbie   Videocard: None Processor: none Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: Antec earthwatts 550w 01-12-2017, 21:36 | posts: 17 As I said I isolated the problem and it just happens at 57% fan speed. The problem is that the automatic fan runs between 55-60% in demanding games. So the noise if I do not set it manually is a little annoying. When that happens, I manually stopped the fan with my finger and it is not listening at all. So I do not know because it vibrates just 57%.     elpollodiablo31 View Public Profile Find all posts by elpollodiablo31   (#4) Agent-A01 Ancient Guru     Videocard: 980Ti SLI H20 Processor: i7 5930k 4.7GHz H20 Mainboard: ASUS X99-A Memory: G.Skill 4x8GB 3200C12 Soundcard: Xonar Phoebus-PC360/HD598 PSU: EVGA P2-1200W 01-12-2017, 21:46 | posts: 8,566 | Location: USA And I'm saying find what it is vibrating on at 57% fan speed. Fan is causing the plastic to rattle against the heatsink somewhere, you have to find out where it's at. The fan itself is most likely not making the noise, the resonance from it is causing the plastic to rattle somewhere. If you do not want to fix it, the only solution is to RMA it or run it at a constant speed. MSI AB will apply at startup so you do not have to set it manually every time.     Agent-A01 View Public Profile Find all posts by Agent-A01     (#5) elpollodiablo31 Newbie   Videocard: None Processor: none Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: Antec earthwatts 550w 01-13-2017, 00:49 | posts: 17 I have looked more deeply. The noise is produced by the fan itself. I checked the casing and I do not see that the fault is from there (vibrations). But if I leave the tower horizontal doesn´t sound wrong. It only does when the tower is upright as most have a pc. The noise is of the bearing of the fan I think and it only does it to the 57% of rpm being in vertical.     elpollodiablo31 View Public Profile Find all posts by elpollodiablo31   (#6) HeavyHemi Ancient Guru     Videocard: 980Ti SC/TITAN SC PhysX Processor: i7 6850K 4.5 Ghz 1.34 v Mainboard: EVGA X99 FTWK Memory: Corsair Vengeance LPX 32G Soundcard: Asus Xonar Phoebus PSU: CORSAIR AX1200 01-13-2017, 04:20 | posts: 4,860 | Location: Wooing whilst wearing only socks.

Then I guess your solution is to use a program like AfterBurner to keep it out of the range that vibrates...until you replace the GPU.     HeavyHemi View Public Profile Find all posts by HeavyHemi « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     ATI Tray Tools         ATI Tray Tools Generic Discussion             ATI Tray Tools Public Beta Section     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

LEAD Ditch These 3 Resolutions to Become a More Powerful Public Speaker Want to become a more powerful public speaker? Start by breaking these New Year's resolutions--guilt free. By Fia Fasbinder Fia Fasbinder, CEO of The MOXiE Institute, arms speakers with the tools to deliver killer presentations. With over 15 years of experience in public speaking, classroom instruction, and presentation skill development, Fia teaches speakers to communicate with confidence, clarity and credibility.

Her unique approach to keynoting utilizes theatrical techniques and performing arts skills in addition to practical, real world knowledge culled from coaching clients at TEDX, UCSD, Qualcomm, Intel and numerous Fortune 500 companies. @moxiespeaker CEO, The MOXiE Institute@moxiespeaker WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement At the start of the year, everyone is trying their best to stick to the resolutions they swore that this year they would keep. Then mid-January rolls along and most of us begin to relax our standards and watch those resolutions go out the window. We start doing creative searches for clever resolutions that we know we can keep and will make our lives easier. We'll dig up studies to prove that chocolate makes us smarter or that we should sleep on the job. Instead of focusing on the new year's resolutions you need to keep, think of the ones you can--and should--break. After all, 80 percent of resolutions are broken by February. Why not make sure they're the right ones? 1. Don't Be Nervous Speakers often tell themselves not to get nervous. Easier said than done. Year after year speakers resolve to simply calm down before a big talk. It's definitely a worthy objective, but there's a reason you shouldn't hold yourself to it. Why You Should Break It: Stage fright comes from our bodies' natural response to threat reaction called fight or flight. Unfortunately, stage fright is unavoidable. There's simply no way to overcome millions of years of survival instinct. But here's the good news: You can break your resolution to calm down and resolve to get pumped up. The best speakers channel the adrenaline produced by their stage fright to get excited. Re-framing anxiety as excitement has been proven to drastically reduce stage fright and speech anxiety. 2. Be Relaxed Everyone aspires to be cool, calm and collected when they walk on stage. Relaxation leads to ease and connection which lets us communicate more effectively. So why shouldn't you aim for zen when you face the audience? Why You Should Break It: Telling yourself to relax is about as effective as telling yourself to imagine the audience naked--it simply doesn't work. Instead, arm yourself with some relaxation power tools in the form of pre-presentation warm ups. Every seasoned actor and athlete can speak to the power of warming up before a performance. This year, break the resolution to chill out and resolve to warm-up. Taking these simple steps to mentally and physically prepare your speaking instrument before your next big talk will make you appear grounded, centered and cool as a cucumber. 3. Be Funny Speakers often resolve to channel their inner life-of-the-party and come across as more humorous and loose. And who could blame them? We all know that humor is good for business. If this is true, then why should you drop the funny-business this year? Why You Should Break It: Instead of trying to be funny or memorizing a few jokes (please, just don't), try using storytelling techniques. An engaging story is the best way to connect with your audience and let your authentic speaking persona shine through. People identify with people, not one-liners. Work on adding compelling and engaging stories that amplify the message of your talk in place of a hackneyed comedy act. By the end of your speech, you may not be the king of comedy, but you'll avoid being a punch line. Feel no guilt in breaking these three public speaking false words of wisdom in the new year and ensure your presentations go from blank stares to standing ovations. If nothing else, resolve to believe you belong on the stage. That's one resolution we should all keep. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

Video Smart Cities: Barcelona A few brave souls predict IoT standards will start to gel this year, but making all those connected things work together still looks like a long shot. Two years ago, some industry analysts cautiously suggested that a vast array of IoT standards would merge into just a few beginning in 2017. If the internet of things in late 2014 was a cacophony of discordant musicians tuning up, it’s now reached the point where a few virtuosos are playing the same tune. But there’s still a lot of sheet music getting passed around. Two of the biggest rivals in IoT did find harmony last year. The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) was formed out of the AllSeen Alliance -- which used the Qualcomm-developed AllJoyn -- and the Intel-backed Open Interconnect Consortium. Previously, each group had been promoting its own way for devices to discover and learn about each other. In another promising sign, the IEEE p2413 standard, which will provide a unified approach to defining IoT architectures, may be finished this year, according to Oleg Logvinov, chairman of the p2413 working group. The standard is meant to span all industries plus consumer devices. It wouldn’t replace existing data formats but would reduce the amount of effort required to share data among them. Using what's already finished Some players are offering established technologies as common layers for interoperability. Last week at CES, the ZigBee Alliance announced Dotdot, which it calls a universal language for IoT. It’s an open application layer that handles the same kinds of things as OCF, but it’s based on the upper-layer protocol already implemented in many devices that use the ZigBee wireless network. Dotdot can already work with Thread networks. Sigma Designs, the main company behind Z-Wave networks, has released the Z-Wave interoperability layer to help developers integrate those networks with applications and services using cloud-based platforms like HomeKit. But there are still too many choices, for both developers and consumers, to make IoT simple and easy, industry analysts say. That will probably still be true 12 months from now, and maybe for two or three more years, they said. "I don't think we've gotten to the point where consolidation has made the lives of solution providers and application developers much easier,” Machina Research analyst Andy Castonguay said. “You still have a tremendous array of options out there." That’s kept consumer choices fragmented, too, which is one issue holding back smart homes, Avi Greengart at Current Analysis said. Most consumers won’t buy IoT gear until they see clear value, ease of installation, and ease of interoperability, he said. “Every major computing and silicon vendor is competing in this space, and there hasn’t been a consolidation around winners just yet. The market is kind of a mess right now,” Greengart said. Enter the lawyers Why is it so hard to agree on standards? "They're big companies, and they move slowly," said Mike Krell of Moor Insights and Strategy. Standards tend to raise intellectual property issues that bring armies of lawyers into the picture. Even breakthroughs in standards diplomacy aren't guarantees. Just because an impressive list of vendors, including Microsoft, Samsung, Cisco Systems, GE Digital, and Haier belong to OCF, that doesn’t mean they’ll all adopt the organization’s standard across all their products, Krell said. It’s common for big vendors to join many industry groups just to engage with and influence trends. There’s too much at stake in a potentially huge market for major companies to give up the chance to dominate home IoT, Greengart said. “I’m highly skeptical that 'co-opetition' in this regard will prevail over competition. And given than nobody knows what layer of the stack is going to be the most valuable one, everyone is fighting for their own,” he said. The common thread that will make smart homes work may turn out to be a system from one vendor, like Apple’s HomeKit, Greengart said. Apple is as well-positioned as any company to make that happen. But even though many manufacturers at last week’s CES show introduced products that use HomeKit, they didn’t play up that capability much, he said. Alexa, Amazon’s cloud-based AI platform that made a splash at CES, at least provides a single user interface, though Greengart said it’s not really a full IoT platform like HomeKit -- yet. There's even more work to do Even if part of the technology stack is standardized and life gets easier for developers and buyers, there are other hurdles to mass adoption of home IoT. Security, one of consumers’ biggest worries, has to be addressed across the board instead of one component at a time, as it is now, Machina’s Castonguay said. “We still are waiting for the market to develop an approach that would allow for a full, end-to-end, consistently updated and audited security approach,” he said. Then there’s the issue of how consumers will choose to buy IoT products. While most smart homes are do-it-yourself affairs today, carriers and cable companies may become the main sales channel, Krell said. But it’s still too soon to say. Some good news While things may be murky at home, there are glimmers of hope in another part of the internet of things. Last year, the 3GPP, which sets cellular standards, settled on two specifications for low-power versions of LTE. Those technologies, called Category M1 and Category NB1, will lead carriers to roll out specialized IoT services, Castonguay said. Both of the new technologies are slower than regular mobile data service but use less energy, so they’re compatible with small, battery-powered connected objects like sensors. As part of the LTE standard, these systems are relatively easy and economical upgrades to current networks. Another low-power, wide-area networking standard, LoRa, is gaining momentum with more national rollouts, Castonguay said. Comcast announced in October that it’s considering a nationwide LoRa network to serve enterprises. Some carriers in other countries already use the technology. Ingenu, a U.S. company with its own type of low-power network, is also making gains around the world, he said. Wherever IoT does reach mass adoption, it will be thanks to one or two technologies -- open or not -- that have somehow caught on with users. “Sometimes ubiquity is the most important part of a standard,” Greengart said.

G. Dan Hutechson, VLSI Research “450 is probably dead for another five to 10 years,” said G. Dan Hutcheson, a veteran semiconductor equipment analyst who is chairman and CEO of VLSI Research Inc. “It may come back, depending on whether there can be consensus among semiconductor equipment companies.” The Global 450 Consortium (G450C)--a joint R&D program that involved Intel, TSMC, Globalfoundries, IBM, Samsung, the SUNY Polytechnic Institute--quietly wound down its work at the end of last year with member companies concluding that the timing was not right for an optional Phase 2. “All the partners agreed that it’s not the right time to continue to focus on 450,” said Paul Kelly, associate vice president for consortia and initiatives at SUNY Poly, in an interview with EE Times. “But everyone walked away saying that the G450 program itself was a success.” At the recent Industry Strategy Symposium from semiconductor equipment and materials trade group SEMI, barely a whisper was heard about 450mm wafers. A few years ago, major chip makers including the G450 members were pushing for 450mm equipment to be available to equip fabs as soon as next year. But, according to Hutcheson, a major hurdle to the movement has been chip equipment makers, still smarting from the transition to 300mm in the early 2000s. He said the push to larger wafers at that time dramatically reduced unit demand, hurting the equipment makers’ businesses. “The equipment companies generally don’t want [450mm] after what happened with 300mm,” Hutcheson said. Hutcheson added that the initial push for 450mm came from a belief that chip makers needed an alternative way to increase sales if the industry could no longer keep on pace with Moore’s Law. But, Moore’s Law “clearly has not ended,” Hutcheson said. “What happened is that the shrinks have slowed down the growth of the silicon.” Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 2 Next > Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author Re: Nothing certain for 7nm and after resistion   1/15/2017 6:17:56 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I used "to/beyond 7nm" instead of "to 7nm and beyond" hoping to get around the definition variability.

"A normal politician would be chastened by that," says John Weaver, a leading Republican Trump critic, who advised Ohio Gov. John Kasich's presidential bid. "But the rules don't apply to him." Trump's surprise victory, Weaver says, "emboldened him somehow." Related ACLU Head on Bracing for Trump and 'Enormous Civil Liberties Crisis' Anthony Romero discusses his group's plan to limit the damage of a president who's openly hostile to essential liberties To put government power behind his darkest campaign rhetoric, Trump has assembled an extreme team – a crew that includes proud Islamophobes, heroes to white supremacists, defenders of torture, and executives from ExxonMobil and Wall Street. "What he's going to do at a policy level is much worse than most liberals understand," says Van Jones, the executive director of the Dream Corps and a CNN contributor. "It's going to be a Blitzkrieg from above – against everything we care about." The Trump agenda threatens the welfare of women, immigrants, LGBTQ Americans and, through climate denial, the health of the planet itself. "You're talking about the rights and lives of millions of Americans at stake," says Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU. But even as the 45th president takes the oath of office, a fierce resistance is rising to confront and constrain the Trump presidency. From the ACLU to the Sierra Club to Everytown for Gun Safety, civil society is girding for battle – reinforced by an unprecedented upwelling of activist support and donations. With so many groups facing "unprecedented assaults," says Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, the progressive world is experiencing a moment of "enormous solidarity – our issues and, frankly, our activists are all connected." Progressives are joined from day one by allies on the right, including principled #NeverTrump Republicans and the rising conservative opposition leader Evan McMullin, who countered Trump as an independent candidate for president. "Trump will blur the line between the right and left," McMullin tells Rolling Stone. "You'll find constitutional conservatives working with people on the left to stand up for civil liberty and stand up for equality – our shared future prosperity depends upon them." Rolling Stone interviewed more than a dozen top leaders of the Trump resistance. Beyond direct action and street protest, five clear opposition strategies are emerging. First, leverage Trump's unpopularity and fragile governing coalition to defeat him outright. "He's going to overreach dramatically, and we have to be prepared to deal him a significant setback," says Weaver. Second, where Trump cannot be stopped, constrain his ambition by bleeding his political capital – "raise the cost of Trump radicalism," says Frank Sharry a top immigrant-rights advocate. Third, blunt Trump's impact with political resistance in the blue states – and even the blue cities in red states – where Trump's agenda remains anathema. Fourth, get out of a defensive crouch: "The best defense is a good offense," says Sierra Club Director Michael Brune. Fifth, when in doubt, sue. "Much of what President Trump is proposing is flat-out illegal," says Romero, whose ACLU has labeled Trump a "one-man constitutional crisis." Squaring off against an aspiring autocrat may come at a high cost: "We need to be concerned about the use of surveillance power to go after critics," warns a prominent rights leader. And successful resistance will depend on creating at-times uncomfortable alliances. But the earliest returns are promising: "This is a progressive coalition and a grassroots army that I have never seen more unified," says Chad Griffin, head of the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for LGBTQ Americans, "or more determined to fight back." Immigration Some in the Trump resistance are putting on a brave face; those who advocate for immigrant rights are bracing for dark days. Trump has vowed a campaign of mass deportation – inspired by the racist and deadly Eisenhower-era program known as Operation Wetback. "Trump has been dehumanizing immigrants from day one of his candidacy," says Sharry, the longtime former director of the National Immigration Forum who now heads America's Voice, a leading immigrant advocacy group. "We would be foolish to engage in wishful thinking that he's going to moderate his course." What makes Trump so dangerous is that "the executive branch has wide latitude" on immigration, Sharry says. "There's a lot a Trump administration can do that's going to be difficult to stop in the courts and in Congress." As a result, immigrant-rights activists are calling for a movement to harbor and protect those without legal status – in terms that evoke the French resistance. "It's going to take unprecedented societal mobilization to thwart the deportation machinery," Sharry says, "from people who are prepared to commit acts of civil disobedience to protect people." To start, Trump has vowed to round up, deport or imprison as many as three million "criminal" undocumented immigrants. "That scale of deportation would be unprecedented in American history," says the ACLU's Romero. Trump's ambition is disconnected from reality. "There's nowhere near three million 'bad hombres' in America," says Sharry. Only by counting common status violations – like driving without a license – as crimes can you get Trump's totals. "We expect them to stretch the definition of 'criminal' to anyone who is in the country without status," Sharry says. "That puts 11 million people at risk." Kevork Djansezian/Getty Among the most vulnerable: 740,000 young immigrants – so-called DREAMers – brought to the country as children, who registered with the Obama administration to gain legal status and employment rights under a program called DACA. Trump has vowed to revoke this "executive amnesty" on day one. At the political level, immigrant-rights activists are going "to try to make DACA a huge fight – bloody enough that it comes with a cost," Sharry says. America's cities have emerged as centers of resistance to Trump's deportation plans. Dozens of mayors from New York to Santa Fe to Seattle have vowed to preserve "sanctuary cities" – which refuse to cooperate in federal immigration enforcement – despite threats to revoke millions in federal funding. The reality is that undocumented immigrants are more popular in America's cities than is the president. "These mayors are not getting out in front of public opinion," Sharry says, "but reflecting it." The Environment Trump's flamboyant climate denial and disgust for environmental regulation – calling global warming a "hoax" and vowing to leave only "tidbits" of environmental protection intact – are now becoming federal policy. Trump has nominated climate denier and fracking champion Scott Pruitt to head the EPA, an agency Pruitt sued repeatedly as attorney general of Oklahoma, including to block Obama's carbon-reducing Clean Power Plan. Pruitt used his nomination announcement to attack the agency he hopes to lead for its "out-of-control anti-energy agenda" that he claimed, without evidence, "has destroyed millions of jobs." For energy secretary, Trump has nominated former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has blasted climate change as a "contrived phony mess." Trump is counting on Perry to "take advantage of our huge natural resource deposits." In what 350.org founder Bill McKibben calls "the most farcical chapter in the absurdist drama that is the Trump transition," Trump has tapped as secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who was until recently CEO of ExxonMobil and who would preside over a petro-driven foreign policy and likely greenlight the Keystone XL pipeline. Environmentalists don't sugarcoat the dangers. But they're far from despondent – more like defiant. "We're not going to cower for the next four years," says Michael Brune of the Sierra Club. "We're going to fight like dogs – in court, in the court of public opinion, in the street and in corporate boardrooms. We'll hold this administration accountable to the law," he vows, "and the expectation of the American public." Environmentalists are keeping chins up, in part, because the market has their backs. Wind and solar increasingly beat fossil fuels on cost alone. "Trump and Tillerson can't stop that," says Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace. Consider that Obama's Clean Power Plan is stalled in the courts, and likely dead under Trump, but national power plant emissions have already been slashed to meet the Obama goal for 2024. Climate activists in New York City Michael Nigro/ZUMA When it comes to Trump's darker aims – rolling back core environmental regulations – environmentalists believe time and public opinion will be on their side. "Trump can't move at the stroke of a pen to undo anything that he wants," says Jeremy Symons, vice president of climate political affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund. Reversing regulations requires months of public comment and is subject to court challenge. "Time is our ally, because once the public sees overreach there will be a backlash," says Symons. "Outside of special-interest lobbyists in Washington, nobody wants to move backwards." Powerful and diverse business interests are already pressuring Trump to reconsider his climate denial. In November, more than 300 companies – including DuPont, Intel and General Mills – signed an open letter to Trump warning that his threat to abandon the Paris climate accord "puts American prosperity at risk." Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire CEO and former New York mayor, has called on the 128 U.S. leaders in the Global Covenant of Mayors to join the Paris accord in place of the federal government if Trump withdraws. And California is forging ahead with global leadership: "Whatever they do in Washington ... we will persevere," Gov. Jerry Brown told a gathering of climate scientists in December, declaring that if Trump acts to shutter NASA's climate program, California will launch "its own damn satellite." At the grassroots level, climate activists are plotting to disrupt the Trump administration's bid to ramp up coal, oil and natural gas extraction with direct-action protests – like the ones that shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline and stalled Keystone XL. "There's a bigger appetite for direct action because conventional doors to democratic participation appear to be shutting on us," Leonard of Greenpeace tells Rolling Stone. "We have been flooded with requests from other organizations to come to our direct action trainings – learning these skills. We are entering the age of resistance." Women's Rights Anchored by a vice president who has vowed to relegate Roe v. Wade to the "dustbin of history," the Trump administration is openly hostile to women's health and reproductive freedoms. Trump will appoint only pro-life judges, he's said, with the aim of allowing individual states to ban abortion – forcing women to "go to another state." Trump is now in position to sign legislation defunding Planned Parenthood and to revoke the executive order that requires health insurers to cover birth control – a benefit to 55 million American women. Trump could also reinstate the global "gag rule" that blocks U.S. funding for aid groups that provide – or even discuss – abortion services. "We are preparing as though the Trump administration is going to do everything within its executive power" to attack reproductive rights, says Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL. And the movement is bracing for the worst-case-scenario: a Trump-stacked Supreme Court that overturns Roe. NARAL is focused on creating "asylum zones" in cities and states where women can be confident of accessing reproductive services, and, says Hogue, to "mobilize resources so that as many women as possible can get to those safe zones in the event abortion services disappear entirely from other states." An April rally for women's rights in Indiana Jeremy Hogan/Alamy Resistance to the Trump/Pence agenda is beginning with a show of force. On inauguration weekend, the Women's March on Washington will bring hundreds of thousands to the Capitol to "demand protection of our rights, our safety, our health, and our families." In a mass action on social media, Cecile Richards has launched the largest "I Stand With Planned Parenthood" campaign in the group's history – to "agitate and engage millions" by asking Americans to share "what people are poised to lose if Planned Parenthood is blocked from serving patients." "This is literally whether a woman who has a lump in her breast can come to us in Ohio to have a breast exam," Richards says. "Or whether a young person can come to us for family planning." More than 1.5 million Americans, many of them Medicaid patients, rely on Planned Parenthood, "and for most of them we're their only medical provider; there's no one to take our place." In Texas, where state Republicans have succeeded in shuttering dozens of Planned Parenthood clinics, the maternal death rate has doubled, hitting poor women of color the hardest. "It is a very serious threat," says Richards, "but we will not go without a fight." Guns Trump owes an enormous political debt to his most potent 2016 backer: the NRA, which spent more than $30 million to get him elected. "They want to get what they paid for," says Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, the grassroots arm of Everytown for Gun Safety. The gun lobby's wish list for Trump begins with replacing deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia with another Second-Amendment fundamentalist – a judge who will back a constitutional right to own military-style assault weapons. The NRA is already pushing a new law to allow residents of states with lax concealed-carry laws, like Montana, to pack heat in states with tight restrictions, like Massachusetts. The NRA also expects Trump to follow through with promises to roll back gun-free zones in schools and to revoke President Obama's executive expansion of background checks. Trump with the NRA's Chris Cox and Wayne LaPierre in May Scott Olson/Getty "With the NRA's champion in office," Watts says, "we see ourselves playing a lot of defense." But Watts hopes that Trump's "dangerous" NRA payback will "galvanize Americans to get off the sidelines and say 'no' to this dystopian vision of guns for anyone, anywhere, anytime – no questions asked." Priority number one is building Moms Demand Action as the grassroots counterweight to the five-million-member NRA. Watts began movement-building in 2012, in the wake of the Newtown massacre. Her group now counts chapters in every state and more than three million members. "The more people join the ranks," she says, "the less likely anything is to pass." Watts also sees running room in state capitals and corporate boardrooms – following the playbook of the marriage equality movement during the darkest days of the Bush administration. "We've gotten businesses like Starbucks, Chipotle and Target to stop open-carry inside their stores," she says. "And we got Facebook to halt all private sales of guns." Electorally, Watts and Everytown are focused on passing universal background checks state-by-state, and have that fight in seven states since Sandy Hook, most recently in Nevada in November. "Nearly half of all Americans now live in states that have closed their background-check loophole," Watts says. "These states are doing what Congress won't." LGBTQ Rights President-elect Trump made news in the aftermath of the election by calling marriage equality "settled" law in an interview with 60 Minutes. But top advocates for the LGBTQ community take Trump's words as cold comfort – pointing to the team the president has assembled, full of politicians hostile to LGBTQ rights and eager "to roll back our progress that we've made under President Obama," says Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. The selection of Pence as vice president speaks loudest to Trump's intentions. "He chose a man who has been the face of our opposition his entire life," Griffin says. "Pence was not only against hate crimes protections, he supports conversion therapy and actually advocated revoking HIV funding in order to pay for it." Trump put Pence in charge of the presidential transition. And Pence has entrusted the domestic-policy track to Ken Blackwell, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council who has called homosexuality a "transgression against God's law" and a "choice" like becoming "an arsonist ... or a kleptomaniac." Ken Blackwell Eduardo Munoz/Getty Trump can reverse Obama's executive orders on LGBTQ rights, including a workplace non-discrimination mandate that protects employees of federal contractors, and a Department of Education order that safeguards trans students. Trump has already endorsed legislation to enshrine "Kim-Davis-style discrimination," Griffin says – allowing people and businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ Americans on the basis of a professed religious objection to same-sex marriage and/or gay sex. But there is political peril in targeting LGBTQ Americans: Just ask North Carolina's former Republican governor, Pat McCrory, who was defeated in November in a revolt against the state's anti-trans bathroom bill. "This is the first time in our history that we have ousted a sitting elected official solely on the issue of attacking our community," Griffin says – a victory made more remarkable because Trump carried North Carolina by more than three points. The LGBTQ community will carry this momentum into fights for trans-inclusive nondiscrimination laws in America's cities, including in the reddest of states. Last year the Human Rights Campaign swept through a non-discrimination law in the capital city of Mississippi. "If we can do it in Jackson," Griffin says, "we can do it anywhere." True Conservatives The election of Donald Trump has been met with quiet horror in many conservative circles. "The Republican Party normalized a lunatic," longtime GOP strategist Stuart Steven wrote to this reporter on election night. "They knew better and refused to stand up – utter disgrace." Many are disgusted that Trump has given racial demagogs a voice in the GOP – and representation in his inner circle. "Gangrene has entered into the body, and either you join in the effort to cut it out – to kill it – or you acquiesce to it," says John Weaver. "We can't stand by and allow racists, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, anti-Semites – whatever you want to call them – free reign in the public discourse. They cannot be normalized." Trump also faces resistance from conservatives on policy. "You have people concerned about the national security implications of Trump – his attitude toward Putin, his affection for autocrats, his not understanding the basics of engagement," Weaver says. "Others are more concerned on the civil rights – the basic rights of Americans." The trick, says Weaver, is to build beyond isolated pockets of dissent in the GOP ranks – Sen. John McCain on torture, or Sen. Rand Paul on surveillance. Trump will be countered, Weaver says, "by a web, not by a rifle shot." Evan McMullin George Frey/Getty The right's opposition to Trump remains loose. ("People are dusting the rubble off," says Weaver, "taking stock of really how bad it is.") But it has emerging leadership in Evan McMullin, a former CIA agent and senior GOP House staffer who ran against Trump for president, placing third in Utah. McMullin cites the president's "resolute alignment" with Russia and his "authoritarian playbook" to contend that "Donald Trump is not a loyal American." The elected GOP, he adds, is focused on party power and not the national interest. "I don't have a lot of hope that many of our public officials on the Republican side will stand up any time soon," he says. McMullin is marshaling conservative resistance to Trump and seeking common cause with progressives. He wants to build a movement around the foundational American principles of "equality and liberty" flouted by Trump. And he hopes the left and right can take this moment to learn from each other: with conservatives following the progressive lead on civil liberties for all Americans, and liberals cottoning to the virtues of limited government. "When conservatives say it's really dangerous for us to have this big, centralized government, some on the left might not have understood why," he says. "But with Donald Trump taking the presidency, I think they now understand." Civil Liberties Defense of our democracy in the age of Trump will fall to the courts – and to groups like the American Civil Liberties Union that can take legal action against the incoming administration's threatened constitutional abuses. Anthony Romero is bracing for a full-blown "civil liberties crisis" in America under Trump. "The stakes are very high," Romero says, "because the impact on the basic rights of so many Americans hang in the balance – whether they be Muslims or undocumented immigrants or women." Preparing a "wholescale campaign to resist" the new administration, Romero says the ACLU is already honing legal theories, staffing up in states along the Mexican border and reaching out to Muslim communities across America. The ACLU's tactics will draw inspiration from GOP obstructionists. "The strategy that Republicans used so effectively – trying to gum up the machinery of the Obama administration" is the same game plan the ACLU will use, Romero says, "to forestall the ability of the Trump administration to make good on its plans." At times, the ACLU will act preemptively "to hold off the worst of the policies from taking effect." In other moments, it will seek to tie up Trump in court "right as the policies are taking effect – to try to deprive the administration of momentum." NAACP President Cornell Brooks, Fraternal Order of Police National President Chuck Canterbury and ACLU Legal Director David Cole testify during Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearing on January 11th. Tasos Katopodis/Getty The group is vigilant – but confident. Many Trump proposals are "flat-out illegal," Romero insists: moving to reinstate torture or waterboarding is "patently unconstitutional and violates international treaties." Trump's threat to jail and revoke the citizenship of flag-burners is "unconstitutional and contrary to established law," Romero says. But with other proposals, he warns, "it's newer terrain." The immigration ban on Muslims, he argues, "would run afoul of the First- and Fifth-Amendment protections of American Muslims" – but those theories will need to be tested in court. Above all, Romero says the ACLU will fight to protect the rights of protesters from a president who has displayed a "complete lack of respect" for them. "If the protestors rights are trammelled, or they're intimidated, or they self-censor," Romero says, "then we're in for even darker days ahead of us." The First Test The first test of the Trump resistance has arrived with the confirmation hearings of the new president's cabinet appointees. Trump's polarizing choices have united diverse coalitions – and strange bedfellows. The nomination of Exxon's Rex Tillerson for secretary of state has raised the hackles of environmentalists – who recoil at the company's long history of climate disinformation – and hawks, who distrust Tillerson's coziness with Russia's Vladimir Putin. "Even the minority of people who voted for Trump weren't voting to turn over the keys [on climate policy] to the head of an oil company," insists 350.org founder Bill McKibben. Tweeting his own skepticism of Tillerson, Sen. Marco Rubio wrote, "Being a 'friend of Vladimir' is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary Of State." No cabinet pick has united the Trump resistance like Jeff Sessions, the Alabama senator tapped to head the Justice Department, where he would have broad autonomy to set the national course on the enforcement of civil rights, drug and immigration policy. Sessions was blocked from Senate confirmation once before, when the body refused to seat him as federal judge in the mid-Eighties, following hearings that detailed a distressing history of racism. As a U.S. attorney, Sessions had prosecuted black voting-rights activists – close associates of Martin Luther King Jr. – on trumped-up accusations of voter fraud. (The activists were found not guilty.) And he's railed against the Voting Rights Act as "intrusive." According to Senate testimony, Sessions repeatedly referred to a black subordinate as "boy" and opined – during an investigation of a Ku Klux Klan lynching – that he'd thought the KKK was "OK until I found out they smoked pot." (Sessions denied denigrating his colleague, and insisted the Klan comment was a joke.) Sessions also called civil rights groups, including the NAACP, "un-American organizations teaching anti-American values." In his U.S. Senate career, Sessions has continued a track record as an extremist. He's an unreconstructed drug warrior – Sessions insisted last year that "good people don't smoke marijuana." An immigration hardliner, Sessions has long ties to the far-right organization FAIR; "he has cavorted with groups that we consider to be hate groups," says Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Members of the Alabama NAACP stage a sit-in at Jeff Sessions' office in Mobile. Benard Simelton Sharry, the immigrant-rights leader, calls the idea of Sessions enforcing civil rights and immigration laws "preposterous." Todd A. Cox, director of policy at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, says "it is unimaginable that he could be trusted to enforce this nation's civil rights laws." Coretta Scott King warned in a 1986 letter that Sessions' appointment to the judiciary would "irreparably damage the work of my husband." Sessions faces deep resistance from the drug-reform community, concerned Sessions will break the fragile federal Drug War truce that has enabled state-legal marijuana to boom into a $7 billion industry. Sessions is also opposed by conservatives, who fear he will derail bipartisan progress on issues like criminal justice reform. "Sessions illustrates the need for a new conservative movement," McMullin says. Given the deference senators historically show when colleagues are nominated to the cabinet, Sharry predicts "an uphill fight." But just this act of fighting, he says, will forge alliances among "groups who don't always work arm-in-arm." To have any hope of succeeding, the Trump resistance must seek out challenging allies. Responsibility for coalition-building weighs heavily on conservatives. "It's important for the opposition to Trump to be bipartisan," Weaver says. "It plays into his hands – and Steve Bannon's hands – for it to be seen as coming from the far left." For some groups, this means embracing Trump voters themselves. "One of the most heartening, but somewhat perplexing things," says Cecile Richards, "is the number of Trump voters who are deeply concerned now about losing access to Planned Parenthood." Hogue says NARAL will be agitating among Trump voters to tell the new president, "Stop messing with reproductive rights and go back to trying to build infrastructure." The first step for progressives, says Van Jones, is to get over the shock and horror at Trump's victory, and to stop thinking of Trump voters as the enemy, instead seeking common cause with working-class Americans who are already feeling "duped." The coalition required to stop Trump won't always agree, Jones says. The key is not to feed the division that is the president's secret weapon. "Trump desperately needs everybody screaming at each other," Jones says, "so he can get away with his agenda." Like Jones, McMullin sees power in love – and love of country. "If there's a silver lining to any of this is," he says, "it's that people on the right and the left may come together to stand up for foundational truths and decency and unity in America. "It's not easy to have hope right now, but that does give me hope," he says. "We need to stand up together as Americans to make sure that our system is not destroyed."

Sen. Richard Burr, who chairs the select committee, revealed Thursday that they will not look into the ties because they "don't have anything to do with political campaigns," which Pelosi railed against while meeting with the reporters in the Capitol on Friday. "Leader [Mitch] McConnell is saying the [Senate] Intelligence Committee can do that. Meanwhile, the GOP chair of the Senate Intel Committee, Sen. Burr, announced he will not investigate Russia and the campaign in the U.S.," she said. "That makes Republicans accomplices in my view of President-elect Trump's praise of Putin." Pelosi continued to echo Democratic calls for a special investigation into the attempted Russian hacking into the election. The comments came after members of Congress took part in a classified briefing on Russia, which Pelosi declined to elaborate on. She also declined to say if FBI Director James Comey indicated that the FBI is looking into the Trump campaign's potential ties to Russia.

"You know I can't talk about what happened in the meeting," Pelosi said. "I can just say publicly that the American people are owed the truth, and there is a great deal of evidence to say that this is an issue of high interest to the American people, to the strength, the integrity of our own democracy." "For that reason, the FBI should let us know if they're doing that investigation or not," Pelosi continued. "They're usually inscrutable, as you saw in the public testimony in the Senate." Burr said it would be the FBI's job to investigate any ties between the campaign and Moscow.

The OS also has higher operating costs due to increased malware attacks and many manufacturers no longer provide drivers for Windows 7 which means that modern peripherals are no longer working with the OS, the software giant writes. “Windows 10 is the only Windows version to provide support for the latest Intel, AMD and Qualcomm chips. In addition, many programs are already written or developed for newer versions of Windows,” according to a post on the website of Microsoft Germany . “Companies that continue to use the operating system take enormous dangers,” the software giant writes. The company goes on to write that Windows 7 was developed for ‘the wireless 2000’s and that ‘Windows 7 is based on long-outdated security architectures’. In 2020, on January 14th, support for Windows 7 ends which means Microsoft will no longer release security updates for the OS. Basic support ended a year ago meaning that Microsoft stopped adding new functionality to the operating system. “Windows 7 slowly becomes old. It does not meet the requirements of today’s modern technology, nor the high security requirements of IT departments, “said Markus Nitschke, Head of Windows at Microsoft Deutschland. “We learned from Windows XP that companies should take early steps to avoid future risks or costs.” The message from Microsoft appears to try to convince users to update to Windows 10 to avoid the same situation as with Windows XP. This OS is still run by millions of computers, both at home and in companies, while has not received any security updates since 2014. By warning users to switch to a more modern OS on time Microsoft not only want to save them from security risks, it appears to be also an attempt to get more users for its latest OS. Windows 7 is currently by far the most used Windows version globally, according to StatCounter more than 40% is using the OS, while Windows 10 is used by about 28% of the internet users. Users who didn’t take Microsoft’s offer of a free upgrade to Windows 10 can still do so, using Microsoft’s Media Creation Tool.

Maybe there is some truth to that statement. But I can't see any reason to think Windows 10 is any better. If fact it is arguably worse - on installation you are still given Administrator privileges by default, but Microsoft tells you even less than before. 4 Agree AaronZ26593 New Member Posted on: 14 Jan 17 02:18 Desperation started with forced updates lol *Shakes Head* I'm sticking with Win 7 it still works and I don't plan on building a new PC anytime soon. 6 Agree Mary Cahill MyCE Junior Member Posted on: 14 Jan 17 10:28 Yes, my first thought has already been extremely well sized up by the others above - when a company gets a reputation for being under-handed - everything they say after that is suspect - that's why "integrity" is so important for a brand-name to maintain.  Microsoft lost it!  1 Agree paulw2 MyCE Senior Member Posted on: 15 Jan 17 01:11 Sounds like MS is softening us up for an early end for Windows 7 support.. 0 Agree CDan MyCE Resident Posted on: 15 Jan 17 04:14 Gosh, lose "support"?

Is this the year IoT standards will finally make sense? Some are starting to come together, but it looks like the battles will go on for a few more years Stephen Lawson (IDG News Service) 14 January, 2017 05:05 - - - - print email Comments A few brave souls predict IoT standards will start to gel this year, but making all those connected things work together still looks like a long shot. Two years ago, some industry analysts cautiously suggested that a vast array of IoT standards would merge into just a few beginning in 2017. If the internet of things in late 2014 was a cacophony of discordant musicians tuning up, it’s now reached the point where a few virtuosos are playing the same tune. But there’s still a lot of sheet music getting passed around. Two of the biggest rivals in IoT did find harmony last year. The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) was formed out of the AllSeen Alliance -- which used the Qualcomm-developed AllJoyn -- and the Intel-backed Open Interconnect Consortium. Previously, each group had been promoting its own way for devices to discover and learn about each other. In another promising sign, the IEEE p2413 standard, which will provide a unified approach to defining IoT architectures, may be finished this year, according to Oleg Logvinov, chairman of the p2413 working group. The standard is meant to span all industries plus consumer devices. It wouldn’t replace existing data formats but would reduce the amount of effort required to share data among them. Using what's already finished Some players are offering established technologies as common layers for interoperability. Last week at CES, the ZigBee Alliance announced Dotdot, which it calls a universal language for IoT. It’s an open application layer that handles the same kinds of things as OCF, but it’s based on the upper-layer protocol already implemented in many devices that use the ZigBee wireless network. Dotdot can already work with Thread networks. Sigma Designs, the main company behind Z-Wave networks, has released the Z-Wave interoperability layer to help developers integrate those networks with applications and services using cloud-based platforms like HomeKit. But there are still too many choices, for both developers and consumers, to make IoT simple and easy, industry analysts say. That will probably still be true 12 months from now, and maybe for two or three more years, they said. "I don't think we've gotten to the point where consolidation has made the lives of solution providers and application developers much easier,” Machina Research analyst Andy Castonguay said. “You still have a tremendous array of options out there." That’s kept consumer choices fragmented, too, which is one issue holding back smart homes, Avi Greengart at Current Analysis said. Most consumers won’t buy IoT gear until they see clear value, ease of installation, and ease of interoperability, he said. “Every major computing and silicon vendor is competing in this space, and there hasn’t been a consolidation around winners just yet. The market is kind of a mess right now,” Greengart said. Enter the lawyers Why is it so hard to agree on standards? "They're big companies, and they move slowly," said Mike Krell of Moor Insights and Strategy. Standards tend to raise intellectual property issues that bring armies of lawyers into the picture. Even breakthroughs in standards diplomacy aren't guarantees. Just because an impressive list of vendors, including Microsoft, Samsung, Cisco Systems, GE Digital, and Haier belong to OCF, that doesn’t mean they’ll all adopt the organization’s standard across all their products, Krell said. It’s common for big vendors to join many industry groups just to engage with and influence trends. There’s too much at stake in a potentially huge market for major companies to give up the chance to dominate home IoT, Greengart said. “I’m highly skeptical that 'co-opetition' in this regard will prevail over competition. And given than nobody knows what layer of the stack is going to be the most valuable one, everyone is fighting for their own,” he said. The common thread that will make smart homes work may turn out to be a system from one vendor, like Apple’s HomeKit, Greengart said. Apple is as well-positioned as any company to make that happen. But even though many manufacturers at last week’s CES show introduced products that use HomeKit, they didn’t play up that capability much, he said. Alexa, Amazon’s cloud-based AI platform that made a splash at CES, at least provides a single user interface, though Greengart said it’s not really a full IoT platform like HomeKit -- yet. There's even more work to do Even if part of the technology stack is standardized and life gets easier for developers and buyers, there are other hurdles to mass adoption of home IoT. Security, one of consumers’ biggest worries, has to be addressed across the board instead of one component at a time, as it is now, Machina’s Castonguay said. “We still are waiting for the market to develop an approach that would allow for a full, end-to-end, consistently updated and audited security approach,” he said. Then there’s the issue of how consumers will choose to buy IoT products. While most smart homes are do-it-yourself affairs today, carriers and cable companies may become the main sales channel, Krell said. But it’s still too soon to say. Some good news While things may be murky at home, there are glimmers of hope in another part of the internet of things. Last year, the 3GPP, which sets cellular standards, settled on two specifications for low-power versions of LTE. Those technologies, called Category M1 and Category NB1, will lead carriers to roll out specialized IoT services, Castonguay said. Both of the new technologies are slower than regular mobile data service but use less energy, so they’re compatible with small, battery-powered connected objects like sensors. As part of the LTE standard, these systems are relatively easy and economical upgrades to current networks. Another low-power, wide-area networking standard, LoRa, is gaining momentum with more national rollouts, Castonguay said. Comcast announced in October that it’s considering a nationwide LoRa network to serve enterprises. Some carriers in other countries already use the technology. Ingenu, a U.S. company with its own type of low-power network, is also making gains around the world, he said. Wherever IoT does reach mass adoption, it will be thanks to one or two technologies -- open or not -- that have somehow caught on with users. “Sometimes ubiquity is the most important part of a standard,” Greengart said.

In another promising sign, the IEEE p2413 standard, which will provide a unified approach to defining IoT architectures, may be finished this year, according to Oleg Logvinov, chairman of the p2413 working group. The standard is meant to span all industries plus consumer devices. It wouldn’t replace existing data formats but would reduce the amount of effort required to share data among them. Using what's already finished Some players are offering established technologies as common layers for interoperability. Last week at CES, the ZigBee Alliance announced Dotdot, which it calls a universal language for IoT. It’s an open application layer that handles the same kinds of things as OCF, but it’s based on the upper-layer protocol already implemented in many devices that use the ZigBee wireless network. Dotdot can already work with Thread networks. Sigma Designs, the main company behind Z-Wave networks, has released the Z-Wave interoperability layer to help developers integrate those networks with applications and services using cloud-based platforms like HomeKit. But there are still too many choices, for both developers and consumers, to make IoT simple and easy, industry analysts say. That will probably still be true 12 months from now, and maybe for two or three more years, they said. "I don't think we've gotten to the point where consolidation has made the lives of solution providers and application developers much easier,” Machina Research analyst Andy Castonguay said. “You still have a tremendous array of options out there." That’s kept consumer choices fragmented, too, which is one issue holding back smart homes, Avi Greengart at Current Analysis said. Most consumers won’t buy IoT gear until they see clear value, ease of installation, and ease of interoperability, he said. “Every major computing and silicon vendor is competing in this space, and there hasn’t been a consolidation around winners just yet. The market is kind of a mess right now,” Greengart said. Enter the lawyers Why is it so hard to agree on standards? "They're big companies, and they move slowly," said Mike Krell of Moor Insights and Strategy. Standards tend to raise intellectual property issues that bring armies of lawyers into the picture. Even breakthroughs in standards diplomacy aren't guarantees. Just because an impressive list of vendors, including Microsoft, Samsung, Cisco Systems, GE Digital, and Haier belong to OCF, that doesn’t mean they’ll all adopt the organization’s standard across all their products, Krell said. It’s common for big vendors to join many industry groups just to engage with and influence trends. There’s too much at stake in a potentially huge market for major companies to give up the chance to dominate home IoT, Greengart said. “I’m highly skeptical that 'co-opetition' in this regard will prevail over competition. And given than nobody knows what layer of the stack is going to be the most valuable one, everyone is fighting for their own,” he said. The common thread that will make smart homes work may turn out to be a system from one vendor, like Apple’s HomeKit, Greengart said. Apple is as well-positioned as any company to make that happen. But even though many manufacturers at last week’s CES show introduced products that use HomeKit, they didn’t play up that capability much, he said. Alexa, Amazon’s cloud-based AI platform that made a splash at CES, at least provides a single user interface, though Greengart said it’s not really a full IoT platform like HomeKit -- yet. There's even more work to do Even if part of the technology stack is standardized and life gets easier for developers and buyers, there are other hurdles to mass adoption of home IoT. Security, one of consumers’ biggest worries, has to be addressed across the board instead of one component at a time, as it is now, Machina’s Castonguay said. “We still are waiting for the market to develop an approach that would allow for a full, end-to-end, consistently updated and audited security approach,” he said. Then there’s the issue of how consumers will choose to buy IoT products. While most smart homes are do-it-yourself affairs today, carriers and cable companies may become the main sales channel, Krell said. But it’s still too soon to say. Some good news While things may be murky at home, there are glimmers of hope in another part of the internet of things. Last year, the 3GPP, which sets cellular standards, settled on two specifications for low-power versions of LTE. Those technologies, called Category M1 and Category NB1, will lead carriers to roll out specialized IoT services, Castonguay said. Both of the new technologies are slower than regular mobile data service but use less energy, so they’re compatible with small, battery-powered connected objects like sensors. As part of the LTE standard, these systems are relatively easy and economical upgrades to current networks. Another low-power, wide-area networking standard, LoRa, is gaining momentum with more national rollouts, Castonguay said. Comcast announced in October that it’s considering a nationwide LoRa network to serve enterprises. Some carriers in other countries already use the technology. Ingenu, a U.S. company with its own type of low-power network, is also making gains around the world, he said. Wherever IoT does reach mass adoption, it will be thanks to one or two technologies -- open or not -- that have somehow caught on with users. “Sometimes ubiquity is the most important part of a standard,” Greengart said.

Is this the year IoT standards will finally make sense? Some are starting to come together, but it looks like the battles will go on for a few more years Stephen Lawson (IDG News Service) 14 January, 2017 05:05 - - - - print email Comments A few brave souls predict IoT standards will start to gel this year, but making all those connected things work together still looks like a long shot. Two years ago, some industry analysts cautiously suggested that a vast array of IoT standards would merge into just a few beginning in 2017. If the internet of things in late 2014 was a cacophony of discordant musicians tuning up, it’s now reached the point where a few virtuosos are playing the same tune. But there’s still a lot of sheet music getting passed around. Two of the biggest rivals in IoT did find harmony last year. The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) was formed out of the AllSeen Alliance -- which used the Qualcomm-developed AllJoyn -- and the Intel-backed Open Interconnect Consortium. Previously, each group had been promoting its own way for devices to discover and learn about each other. In another promising sign, the IEEE p2413 standard, which will provide a unified approach to defining IoT architectures, may be finished this year, according to Oleg Logvinov, chairman of the p2413 working group.

Dotdot can already work with Thread networks. Sigma Designs, the main company behind Z-Wave networks, has released the Z-Wave interoperability layer to help developers integrate those networks with applications and services using cloud-based platforms like HomeKit.

SUBSCRIBE Super Bowl LI teaser ads a no show so far this year with brands keeping campaigns under wraps By this time last year, three brands had released teaser ads and three more had shared creative from their Super Bowl campaigns. Amy Gesenhues on January 13, 2017 at 12:30 pm More As of Sunday, we’ll be three weeks out from Super Bowl LI. By this time last year, three brands had already released teaser ads for their Super Bowl campaigns, and three more had shared creative. This year is a different story with the lineup of Super Bowl brands remaining surprisingly quiet. So far, we’ve only seen creative from Intel, which released a 30-second spot starring NFL MVP Tom Brady scheduled to air during the February 5th Super Bowl broadcast. For Super Bowl 50, Butterfinger and Wix both released teaser videos in December of 2015, more than a month before the game. By the second week of January, Turbo Tax had also released teaser ads. Taco Bell and SunTrust Bank didn’t release video ads, but both brands had shared creative from their Super Bowl 50 campaigns. Taco Bell’s ‘redacted’ release for Super Bowl 50 Carla Marshall, the editor in chief of TubularInsights.com, says she believes brands are getting more savvy when it comes to consumer fatigue around large-scale events like the Super Bowl. “We know there is a lot of excitement and anticipation around Super Bowl content, but a long run-up in terms of teasers may have less impact than a big launch a few days before,” says Marshall, “I think this is the year we will see some of the bigger brands take a slightly different approach to try and capture the public’s attention at exactly the right time, and measure the ROI that has.” Devra Prywes, the SVP of Marketing and Insight for video analytics firm Unruly, agrees with Marshall. She says brands may be realizing that Super Bowl teaser ads are not driving the awareness or engagement when compared to their official Super Bowl spots. “In fact, we actually saw something quite interesting happen last year for the first time,” says Prywes, “While main ads outperformed teasers, the extended versions of TV spots often were more shared than the aired versions.” Prywes says this was true for Heinze’s “Weiner Stampede,” T-Mobile’s “Restricted Bling,” the NFL’s “Super Bowl Babies Choir” and Audi’s “Commander.” Data from Unruly’s “Science of Sharing: Super Bowl 50” report found that teaser ads made up nearly 30 percent of the total number of Super Bowl 50 ads that were launched, but only accounted for 10 percent of overall views and two percent of shares. Prywes says for teaser ads to make an impact, they have to make a strong emotional connection – and that can be a challenge with such a short run-time. “Based on our data, teasers tend to be distracting – for splitting budget and attention,” says Prywes, “As even the best ads need to be seen to be shared, it’s more effective to reinvest that budget into distribution to deliver the main ad to a brand’s target audience everywhere these people are already consuming video.” We suspect to see more activity in the coming days. One brand confirmed over email it plans on sharing details around creative for its Super Bowl LI campaign next week.

LEAD Ditch These 3 Resolutions to Become a More Powerful Public Speaker Want to become a more powerful public speaker? Start by breaking these New Year's resolutions--guilt free.

Then mid-January rolls along and most of us begin to relax our standards and watch those resolutions go out the window. We start doing creative searches for clever resolutions that we know we can keep and will make our lives easier. We'll dig up studies to prove that chocolate makes us smarter or that we should sleep on the job. Instead of focusing on the new year's resolutions you need to keep, think of the ones you can--and should--break. After all, 80 percent of resolutions are broken by February. Why not make sure they're the right ones? 1. Don't Be Nervous Speakers often tell themselves not to get nervous. Easier said than done. Year after year speakers resolve to simply calm down before a big talk. It's definitely a worthy objective, but there's a reason you shouldn't hold yourself to it. Why You Should Break It: Stage fright comes from our bodies' natural response to threat reaction called fight or flight. Unfortunately, stage fright is unavoidable. There's simply no way to overcome millions of years of survival instinct. But here's the good news: You can break your resolution to calm down and resolve to get pumped up. The best speakers channel the adrenaline produced by their stage fright to get excited. Re-framing anxiety as excitement has been proven to drastically reduce stage fright and speech anxiety. 2. Be Relaxed Everyone aspires to be cool, calm and collected when they walk on stage. Relaxation leads to ease and connection which lets us communicate more effectively. So why shouldn't you aim for zen when you face the audience? Why You Should Break It: Telling yourself to relax is about as effective as telling yourself to imagine the audience naked--it simply doesn't work. Instead, arm yourself with some relaxation power tools in the form of pre-presentation warm ups. Every seasoned actor and athlete can speak to the power of warming up before a performance. This year, break the resolution to chill out and resolve to warm-up. Taking these simple steps to mentally and physically prepare your speaking instrument before your next big talk will make you appear grounded, centered and cool as a cucumber. 3. Be Funny Speakers often resolve to channel their inner life-of-the-party and come across as more humorous and loose. And who could blame them? We all know that humor is good for business. If this is true, then why should you drop the funny-business this year? Why You Should Break It: Instead of trying to be funny or memorizing a few jokes (please, just don't), try using storytelling techniques. An engaging story is the best way to connect with your audience and let your authentic speaking persona shine through. People identify with people, not one-liners. Work on adding compelling and engaging stories that amplify the message of your talk in place of a hackneyed comedy act. By the end of your speech, you may not be the king of comedy, but you'll avoid being a punch line. Feel no guilt in breaking these three public speaking false words of wisdom in the new year and ensure your presentations go from blank stares to standing ovations. If nothing else, resolve to believe you belong on the stage. That's one resolution we should all keep. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

For example, TryLive by Total Immersion changes consumers' shopping experience by enabling virtually try-on glasses, clothes and many accessories. Wearable display glasses enable people to run applications. The gaming sector benefits the most with AR technology, but the technology now is used in many other fields, like aerospace & defense, education, tourism, retails and e-commerce. Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ: VUZI) is a supplier of Smart-Glasses, AR and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies and products for the consumer and enterprise markets just announced earlier today that, "the Company has completed, passed, and filed with the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC) all of the (FCC) emission's requirements for its next generation M300 Smart Glasses. Vuzix expects to commence shipping of the M300 Smart Glasses to customers in the USA and Canada within days of this filing. With FCC filings now in place and the recent certification for shipments to Europe completed last month, the Company is now positioned for the full commercial launch to its largest initial markets. Other major regions of the world should follow with submissions of their required regulatory filings through the first quarter of 2017, enabling Vuzix to expand its M300 offerings near worldwide. The new Vuzix M300 represents the next generation of smart glasses, designed to address customer feedback from more than three years of productive use of the earlier M100.  This field experience has led to the addition of many empowering, barrier-reducing features such as improved ergonomics, modern security capabilities, enhanced Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, and industry leading video streaming. These improvements are just some of the many that allow the M300 to be a central communications platform to and from a client's remote workforce, connecting their corporate data and IOT field devices in real time to the people in the field who need them. The work over the last six months to establish the Vuzix VIP application software partner program has resulted in a significant pipeline of customer budgeted and approved projects awaiting the arrival of the M300. Vuzix will begin with production M300 shipments to these EU and US VIP partners who have been pre-allocated units for immediate deployment to their existing client base. In addition, we have many orders from customers that have taken advantage of the M100/M300 migration program and/or placed pre-orders for the M300. These order pipelines are significantly greater than when the M100 launched and the Company expects that it will continue to enjoy robust growth in smart glasses revenues, as clients accelerate volume deployments.  "We are now set up to ship the M300 to the hundreds of US customers that represent the beginnings of volume roll outs," said Paul Travers, President and Chief Executive Officer at Vuzix." Cloud infrastructure and business mobility company, VMware Inc. (NYSE: VMW) announced the addition of new smart glasses management features to VMware AirWatch®. According to the statement, the update will bring a consistent management platform to streamlined onboarding experiences, network setup and application deployment to organizations seeking to leverage augmented and mixed reality devices to transform business processes. VMware is the first unified endpoint management solution to extend into wearables, enabling customers to manage their smart glasses alongside existing desktop and mobile endpoints. VMware is also working alongside with APX Labs, Atheer, Intel, ODG and VUZIX Corporation to help provide wearable management and application delivery solutions. American multinational semiconductor and telecommunications, QUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) company subsidiary along with developer and manufacturer of mobile head worn computing and augmented reality technologies and products, Osterhout Design Group announced that R-8 and R-9 will be the first announced devices powered by the Qualcomm's Snapdragon™ 835 processor, which uses 10-nanometer FinFET process technology to enable a new generation of premium consumer devices in small form factors with breakthrough performance and superior power efficiency. R-8 is Osterhout Design Group's consumer mobile Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality smartglasses, and R-9 is for a wide variety of wide field-of-view experiences from light enterprise. Global semiconductor company, STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM) reported that its LSM6DSM 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit is now to be used in next-generation mobile devices running with Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) high-performance virtual-reality platform, Google Daydream, along with a platform that maps 3-Dimensional space enabling it to be overlaid with virtual objects, Tango. "Certification of ST's 6-axis motion-sensing device for operation with Daydream and Tango for amazing virtual- and augmented-reality experiences demonstrates our abilities to design and deliver an exceptionally accurate and power-efficient IMU," said Aymeric Gisselbrecht, Vice President Global Key Accounts Sales, and STMicroelectronics.

So, here’s our recap. What did really stand out this year in the hot robo-car segment? The “human factor” is how we’d sum it up. Gill Pratt The case for human and social factors was stated softly, but there it was. More companies — including Toyota and Mobileye — are scrambling to address the inconvenient truth that robo-cars pose a man-machine relationship more complicated than we care to admit.   At issue is how the human factor alters the future of self-driving designs. Gil Pratt, CEO of Toyota Research Institute, noted, “As wonderful as AI is, AI systems are inevitably flawed…”  Mobileye’s co-founder, CTO and chairman Amnon Shashua, described teaching vehicles to learn human intuition as “the last piece of the autonomous driving puzzle.” This sort of talk marks a shift in thinking, in sharp contrast to the engineering agenda of just a few years ago — which was simply a matter of eliminating the human driver from autonomous car development. Of course, the show’s headlines featured issues far less subtle. They trumpeted partnership agreements among companies like Nvidia, Intel and Mobileye with big auto brands such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz and Volvo, or with tier ones like Bosch, ZF and Delphi. A slew of tech companies flooded the show floor with their newest lidar, radar and image sensor technologies. Nvidias CEO Jen-Hsun Huang brought Audi of America Head Scott Keogh on the stage to announce the two companies partnership to build the next generation AI cars. Outside the convention center, tier ones like Delphi were busy giving the press rides in a 2017 Audi Q5 SUV. NXP Semiconductors, too, gave CES attendees test drives of a highly automated vehicle, allowing them to experience “improved road safety and traffic flow” via DSRC-based V2V (vehicle to vehicle) and V2I (vehicle to infrastructure) communication. NXP has cooperated with Delphi and Savari for onboard and roadside units, while NXP’s partner Microsoft talked up future scenarios in which artificial intelligence can improve driver safety and analyze traffic situations on its Azure cloud platform. The overall message was clear: Engineers can now make cars drive themselves. But to us, editors at EE Times, the biggest automotive news at this year’s CES broke when Toyota Research Institute’s Pratt, last week took the stage at Toyota’s press conference, and posed a question nobody has dared to ask before on the safety of robo-cars. He asked: “How safe is safe enough?” He noted that people, tolerant of human error, have come to accept the 35,000 traffic deaths every year in the United States. But would they tolerate even half that carnage if it was caused by robotic automobiles? "Emotionally, we don't think so," said Pratt. "People have zero tolerance for deaths caused by a machine." Many engineers in the automotive and tech industries have embraced the prevailing assumption that autonomous cars are much safer than cars driven by human drivers. But how do humans really feel about machines that can drive but can also kill? Add the human factor to the equation, and hard to completely ignore Pratt’s observation or even casually dismiss his statements as too conservative. Phil Magney, founder and principal advisor for Vision Systems Intelligence (VSI), characterized Pratt’s demonstration at Toyota’s press conference as nothing but “very conservative, the Toyota way.” Magney said, “Honestly, this is very pragmatic for a company like Toyota, as for the next many years there will be lots of cars sold to individual drivers and they will want the added safety and convenience.” Given that it will take decades before robo-cars eventually replace all cars driven by people, it isn’t enough to talk about pushing the first robo-car out on the road in 2021. The conversation is now shifting to a reality in which human-driven cars share the road with robo-cars — not the next few years but over the next few decades.

As Telsa has seen, a significant number of drivers interacting with automated systems (either in their own car or another vehicle) push the limits since the systems are not humans. I have not seen a clear plan for dealing with this natural tendency in discussions of mixed traffic of automated and human drivers. For example, how would an automated car ever make it into a crowded roundabout? Or merge during a traffic jam? A measured amount of human aggression keeps things flowing now. If a driver knows that another car is automated, would they tend to not let them merge? Or cut them off intentionally knowing that the automated car will avoid a collision? In a few cases, I would expect extreme behavior specifically testing the automation. Taking this to the limit, should we build in some apparent risk for other drivers to ensure they behave appropriately around automated cars? i.e. zero-tolerance is counter-productive? Rather than adding physical risk to add negative feedback to the system, we could consider a debit system based on driving behavior. Instead of relying on police monitoring and issuing citations, the automated car and ADAS sensor systems could flag hazardous behavior and issue complaints (with documentation) that would lead to automated fines :) The same decision methods driving the automated car's decisions would be applied to surrounding cars. This could lead to better behavior for all drivers!

They're not just en vogue - they're the future. By Jeremy Goldman Jeremy Goldman is the founder and CEO of Firebrand Group, which counts Consumer Reports, L'Oréal, and Unilever among its clientele. He is the author of Going Social: Excite Customers, Generate Buzz, and Energize Your Brand With the Power of Social Media, the 2013 award winner that teaches brands large and small how to use social media for business success. @jeremarketer Founder and CEO, Firebrand Group @jeremarketer WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement One of the individuals I was fortunate enough to interview for my 20.17 Big Ideas for 2017 series, where I asked leading experts for their advice on the year ahead, was Greg McNeal, co-founder of AirMap. The hot startup ($15 million Series A funding round in 2016) has created a low-altitude airspace management system that's been already adopted by 125 US airports and counting. Moreover, thanks to partnerships with manufacturers like DJI and Intel, AirMap's system has been baked into 80% of today's drones. McNeal, an an expert on drone regulation and policy, believes that understanding the rise of the "Smart City" of tomorrow will give you a leg up in 2017. Here's some of our conversation: Fascinating topic. Why should the rise of the Smart City matter to the typical businessperson? Demographic shifts show us that people are moving to cities in droves. We're becoming an increasingly urban nation: the city is the backdrop for all of the economic, commercial and social activities of our lives. And as cities become denser and more urban, they are relying on technology to help them accommodate the influx of new residents and improve quality of life for all. Today, that takes the form of ridesharing and platforms for civic tech and data sharing. Tomorrow, cities will be the first use cases of mobility solutions that seem like science fiction. You'll hail a flying Uber for your daily commute - and much sooner than you think. Cities have become some of the most vibrant and progressive places for technological development. They have dense cellular networks to facilitate connectivity and information sharing. They've become hubs for Internet of Things sensors that can help us describe our world. And they bring together bright, creative people in close proximity to each other, catalyzing innovation. What technologies in particular are you paying close attention to, with respect to smart cities? Top of mind for me in the smart cities space: platforms for autonomous navigation, connectivity (cellular and GPS), civic tech, and of course, drones. Smart city technology often starts with the need to deliver services more rapidly and more efficiently to residents. Drones have a tremendous amount of potential to help cities better serve the people who live in them. Today, thousands of drones are already being used to improve city life: drones are being used to document accident scenes, support first responder activities, monitor construction sites, and more. In 2017, we'll see drones take on more of these responsibilities, and tasks that are dull or dangerous for city workers. This is just the very beginning. In the future, connected drones will navigate autonomously through cities. Millions of both commercial and civic drones will fly billions of missions to serve city residents. With that, I suspect that cities will want to make rules about where drones can take off, land, and operate above city streets - guidelines that will determine how the industry grows and cities flourish. AirMap's obviously had a big year in 2016. What's next for you in 2017? The vast majority of drones operating today with network connectivity receive airspace data to help the operator make safe flight decisions - and they likely get that info from AirMap. More than a million drones, the vast majority worldwide, are powered by AirMap (our main competitor is non-consumption) and we expect that trend to continue. In 2017, we will be expanding our network of stakeholders, which presently includes more than 125 airports. And we will continue to work with the FAA and provide thought leadership locally and globally to ensure that cities and their residents benefit from drones, and that drones are used in safe and accountable ways. We'll also be announcing partnerships with major corporations that share our vision of the future. With that said, it's difficult to predict what will happen in 2017. We're only 18 months old, and already we have a team of 45, and 90% market share. Who knows what the future will bring - but we're excited about all of the opportunities on the horizon. How do you feel that AirMap fits into the architecture of the smart cities of tomorrow? AirMap's airspace management platform is the only one connected to over a million drones, so we're already playing a role in cities today. Drones are about to become an indispensable part of city life, and we're talking to state and local stakeholders to help create an environment that allows drones to flourish, while also giving local concerns a seat at the table. We're building a technology solution - which many people call Unmanned Traffic Management - to help make drones a part of everyday life. Coda Looking for more Big Ideas for 2017?

He quoted the Russian President's press secretary Dmitry Peskov as saying that Moscow knows nothing about the true goals of the authors of the US intelligence report on the suspected Russian hacker attack. "The absolutely unfounded accusations (in the published part of the report) sound at a rather amateurishly emotional level that can be hardly applied to the highly professional work of high-class [intelligence] services," Peskov said. "We still don't know what the facts are and what data those who make such unfounded accusations have," he added. For his part, US State Department spokesman John Kirby attributed the lack of evidence in the report of to the desire of US intelligence to maintain the secrecy of their sources of information and methods of work. © REUTERS/ Lucas Jackson 'Tremendous Blot on Their Record' - Trump Slams Intel Community for Endorsing Fake ReportMeanwhile, opponents of Trump in the US are sparking suspicions, Ilyashenko said, quoting New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow as saying that "Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin's American 'president' — clearly his preference and possibly his product." "Mr. Trump, your victory is tainted; your legitimacy is rightly in question," according to Blow. "However, if we proceed from this assumption, it turns out that the Democrats left a bad legacy for Trump, who will be the President of a country where public opinion and the outcome of the presidential elections can be affected by the leader of another country with the help of hackers. So it seems that the authors of the report try to avoid making such conclusions," Ilyashenko said. "We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The US Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze US political processes or US public opinion," he quoted them as saying. Ilyashenko predicted that the next round of domestic political confrontation in the US will certainly start amid the US Congress' discussion of the Trump team's candidates.  "For Democrats, this will be another opportunity to slam Trump's election promises and his personnel policy. It appears that the Democrats do not realize the fact that their continuous attacks on Trump's political reputation not only weaken his position, but also damage the international clout of the US," Ilyashenko pointed out. © REUTERS/ Jonathan Ernst Isn't It Time to Admit? Trump Won Elections Without "Kremlin's Support"He added that social inequality in the US, which was a major factor adding to Trump's election win, is now accompanied by a political split between his supporters and opponents, as well as a standoff between Trump and the media, intelligence community, intellectuals, businesspeople and minorities. Both US allies and rivals, including Russia, China, Japan and the EU, are keeping a watchful eye on how Trump will respond to the attacks against the legitimacy of his presidency, and how he will compensate for weakness caused by permanent internal political conflict, according to Ilyashenko. "The current situation does not add to the stability of international affairs. Rather to the contrary," Ilyashenko concluded. ...

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Foxconn Plan Close to Completion for a Massive U.S. Plant in the U.S. to Make LCD Displays and More | Main | Samsung & Foxconn Jointly Invest in Israeli firm Core Photonics Possibly Delaying a Dual Lens Camera for Galaxy S8 » January 13, 2017 It's a Long Shot, but TSMC wouldn't rule out Opening a U.S. Plant to Support U.S. Customers like Apple and Qualcomm   It's definitely the talk of Asia. Earlier today a Sharp executive revealed that a new Sharp/Foxconn plant is being planned for the US. Many Asian companies have made announcements about opening a plant in the US or are planning one and yesterday even TSMC's chairman said that they're now considering a plant in the US.    It's being reported today in Taipei that Chairman Morris Chang of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. stated yesterday that he would not rule out the possibility of building a new facility in the U.S. although its American customers including Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia could suffer if its chips were produced there.   "I will not rule out [the possibility of build a factory in the U.S.] but I see a lot of sacrifices that we and our customers will have to make," Chang told investors and reporters. However, he added that he felt no pressure from customers to move production to the U.S., despite incoming President Donald Trump's pledge to move jobs home. TSMC is the world's largest contract chipmaker.   Apple is TSMC's no.1 customer and the Taiwanese tech giant enjoys a monopoly in the production of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7-plus chips, which are among the most expensive components used in the handsets. TSMC also supplies to Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Marvell, among some 470 others across the globe. U.S. customers make up 66% of the company's record revenue of 947.93 billion New Taiwan dollars ($30.12 billion) in 2016.   Chang says "TSMC leads the industry with 55% of market share not because it uses cheaper labor, but because it has built an ecosystem of semiconductor suppliers in Taiwan. TSMC infrastructure and facilities allow thousands of the company's engineers to commute from one manufacturing site to another frequently in a very short time. Such advantages allow TSMC to produce efficiently and solve problems quickly to maintain a competitive edge. If we lose these advantages, our customers will lose too." Though in the age of teleconferencing is that really a problem?   At present TSMC only has a small manufacturing subsidiary, WaferTech, that hires around 1,500 employees in Camas, Washington in the U.S. In Taiwan, it employs more than 40,000 staff.   The report also noted that "TSMC announced yesterday that for the January-March period, TSMC forecast sales of NT$236 billion to NT$239 billion, representing a rise of 15.9 % to 17.4% from a year ago." However, it should be noted that this forecast contradicts a new DigiTimes report today.   The DigiTimes report states that "Pure-play foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has forecast revenues will fall up to 10% sequentially in the first quarter of 2017, and expressed caution over the prospects for the second quarter.   Lastly, Li said that TSMC will most likely continue to be the main supplier of processor chips to Apple's next iPhone model to be released in the second half of 2017.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

🔍 Home Magazines Advertising Events Videos Contact us Special Reports Sunday, January 15, 2017 Shipbuilding/Repair Deepwater Offshore Coastal/Inland Government Equipment Training Law & Regulations Europort Tackles Shipping’s big issues By Joseph R. Fonseca January 13, 2017 Logo Shipping’s data revolution, its environmental responsibilities and its continuing reliance on ‘the human factor’ will be the focus of attention as the eyes of the maritime world turn once more to Rotterdam between 7th-10th November 2017, for the staging of the long-established, and always well-supported Europort event.   Organised by Rotterdam Ahoy, Europort is the highlight of the maritime exhibition calendar in 2017, with a finely crafted programme expected to attract an estimated 30,000 visitors and 1,100 exhibitors.   The Europort exhibition team has chosen three highly topical themes for the event this year. These are: Big Data; The New Environmental Age; and The Human Factor. Raymond Siliakus, Exhibition Manager, says: "Each of these themes is very different, but all three come together to drive forward the event's overarching aim - to help maximise vessel performance - and as such will have an increasingly important role in shaping the world of shipping and shipbuilding over the months and years ahead. We have selected these three very current themes to ensure that attending Europort will be a hugely rewarding and valuable experience, with benefits extending well into the future for those visiting and exhibiting."   Many leading technology suppliers, shipbuilders and shipping companies are exploring the scope of using Big Data methodologies to develop 'smart ships' that will be safer, more efficient and cost effective. As an illustration of the trend, last year the world's biggest shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries, joined forces with tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) to develop smart shipping software solutions that are expected to yield benefits in terms of crew wellbeing, technical inspections, equipment maintenance and voyage information recording. Furthermore, Rolls-Royce, whose subsidiary MTU will be exhibiting at Europort, recently formed a strategic alliance with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland to develop the first generation of remote and autonomous ships, while another exhibitor, Lloyd’s Register, acquired Big Data company Real Time Adaptive Maintenance Optimisation (RTAMO) and plans to roll out its software to commercial shipping.   Europort will provide a showcase for new generation IT and system integration tools, ultra-sensitive monitoring, condition-based maintenance, fleet performance management and other types of data analysis needed to help owners and operators enhance cost efficiency and reliability. "If you are involved in Big Data and are targeting the maritime sector, then Europort 2017 is the place to be," adds Siliakus.  The popular Europort Masterclasses will be returning this year and there will be daily Masterclasses specifically targeted at this theme.   International regulations continue to drive the development of environmentally friendly technology. The entry into force later this year of IMO's Ballast Water Convention will require major investment in ballast water technology, both in new ships and as retrofits. The IMO cap on fuel sulphur content is also due to enter force in 2020.  Both developments will require the evaluation of available technologies to ensure compliance. Europort’s focus this year will not simply be the solutions aimed at compliance, but those providing a competitive advantage, with exhibits to include alternative fuels, high tech coatings and solar cell systems. As Siliakus points out: "The underlying message will be clear. Clean and efficient shipping is central to a profitable and sustainable business model."   A special conference on Alternative Ship Power & Propulsion Systems, organised by the Royal Institution of Naval Architects (RINA), will be held on November 8th. This will examine the current use of alternative fuels in shipping and how to embrace the challenges of designing cleaner, lower carbon emission vessels.   Remaining competitive today in the maritime industry also relies on having a skilled and motivated workforce, able to innovate and operate efficiently. Europort will provide a forum for a well-timed discussion on the importance of investing in human capital, with the opportunity to engage with academic institutions and training bodies on how to attract and retain the younger generation.   Many believe the maritime industry is facing a workforce crisis, with a lack of younger seafarers to fill the gaps left by the retirement of an ageing workforce, putting marine companies under renewed pressure. The U.K. Department for Transport (DFT) predicts a shortfall of around 3,500 deck and engineering officers by 2021 in the UK alone, while the BIMCO / ICS Manpower Report suggests there could be a worldwide global shortfall of 147,500 officers by 2025. This shortfall in human resources is evident not just in the deep-sea segment, but across the maritime industry, where specialists and technical staff with very specific areas of expertise are required, as shipping moves to embrace robot technology, automation and advanced data capture tools, among other advanced technologies.   Email Related News Transas Brings THESIS to its 2017 Forum for Change The speaker line-up at the next annual Transas Global Conference confirms that the innovative digital solutions company is… U.S. 6th Fleet Exercises Ordnance Loading Capability in Rota U.S. 6th Fleet, in coordination with USS California (SSN 781), Navy Munitions Command Rota, Spain and Naval Submarine Support… US-flag Cargo on the Great Lakes Down 4.5% in 2016 U.S.-flag Great Lakes freighters (lakers) moved 83.3 million tons of cargo in 2016, a decrease of 4.5 percent compared to 2015… Fourth Submarine in UK’s Astute Class Named The fourth submarine in the Astute class was officially named Audacious during a December 16 ceremony at builder BAE Systems’… Supersizing Car Carriers Similar to container vessels, bulk carriers and cruise ships, car carriers are rapidly growing in size, says a report by DNV GL.

The prototypes offered the world's first automated triple display laptops. Razer combined its best industrial design and powerful modern hardware from the likes of Sharp, Intel and Nvidia to create this portable triple display workstation which weighed a reasonable 5.4Kg and folded to just 1.5-inch thick. Reports earlier this week came in saying that the two Razer Project Valerie laptops at CES 2017 had been stolen. Later the reports were confirmed by Razer boss Min-Liang Tan, who posted a $25,000 reward, in return for "original information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of a criminal suspect". Now at least one of the prototype laptops has appeared on a Chinese auction/sales site called Taobao. It looks like WCCFTech was among the first to spot the Chinese listing of these stolen goods. The machines, which went missing from the Razer Press room about 4pm PST on Sunday, 8th January, have now surfaced in mainland China. Appealing to his Facebook fans, Tan previously wrote the following about the theft; "At Razer, we play hard and we play fair. Our teams worked months on end to conceptualize and develop these units and we pride ourselves in pushing the envelope to deliver the latest and greatest." "We treat theft/larceny, and if relevant to this case, industrial espionage, very seriously – it is cheating, and cheating doesn't sit well with us. Penalties for such crimes are grievous and anyone who would do this clearly isn't very smart." This case currently looks like a plain old sneaky opportunist theft. Unless the other machine has been sold to some Chinese PC hardware copyists, at least it looks like Min-Liang Tan's worst fears of industrial espionage don't seem to have played out. It will be interesting to see how this case develops now that there appears to be a public 'fence' selling the stolen goods for 150,000 Yuan, which is about £17,800 / $21,700. Surely Chinese authorities will be able to act on this blatant and obvious case of theft?

Self-driving cars are emerging as the Next Big Thing in tech, but striking out on your own can be difficult, meaning you'll probably need a gig at Google, Uber, or a major auto maker to really dig in and make progress—until now. The DeepDrive project came up with a unique way to let tech-savvy types tinker with autonomous driving tech—it repurposed popular video game Grand Theft Auto V as a self-driving car simulator. Companies like Intel have been playing around with it, but now it's open source thanks to an integration with Universe, which emerged last month as "a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites and other applications." The Universe integration with GTA V comes courtesy of OpenAI, a non-profit research company launched in 2015 by Elon Musk and others. "To use it, you'll just need a purchased copy of GTA V, and then your Universe agent will be able to start driving a car around the streets of a high-fidelity virtual world," OpenAI said in a blog post. That "agent" was "trained via imitation learning on 21 hours (about 600,000 images) on the game's AI driving," according to OpenAI. "The baseline agent can drive in a variety of different weather conditions, react to traffic, and keep to its lane. This agent is a start, which we invite the community to improve upon!" Related 5 Killer Features in Grand Theft Auto V 5 Killer Features in Grand Theft Auto V Those familiar with the game might wonder if the simulation will stumble upon prostitutes and gang members looking for a fight. Sorry, adrenaline junkes, the "integration modifies the behavior of people within GTA V to be non-violent," said OpenAI. Not to worry; there's still plenty to explore minus the gun battles. "GTA V gives researchers access to a rich, diverse world for testing and developing AI. Its island setting is almost one fifth the size of Los Angeles, giving access to a broad range of scenarios to test systems," OpenAI said. "Add to that the 257 different vehicles, 7 types of bicycles, and 14 weather types, and its possible to explore a huge number of permutations using a single simulator."

Amid a deluge of new gadgets, the tech industry searches for its soul By Mark Gauger Mark Gauger has been involved in product development for over 25 years. He is passionate about the role of great design as an element and a facilitator of corporate strategy, and he consults regularly with business leaders on how to transform their businesses with design. Prior to founding argodesign with his longtime colleague, Mark was the President and Chief Business Officer for Globant. From 2002 to 2012, Mark held various roles inside of frogdesign, ultimately taking over as the Chief Development Officer in 2007, where he oversaw frog's entry into the world of first-party application development, among other duties. @megauger Founder, Argodesign@megauger WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Courtesy Camille Woods, Argodesign Advertisement After attending this year's bigger-than-ever Consumer Electronics Show, I had the distinct impression that the future will not be televised. A major arc at the show was the evolution of the human-computer interface beyond a keypad or screen. The boxes, screens, and keyboards of computing's past are morphing into a ubiquitous, flexible, and smart presence that is personalized to a user's needs--for example, in the form of Amazon Alexa--and activated by voice or gesture. Although ultra-thin screens and barely there bezels still captured the headlines, I'll put my money on the ever-expanding universe of screen-less products and services--Razer's Project Ariana, HoloLamp, and the latest in mixed reality glasses. Intel's Project Alloy merges augmented and virtual reality together in a headset with full wireless positional tracking and multi-room tracking, to create what the company has coined "merged" reality, and that will facilitate multiplayer virtual gaming among other things. The shift to voice, gesture, and projection computing is led by the gaming and entertainment sectors, but slowly seeping into the home and the office as well. The Sevenhugs smart remote wirelessly connects to sensors placed throughout a room. Aim the remote at a lamp and Philips Hue's interface will pop up. Point it at your Nest thermostat and you can change the temperature of the room. Pointing it at the door will let you call an Uber straight from your remote. A second arc, related to Alexa's ascendance, was the onslaught of new Internet of Things enabled gadgets. The breathless enthusiasm for smart trashcans was palpable, and so was the skepticism. Do IoT products solve actual human needs or simply fuel an insatiable appetite for new gadgets? As my colleague Mark Rolston observed about CES, "It's like one big Sky Mall catalogue--a lot of junk looking for a purpose. If I have a smart toothbrush, a smart hairbrush, and a smart bathroom mirror, how do they work together to make my life measurably better?" It will be interesting to watch the evolution of the Alexa ecosystem--companies developing products and services compatible with Amazon Echo--as well as the trajectory of Echo copycats. Could Alexa and her ilk become the "personalities" that bring the IoT to the next level? It's telling that the Consumer Electronics Association gave the chipmaker Nvidia a keynote slot, and that their CEO used the opportunity to convey his ambitious agenda for AI-powered assistants operating in all areas of human activity. A third arc at CES was the continuing march of AI into our everyday lives. Nvidia is best known for the high-end computer graphics cards. In the future, it wants to be known as the powerhouse behind artificial intelligence in your home and in your vehicle. The company is at the intersection of key, changing dynamics in the tech industry, notably AI and deep learning and their respective roles in pushing home entertainment and in fueling those next generation autonomous vehicles. Nvidia wants to spread AI through the home via an upcoming, yet-to-be-priced ball-shaped peripheral for its SHIELD streaming system called Nvidia Spot. Each has tiny far-field processing microphones and echo cancellation to pick up your speech from 20 feet away. SHIELD also integrates with Samsung's SmartThings hub to connect to smart plugs, coffeemakers, garage doors, locks, thermostats, cameras and other devices. Nvidia also showed off a tiny AI-car supercomputer called Xavier meant to be the brains in future self-driving cars. Which brings us to my fourth and final arc: the rapidly emerging autonomous vehicle, which seems to be arriving faster than anyone has thought. Imagine, Ford arrived to CES seven years ago with the Sync system, and a CEO that dismissed autonomous vehicles "in my lifetime." Fast forward to today and Ford insists we will see fully autonomous cars, without steering wheels, by 2021.The introduction of new smart car models was the hit of the show. Faraday Futures grabbed the headlines, but the Vision Van from Mercedes packed autonomous features with drones and robotics to give a more realistic glimpse of the fast-moving and diverse future the vehicle manufacturers have in store for us. Buckle up. Through it all my sense from touring the Sky Mall at the Las Vegas Convention Center is that non-trivial technologies will still be the big winners in 2017. We need more technologies that combine "humanistic" interfaces like voice and gesture with advanced machine intelligence to help us solve real-world problems, like healthcare or making water infrastructure more resilient against extreme weather. Just as CES was drawing to a close, a mammoth storm slammed into Northern California and Nevada, causing floods and landslides and pushing already vulnerable water and wastewater infrastructure to the breaking point. A smart bathroom may drive foot traffic on an expo floor, but a smart sewer system is the kind of technology that makes a lasting impact. There's serious buzz about a tech backlash unless we get our priorities straight--entrepreneur Ross Mayfield says, "Tech can do more than grow. It can do good. And if doesn't, bad things will happen." In an age of global jitters and digital clutter, doing worthwhile work is foremost on everyone's minds.

The Legion Y720 might have been a long time coming, but it looks set to make a big first impression: It's got all the Intel- and Nvidia-provided power you need for VR, gamer-pleasing features like a built-in wireles adapter for an Xbox One controler, and a backlit keyboard for anyone that insists on turning their desktop into an all-night rave. Oh, and it's the first laptop with Dolby Atmos surround sound. No biggie. This is actually the first of many Lenovo gaming machines, which will arrive under the Legion gaming brand. Should you be excited? We went hands-on at CES 2017 to find out. Devil in the details Take one look at the Legion and you just know it's a gaming laptop. Those bright LED lights, colossal display, and prominent speaker grilles are anything but subtle.  It has a lot in common with the Alienware 15: when the lid's closed, it's fairly unobtrusive (yet seriously chunky), but open it up and the lashings of red are guaranteed to get you noticed.  Underneath that cavernous chassis, the Legion Y720 ticks all the boxes for a 2017 gaming laptop. The base model kicks things off with an Intel Core i5 CPU, Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics chip, 512GB SSD and 15.6in, 1080p screen. Got some cash to splash? You can upgrade to an i7 CPU, add a 1TB SSD or 2TB hard disk, and make the jump to a 4K display. Annoyingly there's no way to add a better graphics card, though - the GTX 1070 and 1080 are off the cards. Try out this monitor LG's HDR screen Game On The GTX 1060 is still ready for virtual reality, though, and the Legion has all the ports you'll need to hook up an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. There's even a Thunderbolt/USB Type-C port on top of the three regular USB3 ports. Handy. Lenovo's Entertainment Hub software lets you watch your regular old 2D videos in VR, from inside a simulation of a cinema, and adds head-tracking to your non-VR games. We tried it out with Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, and while it takes some getting used to, works across every VR headset out there - including Lenovo's own upcoming HMD. The Legion is also one of the first laptops we've seen with built-in Dolby Atmos surround sound. Lenovo reckons it's the first in the world with the tech, but until it actually goes on sale, there's still time for another company to swoop in and steal first place. Either way, it's supposed to produce precisely-pinpointed surround sound from just two speakers.  It was difficult to test out properly in a trade show environment, but if you’re going to be holed up in a hotel room with only this laptop as entertainment, it should be able to service your gaming, movie and music needs. When you're not gaming, you should get about five hours of battery life - not bad for a 15in PC this powerful.  Check out more laptops The latest issue of Stuff Lenovo Legion Y720 initial verdict I tried the Y720 with a 4K display, which looks absolutely stunning up close. The keyboard felt great to type on, too, but I'm not convinced the multicolour backlighting is worth paying extra for. Whether you’ve got a VR headset or not, though, chances are you’re going to want to play some games using a gamepad, and this is where the Legion Y720 has you covered as well. The built-in Xbox One wireless receiver lets you use up to four of the console’s controllers at once, without having a mess of wires trailing from players to laptop. We love the Xbox One controller for gaming, especially in its Elite form, and expect plenty of Legion owners to make the most of this (still pretty unique) feature. You should be able to pick up a Legion Y720 in April, but there's no word on price just yet. We're planning on giving it a full review a little closer to launch, though, so make sure to check back once we've given one a proper gaming workout.
