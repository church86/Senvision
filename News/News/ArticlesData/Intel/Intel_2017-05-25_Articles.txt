Pre-order: Surface Laptop | NEW Surface Pro Both great devices Should you buy the Surface Pro 4 instead of the new Surface Pro? By Cale Hunt Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 12:00 pm EDT 39 Comments Should I get the older Surface Pro 4 or the new Surface Pro? Now that Microsoft's refreshed Surface Pro 4 — named simply the Surface Pro — has been revealed, many people are wondering whether they should stick with a tried and true device or go for the newer hardware. Let's take a look at some of the differences and similarities to see which Surface is best suited to your needs. See at Microsoft | Surface Pro See at Microsoft | Surface Pro 4 The new Surface Pro is more portable The Surface Pro line has always been about taking on tablets while maintaining the function of a full PC. The new Surface Pro takes this idea and runs with it. Available in models coming later this year will be optional 4G LTE connectivity. This will work with nano SIM cards commonly used now, as well as eSIM cards that are set to take over. Adding to the Surface Pro's portability is a battery that will last about 50 percent longer. You should expect up to about 13.5 hours of use on a full charge, meaning you don't have to worry about hauling a charger with you. Bottom line: If you're working primarily from home or office, LTE connectivity and a larger battery don't mean much. However, if you're constantly on the go to places without Wi-Fi (and likely without an outlet), the new Surface Pro should be your first choice. The new Surface Pro contains new hardware With this overhaul comes a host of new hardware, including 7th-generation Intel "Kaby Lake" processors. The upgrade from 6th-generation processors helps with battery life and delivers a slight edge in performance, but the biggest change is perhaps that Core i5 processors are now fanless. Core i7 models of the new Surface Pro use Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, giving a significant boost to graphics power over the Intel Iris Graphics 540 in the Core i7 Surface Pro 4 models. Bottom line: If you're interested in graphic design or any other hardware-intensive activity, you'll want to opt for the new Surface Pro. Just need a laptop for browsing the web and word processing? The Surface Pro 4 will handle those tasks with ease. There have been some changes to the body of the new Surface Pro Picking up the new Surface Pro, one of the first things you'll notice is how the edges are smoother and more rounded. Also changed are the radial vents that run around the top of the device. They are quite noticeable on the Surface Pro 4, but Microsoft has done a good job of trimming them down on the newer Surface Pro. One other noticeable aspect on the Surface Pro 4 is the front-facing camera. The cutout in the bezel where it sits is sort of wide and is a different color than the rest of the bezel. Not so on the new Surface Pro. The camera has been blacked out, making it disappear into the bezel. No longer will the eye be drawn there. The kickstand on the back of the new Surface Pro now opens further, allowing your device to sit at a 165-degree angle. The Surface Pro 4 does open quite wide — at a 150-degree angle — and is suitable for most people, but artists will love the extra 15 degrees. Bottom line: The big difference here for a lot of people will likely be the extra degrees of rotation in the kickstand, but those concerned with the appearance of their device will also love the smooth edges, hidden camera, and reduced vents on the new Surface Pro. See at Microsoft | Surface Pro See at Microsoft | Surface Pro 4 New Surface Pro Type Covers also work with previous models With the new Surface Pro comes a new collection of Type Covers, the slick keyboards that attach with magnets. These new Type Covers are all covered with Alcantara fabric, the luxury stuff found only on previous Signature Type Covers and on the new Surface Laptops. These new Type Covers are available in three new colors: platinum, burgundy, and cobalt blue. Those who already have a Surface Pro 4 will be happy to know that these new Type Covers are backwards compatible. Bottom line: This one is a draw. The new Type Covers will work with the Surface Pro 4, leaving the option open. The new Surface Pen blows the old one away One of the main features of the Surface Pro is inking, and the new Surface Pen has been updated to reflect the demands of users and advances in technology. Instead of 1,024 levels of sensitivity found in the old pen that comes with the Surface Pro 4, the new pen has a whopping 4,096 levels of sensitivity. Also cut down is the latency. The new Surface Pen sits at 21 milliseconds, while the older pen is more than double that at 45 milliseconds. You can now also use the pen on more of a tilt, great for shading. The extra sensitivity, increased tilt, and decreased latency means an inking experience that's pretty much on par with a real pen on real paper. The good news here is that the new Surface Pens are backwards compatible with the Surface Pro 4. However, not all features will be available due to different technology in the older displays. It appears that you won't be able to experience the same levels of latency or sensitivity, but a later update will bring the increased tilt support to the Surface Pro 4. One more thing: the Surface Dial can now be used directly on the screen of the new Surface Pro, something mobile artists have been clamoring for. Bottom line: For the absolute best pen and inking experience, you have to go with the new Surface Pro. The new Surface Pens will work with the Surface Pro 4, but you won't be getting the same experience. Price and availability Many people will turn to the price comparison as the final decider here. The 128GB SSD, 4GB of RAM, Intel Core m3 configuration of the Surface Pro 4 costs about $700, while the same configuration (albeit with newer hardware) in the Surface Pro costs about $800. Neither of these laptops includes a Surface Pen or Type Cover. As you scale up the hardware, a Surface Pro 4 with an Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD costs about $2,400, but you also get a Surface Pen (last generation) with the deal. A new Surface Pro with the same specs and no included Surface Pen costs about $2,700. As for availability, the new Surface Pro and new Type Covers will be available June 15 in the following countries: Australia. Austria. Belgium. Canada. China. Denmark. Finland. France. Germany. Hong Kong. Ireland. Italy. Japan. Korea. Luxembourg. Netherland. New Zealand. Norway. Poland. Portugal. Spain. Sweden. Switzerland. Taiwan. U.K. US. Bottom line: If you need the least expensive Surface between these two devices, go with the older Surface Pro 4. The included pen (except for the Core m3 model) and price difference of a few hundred dollars can be a pretty heavy factor. The Surface Pro 4 is still a formidable laptop, especially for anyone not worried about the absolute latest hardware.

If one is truly like a tablet while the other still 'turns on quickly' like a PC, that's done deal. I know this seems like an OS thing, but I'd like to know if it truly is, or if there is some hardware component as well 5 14 hours ago Reply RayWP7 First of all, I agree. The instant-on is a highly desired feature. It's funny. Back in the day, Microsoft was trying to some core kernel code put onto BIOS chips to enable faster boot times.  I think this was 15+ years ago (at least).   It surprises me today, that they are still unable to forge the type of partnerships required to make that happen.  Maybe they have!  But, I have pretty recent PCs and though sleep/ hibernate resume is fast enough, it isn't "press power, screen on and login waiting" fast. 0 8 hours ago Reply Matt Manahan I dunno if this is a dumb question: The new keyboards are backwards compatible, but are the Sufrace Pro 4 keyboards compatible with the new Surface Pro?

I really don't understand that they had to increase the price by not including the pen. That's a 100 dollar more for nothing. On the other hand they sell it as a laptop but don't include the keyboard and just reveal the even more expensive signature keyboard, which makes the whole system even more expensive. For this price I better buy a pro 4.   1 13 hours ago Reply Great deal when will the SP4 be discontinued, with an extended warranty would be a shame to drop it, screeen crack and sent in to repair only  to be replaced with the new SP :P 1 13 hours ago Reply Paul Foulkes Once the lte version is available I think I'll be upgrading from my pro3.

If I can get tilt and more pen pressure just by purchasing a new pen, I'm perfectly happy with my Pro 4's kickstand angle, pen performance, cpu, display, etc, etc. I'm still a little bitter that we never got on screen Dial support. I bought one ONLY because whats-his-face at Microsoft said we'd be getting it.    0 10 hours ago Reply badMojo69 All I want is a core M with 8 gigs of RAM.  Is that too much to ask. I run AMIDuOs and it would help if I had the extra memory.  4 extra gigs and a i5 isn't worth 2x times the price.  I'd pay an extra $200 tops. 0 9 hours ago Reply TechFreak1 Interesting approach to surface pen for latest iteration of the surface pro series to say the least (not one that I'm overly fond off, rather Applesque. Also why just Surface Pro? Does that mean it's the last iteration of the series and going forward we will just get internal hardware revamps? Hmm.. 0 9 hours ago Reply sapientdiaspora No. If you're going to drop the pen, you need to drop the price.  Without the pen, the new Surface Pro (including the SP4 w/M3 SKU, which originally came with the pen) is now at least $100 less valuable off the top (-$200 for the i7/8GB RAM/256GB SSD and up) than its predecessor with the pen included. Also, what happened to the same kinds of technology getting less expensive over time?  There is nothing novel about any of these devices over the past 10 years that warrants the trends in pricing that are outpacing inflation as well as cost-benefit.  The inherent planned obsolete nature of these non-user-repairable products should immediately knock their prices down within a year of their release let alone start them off at a much lower price point.  Your bloated R&D isn't producing much that we can't live without short of the government arbitrarily making tech use mandatory to do normal human activities. 1 9 hours ago Reply RayWP7 For portable/ tablet hardware, my family owns a SP3 and an SP4.  I use the SP3 as the SP4 has been monopolized by my partner.  They are a world of difference apart in feel!  If my aim is to replace the SP3, I would get the new SP.  I won't be replacing the SP4.  Admittedly, for my use case, I am still on the fence re: the new Surface Pro vs Surface Laptop. 0 8 hours ago Reply Cryio "Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, giving a significant boost to graphics power over the Intel Iris Graphics 540 in the Core i7 Surface Pro 4 models."

It's an improvement all around. If you want one and you've been waiting for the new one, the ... 300$ difference between same configurations SP4/5 is worth it. 0 8 hours ago Reply Aden Rossinni I think, the question should have been, 'Is the Surface Pro 4 still viable since the Pro is soooooo much better!' Future discounted rates on the Pro 4 will tell if that is still worth buying. I have the Pro 4 and love it but there is no way I would still buy it over the new Pro!!! Battery life, better pen, better chip, lighter etc. I think it goes without saying. Deep discounts, well that's another thing. 0 4 hours ago Reply Bjfcm As a Happy Surface Pro 4 owner, I see no need to upgrade with this Model. * However , I'm impressed with the Battery life ( MS should be ashamed selling us the Pro 4 with its current Battery life 2015/2016) *The LTE is Awesome!!!!!! BTW This truly shows that A SURFACE PHONE ( LTE , TELEPHONY) IS ON ITS WAY!!!!!!!

No you can't, because it didn't happen 0 6 min ago Reply PoohGQ It's great that they were some updated improvements, and all, but that's not a SP5. I got a better deal on an SP4 and it made more sense than to jump on the little improvements added that will still mean I will have an obsolete piece of hardware in a year anyway! 0 9 sec ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Home Hardware AMD’s 16-core CPU and other exciting stuff By Jeremy Laird on May 25th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Yes, yes, a 16-core CPU is likely-going-on-definitely irrelevant for PC gaming. But it’s an exciting notion in simple technological terms and it represents something that certainly is important for gaming, namely that the PC as a platform has woken up again. Along with that mega-CPU from AMD, we also have the imminent prospect of new graphics card families from both AMD and Nvidia, new CPUs from Intel in response to AMD Ryzen assault, an intriguing new APU, again from AMD, that could just make for some nice cheapo laptops with genuine gaming chops and, well, plenty more. And the annual Computex tech shindig hasn’t even kicked off yet… AMD’s saucy new 16-core Threadripper (yes, really) processor, then. What’s it all about? Socking it to Intel, quite simply. I can’t imagine that AMD is going to sell very many of these new 16-core beasts to desktop PC enthusiasts. But beating Intel on core count and (possibly but not quite certainly) for outright performance in certain metrics has significant PR value. For the record, this 16-core / 32-thread chip will apparently be branded Ryzen 9 and the full range will also include 14-core, 12-core and 10-core models. It’s also mated to its own new socket, much like Intel’s high-end desktop CPUs, so it’s not cross compatible with existing Ryzen CPUs and their AM4 socket. Clockspeeds are expected to be surprisingly high, with a baseclock of 3.5GHz and 3.9GHz Turbo for the top 16-core Ryzen 9 Threadripper. Thus, you can have your single-threaded performance cake and eat the multi-core goodness at the same time. In other words, if you can afford what will undoubtedly be a very expensive chip, it’ll likely be decent for gaming and killer for almost everything else. One chip to rule them all, perhaps. Threadripper will likely be a pair of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen CPU dies crammed into a single package… For real-world gamers, the existing Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 models still make much more sense. But Ryzen 9’s impact will be felt in terms of how it pushes the market on in general, regards both performance and pricing. Even if you never buy a Ryzen 9, it’ll probably make whatever you do buy a bit faster or a bit cheaper. Indeed, it’s no surprise to learn that Intel is planning a riposte. The web has been alive with reports of a new high-end 12-core Intel CPU for the desktop, branded predictably enough Core i9, plus a pair of slightly odd-ball quad-core CPUs that eschew integrated graphics and slot into Intel’s high-end LGA2011 socket. But for me, it’s what Intel does with its mainstream LGA1151 socket, the one that accepts chips like the £200/$200-odd Core i5-7600K, that’s of more interest. The expectation here is for the debut of a six-core processor as part of the upcoming Coffee Lake family later this year. That’s a big deal given that mainstream Intel desktop CPUs have topped out at four cores ever since they were split off into a separate socket eight long years ago. Even if you’re not convinced that six cores will have much impact on game performance, inserting a new six-core model as the de facto top rung of the mainstream Intel CPU line should push the four-core models down the stack a little and make them more affordable. AMD’s mainstream AM4 socket that appeared with the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs isn’t compatible with the new Threadripper megachips Another fun-sounding new CPU, or rather APU, due soon is Raven Ridge. It’s basically an AMD Ryzen CPU in dual up to quad-core trim with a slice of AMD’s next-generation Vega graphics all squeezed into a single chip. Nothing is certain, but leaked AMD docs indicate it will have 11 so-called Vega graphics cores, which should work out at about 700 pixel-prettifying shaders or roughly the same as the original Xbox One console. Imagine all of that in a genuinely cheap, thin and light laptop PC and I suggest you are now quite interested. At the very least, Raven Ridge should massively lift the bar for entry-level integrated graphics performance. It might just be the first APU that’s genuinely gaming capable. Dare we hope for, say, a $400 / £400 laptop with decent gaming chops? Fingers crossed. On the graphics side of the equation AMD still has an awful lot of catching up to do. At the high end, it’s a full generation behind AMD’s Pascal graphics cards, such as the GeForce GTX 1080. AMD has had no response to Nvidia’s high-end Pascal cards, like the GTX 1080 Ti In fact, Nvidia even beat AMD to the punch with its recent announcement of the first GPU from its next generation Volta family of graphics tech. It’s a chip aimed at high-end compute and machine learning rather than gaming. But as a member of the new Volta family, it’s fully two generations advantage over AMD’s last high-end GPU, the Radeon Fury. In fairness, it was only a week later that AMD rolled out its own new high-end GPU for compute and in turn the first member of its long-awaited Vega series of graphics cards. The Radeon Vega Froniter Edition, as its known, gives a sneak peak of what to expect from AMD’s next high-end gaming cards. And what we can apparently expect is a GPU that depends on high clocks to achieve its performance edge. If that’s accurate, then it may explain why Vega is so late to launch (yes, late you naughty people in the comments below). Perhaps AMD is struggling to get the clocks up to sufficiently competitive speeds. We’ll find out the truth soon enough as I expect a fairly substantial Vega reveal from AMD in the coming weeks. Anyway, the sum total of all this is that by year end the PC landscape will likely look very different. At any given price point, both CPU and GPU performance will have stepped up fairly dramatically on the desktop and there’s also a half decent chance that new generation of cheap gameable laptops may have arrived. With all that in mind, my broad advice re upgrading your PC or buying a new rig is a very firm hold, currently. Recent years have seen fairly long periods of stagnation in terms of key PC hardware, which meant you may as well buy sooner rather than later. But right now looks very much like a moment where holding off for three to six months could pay significant long-term dividends. Watch this space.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:52 vorador says: On the positive side it will definitely put the screws on Intel, who has been lazy as hell lately on the CPU department, with new models barely a 5%-10% performance improvement over previous ones. While it likely won’t beat Intel at gaming purposes, for tasks that benefit from multithreading this thing is a beast. Even the biggest Xeon has “just” 12 cores and 24 threads, and its price is/was ridiculous. And the its equivalent on Ryzen has a maximum of 32 cores and 64 threads, a chip named “Epyc” (yes really) the size of a fist.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:39 tormeh says: Technically yes, but if I remember correctly, the cores in Xeon Phi are essentially slightly modified 386 cores. In other words, the Xeon Phi has absolutely useless single-core performance. While there definitely are applications that benefit from this approach, you would be really screwed for everything else. The Phi booting Windows could take a while. In fact, you should definitely consider taking a nap while it happens. Or even work a couple of days; I’m unsure what order of magnitude this thing is on. The Xeon Phi is supposed to compete with GPUs, not CPUs. That it can do all the instructions a standard x86 CPU can do is a unique selling point, but you shouldn’t take that as an invitation to use it as a CPU. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 05:35 Don Reba says: They are slightly modified Xeon cores, but you’re right that they are not really comparable. The Phi runs its own OS, it’s not just a chip. We evaluated them for the LHCb compute farm, but they turned out to be far from price-competitive compared to GPUs. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 02:25 TillEulenspiegel says: I swear people are spoiled by the huge jump that occurred around Core 2 and have no memory of the miserable Pentium 4 years. Intel isn’t “lazy”, the problem is that CPU development isn’t magic. The only straightforward thing is using smaller processes for better efficiency, everything else is either a tradeoff or expensive or a genuine innovation. It’s astonishing we’ve come this far; ~15 years ago there was real fear about reaching physical limits due to heat. Yeah you can shove more cores on a single die, but that doesn’t make it a useful consumer product. You add a lot of Watts to crush some benchmarks, but it has zero relevance to the vast majority of “enthusiast” gaming. Of course, it’ll be great for the multi-threaded successor to Dwarf Fortress that I keep hoping somebody makes.

This puts immense pressure on Intel, as last year they had none. Combined with the aggressive roadmap that AMD has laid out for die shrinkage and general processor improvement and Intel has been scrambling. You can see this in their early(by about 6-8 months) release of the 299 chipset and processors. Now, Intel does have an advantage with Optane for servers, but the amount of data sets that could take advantage of it and would find the load time boosts upon system restarts that 6 terabytes of Optane can give economically feasible at $2-4 per GB has to be pretty damned low. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:35 Buuurr says: ” This puts immense pressure on Intel, as last year they had none.” Yeah, Intel is terrified to lose that other 15% of the market that gives them a ginormous lead in RND and marketing and income. That 15% provides Intel with the best competition that it could possibly ever want to go against… competition that is always on the back foot. Sorry, competition that is always in the air about to hit the mat after a proper upper cut. If you think Intel is fearing anything, go ahead and check the stocks and cash reserves to find all the ‘fear’. AMD’s release was nothing more than a last gasp from them. Years ago when they were emergent they had some great, genuine competition to Intel chips. They really did. But, they fell and haven’t gotten up yet. Yeah, they released some new chips that do a touch better than the Intel line released a year ago. Great. Hi, welcome to the party. Intel releases the new ones soon. As usual, they will destroy. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 05:49 ravenshrike says: Yeah, you don’t seem to understand AMDs play. They’re making a serious push for the server and content creation market out of the gate with servers that will cost from 60-70% of comparable Intel servers. Moreover, Intel doesn’t look to have more than their 5-10% real world performance gains in their current architecture assuming the past three refreshes are anything to go by. Whereas this is the first iteration of Zen, and it’s immediately going through a process shrink, disregarding any other improvements to the underlying architecture itself.

Home Hardware AMD’s 16-core CPU and other exciting stuff By Jeremy Laird on May 25th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Yes, yes, a 16-core CPU is likely-going-on-definitely irrelevant for PC gaming. But it’s an exciting notion in simple technological terms and it represents something that certainly is important for gaming, namely that the PC as a platform has woken up again. Along with that mega-CPU from AMD, we also have the imminent prospect of new graphics card families from both AMD and Nvidia, new CPUs from Intel in response to AMD Ryzen assault, an intriguing new APU, again from AMD, that could just make for some nice cheapo laptops with genuine gaming chops and, well, plenty more. And the annual Computex tech shindig hasn’t even kicked off yet… AMD’s saucy new 16-core Threadripper (yes, really) processor, then. What’s it all about? Socking it to Intel, quite simply. I can’t imagine that AMD is going to sell very many of these new 16-core beasts to desktop PC enthusiasts. But beating Intel on core count and (possibly but not quite certainly) for outright performance in certain metrics has significant PR value. For the record, this 16-core / 32-thread chip will apparently be branded Ryzen 9 and the full range will also include 14-core, 12-core and 10-core models. It’s also mated to its own new socket, much like Intel’s high-end desktop CPUs, so it’s not cross compatible with existing Ryzen CPUs and their AM4 socket. Clockspeeds are expected to be surprisingly high, with a baseclock of 3.5GHz and 3.9GHz Turbo for the top 16-core Ryzen 9 Threadripper. Thus, you can have your single-threaded performance cake and eat the multi-core goodness at the same time. In other words, if you can afford what will undoubtedly be a very expensive chip, it’ll likely be decent for gaming and killer for almost everything else. One chip to rule them all, perhaps. Threadripper will likely be a pair of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen CPU dies crammed into a single package… For real-world gamers, the existing Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 models still make much more sense. But Ryzen 9’s impact will be felt in terms of how it pushes the market on in general, regards both performance and pricing. Even if you never buy a Ryzen 9, it’ll probably make whatever you do buy a bit faster or a bit cheaper. Indeed, it’s no surprise to learn that Intel is planning a riposte. The web has been alive with reports of a new high-end 12-core Intel CPU for the desktop, branded predictably enough Core i9, plus a pair of slightly odd-ball quad-core CPUs that eschew integrated graphics and slot into Intel’s high-end LGA2011 socket. But for me, it’s what Intel does with its mainstream LGA1151 socket, the one that accepts chips like the £200/$200-odd Core i5-7600K, that’s of more interest. The expectation here is for the debut of a six-core processor as part of the upcoming Coffee Lake family later this year. That’s a big deal given that mainstream Intel desktop CPUs have topped out at four cores ever since they were split off into a separate socket eight long years ago. Even if you’re not convinced that six cores will have much impact on game performance, inserting a new six-core model as the de facto top rung of the mainstream Intel CPU line should push the four-core models down the stack a little and make them more affordable. AMD’s mainstream AM4 socket that appeared with the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs isn’t compatible with the new Threadripper megachips Another fun-sounding new CPU, or rather APU, due soon is Raven Ridge. It’s basically an AMD Ryzen CPU in dual up to quad-core trim with a slice of AMD’s next-generation Vega graphics all squeezed into a single chip. Nothing is certain, but leaked AMD docs indicate it will have 11 so-called Vega graphics cores, which should work out at about 700 pixel-prettifying shaders or roughly the same as the original Xbox One console. Imagine all of that in a genuinely cheap, thin and light laptop PC and I suggest you are now quite interested. At the very least, Raven Ridge should massively lift the bar for entry-level integrated graphics performance. It might just be the first APU that’s genuinely gaming capable. Dare we hope for, say, a $400 / £400 laptop with decent gaming chops? Fingers crossed. On the graphics side of the equation AMD still has an awful lot of catching up to do. At the high end, it’s a full generation behind AMD’s Pascal graphics cards, such as the GeForce GTX 1080. AMD has had no response to Nvidia’s high-end Pascal cards, like the GTX 1080 Ti In fact, Nvidia even beat AMD to the punch with its recent announcement of the first GPU from its next generation Volta family of graphics tech. It’s a chip aimed at high-end compute and machine learning rather than gaming. But as a member of the new Volta family, it’s fully two generations advantage over AMD’s last high-end GPU, the Radeon Fury. In fairness, it was only a week later that AMD rolled out its own new high-end GPU for compute and in turn the first member of its long-awaited Vega series of graphics cards. The Radeon Vega Froniter Edition, as its known, gives a sneak peak of what to expect from AMD’s next high-end gaming cards. And what we can apparently expect is a GPU that depends on high clocks to achieve its performance edge. If that’s accurate, then it may explain why Vega is so late to launch (yes, late you naughty people in the comments below). Perhaps AMD is struggling to get the clocks up to sufficiently competitive speeds. We’ll find out the truth soon enough as I expect a fairly substantial Vega reveal from AMD in the coming weeks. Anyway, the sum total of all this is that by year end the PC landscape will likely look very different. At any given price point, both CPU and GPU performance will have stepped up fairly dramatically on the desktop and there’s also a half decent chance that new generation of cheap gameable laptops may have arrived. With all that in mind, my broad advice re upgrading your PC or buying a new rig is a very firm hold, currently. Recent years have seen fairly long periods of stagnation in terms of key PC hardware, which meant you may as well buy sooner rather than later. But right now looks very much like a moment where holding off for three to six months could pay significant long-term dividends. Watch this space.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:52 vorador says: On the positive side it will definitely put the screws on Intel, who has been lazy as hell lately on the CPU department, with new models barely a 5%-10% performance improvement over previous ones. While it likely won’t beat Intel at gaming purposes, for tasks that benefit from multithreading this thing is a beast. Even the biggest Xeon has “just” 12 cores and 24 threads, and its price is/was ridiculous. And the its equivalent on Ryzen has a maximum of 32 cores and 64 threads, a chip named “Epyc” (yes really) the size of a fist.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:39 tormeh says: Technically yes, but if I remember correctly, the cores in Xeon Phi are essentially slightly modified 386 cores. In other words, the Xeon Phi has absolutely useless single-core performance. While there definitely are applications that benefit from this approach, you would be really screwed for everything else. The Phi booting Windows could take a while. In fact, you should definitely consider taking a nap while it happens. Or even work a couple of days; I’m unsure what order of magnitude this thing is on. The Xeon Phi is supposed to compete with GPUs, not CPUs. That it can do all the instructions a standard x86 CPU can do is a unique selling point, but you shouldn’t take that as an invitation to use it as a CPU. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 05:35 Don Reba says: They are slightly modified Xeon cores, but you’re right that they are not really comparable. The Phi runs its own OS, it’s not just a chip. We evaluated them for the LHCb compute farm, but they turned out to be far from price-competitive compared to GPUs. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 02:25 TillEulenspiegel says: I swear people are spoiled by the huge jump that occurred around Core 2 and have no memory of the miserable Pentium 4 years. Intel isn’t “lazy”, the problem is that CPU development isn’t magic. The only straightforward thing is using smaller processes for better efficiency, everything else is either a tradeoff or expensive or a genuine innovation. It’s astonishing we’ve come this far; ~15 years ago there was real fear about reaching physical limits due to heat. Yeah you can shove more cores on a single die, but that doesn’t make it a useful consumer product. You add a lot of Watts to crush some benchmarks, but it has zero relevance to the vast majority of “enthusiast” gaming. Of course, it’ll be great for the multi-threaded successor to Dwarf Fortress that I keep hoping somebody makes.

This puts immense pressure on Intel, as last year they had none. Combined with the aggressive roadmap that AMD has laid out for die shrinkage and general processor improvement and Intel has been scrambling. You can see this in their early(by about 6-8 months) release of the 299 chipset and processors. Now, Intel does have an advantage with Optane for servers, but the amount of data sets that could take advantage of it and would find the load time boosts upon system restarts that 6 terabytes of Optane can give economically feasible at $2-4 per GB has to be pretty damned low. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:35 Buuurr says: ” This puts immense pressure on Intel, as last year they had none.” Yeah, Intel is terrified to lose that other 15% of the market that gives them a ginormous lead in RND and marketing and income. That 15% provides Intel with the best competition that it could possibly ever want to go against… competition that is always on the back foot. Sorry, competition that is always in the air about to hit the mat after a proper upper cut. If you think Intel is fearing anything, go ahead and check the stocks and cash reserves to find all the ‘fear’. AMD’s release was nothing more than a last gasp from them. Years ago when they were emergent they had some great, genuine competition to Intel chips. They really did. But, they fell and haven’t gotten up yet. Yeah, they released some new chips that do a touch better than the Intel line released a year ago. Great. Hi, welcome to the party. Intel releases the new ones soon. As usual, they will destroy. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 05:49 ravenshrike says: Yeah, you don’t seem to understand AMDs play. They’re making a serious push for the server and content creation market out of the gate with servers that will cost from 60-70% of comparable Intel servers. Moreover, Intel doesn’t look to have more than their 5-10% real world performance gains in their current architecture assuming the past three refreshes are anything to go by. Whereas this is the first iteration of Zen, and it’s immediately going through a process shrink, disregarding any other improvements to the underlying architecture itself. Unless Intel pulls a series of rabbits out of their hat AMD is going to seriously cut into their marketshare over the next 5 years. Especially if Apple goes with Raven Ridge for the new Macbook Pro.

But if the latest leak is accurate, Intel's next-generation silicon is likely to be out of most people's budget. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | May 23, 2017 -- 15:03 GMT (08:03 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Ben Fox Rubin/CNET A leaked slide suggests that Intel is gearing up to release a 12-core desktop processor as part of a new Core i9 release. But does anyone really need 12 cores on the desktop? Or, more importantly, will people pay for 12 cores? See also: Microsoft should have left Windows XP to rot and die Here's what the leaked line-up is rumored to look like: CPU i9-7800X i9-7820X i9-7900X i9-7920X Cores/Threads 6/12 8/16 10/20 12/24 Base clock (GHz) 3.5 3.6 3.3 n/a Boost clock (GHz) 4.0 4.5 4.5 n/a L3 cache (MB) 8.25 11 13.75 16.5 TDP (watts) 140 140 160 160 Cyberwar and the Future of Cybersecurity A spotter's guide to the groups that are out to get you Ransomware attack: How a nuisance became a global threat Devastating attacks to public infrastructure 'a matter of when' in the US The Internet of Insecure Things, and why we're still in denial As you can probably tell, we're looking at high-end chips here, aimed at workstations, and gamers who have crazy budgets. We're also seeing what is likely to be the first shot across the bow of AMD's newly-released Ryzen chips. Now the geek in me wants to start comparing AMD's current processor line-up to the information in this leak and start extrapolating and making wild conclusions. But the analytical part of me is putting the breaks on that. After all, comparing silicon that's out and in PCs to a slide made in PowerPoint. There's a big difference there, and we know that AMD has plans that go beyond the current Ryzen line-up because the company has already made that clear. But we can ask a serious question, and that's whether we actually need 12-core processors in desktops? After all, modern operating systems and applications don't do a particularly good job of leveraging much above four cores. Don't get me wrong, there are situations where "more cores means better," but you have to know when you're spending money on cores wisely, and when you're just throwing money at silicon that you're not really going to leverage. So if Intel can push 12-core i9 processors out the door before the end of the year -- the leak suggests they could land as early as August -- then we have a great chip for workstations and gamers who have deep pockets. Sure, it's niche, but still an important market to cater for. And the leaked slide suggests that the Core i9 will have more going for it that just more cores and more speed. The 44 PCIe lanes on the higher-end i9s opens up the way for systems to have more flexibility by including more M.2 slots for high-performance storage and more lanes for PCIe slots (and expansion to three and four graphics cards). 44 lanes is a huge increase over the 16 lanes offered by the Intel i7-7700K, and even the 40 lanes provided by Intel's monster $1,650 i7-6950X (AMD's Ryzen chips have 24 PCIe lanes). More robotics Watch this 3D-printed robot walk on sand This is the first soft robot that can walk on rough surfaces. Read More Those extra lanes will make a difference, but only those pushing the limits of the current envelope -- and spending serious money -- will see the benefit. Another point of note is TDP (Thermal Design Power), which is a measure of the amount of heat generated by the chip that the cooling system will have to deal with. 140 watts is a lot of heat to get rid of, especially compared to the 95 watts generated by the high-end Ryzen. But the watts per core generated by the rumored Intel 12-core i9 doesn't seem too bad when you consider that the top Ryzen is an 8-core chip. But it still leaves the subject of pricing, and the inescapable fact that Intel chips are expensive. Intel's 10-core i7-6590X is an eye-watering $1,650, and no matter how you cut it, that's a lot of money. That's where the i9 might hit a speed bump. After all, PCs aren't really flying off the shelves, and buyers are more price sensitive than ever. While we'd all love to have 12 cores at our disposal, not many will be willing to spend over a thousand dollars on just the silicon. And that's the edge that AMD currently has over Intel -- silicon at a price point that people are willing to pay.

Threadripper will likely be a pair of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen CPU dies crammed into a single package… For real-world gamers, the existing Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 models still make much more sense. But Ryzen 9’s impact will be felt in terms of how it pushes the market on in general, regards both performance and pricing. Even if you never buy a Ryzen 9, it’ll probably make whatever you do buy a bit faster or a bit cheaper. Indeed, it’s no surprise to learn that Intel is planning a riposte. The web has been alive with reports of a new high-end 12-core Intel CPU for the desktop, branded predictably enough Core i9, plus a pair of slightly odd-ball quad-core CPUs that eschew integrated graphics and slot into Intel’s high-end LGA2011 socket. But for me, it’s what Intel does with its mainstream LGA1151 socket, the one that accepts chips like the £200/$200-odd Core i5-7600K, that’s of more interest. The expectation here is for the debut of a six-core processor as part of the upcoming Coffee Lake family later this year. That’s a big deal given that mainstream Intel desktop CPUs have topped out at four cores ever since they were split off into a separate socket eight long years ago. Even if you’re not convinced that six cores will have much impact on game performance, inserting a new six-core model as the de facto top rung of the mainstream Intel CPU line should push the four-core models down the stack a little and make them more affordable. AMD’s mainstream AM4 socket that appeared with the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs isn’t compatible with the new Threadripper megachips Another fun-sounding new CPU, or rather APU, due soon is Raven Ridge. It’s basically an AMD Ryzen CPU in dual up to quad-core trim with a slice of AMD’s next-generation Vega graphics all squeezed into a single chip. Nothing is certain, but leaked AMD docs indicate it will have 11 so-called Vega graphics cores, which should work out at about 700 pixel-prettifying shaders or roughly the same as the original Xbox One console. Imagine all of that in a genuinely cheap, thin and light laptop PC and I suggest you are now quite interested. At the very least, Raven Ridge should massively lift the bar for entry-level integrated graphics performance. It might just be the first APU that’s genuinely gaming capable. Dare we hope for, say, a $400 / £400 laptop with decent gaming chops? Fingers crossed. On the graphics side of the equation AMD still has an awful lot of catching up to do. At the high end, it’s a full generation behind AMD’s Pascal graphics cards, such as the GeForce GTX 1080. AMD has had no response to Nvidia’s high-end Pascal cards, like the GTX 1080 Ti In fact, Nvidia even beat AMD to the punch with its recent announcement of the first GPU from its next generation Volta family of graphics tech. It’s a chip aimed at high-end compute and machine learning rather than gaming. But as a member of the new Volta family, it’s fully two generations advantage over AMD’s last high-end GPU, the Radeon Fury. In fairness, it was only a week later that AMD rolled out its own new high-end GPU for compute and in turn the first member of its long-awaited Vega series of graphics cards. The Radeon Vega Froniter Edition, as its known, gives a sneak peak of what to expect from AMD’s next high-end gaming cards. And what we can apparently expect is a GPU that depends on high clocks to achieve its performance edge. If that’s accurate, then it may explain why Vega is so late to launch (yes, late you naughty people in the comments below). Perhaps AMD is struggling to get the clocks up to sufficiently competitive speeds. We’ll find out the truth soon enough as I expect a fairly substantial Vega reveal from AMD in the coming weeks. Anyway, the sum total of all this is that by year end the PC landscape will likely look very different. At any given price point, both CPU and GPU performance will have stepped up fairly dramatically on the desktop and there’s also a half decent chance that new generation of cheap gameable laptops may have arrived. With all that in mind, my broad advice re upgrading your PC or buying a new rig is a very firm hold, currently. Recent years have seen fairly long periods of stagnation in terms of key PC hardware, which meant you may as well buy sooner rather than later. But right now looks very much like a moment where holding off for three to six months could pay significant long-term dividends. Watch this space.

Even the biggest Xeon has “just” 12 cores and 24 threads, and its price is/was ridiculous.

It’s astonishing we’ve come this far; ~15 years ago there was real fear about reaching physical limits due to heat. Yeah you can shove more cores on a single die, but that doesn’t make it a useful consumer product. You add a lot of Watts to crush some benchmarks, but it has zero relevance to the vast majority of “enthusiast” gaming.

You can see this in their early(by about 6-8 months) release of the 299 chipset and processors. Now, Intel does have an advantage with Optane for servers, but the amount of data sets that could take advantage of it and would find the load time boosts upon system restarts that 6 terabytes of Optane can give economically feasible at $2-4 per GB has to be pretty damned low. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:35 Buuurr says: ” This puts immense pressure on Intel, as last year they had none.” Yeah, Intel is terrified to lose that other 15% of the market that gives them a ginormous lead in RND and marketing and income. That 15% provides Intel with the best competition that it could possibly ever want to go against… competition that is always on the back foot. Sorry, competition that is always in the air about to hit the mat after a proper upper cut. If you think Intel is fearing anything, go ahead and check the stocks and cash reserves to find all the ‘fear’. AMD’s release was nothing more than a last gasp from them. Years ago when they were emergent they had some great, genuine competition to Intel chips. They really did. But, they fell and haven’t gotten up yet. Yeah, they released some new chips that do a touch better than the Intel line released a year ago. Great. Hi, welcome to the party. Intel releases the new ones soon. As usual, they will destroy. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 05:49 ravenshrike says: Yeah, you don’t seem to understand AMDs play. They’re making a serious push for the server and content creation market out of the gate with servers that will cost from 60-70% of comparable Intel servers. Moreover, Intel doesn’t look to have more than their 5-10% real world performance gains in their current architecture assuming the past three refreshes are anything to go by. Whereas this is the first iteration of Zen, and it’s immediately going through a process shrink, disregarding any other improvements to the underlying architecture itself. Unless Intel pulls a series of rabbits out of their hat AMD is going to seriously cut into their marketshare over the next 5 years. Especially if Apple goes with Raven Ridge for the new Macbook Pro.

Home Hardware AMD’s 16-core CPU and other exciting stuff By Jeremy Laird on May 25th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Yes, yes, a 16-core CPU is likely-going-on-definitely irrelevant for PC gaming. But it’s an exciting notion in simple technological terms and it represents something that certainly is important for gaming, namely that the PC as a platform has woken up again. Along with that mega-CPU from AMD, we also have the imminent prospect of new graphics card families from both AMD and Nvidia, new CPUs from Intel in response to AMD Ryzen assault, an intriguing new APU, again from AMD, that could just make for some nice cheapo laptops with genuine gaming chops and, well, plenty more. And the annual Computex tech shindig hasn’t even kicked off yet… AMD’s saucy new 16-core Threadripper (yes, really) processor, then. What’s it all about? Socking it to Intel, quite simply. I can’t imagine that AMD is going to sell very many of these new 16-core beasts to desktop PC enthusiasts. But beating Intel on core count and (possibly but not quite certainly) for outright performance in certain metrics has significant PR value. For the record, this 16-core / 32-thread chip will apparently be branded Ryzen 9 and the full range will also include 14-core, 12-core and 10-core models. It’s also mated to its own new socket, much like Intel’s high-end desktop CPUs, so it’s not cross compatible with existing Ryzen CPUs and their AM4 socket. Clockspeeds are expected to be surprisingly high, with a baseclock of 3.5GHz and 3.9GHz Turbo for the top 16-core Ryzen 9 Threadripper. Thus, you can have your single-threaded performance cake and eat the multi-core goodness at the same time. In other words, if you can afford what will undoubtedly be a very expensive chip, it’ll likely be decent for gaming and killer for almost everything else. One chip to rule them all, perhaps. Threadripper will likely be a pair of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen CPU dies crammed into a single package… For real-world gamers, the existing Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 models still make much more sense.

Intel will begin embedding Thunderbolt 3 into all future models of its CPUs, in plans to create a world where one USB-C connector handles all the work. By deploying the Thunderbolt 3 into the CPU, computers will be able to create smaller systems by just using Thunderbolt 3 ports. Its capabilities will include handling applications such as 4K resolution video cameras in virtual reality, which will be delivered using Thunderbolt 3. Chris Walker, VP for Computing group, Intel said: “Intel’s vision for Thunderbolt was not just to make a faster computer port, but a simpler and more versatile port available to everyone. “We envision a future where high-performance single-cable docks, stunning photos and 4K video, lifelike VR, and faster-than-ever storage are commonplace.” Read more: Intel axes lack Lustre file systems and open sources features This can also be deployed by gamers as the addition of Thunderbolt 3 enables gamers to experience mobility and performance gaming in one device. According to Intel, Thunderbolt 3 is the only USB port that can connect NVMe SSDs to PCs and the large storage space enables users to save time with data transfers that usually take a while. In this case, a full 4K movie can be transferred in under 30 seconds. Thunderbolt is currently already available on Apple and Intel has increased its adoption market size to Microsoft, in order to deliver Thunderbolt 3 device plug-and-play support in Windows 10 Creators Update. “Microsoft and Intel are working together to enable Thunderbolt 3 on Windows PCs to deliver on the ‘if it fits, it works’ potential of USB-C. “The Windows 10 Creators Update enhanced plug-and-play support for Thunderbolt 3 devices, with additional enhancements planned for future OS releases,” said Roanne Sones, GM for Strategy and ecosystem for Windows and devices, Microsoft. Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 has been already been adopted widely in over 120 PC designs with its 7th Generation Core processors and the latest MacBook Pros, and is expected to increase to nearly 150 by the end of the year.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | May 24, 2017 -- 17:00 GMT (10:00 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Less than a year after expanding its partnership with the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT to advance the use high-performance computing for genomics analytics, Intel is announcing some milestones. Intel and Broad have developed a new reference architecture, called the Broad-Intel Genomics Stack (BIGstack), which delivers a 5X improvement to Broad's genomics analytics pipeline. It uses Intel's CPUs, Omni-Path Fabric, and SSDs. The stack also includes optimizations for the Intel's integrated CPU and FPGAs. The new architecture supports data volumes "at truly unprecedented scale," wrote Jason Waxman, corporate VP and GM of the Data Center Solutions Group at Intel, in a blog post. With this sort of advancement in genomics analytics, he wrote, "we can take new steps toward understanding the molecular drivers of cancer and other diseases and accelerating the promise of precision medicine." BIGstack is now available to the 45,000 registered users of GATK, Broad's genomics analysis toolkit. Waxman called it "the kind of breakthrough in affordability for the genomics analytics community" that Intel had in mind when it committed $25 million to its five-year collaboration with the Broad Institute last year. Meanwhile, Intel also announced that the Broad Institute is open-sourcing GATK4. Additionally, BGI -- a leader in China's genomics industry -- is adopting GATK tools, including GATK4, Broad's workflow management system Cromwell and the WDL (workflow definition language) on the BGI Online platform. The move should help align genomics research around the globe, Waxman said. A problem-solving approach IT workers should learn from robotics engineers Sometimes the most profound solution is to change the entire problem.

Combined with the Type-C connector, it is the absolute embodiment of universal and versatile connectivity. However, current adoption is far from universal, mainly due to its proprietary nature and royalties involved - two problems that Intel is now planning to resolve. The chip manufacturer just announced its plans to offer the Thunderbolt 3 spec to third-party partners royalty-free and also embed the technology in most of its future chips. The latter sure sounds like something that should already be a thing, but actually most of Intel's current chipsets, including last year's Kaby Lake line don't have Thunderbolt 3 support built-in. In most devices that currently offer the feature, it is powered by a dedicated chip, codenamed "Alpine Ridge" and released all the way back in 2015. Since then, under proprietary conditions, it has been one of the only ways to add Thunderbolt 3 to a device. This is enough to slow adoption in itself, but, to make things worse, both ends of the fast Thunderbolt connection generally have to have an expensive "Alpine Ridge" chip installed. Intel's move to infuse the technology in its chipsets should instantly boost adoption in the PC world. AMD will likely be the first in line to sign a partnership with its blue rivals. This moves opens up even more interesting possibilities in the mobile realm. A future adoption of Thunderbolt 3 in the ARM world could bring about a veritable revolution in mobile device connectivity, since the true power of Thunderbolt 3 lies in its interoperability and versatility. In its current PC form, the standard almost magically incorporates support for fast USB 3.1 connectivity, DisplayPort output for up to two 4K streams, as well as HDMI, DVI and even VGA with passive adapters. It also comes with power delivery at up to 100W. Last, but not least, there is the extremely exciting external PCI Express support, which is is already being leveraged for attaching powerful GPU's and other high-bandwidth peripherals to supported PC's. Just imagine all that freedom embedded in your smartphone.

You'll Love These Stocks If you love NVIDIA’s business but hate its lofty price tag, consider buying AMD or Qualcomm instead. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 25, 2017 at 3:13PM Shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) have rallied more than 210% over the past 12 months, fueled by robust demand for its gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, and CPUs for connected cars. But after that huge run, NVIDIA now trades at 53 times earnings -- more than double the industry average of 26 for semiconductor makers. Therefore, investors might hesitate to buy NVIDIA at these levels, especially with the market hovering near historic highs. So for investors who like NVIDIA's growth story but don't like its premium valuation, here are two alternative plays to consider -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). NVIDIA's Roborace car. Image source: NVIDIA. AMD AMD is NVIDIA's main rival in discrete GPUs. According to research firm JPR, AMD controlled 29.5% of the market at the end of 2016, compared to NVIDIA's 70.5% share. AMD generally sells cheaper GPUs than NVIDIA, which helped it carve out a loyal niche among budget PC gamers. AMD has been aggressively striking back at NVIDIA in GPUs and Intel in CPUs with new products. On the GPU front, it launched new low-end VR-ready GPUs with its Polaris chipset to challenge NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal cards last year. It also plans to launch a preemptive strike against NVIDIA's next-gen Volta cards with its Vega-based cards later this year. AMD's RX480 GPU. Image source: AMD. In CPUs, AMD is challenging Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake processors with its new Ryzen chips -- which reportedly offer comparable performance as Intel's top-tier eight-core chips at about half the price. These fresh catalysts could significantly strengthen its computing and graphics business over the next few quarters. AMD also dominates modern gaming consoles by supplying custom SoCs for the PS4 and Xbox One, which have since become a pillar of growth for its EESC (enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom) unit. Analysts expect these tailwinds to lift AMD's revenue by 13% this year, while its non-GAAP earnings -- which have remained in the red for two straight years -- are expected to bounce back into the black. AMD has rallied 180% over the past 12 months on that optimism, but it still isn't that expensive at 2.1 times sales, which is much lower than the industry average price-to-sales ratio of 4 for semiconductor makers. Qualcomm Qualcomm's 8% gain over the past 12 months looks paltry relative to NVIDIA's and AMD's gains, but that's because the mobile chipmaker has been weighed down by a series of ongoing legal battles with regulators and smartphone makers. Image source: Qualcomm. Since those battles are mainly centered on the mobile device market, Qualcomm is aggressively expanding into adjacent markets -- like wearables, connected cameras, drones, and connected cars -- to diversify its business. A big part of that push is challenging NVIDIA's rapidly growing business of connected cars. Last year, Qualcomm launched Snapdragon Automotive chips to counter the growing adoption of NVIDIA's Tegra chips in infotainment and navigation systems in connected cars. Qualcomm will also close its $47 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world, later this year. That purchase will give Qualcomm NXP's BlueBox platform for driverless cars, which directly competes against NVIDIA's Drive PX platform. Since NXP sells a large variety of other automotive chips, Qualcomm will likely employ bundling strategies to gain market share against NVIDIA in the automotive market, which might make the former a better long-term play on connected cars than the latter. Qualcomm's legal troubles won't end anytime soon, but the NXP deal could transform its business model into a more balanced one, instead of one that relies heavily on a high-margin licensing business propping up a lower-margin one that makes mobile chipsets. Analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue and earnings (excluding the NXP deal) to dip 3% and 4%, respectively, this year. That sounds dismal, but the stock's price to earnings of 20 remains lower than the industry average of 26 for semiconductor makers, and its forward dividend yield of 3.9% is much higher than S&P 500's current yield of 2%. The key takeaways I doubt NVIDIA will lose its footing anytime soon, thanks to its market-leading positions in GPUs and automotive CPUs. However, the stock could certainly stagnate as investors fret over its valuations. So, in the meantime, investors should keep AMD and Qualcomm in mind as alternative plays on GPUs and connected cars. There's no guarantee that either stock will outperform NVIDIA this year, but they could be lifted by the same rising tides that are boosting NVIDIA's growth. Leo Sun owns shares of Qualcomm.

The 2017 Surface Pro’s processors and bigger batteries allow it to run for 13.5 hours between charges. Its screen is more sensitive to pressure and knows when its user is holding their Surface Pen at an angle. These features make for a fine upgrade. They don’t instantly make the Surface Pro 4 obsolete. The Surface Pro 4 has the same features that its successor does, they’re just less advanced. Users can take notes and draw using the included Surface Pen. Microsoft’s Windows Store has desktop programs and new touch-friendly apps that work just fine with it. It has a kickstand, and you can buy keyboard covers and docking accessories for it. Pre-orders of the 2017 Surface Pro are available now ahead of its June 15th launch. 2017 Surface Pro vs Surface Pro 4: Design & Performance The Surface Pro 4 and 2017 Surface Pro are both one-third of an inch thick magnesium and glass slabs. Each tablet weighs between 1.69 and 1.73 pounds, depending on the Intel Core processor that it has inside. Kickstands that extend out of their rear-casing allow buyers to prop them up without a case. A MicroSD card slot, USB 3.0 port, Surface Connect charging port, Mini Display Port and headphone jack are on them both. The Surface Pro 4 with Type Cover and Surface Pen. The two computers share a lot of components. Their 5-megapixel front-facing cameras let buyers avoid passwords. An 8-megapixel camera on their rear can scan documents and take decent photos. Because the 12.3-inch 2736 x 1824 display in the Surface Pro 4 is the same display that’s in the 2017 Surface Pro, movies and videos will appear the same on either device. Internally, the two Windows 2-in-1s have some big differences. The 2017 Surface Pro uses Intel 7th Generation Core m3, Core i5 and Core i7 processors. Microsoft claims that these processors allow the 2017 Surface Pro to play back video for 13.5 hours on a single charge. That’s more than the 9 hours of video the Surface Pro 4 is capable of. Starting up and opening programs on the 2017 Surface Pro is a little faster thanks to these new processors too. How Digital Inking is Different on the 2017 Surface Pro Digital inking is a core feature of the Surface Pro 4. The device comes with a Surface Pen. Its screen can detect 1,024 different levels of pressure as users write and draw. A rubber cap on the end of its pen gives users a convenient way to erase what they’ve written, and the built-in kickstand lets users lower the screen to a 150-degree angle for writing or drawing. All but one Surface Pro 4 comes with a Surface Pen. Despite all that, drawing is better on Microsoft’s newest device. Only the 2017 Surface Pro knows when users are tilting their Surface Pen while sketching. It detects 4,096 different levels of pressure so that strokes have the exact thickness that the artist wants. Microsoft claims in an interview with The Verge that new technology lets strokes and lines show up two times faster than before. Drawing on tables is easier with the kickstand’s lower 165-degree maximum angle. This lower angle allows for more comfortable wrist and arm movement. The 2017 Surface Pro’s 165-degee kickstand angle is more comfortable for artists. The digital inking experience on the 2017 Surface Pro does take a step back in one major way. Microsoft doesn’t bundle the new Surface Pen with the new Surface Pro. Instead, shoppers must buy the accessory separately. Getting the expanded pressure sensitivity and tilting requires users to spend $99. If the improved pressure sensitivity isn’t important, they can get by with the older $59 Surface Pen. 2017 Surface Pro vs Surface Pro 4: Accessories Your experience with either Surface Pro is only as good as the accessories you have for it. The Surface Type Cover is the only way that you’ll get the laptop experience Microsoft teases in its ads. Unless you’d like to draw with your finger, a Surface Pen is a must. The Surface Dock conveniently connects the tablet to a monitor, hard drive, mouse and keyboard with a single cable. All older accessories work with all Surface Pros, but require the latest hardware to unlock all features. Only buyers of the 2017 Surface Pro get tilt sensitivity and boosted pressure detection with the new Surface Pen. Microsoft’s Surface Dial locks to Surface Pro 4’s screen. It doesn’t show any extra settings or options today. You can pair it with Bluetooth and change settings with it on your desk. That’s not as appealing. The Surface Dial adds options to the 2017 Surface Pro’s screen. No Surface Pro comes with a cover, so you’ll need to factor that into your buying decision.  The $159 Surface Pro Signature Type Covers launch alongside the 2017 Surface Pro. Only their softer Alcantara fabric makes them different from the $129 Surface Pro 4 Type Covers. 2017 Surface Pro vs Surface Pro 4: Price The Surface Pro 4 offers a great display, a fine writing experience and Windows programs without the hefty price tag of the 2017 Surface Pro. Only one Surface Pro 4 lacks the Surface Pen. Shoppers can upgrade the RAM and storage of three models for a bit more than their base price. These upgraded models still cost less than similar 2017 Surface Pro configurations. A Surface Pro 4 with Surface Pro 4 Type Cover and Surface Pen. A Surface Pro 4 with Intel Core m3 processor is $699 at the Microsoft Store. This model doesn’t include a Surface Pen. It does boast 128GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. This base model is only available in this configuration, which means you can’t pair more RAM or more storage with the Intel Core m3 processor. The $849.99 Surface Pro 4 with Intel Core i5 processor and 4GB of RAM comes with the Surface Pen. The $999 model comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Going up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage bumps the price up to $1,799. $1,299 gets shoppers a Surface Pro 4 with 256GB of storage, an Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM. A $1,499 upgrade to this model adds 16GB of RAM. RAM helps you run more apps and programs at the same time. 16GB is the most any Surface Pro has. A Surface Pen comes in the box with this model. The 2017 Surface Pro models are slightly faster and more power efficient than the Surface Pro 4. That’s despite them having the same name. Also, keep in mind that no 2017 Surface Pro comes with a Type Cover or Surface Pen. The 2017 Surface Pro with new Surface Pen, Surface Mouse and Surface Signature Type Cover. A 2017 Surface Pro with Intel Core m3 processor and 4GB of RAM is $799 from the Microsoft Store. This model doesn’t have any upgrade options. The 2017 Surface Pro with Intel Core i5 has 4GB of RAM and a 128GB solid state drive for $999. Only a single upgrade to this model is available for pre-order. For $1,299, you will get 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. Intel’s Core i7 processor is in the last 2017 Surface Pro. The base model has 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. Adding 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM pushes the price to $2,199. The 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM add-on increases the price to $2,699.

Very few things in technology are as simple as choosing between the Surface Pro 4 and the 2017 Surface Pro. The advantages and disadvantages of buying these machines are clear. Those that must stay mobile for long periods need Intel’s latest processors and longer battery life, whatever the cost. Artists serious about their craft need that added pressure sensitivity and tilting. Both groups should go with the 2017 Surface Pro. The 2017 Surface Pro with Surface Signature Type Cover. All others should buy the Surface Pro 4. Buyers on a budget certainly get more for their money. A Surface Pro 4 with 8GB of RAM, Core i5 processor and 256GB storage is $999. The included Surface Pen makes Surface Pro 4 an even better bargain. Compare that to the $1,299 that a 2017 Surface Pro with the same configuration costs. That’s $300 in savings to cover a Surface Type Cover or any needed software. Note takers and casual computer users will do fine with the Surface Pro 4’s pressure sensitivity and processing power. The Microsoft Store and Best Buy are taking 2017 Surface Pro pre-orders now ahead of its June 15th launch. Both stores still carry the Surface Pro 4 too.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Intel To Expand Thunderbolt 3 Reach, Plans To Open USB-C Specs By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: MAY 25 2017 By the end of this year, the PC and Mac marketplace could feature nearly 150 devices with Intel's Thunderbolt 3 USB-C port. But Intel is aiming to expand the reach of its universal port design even further by integrating support for the connector into its future CPUs. Starting next year, the company also plans to boost the connector technology by making the Thunderbolt 3 protocol specification available to other companies under a non-exclusive, royalty-free licensing arrangement. Announced yesterday, the move would enable third-party manufacturers to incorporate the USB-C technology into their chips as well. First released by Intel and Apple in 2011, the Thunderbolt updated previous USB technology via a single cable that can support high-speed data transfers, device connectivity, and charging. The Thunderbolt 3, which hit the market in late 2015, provides speeds of up to 40 Gbps and can support dual 4K displays and up to 100W of charging power. Integration Means 'Thinner, Lighter' Systems Writing in an online editorial yesterday, company executive Chris Walker said the new CPU integration and specification plans are part of Intel's "Thunderbolt 3 everywhere" ambitions. "With Thunderbolt 3 integrated into the CPU, computer makers can build thinner and lighter systems with only Thunderbolt 3 ports," said Walker, vice president of Intel's client computing group and general manager of the mobility client platform. By making the technology available to third-party processor manufacturers, "[w]e expect industry chip development to accelerate a wide range of new devices and user experiences," he said. Currently, not all Intel chips provide native support for Thunderbolt 3. This means device manufacturers must either use Intel's Alpine Ridge chip, designed to support Thunderbolt 3, or include Alpine Ridge as an add-on, which adds to a device's cost and power consumption. With Thunderbolt 3 support built into all of Intel's chips, "all the ports on a computer can be the same -- any port can charge the system and connect to Thunderbolt devices, every display and billions of USB devices," Walker noted. "Designs based on Intel's integrated Thunderbolt 3 solution require less board space and reduce power by removing the discrete component needed for existing systems with Thunderbolt 3." Working on Enhancements with Microsoft While the current USB-C standard is already a "do everything connector" for video and high-speed data, power users who would benefit from the even faster Thunderbolt 3 have a more limited, and generally more expensive, selection of devices to choose from, Paul Teich, principal analyst at Tirias Research, wrote in a commentary on Medium in September. "As I looked into Thunderbolt 3, I began to see the perfect end-game for Intel and the PC market in promoting Thunderbolt 3 ports on laptops, tablets and smartphones -- commodity consumer VR/AR headsets," Teich said. "I like the direction that USB-C is heading, but it's not yet a complete solution for high-end laptop and tablet PC owners. I very much look forward to the second generation of USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 connectors giving all PC owners a vendor-independent single-wire dock in a few years." Intel's latest announcement appears to be aimed at doing just that. Walker noted yesterday that Microsoft has already boosted support for Thunderbolt 3 with its most recent Creators Update for Windows 10. He added that Intel and Microsoft are working together on future enhancements. "Microsoft and Intel are working together to enable Thunderbolt 3 on Windows PCs to deliver on the 'if it fits, it works' potential of USB-C," Roanne Sones, Microsoft Windows and Devices strategy and ecosystem general manager, said in a statement. "The Windows 10 Creators Update enhanced plug-and-play support for Thunderbolt 3 devices, with additional enhancements planned for future OS releases." Image credit: Product shots by Intel.

The move should help expand the Thunderbolt ecosystem by making the protocol more affordable for technology companies and accessory makers alike. Intel expects third-party Thunderbolt-compatible chip development to accelerate a wide range of new devices and user experiences. Intel also revealed plans to integrate Thunderbolt 3 into its future CPUs, but it didn't provide a timeline as to when. The all-in-one design will take up less space on a Mac or PC's logic board, and reduce power consumption by eliminating the need for a standalone Thunderbolt controller. “Apple and Intel have collaborated on Thunderbolt from the beginning, and as the industry leader in its adoption, we applaud Intel’s efforts to integrate Thunderbolt technology into its CPUs and open it up to the rest of the industry,” said Dan Riccio, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering.Intel said Thunderbolt 3 built into the processor could pave the way for thinner and lighter devices, although the current Thunderbolt 3 controller used in Apple's latest MacBook Pro has a package size of 10.7mm×10.7mm, so any logic board space saved would likely be negligible. The greater benefit will likely come from Thunderbolt 3's increased power efficiency, paving the way for longer battery life. Thunderbolt 3 carries power, USB, DisplayPort, HDMI, and VGA over a single port that shares the USB-C connector design, creating one standard for connecting most accessories and peripherals. Apple's latest MacBook Pro has two or four Thunderbolt 3 ports depending on the model. Thunderbolt 3 can transfer data at speeds up to 40Gbps, allowing for a full 4K movie to be transferred in less than 30 seconds. The interface is suitable for 4K virtual reality experiences on PCs, high-end gaming, and single-cable peripherals such as external displays, docks, and storage drives.

In 2/3 years, anyone who bought an expensive computer with old ports will regret it Regret it how? Person buys brand new computer today, May 24th. A standard config with USB, HDMI, Display Port, SD Reader. Come 2020, the computer still works. So what's to regret? I bet you can find forum members with computers that are 2, 3, heck 5-7 years old (or older) running perfectly fine. I know my 2011 MBA is still humming along. It's pretty hard to regret something that doesn't exist yet, and it definitely isn't a confirmation that Apple was correct about anything. In fact, didn't Apple recently acknowledge some of their decisions weren't exactly spot on?

Rating: 13 Votes ThunderSkunk 2 days ago at 08:35 am Actually it adds to the confusion, as now you'll have to find out if the USB-C port also supports Thunderbolt 3. :) Most of the lower to mid range devices will keep using USB 3 or 3.1 for connectivity, and not Thunderbolt. Rating: 11 Votes OldSchoolMacGuy 2 days ago at 09:27 am Sounds like great news. 40Gbps is just insane speed; I can't wait for this to become a ubiquitous standard. Sadly so few people get this part. Yes, it sucks to switch and have to use some adapters for a bit but the payoff is HUGE. Once you make the change you never need a different cable for power, and a different cable for networking and a different one for your monitor, and a different one for your hard drive, and a different one for your card reader, and a different one for your.... Switching to Thunderbolt 3 means a single cable can run everything and run it as speeds beyond what anything currently on the market can achieve. I'm already super happy with the new MBP and Thunderbolt 3. When I sit down at my desk, I plugin a single cable which means charging and connection to my dual monitors, external hard drives, keyboard, and other peripheral. Super simple and fast with a single connection. Sure beats having to deal with a million different devices and plugging each one in every time as some seem to love.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Thunderbolt Goes Royalty-Free as Intel Repositions It to Boost Adoption Thunderbolt Goes Royalty-Free as Intel Repositions It to Boost Adoption By Joel Hruska on May 25, 2017 at 11:15 am Comment For the past few years, Thunderbolt has been more of a curiosity than a standard-bearer for device connectivity. While the standard was meant to usher in a new era of high-speed peripherals and device interconnects, this was limited to a few high-end products and mostly marketed towards Mac users. Several years ago, Intel combined Thunderbolt support with the USB-C standard, creating the potential for systems that were compatible with the latest and greatest USB standard with reversible plug support, while simultaneously supporting the increased bandwidth of Thunderbolt 3 (40Gbit/s). Now, Intel is going one step further : It’s making the Thunderbolt 3 standard royalty-free in a bid to attract attention for the standard and improve uptake from manufacturers. There are two other key components to this development. First, Intel is going to bake Thunderbolt 3 support into its future CPUs, likely as part of the on-die I/O capabilities. Here, the technology could be key to extending capabilities like VR, which can make use of Thunderbolt 3’s bandwidth to hit high transmission speeds. Intel has never talked about a Thunderbolt 4, but if we assume that any such standard could make use of PCIe 4.0, we could see the most capable platforms in the future supporting Intel’s next-generation protocol. Thunderbolt 3 also includes USB 3.1 Gen 2 support via the Alpine Ridge controller. One of the more puzzling aspects to Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 support has been the way the company hasn’t integrated it into modern chipsets or CPUs. Despite debuting years ago, no Intel desktop or laptop CPU has integrated the capability natively, and neither do any of its chipsets. Instead, Intel has relied on consumers buying equipment with expensive additional controllers, including Alpine Ridge. As a result, while it’s been possible to find Thunderbolt 3 on various devices, it hasn’t been easy and it certainly hasn’t been cheap. With the technology being baked into future parts and offered royalty-free, Intel clearly wants to change that. And as a result, it’s going to open up the Thunderbolt 3 specification to other companies that want to build hardware as well. This means third-party firms will now be able to design their own Thunderbolt-compliant standards, including firms like AMD. Historically, this kind of broad compatibility has fostered greater innovation and performance in the computing industry. It’s true that in some cases, controllers made by one company have been superior to those made by another, but on the whole, the benefits have outweighed the costs. And it’s nice to see Intel finally taking the steps it needed to take to make Thunderbolt 3 competitive with other solutions in-market. The faster we can move towards USB-C and a single port standard for everything from power delivery to external interconnects, the better off customers will be — provided manufacturers step back from this BS trend of claiming that slapping one or two ports on an entire laptop is some kind of magical achievement that justifies even higher prices.

Thunderbolt 3, a port technology that uses the USB Type-C connection standard, is capable of a blistering data transfer rate of 40Gbps, and offers simultaneous power, data and video transfer capabilities, likely making it capable of fulfilling all your connection needs. Including Thunderbolt 3 support in a device requires a special controller chip though, a chip that is currently manufactured exclusively by Intel. However, in order to drive up adoption of the technology, Intel has announced that it will be building Thunderbolt 3 support directly into its processors, meaning that manufacturers will no longer need to worry about including a dedicated controller chip for Thunderbolt 3 support. In addition to this, Intel is also announcing that it will be making the specifications for Thunderbolt 3 technology freely available, with no royalties. This means that third parties and other companies will be free to include Thunderbolt 3 support in their devices at no added cost, which could spur adoption significantly. The Thunderbolt 3 specs will be published next year, but Intel did not release any information regarding which specific processor models would be receiving integrated Thunderbolt support, or when they will be released. The move will hopefully lead to many more devices using the Thunderbolt 3 standard, which could have big benefits for many companies' agile working efforts. The ease of being able to do everything with one cable has proved exceptionally useful in many businesses' adoption of flexible and agile workplace practices.

This is a huge deal for Skylake-X, as the IPC performance at 4.3GHz and 10C/20T of power should pummel every other CPU into dust. Better yet, SiSoft's benchmark picked up the CPU as 4.0GHz base clock and 4.5GHz boost, which would be absolutely insane - especially for a 10-core processor.     We should expect 13.75MB of L3 cache, 1MB L2 cache per core (10MB total), and a 175W TDP for the upcoming Core i9-7900X. We should expect Intel to unleash its new Skylake-X parts at Computex next week, alongside the new X299 chipset and a slew of new motherboards.     More Reading:   Core i9-7920K (12C/24T) @ 4.0GHz benchmarks Core i9 series teased NEWS SOURCES:Techpowerup.com >> NEXT STORY: New 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' trailer keeps improving << PREVIOUS STORY: Intel next-gen Xeon: 59% faster, up to 6TB Optane RAM Related Tags Intel Intel 10C/20T Intel Skylake-X Intel Core i9 Core i9 Intel Core i9-7900X AMD Subscribe to our Newsletter Latest News Posts Monster Hunter XX coming to Nintendo Switch Destiny 2 uses hybrid servers, P2P and peer-to-client Dreamcast's Seaman game is getting a sequel Only 37% of active PS4 users bought PS Plus Capcom wants to resurrect old IPsView More News Posts Forum Activity Free Paypal Money Adder Online Tool Legit 2017 Prey benchmarked: Radeon RX 580 vs. GeForce GTX 1060 ADATA AI910 Lightning Card Reader Plus Review PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Benchmarked: CPU & GPU War NIC not working after BIOS corruption (ASUS X202E)View More Forum Posts Press Releases Qualcomm fuels IoT growth by currently delivering more than 1 million chips a day into a wide range of connected applications Team Group announces theme for COMPUTEX 2017 showcase: go beyond the limit and reach for the top SAPPHIRE announces PULSE Radeon RX 560 graphics card ELITEGROUP computer to stand out at Computex for its smart campus deployment, robotic technology, education laptops, tablets, mini PC, and motherboards ADATA Shares a Symphony of Technology at Computex 2017View More Press Releases Home Sitemap Advertising Awards About Contact Price Search RSS FEEDS PRIVACY POLICY & AD CHOICES © 1999-2017 Tweak Town Pty Ltd.

Valentina Palladino - May 25, 2017 12:30 pm UTC reader comments 31 Share this story Video shot/edited by Jennifer Hahn. Samsung revamped one of its 2016 hybrids while simultaneously creating a challenger to Microsoft's Surface family. Last year's Galaxy TabPro S was a thin-and-light tablet powered by a Skylake Core M processor and featuring an OLED display. While stunning, the OLED display raised questions about the longevity of the device, and the tablet itself was lacking in connectivity options. The new Galaxy Book tries to fix some of that while keeping the good parts intact: it's a slim Windows tablet, accompanied by a folio keyboard case and S Pen stylus, that's vying to replace your regular laptop by enticing you with Ultrabook-grade internals. The Galaxy Book comes in 10- and 12-inch models, but both are very different, not just in their screen size, but in internal quality as well. While Samsung managed to right some of the wrongs of the TabPro S, it's hard to make a case for the Galaxy Book replacing your everyday work device. Look and feel As the next iteration of the TabPro S, the Galaxy Book's kicker is its 12-inch, 2160×1400 Super AMOLED display. It produces highly saturated colors and rich blacks that make photo and video viewing (or editing) a vibrant experience. But since it is an OLED panel, I ran into the same issues that Ars' Peter Bright did while reviewing the TabPro S: the pixels in OLED panels degrade over time. Areas of the screen that are brightly lit grow dimmer more quickly than areas of the screen that stay dark. This degradation is much faster and more uneven than the gradual backlight dimming of LCD screens. Samsung tries to slow that process as much as possible with the use of screensavers and screen-dimming software. You can turn off the screensaver completely, but, just like with the TabPro S, there's no straightforward way to stop the display from dimming after about 10 minutes of inactivity. Specs at a glance: Samsung Galaxy Book Base As reviewed Screen 10-inch TFT 1920×1280 12-inch 2160×1440 Super AMOLED OS Windows 10 Home CPU Intel 7th generation Core m-7Y30 (dual core 1GHz, 2.6GHz Turbo) Intel 7th generation Core i5-7200U (dual core 2.5GHz, 3.1GHz Turbo) RAM 4GB DDR3 8GB DDR3 GPU Intel HD Graphics 615 Intel HD Graphics 620 SSD 64GB eMMC 256GB SSD Networking 802.11ac/a/b/g/n with 2x2 MIMO antennas, Bluetooth 4.1 Ports 1 USB Type-C, microSD card slot 2 USB Type-C, microSD card slot Cameras Front: 5MP Rear: 13MP autofocus Front: 5MP Size 261.2x179.1x8.9 mm (10.28× 7.05×0.35 inches) 291.3×199.8×7.4mm (11.45× 7.85×0.29 inches) Weight 648 grams (1.4 pounds) 754 grams (1.6 pounds) Battery 30.4W 39.04W Price $629 $1,329.99 Other features GPS, GLONASS, S Pen, Air Command, Samsung Flow, and Notes Samsung included this feature for good reason: similar to the Tab Pro S, screen-dimming will help reduce the effects of the pixel degradation. Since the Galaxy Book is positioned as a productivity two-in-one, users will be tapping, typing, and writing with the device, presumably for hours on end. Screen dimming will likely increase the longevity of the device overall, even if it was an annoying obstacle during our testing. The bezels surrounding the display are a bit wide (the biggest measuring about .75-inches), but the bezel that sits at the top of the tablet in laptop mode holds the front-facing 5MP camera. Mirroring its placement on the back of the tablet is the 13MP rear camera. This isn't complemented by a cutout on the keyboard cast like the TabPro S's rear camera had. Instead, the plastic flap covering the camera is narrower than the other two sections of the case's back, so you can simply fold it down to reveal the camera and not much else. Still, having the cutout is more convenient because you don't have an extra step to complete before taking a photo. Further ReadingSamsung Galaxy TabPro S review: A taste of a future I’m not ready for Being a tablet, the Galaxy Book doesn't have many ports on its edges. Both of the short sides sport speaker grills, the right side holds the two USB Type-C ports and a headphone jack, and the opposite side holds a microSD card slot. The power and volume buttons are at the top edge of the device for easy access when in laptop mode. I appreciate that Samsung added an additional USB Type-C port since the TabPro S only had one, and I really appreciate that you can charge the device through either of those ports. That being said, I would have been elated if some adaptors like USB Type-C to Type A were included in the box as well. Otherwise, the Galaxy Book is your typical metal slab-like tablet. Our review model, the 12-inch Galaxy Book, is better positioned for work and serious productivity, not only thanks to its size but also its internals. Comparatively, the 10-inch device requires compromising at every corner: it has a 10-inch TFT 1920×1080 display, Core m3 processor, 4GB of RAM, either 64 or 128GB of storage (but it does have the microSD card slot, so you can expand that to 256GB), no rear-facing camera, and no LTE option. Both the 10- and 12-inch models conveniently have onboard GPS and GLONASS, so you're not forced into the LTE option if you want a GPS on the tablet. The 10-inch Galaxy Book starts at $629, which is much lower than the $1,129 starting price of the 12-inch model (our model comes in at $1,329). Samsung's Galaxy Book with keyboard cover and S Pen.

Unlike the TabPro S, which had two viewing angles using the back magnetic flap of the case, the Galaxy Book has four. I typically kept mine on the second-highest angle, as that and the highest position are best for basic work like Web browsing and typing. I didn't use the second-lowest position much at all, but it's likely better for using the S Pen instead of the trackpad to navigate. I love taking notes, so the S Pen mostly came in handy with the Galaxy Book in tablet mode. Artists may also like the lowest mode that leans the tablet back so much that it's nearly flat, using only the smallest flap (the one covering the rear camera) for support. The absence of a kickstand makes the Galaxy Book look and feel much more like a tablet than a two-in-one. The keyboard case provides a fairly stable stand for the slab, even while working with the device on your lap. However, it's not nearly as secure as a device with a kickstand would be, like HP's updated Spectre x2 or the newly announced Surface Pro devices. The Galaxy Book isn't as stable as a regular laptop, either. You need stability for any two-in-one to succeed on a fundamental level, and devices with built-in kickstands (particularly those you can adjust to sit at different viewing angles) are arguably better suited for stability in unstable environments. The flap of the keyboard case sticks nicely to the back of the Galaxy Book, but just fiddling with it to adjust the viewing angle requires attention to make sure it's completely secure at the angle you want. If you misalign the magnets, the tablet will fall backward. Further ReadingSamsung’s Chromebook Pro gives me hope in Chrome OS—thanks to Android’s help The island-layout, full-sized keyboard is one of the better tablet keyboards I've used. There's decent travel between the keys, and Samsung didn't misplace or leave out any crucial keys. The Backspace key is slightly smaller than normal, but not small enough to impact my typing speed or cause many mistakes. I managed many hours of typing on this device with no fatigue or discomfort. The trackpad is just as pleasant to use with its smooth-to-the-touch feel and gesture support. It's a Precision Touchpad, supporting the full range of built-in Windows touch gestures. The included S Pen is similar to what's included in Samsung's Chromebook Pro. However, the Galaxy Book doesn't have a built-in slot to keep the pen close. Instead, the box includes an adhesive sleeve you can attach to an indentation on the keyboard case. The sleeve places the pen at the left side of the keyboard at all times. The pen's 0.7mm tip is precise and easy to use to write, sketch, or highlight, and neither the S Pen nor keyboard require charging, so you never have to worry about battery life with either of these accessories. The pen's latency was barely noticeable, but it wasn't exactly the same as the elevated writing experience found on the Chromebook Pro. One of my favorite features of the Tab S3 is Samsung's Air Command, and that's also ready to go on the Galaxy Book. With the pen tip close to the display, you can bring up the Air Command menu by pressing the singular side button on the S Pen. By default, five apps pop up, letting you quickly grab a screenshot, write notes, select parts of the screen, and more. I will say that the side button is awkwardly placed, at least for me and how I hold a pen naturally. While taking notes and gripping the pen normally, I often accidentally clicked the side button Air Command makes using the S Pen much easier in situations where you wouldn't necessarily think to use a stylus. There are plenty of shortcuts for Windows users already, but making some important ones (like taking a scribble-ready screenshot) readily accessible in a pen-only menu encourages users to pick up the S Pen more often. I only wish you could customize the app shortcuts in Air Command like you can on the Tab S3 Android tablet. On this Windows device, you have to make do with just the five apps programmed into Air Command: create note, view all notes, smart select, screen write, and show window. Software Further ReadingGalaxy Tab S3 review: The high price of a well-rounded Android tablet Samsung doesn't add much bloatware to the Galaxy Book, but the company hopes users will take advantage of Samsung Flow. Flow is Samsung's software for sharing information, including notifications, photos, and documents, between different Samsung devices that are connected via Bluetooth. If you have a Samsung smartphone, you can unlock the Galaxy Book by using your fingerprint on the smartphone's reader. You can also share documents easily between the two devices and receive smartphone notifications on the two-in-one. Flow certainly makes life easier for those with many Samsung devices. Flow also provides the only biometric security features for the Galaxy Book. The Book doesn't have an IR camera or an onboard fingerprint sensor, so the only way you'll get around using a password or PIN will be by using your fingerprint to unlock Flow on a Galaxy smartphone. I'm glad there's some form of biometric security available for the Galaxy Book, but I'm disappointed at the lack of IR camera—numerous times, I flipped open the Galaxy Book from its keyboard case and expected the camera to recognize my face and unlock my device. Performance Our review model of the Galaxy Book is powered by a dual-core Core i5-7200U processor, Intel HD 620 graphics, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of onboard storage. I like that Samsung added an 8GB of RAM option—the 4GB on the TabPro S just wasn't enough—but you'll still pay premium for it. The Galaxy Book performed just as well as similar Kaby Lake systems in all of our benchmark tests, and it performed a little better than Skylake devices like Microsoft's Surface Pro 4. However, it did get noticeably warm with consistent use.   Battery life We had to account for the Galaxy Book's screen-dimming feature before running our battery tests by running an app that moves the cursor periodically to simulate activity and prevent the screen from dimming. Samsung estimates the Galaxy Book will last around 11 hours on a single charge, but our tests didn't even get close to that. The Galaxy Book lasted an average of 411 minutes on our default battery test, or just under seven hours. Many two-in-ones we've tested last anywhere between 600 to 900 minutes on this test, but the Galaxy Book performed most like Apple's 9.7-inch iPad Pro (which still lasted over an hour more on the same test). The Galaxy Book did slightly better on our graphics test, lasting 241 minutes, or about four hours. It placed ahead of devices like the Dell XPS 15, the HP Spectre 13, and the 13-inch MacBook Pro with TouchBar. Can’t replace, but could be a premium complement Samsung succeeded in updating the TabPro S with the Galaxy Book. Adding 4GB of RAM, an extra USB Type-C port, and an LTE option bring the slab into the modern age, at the very least. The keyboard cover and S Pen are particularly good because they're included (similar accessories are extra when you buy a Surface Pro). The typing experience is much better than other hybrid keyboards, and the S Pen is quite useful when paired with Samsung's Air Command software. Our model of the Galaxy Book was a capable machine that performed just as well as other devices with U-series processors, two-in-ones or not. But just because the Galaxy Book is a better TabPro S doesn't mean it's an ideal hybrid. I have yet to try a slab-folio keyboard combo that I would feel comfortable replacing my laptop with, and the Galaxy Book doesn't change that. While it is decently stable on your lap, its overall design simply isn't suited for my lifestyle as a primary PC. This type of device is best suited for hyper-mobile users—as in those who are constantly running around and need a lightweight device that packs plenty of power. Those users also value the laptop experience and the tablet experience equally. I need a laptop more than a tablet most of the time, so the Galaxy Book won't replace my current PC any time soon. I also take issue with the OLED display and the price. The issues we had with the TabPro S concerning its OLED display haven't been quelled with the Galaxy Book, but I didn't expect them to be. Samsung uses OLED panels in many of its devices, and we'll probably have to make do with screensavers and screen dimming on its tablets for the foreseeable future—or at least until the longevity of OLED panels is as wonderful as the panels themselves. In terms of price, you'll spend at least $1,329 for a Galaxy Book with this much power. But you still sacrifice a lot despite the high price tag, particularly with the lack of any Windows Hello support and the disappointing battery life. I'd hold off on the Galaxy Book for now and wait to see how new, similar devices perform, including the updated HP Spectre x2, which starts at $999, and the new line of updated Surface Pros, which start at $799. The Good Included keyboard case and S Pen. 8GB of RAM. Two USB Type C ports. GPS and GLONASS on both LTE and non-LTE models. Good performance. The Bad Screen-dimming software is annoying. No onboard biometrics, so no Windows Hello options. Gets warm with use. The Ugly Lackluster battery life.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Intel’s Share of $53.98 Billion, 34.7% CAGR Growth – New Emerging Industry Growth, Driving New Horizons in the Affective Computing Market: Analysis Points to Substantial Shifts Ahead, Strategic Positioning to Benefit SINGAPORE / ACCESSWIRE / May 25, 2017 / In an independent research report released early this morning, Capital Review released its latest findings and analysis on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), including updated analyst target prices, detailed fundamental discussion, financial review and analysis, consensus estimates, share supply assessment, and this year’s upcoming fiscal period upside projections. Complimentary Access: INTC RESEARCH REPORT Full copy of the recently published report is available to readers at the link below. INTC DOWNLOAD: http://www.capital-review.com/register/?so=INTC (You may have to copy and paste the link into your browser and hit the [ENTER] key) The new research report from Capital Review, available for free download at the link above, examines Intel on a fundamental level and outlines the overall demand for their products and services in addition to an in-depth review of the business strategy, management discussion, and overall direction going forward. Several excerpts from the recently released report are available to today’s readers below. According to new research obtained by Capital Review, the global affective computing market will exhibit a compounded annual growth rate of 34.7% from 2016 through 2021. This latest projection would result in a total market size of $53.98 billion by 2021 and could signal significant shifts ahead for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC). Affective computing, perhaps more accurately described as the process of ‚teaching computers to be human’, is all about creating technology that can observe, understand, think, and act with simulated human emotion. The industry involves expertise from many fields including computer science, psychology, and cognitive science. The affective computing industry is responsible for some of the most cutting edge technology available today, including facial recognition and early detection of psychological disorders. Substantial new levels of efficiency can be recognized by careful and correct implementation of the technologies sets within affective computing, creating significant new value and new opportunity for companies positioned to participate in the emerging $53.98 billion industry. Behind the scenes of the affective computing industry is the actual hardware which allows AI, touch screens, and virtual reality to be possible. Moore’s Law, which observes the rate of technological advancements as a whole, was first observed by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel. The observation was that transistors in a dense integrated circuit would double roughly every two years, a prediction that proved accurate for many decades. Another of Intel’s executives, David House, had predicted chip performance would increase even faster due to the combination of not just more transistors on each circuit, but also the design of the transistors themselves being faster as well. By his estimate, chip performance would increase every 18 months. Moore’s Law and Mr. House’s contribution plays a large part in the affective computing industry, being able to accurately predict a time frame on when certain technologies may be possible. This prediction model provides an accurate guideline for the planning, preparation, and final integration of new technologies into both existing systems and upcoming product launches. Intel develops many products based on what their customers need, with a focus on improving people’s everyday lives and transforming technologies to deliver an unparalleled user experience. As the affective computing industry is projected to increase, so should the need for the processing to be able to optimize these products. As a result, greater memory capacity and increased storage speed would be required, which fits hand in hand with Intel’s continual advancements in these areas to accommodate data centers and Internet of Things. The Client Computing Group (CCG), Intel’s largest operating segment, was responsible for 55.41% of total net revenue in fiscal year 2016. This segment is the combination of the previous two segments, PCCG (PC Client Group), and MCG (Mobile and Communications Group). CCG now encompasses desktops, tablets, phones, wired connectivity products, 2-in-1 systems, and more. A frontrunner of Intel’s affective computing technology is its RealSense platform to enable human-computer interaction. The technology could enable a new generation of easy to use, quantum leap advancements in the way the average user interacts with their computing device. At the Consumer Electronics Show, Intel dedicated a considerable amount to time to demonstrating the capability and future potential of RealSense, a move that may hint at the future potential and importance of this emerging technology. In addition, Capital Review obtained a research report on the affective computing industry published by Markets and Markets, which outlined that human and machine interaction technologies are some major factors contributing to the growth of the affective computing market. The demand for the newest and latest hardware technologies are ever increasing as these new technologies are including enhanced facial feature extraction software, greatly improved touch displays, and refined, improved microphones and speakers. It was estimated North America would hold the largest market share in affective computing in 2016 with some notable enterprises establishing powerful affective computing technologies and technological advancements. The Asian-Pacific region (APAC) is to show some potentially significant growth over the coming years with the rise of technological adoption, potentially transcending beyond North America. Driving the growth in the APAC region includes utilizing current and future technologies and increased investments in smart city technology. The segment most expected to experience the highest growth rate is facial feature extraction software on the basis of its growing demand in the smart phone and authenticating devices sector.

The industry involves expertise from many fields including computer science, psychology, and cognitive science. The affective computing industry is responsible for some of the most cutting edge technology available today, including facial recognition and early detection of psychological disorders. Substantial new levels of efficiency can be recognized by careful and correct implementation of the technologies sets within affective computing, creating significant new value and new opportunity for companies positioned to participate in the emerging $53.98 billion industry. Behind the scenes of the affective computing industry is the actual hardware which allows AI, touch screens, and virtual reality to be possible. Moore’s Law, which observes the rate of technological advancements as a whole, was first observed by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel. The observation was that transistors in a dense integrated circuit would double roughly every two years, a prediction that proved accurate for many decades. Another of Intel’s executives, David House, had predicted chip performance would increase even faster due to the combination of not just more transistors on each circuit, but also the design of the transistors themselves being faster as well. By his estimate, chip performance would increase every 18 months. Moore’s Law and Mr. House’s contribution plays a large part in the affective computing industry, being able to accurately predict a time frame on when certain technologies may be possible. This prediction model provides an accurate guideline for the planning, preparation, and final integration of new technologies into both existing systems and upcoming product launches. As a leader in the industry, Microsoft defines itself as a market software, services, and hardware devices company and looks to enhance value in people’s everyday lives. The company has branched off into many different products and is no longer known as just an operating system for the personal computer. Microsoft is constantly adding to its portfolio of products that seek to develop advanced technologies and empower people around the globe both commercially and individually. One of the major factors that could impact revenues is emerging within the affective computing space, namely new authentication and authorization technologies that enable a more natural and intuitive interaction between human and computer. The rapid increase of new computer devices that emphasize touch and mobility functionality could shift Microsoft’s innovation focus. As a core strategy however the company is likely to continue development of its core performing products, adding affective computing where the strategic aim and consumer benefit can be clearly forecast. There is significant opportunity for Microsoft to leverage its substantial expertise in the industry to create more commercialized business products, leading to new streams of revenue and potential add-on sales with existing customers. A main area of focus for Microsoft over the long term is developing increasingly natural ways to incorporate touch, gesture, and speech into its products to enhance usability. Plans to continue to incorporate the application of machine learning for a more intuitive product, one that acts on the user’s behalf and interpret their needs rather than relying upon traditional and specific input, is seen by Microsoft as an emerging competitive advantage. The company has already started to make a shift into this industry with its entertainment and gaming platform Xbox and Kinect Sensor. Microsoft is utilizing expertise and innovation in its areas of strength to keep most of its development, research, and production within its ecosystem of partners. With Microsoft’s current depth of devices and services, it is not hard to imagine Microsoft becoming the leader in this industry through its large current customer base, brand recognition, and the efforts to foster further innovation. In addition, Capital Review obtained a research report on the affective computing industry published by Markets and Markets, which outlined that human and machine interaction technologies are some major factors contributing to the growth of the affective computing market. The demand for the newest and latest hardware technologies are ever increasing as these new technologies are including enhanced facial feature extraction software, greatly improved touch displays, and refined, improved microphones and speakers. It was estimated North America would hold the largest market share in affective computing in 2016 with some notable enterprises establishing powerful affective computing technologies and technological advancements. The Asian-Pacific region (APAC) is to show some potentially significant growth over the coming years with the rise of technological adoption, potentially transcending beyond North America. Driving the growth in the APAC region includes utilizing current and future technologies and increased investments in smart city technology. The segment most expected to experience the highest growth rate is facial feature extraction software on the basis of its growing demand in the smart phone and authenticating devices sector.

Complimentary Access: FB RESEARCH REPORT Full copy of the recently published report is available to readers at the link below. FB DOWNLOAD: http://www.capital-review.com/register/?so=FB (You may have to copy and paste the link into your browser and hit the [ENTER] key) The new research report from Capital Review, available for free download at the link above, examines Facebook on a fundamental level and outlines the overall demand for their products and services in addition to an in-depth review of the business strategy, management discussion, and overall direction going forward. Several excerpts from the recently released report are available to today’s readers below. According to new research obtained by Capital Review, the global affective computing market will exhibit a compounded annual growth rate of 34.7% from 2016 through 2021. This latest projection would result in a total market size of $53.98 billion by 2021 and could signal significant shifts ahead for Facebook, Inc (NASDAQ: FB). Affective computing, perhaps more accurately described as the process of ‘teaching computers to be human’, is all about creating technology that can observe, understand, think, and act with simulated human emotion. The industry involves expertise from many fields including computer science, psychology, and cognitive science. The affective computing industry is responsible for some of the most cutting edge technology available today, including facial recognition and early detection of psychological disorders.

This prediction model provides an accurate guideline for the planning, preparation, and final integration of new technologies into both existing systems and upcoming product launches. As a potential leader in this emerging space, Facebook is focused on building helpful and engaging applications that allow people to share and connect through a variety of products, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Oculus. Engagement and relevance are key components to Facebook’s business strategy as substantially all revenue is from selling advertising placements. As a result, Facebook has invested in long-term initiatives such as artificial intelligence research and other projects influenced heavily by affective computing. Facebook is led by Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook’s founder) with continuing input from Peter Thiel (Paypal co-founder), Reed Hastings (Netflix co-founder), Marc Andreessen (super angel), Sheryl Sandberg (ex-Google), and Jan Koum (WhatsApp co-founder). The current road map of the Facebook board is to further invest in engagement of existing user bases of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp and develop long-term initiatives such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Careful attention is being paid to ensuring top engineering talent recruitment, expansion of facilities, new research and development, as well as new marketing efforts are kept at the forefront of Facebook’s priorities. As of December 2016, daily active users for Facebook were 1.23 billion on average, signifying an increase of 18% year-over-year, while monthly active users saw similar improvement at 17% year-over-year growth to 1.86 billion. Recent quarterly numbers reflected near identical improvements, pegging 18% year-over-year growth for daily active users as of March 2017 and 17% year-over-year growth for monthly active users. This consistent and sustained increase of engagement, combined with initiatives by Facebook management to grow the number of marketers while simultaneously increasing the effectiveness of ads, resulted in a year-over-year increase of 54% in revenues to $27.64 billion in December 2016 and a year-over-year increase of 49% for the first quarter, up to $8.03 billion for the quarter. These results are achievable due to Facebook’s focus on making an engaging user platform across all of its products and adapting its ad offerings to the behaviors of its users. Naturally, Facebook is developing and participating in the significant benefits the affective computing industry is able to bring forward. In addition, Capital Review obtained a research report on the affective computing industry published by Markets and Markets, which outlined that human and machine interaction technologies are some major factors contributing to the growth of the affective computing market.

This prediction model provides an accurate guideline for the planning, preparation, and final integration of new technologies into both existing systems and upcoming product launches. Google, Alphabet’s largest business, prides itself on being unconventional. With ever-continuing growth in technological evolution, Google continues to look towards the future. The belief is, companies that remain comfortable are the ones that seem to become irrelevant on a long enough time horizon. These companies slowly begin to lose market share over time due to a misguided strategy of only working on minor tweaks and bug fixes, staying away from any risk that may rock the boat even slightly. Unfortunately, in the sea of the competitive markets, sometimes you are going to encounter competitive winds and the waves of change. A lack of innovation in the technology space is akin to a ship’s captain focused on preventing sway with the waves instead of steering clear of the iceberg ahead. The philosophy of Google and other great innovators is that real progress happens when and where there is risk. Google’s acquisition of YouTube and Android, as well as the creation of Google Chrome were bold, but necessary moves. These acquisitions, under visionary management, grew into mature platforms that resulted in the successful defense of Google’s dominate market position in search. Google’s focus on machine learning over the past decade has allowed the company’s products to become faster, smarter, and more reliable. Voice integration, web page translation, recommendations, and pattern recognition is the result of years of dedicated research in artificial intelligence. As research continues and technologies further develop, Google has had the ability to recognize facial patterns, suggest names or search for certain people on Google Photos, blur out faces on Google Street View, or determine certain characteristics of the face that suggests one is wearing a beard, glasses, or other accessories. This artificial intelligence technology goes well beyond facial recognition however, and is now expanding into self-driving cars with precise localization, path planning, and obstacle detection. As a result, Google is positioning itself as a leader within the emerging affective computing industry.

On May 23, Intel-backed MinnowBoard.org and ADI Engineering began shipping the first quad-core MinnowBoard, selling for $190. The “MinnowBoard Turbo quad-core,” which was originally billed as the MinnowBoard Turbot Quad when it went on pre-sale in Sept. 2017, features the quad-core, 1.91GHz Intel Atom E3845 of the 22nm Bay Trail generation. Intel’s MinnowBoard Turbot Quad (left) compared to Aaeon’s Up Squared (click images to enlarge) The very next day, Aaeon’s UP community announced it had begun shipping to Kickstarter backers its new UP Squared follow-on to its Up board. The UP Squared offers the latest Intel “Apollo Lake” chips including a quad-core Pentium N4200 version that sold to backers for $185 (see farther below). Both SBCs are now available for new pre-orders, with shipments due in June or July. The competing Udoo X86 board began shipping in March, and is also available for pre-order (see below).   Intel MinnowBoard Turbot Quad The MinnowBoard Turbot Quad has the same 99 x 74mm footprint and an almost identical layout as the earlier MinnowBoard Turbot Dual. The Dual runs on a dual-core, 1.46GHz E3826 from the same Bay Trail generation, and sells for $146. Aside from the faster processor, the only major difference on the Quad is the addition of a heatsink and fan, and an upgrade from a Realtek GbE controller to an Intel I210. The MinnowBoard Turbot Quad ships with 2GB DDR3L-1067 RAM, and offers microSD and SATA storage. There are USB 3.0 and 2.0 host ports, as well as a micro-HDMI port and an optional case. Like other MinnowBoards, the 5V board offers 26-pin low-speed and 60-pin high speed expansion connectors compatible with previous “Lure” expansion boards. MinnowBoard Turbot case, front (left) and rear views (click images to enlarge) The Turbo Quad is released under a Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 license, and offers downloads for Debian/GUN Linux, Ubuntu, Yocto Project, Windows 8.1 and 10, Android 4.4, and Android Things (the new version of Brillo). For full specs, see our earlier coverage, as well as the Netgate shopping page linked to at the end of the story. The Turbo Quad’s five-month delay from its original ship date is not unusual for x86 hacker SBCs. While many ARM board vendors spin off a half dozen different open-spec hacker SBCs every year, the much smaller new segment of x86 hacker boards typically struggle to get a board out every one or two years, and they are often delayed by months if not multiple quarters. This may be due in part to the typically more complex feature set and need to keep the prices down despite the more expensive processors. Udoo X86 The MinnowBoard Turbo Quad is most directly comparable with Seco’s (Udoo.org’s) faster, quad-core Intel Braswell based Udoo X86 board, which was promised to ship to Kickstarter backers in November, but only began shipping in March. Like the Turbo Quad, the Udoo X86 is fully open source. Its price has risen from the $89 provided to KS buyers to $125, but that still beats the quad-core MinnowBoard and UP Squared. MinnowBoard Turbot Dual-E There’s still no word about whether the more feature rich MinnowBoard Turbot Dual-E, which was announced six weeks earlier than the Quad, will ever see the light of day. The Dual-E, which is larger than the Dual or Quad models at 103 x 99mm, was to offer both dual- and quad-core Bay Trail options. The Dual-E name came from the addition of a second GbE port. The board also added an M.2 and micro-SIM interfaces for WiFi, LTE, or SSDs.   Aaeon Up Squared (UP2) Aaeon’s $89 to $149 UP board, which runs on a quad-core “Cherry Trail” Intel Atom x5-Z8350, did better on timing, and the newly shipping UP Squared board was only a month late. The board, which is billed as the fastest community-backed x86 SBC in the world, is now on pre-sale starting at $145 for the dual-core model and $219 for the quad-core, with shipments promised in July. Up Squared (left) and Up Core (click images to enlarge) The 90 x 86mm Up Squared offers 4K video encode and decode, dual GbE ports, dual HDMI video outputs, a SATA interface, M.2 support, and mini-PCIe expansion. You also get eDP, dual MIPI-CSI, 3x USB host ports, and both a 60-pin GPIO and a 40-pin interface tied to an Altera Max 10 FPGA. OS support includes Linux (Ubuntu, Ubilinux, Yocto), Android Marshmallow, and Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. Comprehensive specs are in our Up Squared coverage. Unlike the MinnowBoard and the Udoo X86, the UP boards do not ship with full schematics. The UP community does, however, post extensive documentation and software downloads, and offer community support. Next “up” for Aaeon’s UP community is the UP Core, a smaller, 66 x 56.5mm version of the original UP board. Back in March, it was said to be coming soon to Kickstarter starting at $69, but it has yet to show.   Further information The MinnowBoard Turbot Quad board is available for $189.95 at Netgate, with shipments due in June.

PC and motherboard manufacturers as such will not need to add and purchase additional components.  Royalty free or not, it however will likely drive upwards CPU prices. Thunderbolt has never seen a great deal of market penetration, but that may be about to change with Intel natively integrating Thunderbolt 3 into future CPU models and making the protocol royalty-free to chipmakers in 2018. Thunderbolt 3 comes offers transfer speeds of 40Gbps, which roughly works out to a 4K movie in 30 seconds. It can power devices, and connect to 4K peripherals. But Thunderbolt’s had six years to go mainstream, a combination of high cost and low availability have hampered its success. As posted on the Intel website: Intel’s vision for Thunderbolt was not just to make a faster computer port, but a simpler and more versatile port available to everyone. We envision a future where high-performance single-cable docks, stunning photos and 4K video, lifelike VR, and faster-than-ever storage are commonplace. A world where one USB-C connector does it all – today, and for many years to come. With this vision in mind, Intel is announcing that it plans to drive large-scale mainstream adoption of Thunderbolt by integrating Thunderbolt 3 into future Intel CPUs and by releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification to the industry next year. With Thunderbolt 3 integrated into the CPU, computer makers can build thinner and lighter systems with only Thunderbolt 3 ports. For the first time, all the ports on a computer can be the same – any port can charge the system and connect to Thunderbolt devices, every display and billions of USB devices.  Designs based on Intel’s integrated Thunderbolt 3 solution require less board space and reduce power by removing the discrete component needed for existing systems with Thunderbolt 3. In addition to Intel’s Thunderbolt silicon, next year Intel plans to make the Thunderbolt protocol specification available to the industry under a nonexclusive, royalty-free license. Releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification in this manner is expected to greatly increase Thunderbolt adoption by encouraging third-party chip makers to build Thunderbolt-compatible chips. We expect industry chip development to accelerate a wide range of new devices and user experiences. “Apple and Intel have collaborated on Thunderbolt from the beginning, and as the industry leader in its adoption, we applaud Intel’s efforts to integrate Thunderbolt technology into its CPUs and open it up to the rest of the industry,” said Dan Riccio, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. Microsoft has enhanced Thunderbolt 3 device plug-and-play support in the now available Windows 10 Creators Update. Intel and Microsoft plan to continue to work together to enhance the experience in future versions of the Windows operating system. “Microsoft and Intel are working together to enable Thunderbolt 3 on Windows PCs to deliver on the ‘if it fits, it works’ potential of USB-C,” said Roanne Sones, general manager, Strategy and Ecosystem for Windows and Devices at Microsoft. “The Windows 10 Creators Update enhanced plug-and-play support for Thunderbolt 3 devices, with additional enhancements planned for future OS releases.” In addition to support from Apple and Microsoft, Thunderbolt 3 has already gained significant adoption with more than 120 PC designs on systems with 7th Generation Intel® Core™ processors, the latest MacBook Pros and dozens of peripherals – expected to ramp to nearly 150 by the end of 2017. Well on our way to achieving our vision, let’s explore a few scenarios where Thunderbolt 3 is changing the PC experience and creating new expectations for what’s possible. Mobile platforms continue to get thinner, lighter and more powerful. The challenge? A simple and universal way to unleash the full performance of these mobile devices when docked. Today, business and home users are forced to choose between performance and mobility. Thunderbolt 3 docks enable mobility without compromise. Some people are more productive with a large high-resolution monitor, and others with multiple monitors. Only Thunderbolt 3 docks support both, while simultaneously transferring large files and charging the notebook. Other people want a simple way to play and create, and Thunderbolt 3 docks can connect to any compatible peripheral or display, avoiding confusion. The power Thunderbolt 3 brings to docking is speed and simplicity. Some of these products are available now for less than $200. The amount of data the average person creates, uses and saves these days is exploding. For example, taking 1,000 high-resolution photos can quickly create over 20GB of data. Likewise, shooting an hour of 4K video from a drone can generate a jaw-dropping 1.5TB of data. It could take hours to transfer this data to storage via conventional methods. In order to speed up data transfer, storage makers are shifting from slower Serial ATA (SATA) drives to non-volatile memory (NVMe) SSDs for higher speed and lower latency storage solutions. For any media lover or YouTuber generating large amounts of data, there is often a great need for external storage that is as fast as the internal SSD to expand capacity. Since only Thunderbolt can connect NVMe SSDs to your PC, Thunderbolt 3 storage fulfills this need and enables people to save time with data transfers that happen in a snap. A full 4K movie can be transferred in less than 30 seconds. Gaming desktops will continue to offer best-in-class performance for the ultimate gaming experience. And gamers who want to combine mobility and performance gaming in one device can use Thunderbolt 3 to do so. With Thunderbolt 3, gamers can travel, work or enjoy long hours at a coffee shop with a thin and light notebook. Then, when it’s time for epic gaming, the notebook can be paired with a Thunderbolt 3 external graphics box to get a GPU boost for higher resolution and settings experience.

It will certainly add some additional transistors to Intel cpus looking ahead, however, and Thunderbolt has had years to achieve widespread adoption and so far has gathered little interest--being custom-cable-dependent has a lot to do with it, imo. Probably looking at another Firewire story--although I suspect Firewire even though it failed ultimately garnered a far wider adoption than has Thunderbolt thus far--and for the same reason--the Tbolt cables, again. hpascoa Newbie Posts: 22 Joined: 2017-01-06 #5435499 Posted on: 05/24/2017 10:03 PM Quote: next year Intel plans to make the Thunderbolt protocol specification available to the industry under a nonexclusive, royalty-free license. That's excellent news. I really do like the idea behind TB, it's a shame Intel was never willing to let 3rd parties in on the game. Hopefully this will also mean that we will eventually see TB available on AMD systems. Quote: IMO, not very interesting as the expensive/complex part of Thunderbolt is in the cables The reason why the cables are expensive is because the technology hasn't become mainstream yet. It's like HDMI back in the day when it first came out and the cables cost a fortune. Once production reaches critical mass, then prices will come down. They could have driven up adoption of TB3 back in 2015, if they had built it into the 100 series chipset when they released Skylake, instead of relegating it into the separate (and expensive) Alpine Ridge controller. Motherboard manufacturers didn't want to drive up prices, or lower their margins, on their mainstream boards by including Alpine Ridge, so the feature was available only on some high-end motherboards (and MacBooks), and as such never reached the mainstream. typhon6657 Newbie Posts: 38 Joined: 2013-01-06 #5435508 Posted on: 05/24/2017 10:24 PM Sweet cant wait for that shizzel to drizzel on my comzzel FeDaYin Newbie Posts: 34 Joined: 2006-07-20 #5435513 Posted on: 05/24/2017 10:43 PM USB 3.1 gen2 in 2020 ? terremonde Newbie Posts: 17 Joined: 2013-12-25 #5435518 Posted on: 05/24/2017 11:09 PM as a fanboy.

By Gordon Mah Ung Executive Editor, PCWorld | May 25, 2017 3:00 AM PT Credit: Gordon Mah Ung More like this How Intel turned Thunderbolt from a failure into a success Thunderbolt vs. SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Intel Thunderbolt Bolts Through Data Transfers Video Surface Pro 4 vs. Surface Book: How to decide Intel's dream of making one cable to rule them all took a huge step forward this week. On Wednesday, Intel announced it will integrate Thunderbolt 3 into future CPUs. More importantly, the company said it would open up the long-secret protocol to the world, royalty-free. The company's explanation for the change is practically utopian. "Intel's vision for Thunderbolt was not just to make a faster computer port, but a simpler and more versatile port available to everyone," wrote Chris Walker, Intel's vice president for Client Computing, in a blog post. Walker predicted a groundswell of Thunderbolt products. "We envision a future where high-performance single-cable docks, stunning photos and 4K video, lifelike VR, and faster-than-ever storage are commonplace. A world where one USB-C connector does it all—today, and for many years to come." Why this matters: Intel's long battle to establish a universal, high-speed port and cable for all PCs was headed for defeat until the company adopted the more successful USB protocol and USB-C port two years ago. Baking Thunderbolt into future CPUs and opening up the proprietary protocol could be all Thunderbolt 3 needs to achieve total world dominance. Gordon Mah Ung Both the MacBook Pro 15 and the XPS 15 include Thunderbolt 3 ports. A long road Thunderbolt's sudden freedom means a lot considering the standard's proprietary history. Thunderbolt was born in 2009 as Light Peak, with lofty goals and expensive optical cables. Apple, long a proponent of eliminating cable clutter, partnered with Intel to help bring it onto more affordable copper cables. Thus it evolved into Thunderbolt, with speeds up to 10Gbps. Thunderbolt 2 doubled that to 20Gbps by combining both Thunderbolt channels into one. However, unlike USB, PCIe, and other industry standards (all of which Intel helped build), Thunderbolt remained a proprietary spec. Intel always said it was to speed its adoption—by taking a unilateral approach, it could avoid the slog of design-by-committee. Unfortunately, outside of Apple's closed ecosystem, few PC vendors took Intel up on its Thunderbolt offer. Even with the copper cables, Thunderbolt remained costly. Also, because Intel owned the protocol, spec, and supply, many feared the company would just ramp up pricing once it became an accepted norm. In fact, many PC vendors have privately cited that reason for not fully embracing it. IDG Using an external Thunderbolt 3 cabinet, a 2.5-pound HP Spectre X360 13t (top) can hang with far more powerful and far heavier gaming laptops. It didn't help Thunderbolt that Intel's own USB spin-off had been evolving, moving from 5Gbps to 10Gbps with USB 3.1 (Gen 2), offering the ability to charge laptops over USB-Power Delivery, providing DisplayPort connectivity for external monitors, and introducing the reversible USB-C connector that was small enough to use in phones and tablets. At this point, Thunderbolt seemed headed for a shallow grave alongside FireWire. Intel's Hail-Mary decision to make Thunderbolt 3 a superset of USB-C in 2015 changed the game. Thunderbolt 3-equipped laptops could suddenly do everything USB-C could, and even more, with Thunderbolt's now-higher speed of 40Gbps. Thunderbolt 3-equipped PCs even have enough performance to drive external graphics competently.  Gordon Mah Ung This Akitio Node lets you add real graphics power to a compatible laptop over its Thunderbolt 3 port. What was once headed for failure has become a feature-check item on higher-end laptops. But it comes with caveats: A Thunderbolt 3 chip can cost a pricey $5 to $8, and they consume power when on. In our tests, we've sometimes found a 10-percent power penalty from having the external Thunderbolt 3 chip running. Intel's move on Wednesday truly changes everything. By moving Thunderbolt onto the CPU, Intel says it can lower the cost and the power requirements. Intel didn't actually detail which CPUs would get Thunderbolt 3 or when. If it's truly coming to all of them, it would mean every PC that uses an Intel chip would get the much sought-after feature. There's no fear of a proprietary lock now, either. "In addition to Intel’s (CPU integrated) Thunderbolt silicon," Walker wrote, "next year Intel plans to make the Thunderbolt protocol specification available to the industry under a nonexclusive, royalty-free license." Intel is ready to let Thunderbolt be fruitful and multiply: "Releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification in this manner is expected to greatly increase Thunderbolt adoption by encouraging third-party chip makers to build Thunderbolt-compatible chips," Walker said. "We expect industry chip development to accelerate a wide range of new devices and user experiences." A competitive edge Intel's motivations are hardly altruistic, of course. By including Thunderbolt 3 in a future CPU for "free," it also makes its CPUs more attractive than upcoming AMD CPUs. Even though Intel's opening up the spec, it has several years' head start on AMD before its rival could develop its own laptop CPU with Thunderbolt 3. It's also hard not to see this as an inevitable win for Thunderbolt 3 over any competing standards. The biggest loser is likely USB. Like Thunderbolt, USB was created by Intel and eventually set free. USB spec officials have always maintained that Thunderbolt 3 and USB did not compete, but the standard seems to be running out of steam. At one point, in fact, USB officials had been exploring developing optical cables. With Thunderbolt 3 already pushing 40Gbps, it's difficult to see USB going its own way. Instead, if there is a USB 4.0, it'll probably ride on top of Thunderbolt 3. The upshot: Within the next year or two, you may have a hard time finding a PC without Thunderbolt 3. For laptops, that's great news, as they'll be able to hook up ultra-fast external drives, rock single-cable docks, and add external graphics support. These are all good things.

The upcoming new top tier processors would range from 6C/12T all the way up to 12C/24T processors under the Skylake-X banner. Now a bit more information has emerged, if the sources are correct, concerning the Intel Core i9-7900X Skylake X processor. Ukrainian language site Overclockers.ua (via TechPowerUp) spotted this processor in the SiSoft Sandra online benchmarking database, see below. In the database entry SiSoft appears to mistakenly list the processor ID as an "Intel i7-7900X CPU". Sometimes software needs to be updated with new ID references or parameters to get designated names correct. Within the listing you can see other key specifications of this 10 core / 20 thread processor. For example it is said to run at a base clock of 4GHz with Turbo Boost up to 4.5GHz on tap. That kind of deviates from the previous information which outlined the spec as below: Beyond the above questions about Base and Turbo frequencies there are other clearer-cut specs from the SiSoft Sandra entry. For example it reports the 1MB of L2 cache and 13.75MB of L3 cache in line with the previous leak. A slightly worrying spec not touched upon so far concerns the processor TDP. Previously it was touted as being a 140W processor but it is reported as a 175W CPU by SiSoft Sandra. In an added bonus nugget of information we can see the motherboard supporting Intel's upcoming Skylake-X processor is a Gigabyte X299 AORUS Gaming 7. Of course the X299 designator is the Intel chipset being introduced to support these new CPUs and platform features.

Unlike its predecessors, however, Thunderbolt 3 is fortunately based on USB-C, making it possible to use the same type of connection for both, just like in the latest MacBook Pros. And if Intel has its way, Thunderbolt 3 will be in every desktop, laptop, or computing device, thanks to its generous but also aggressive campaign. While most consumers will understand USB Type C or USB-C as a type of port and plug connection, it is actually a specification that layout not just the form of the connection but also the capabilities of that connection, from transferring data, power, or even video output. In Thunderbolt 3, Intel and Apple decided to do away with the proprietary connectors used in the first two versions of the Thunderbolt specification and, instead, adopt the USB-C spec. On top of USB-C’s standard capabilities, Thunderbolt 3 adds faster data transfers, two-way communication between connected devices. As such, every Thunderbolt 3 connection is also a USB-C connection but not vice-versa. Manufacturers have avoided adding support for Thunderbolt 3 for mainly two reasons. First is the additional micro-controller hardware required to support it. The other is that Intel is the only one making such a controller and everyone else has to license those from Intel first. To help make Thunderbolt 3 a de facto standard, Intel is doing away with both obstacles. Intel’s future CPUs will have Thunderbolt 3 baked in. This means that no additional space on the motherboard or logic board has to be sacrificed to a separate controller. Intel is also turning the Thunderbolt 3 into a royalty-free, but not open, spec. This means that chip makers will be able to make Thunderbolt 3 controllers of their own, without having to pony up licensing fees. Thunderbolt 3 does have some rather convincing benefits, like exponentially increasing the bandwidth for data transfers. Gamers might also feel me empowered, as Thunderbolt 3 allows them to have skinny laptops that attach to graphics boosters when gaming. Whether or not the rest of the industry subscribes to Intel’s vision, however, is something to be seen, but that still depends on when Intel actually puts its plans into motion, which will start sometime next year.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Acer just can’t wait for Computex, announces… Acer just can’t wait for Computex, announces new laptops, 2-in-1s early By Kevin Parrish — Updated May 25, 2017 7:45 am Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Acer's new laptops bring a wider variety of hardware to affordable price points. The Nitro 5 stands out, as if offers both Intel and AMD hardware, plus an entry-level GPU. On Thursday, Acer introduced a handful of new products just days ahead of the Computex tech conference in Taipei. The company revealed four mobile devices in all: one laptop, one 2-in-1, and two Iconia-branded Android tablets. The specific hardware details weren’t made available at the time of this post’s publication, so we’ve pieced together what each product will bring to these markets through the company’s three announcements. Acer Nitro 5 This is a laptop focused on PC gaming that will be sold in multiple configurations. What’s interesting is that Acer addresses its Intel and AMD customer bases with this specific unit. The Intel configurations will pack a seventh-generation Core i5 and i7 processor that’s paired with up to a discrete Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphics chip.  Meanwhile, AMD-based configurations will include the company’s seventh-generation A-Series FX, A12, and A10 APUs along with up to a discrete Radeon RX 550 graphics chip. “The Nitro 5 features dual fans with Acer Coolboost technology, which delivers heightened fan speeds and cooling ability, and allows users to manually control the cooling process when heavy use requires an added boost,” Acer says. Here are the other details we pulled from the announcement: Display: 15.6 inches Panel type: IPS Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 System memory: Up to 32GB DDR4 @ 2,400MHz Storage: SSD maximum – 512GB (PCIe) HDD maximum – 2TB (SATA) Some configurations will include both Ports: 1x Gigabit Ethernet 1x USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C 1x USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-A (charges) 2x USB 2.0 Type-A 1x HDMI 2.0 (supports 90Hz refresh) Connectivity: Wireless AC (2×2) (up to 867Mbps) Keyboard: Red back-lighting WASD keys outlined in red Other details: Matte black with a hairline finish Red hinge along the back Bold black grill vent Touchpad outlined in red Acer Spin 1 Next up we have the Acer Spin 1, the company’s latest thin-and-light 2-in-1 Windows 10 device, measuring just 0.55 inches thin and weighting at 2.76 pounds. Arriving in several configurations, this laptop will be powered by a seventh-generation Intel Pentium or Celeron processor, and a battery promising up to eight hours on a single charge. “With a sleek all-metal chassis, the Windows 10 device is lightweight, portable, and supports Windows Ink through an Acer Active Stylus for creative users on the go,” the company says. “The Spin 1 combines superb hardware with innovative features to make the user experience really pop.” While Acer did not provide pricing with its press release, it’s fair to say this will be an affordable model. The Acer Spin 3 starts at $500. Here’s what we have on the Acer Spin 1 so far: Display: 11.6 inches Panel type: IPS with Touch support Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 System memory: 4GB DDR3L Storage: 32GB / 64GB / 128GB Ports: 1x USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-A 1x USB 2.0 Type-A 1x HDMI 1x Micro SD card slot Connectivity: Wireless AC (2×2) (up to 867Mbps) Bluetooth 4.1 Audio: 2x speakers supported by Acer TrueHarmony Other details: Precision touchpad Acer Bluelight Shield tech Supports Acer’s Active Stylus Acer Iconia Tab 10 & One 10 Finally, we have two new tablets under the Iconia umbrella: the premium Iconia Tab 10 (A3-A50) and the productivity-focused Iconia One 10 (B3-A40FHD). Acer wasn’t exactly forthcoming with the hardware details at the time this article went live, but the company said that both will be powered by a quad-core MediaTek processor, Android 7.0, and a battery promising up to eight hours of use on a single charge. Additionally, both tablets sport 10-inch screens backed by In-Plane Switching technology, which is also used in the two previously-mentioned laptops. Other shared features include two five-magnet speakers powered by DTS-HD Premium Sound, and Wireless AC connectivity. Here are a few notes regarding the exclusive features of each model: Iconia Tab 10 (A3-A50) Quantum Dot display technology Acer-patented subwoofer Measures just 0.35 inches thin Acer MediaMaster for creating profiles for movies and music Iconia One 10 (B3-A40FHD) 2x Micro USB ports supporting On-The-Go White frame Acer’s new Nitro 5 laptop for PC gamers will go on sale in multiple configurations in July for a starting price of $799. The super-thin Spin 1 2-in-1 device will hit retail in multiple configuration in July as well for a cheaper starting price of $329. We still don’t know when the two Android tablets will ship or for how much, so stay tuned for more info. Updated on May 25, 2017, by Kevin Parrish to reflect the release dates and pricing.
Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel: Thunderbolt 3 will be integrated with next-gen chips 05/24/2017 at 12:02 PM by Brad Linder 7 Comments It’s been a few years since the Thunderbolt 3 protocol was  introduced, and Intel says there are more than 120 PCs on the market to support the standard. But Intel’s latest chips don’t actually include native support for Thunderbolt 3. Device makers have needed to integrate a discrete Thunderbolt 3 controller, which has slowed adoption. That’s one of the reasons why every device with a Thunderbolt 3 port can support USB Type-C accessories… but not every device with a USB Type-C port supports Thunderbolt 3’s 40 Gb/s data transfer speeds and other key features. Now Intel wants to make it easier for device makers to adopt Thunderbolt 3 by integrating the technology “into future Intel CPUs.” Intel will also make the Thunderbolt 3 specification available royalty-free to help anyone integrate the technology. Here are a few of the benefits of Thunderbolt 3: Support for sending video to up to two external 4K displays Support for up to 100 watts of power delivery (your USB port can be your laptop’s power jack) Supply up to 15 watts to bus-powered devices (for charging phones or tablets, or powering USB displays, among other peripherals) Up to 4x faster data transfer speeds than you get with USB 3.1 By supporting Thunderbolt 3 at the chip level and making the spec available, Intel is probably increasing the odds that you’ll start to see the technology in mid-range PCs. Right now it tends to be available exclusively on higher-end machines. While Intel says Thunderbolt 3 will be integrated into “future” CPUs though, it’s unclear if that means all future CPUS including entry-level, low-power Celeron and Pentium chips or if this is a feature that will be reserved for Core family processors.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 7 Comments on "Intel: Thunderbolt 3 will be integrated with next-gen chips" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest Phil Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. Not going to be royalty free. The best case scenario would be some kind of AMD and Intel cross-licensing deal where both parties gain access to parts of the other’s tech portfolio. These deals are made all the time between major tech corporations.

Releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification in this manner is expected to greatly increase Thunderbolt adoption by encouraging third-party chip makers to build Thunderbolt-compatible chips. We expect industry chip development to accelerate a wide range of new devices and user experiences. ” No Tacitus, you’re wrong. Straight from Intel’s mouth, it will be royalty-free. And they are ENCOURAGING third-party chip makers like AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, Nvidia, Huawei. And are EXPECTING a wide-range of new devices like phones, handhelds, tablets, TVs etc etc. Vote Up2Vote Down  Reply 1 day 1 hour ago Guest opticron Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

I want to be able to use PCI-E for the wide variety of things it’s capable of (4GB/s external storage arrays, 40gbit/s networking, external GPUs). Then there’s the stuff TB3 support guarantees like adherence to the USB-PD spec for up to 100W of power, like 8 lanes of displayport for dual 4K monitors. Then there are the funky features like connect two computers together via it for an easy 10gbit network. If a device has a USB-C port there’s no guarantee it’ll do anything special, it might even be just USB 2.0. You could have USB 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 500mA of current, 900mA, or 5A@20V, displayport or not, HDMI or not, it’s totally unknown and that sucks. There’s no apt comparison here but if you got a device with a HDMI port that can only output 320×240 video over it that’d be a massive… Read more » Vote Up1Vote Down  Reply 17 hours 27 minutes ago Member Kagnon Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Intel's Thunderbolt interface was mostly a Mac-only curiosity until the company decided to bring it to USB-C ports, and now it is poised to become ubiquitous thanks to Intel's decision to allow any device manufacturer to use it without paying royalties. The end of royalty payments will take effect next year, and Intel announced on Wednesday that it also plans to integrate Thunderbolt directly into its future CPUs. The two changes should make the Thunderbolt interface, which currently supports transfer speeds of up to 40 Gbps, the de facto standard for data ports on everything from desktop PCs to virtual reality headsets. And it is emerging technologies like VR where Intel see's Thunderbolt's biggest promise. A Thunderbolt 3 cable can deliver enough throughput to allow 4K games on a virtual reality headset, according to Intel Vice President Chris Walker. Related What Thunderbolt 3 Means for PC Connectivity: An Explainer What Thunderbolt 3 Means for PC Connectivity: An Explainer Other benefits include the ability for laptop and desktop manufacturers to greatly simplify the variety of ports that they offer. Thunderbolt, which started life built into the MiniDisplay ports of Mac laptops and desktops, can function as a monitor cable or a power cord in addition to connecting external drives and other peripherals. "With Thunderbolt 3 integrated into the CPU, computer makers can build thinner and lighter systems with only Thunderbolt 3 ports," Walker explained in a blog post. "For the first time, all the ports on a computer can be the same – any port can charge the system and connect to Thunderbolt devices, every display and billions of USB devices." Making Thunderbolt royalty-free should also make its peripherals and cables cheaper and easier to find. When it comes to external hard drives, for instance, Thunderbolt is still mostly limited to high-end models geared toward media professionals, like the $399 6TB Lacie d2.

Cascade Lake-SP is the Skylake-SP refresh, with Intel tapping the 14nm+ node. Cascade Lake will support up to a mammoth 6TB of Optane DIMMs, which is a huge plus for Intel.   Intel has teased: "Intel persistent memory will allow users to improve system performance dramatically by putting more data closer to the processor on nonvolatile media, and do it in an affordable manner. This will truly be a game-changer when it comes to the way applications and systems are designed".   The next-gen Cascade Lake CPUs will be capable of being thrown into 4-socket configurations, supporting up to 3TB of Optane DIMMs, while the 8-socket systems will support up to 6TB of Optane goodness.

By Chris Duckett | May 25, 2017 -- 00:52 GMT (17:52 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Intel has announced that it will make its Thunderbolt 3 specification royalty-free from next year. The move is expected to boost adoption of the protocol, Intel vice president of the Client Computing Group Chris Walker said in a blog post. At the same time, the company said it would do away with its discrete Thunderbolt 3 component, and move it into the CPU itself, allowing for thinner and more power-efficient devices, Walker said. "For the first time, all the ports on a computer can be the same -- any port can charge the system and connect to Thunderbolt devices, every display and billions of USB devices," he said. Intel has touted its 40Gbps protocol as "the USB-C that does it all" as it is able to support USB, Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, and PCI Express protocols, as well as carry power to devices. In its new Surface Pro released this week, Microsoft continued to ship the device without support for USB-C, let alone add Thunderbolt 3 support. Support for Thunderbolt 3 is slowly making its way into peripherals, with Western Digital announcing this week it was updating its G-Technology product lines with USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 support. A slide leaked earlier this week suggested Intel would release a 12-core desktop CPU badged as a Core i9.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach The growing belief right now is that Apple will be releasing a new MacBook Pro at the Worldwide Developer Conference on June 5, an act that may work against the Cupertino company. While most have been placing heavy criticism on the laptops released in late 2016, the cycle of introducing the MacBook line has been singled out.  The MacBook Pro 2016 came out last year, a much-needed refresh for the device that sorely needed an update. The only problem then was that it came with an old chipset (Intel Skylake) limited to 16GB. As one would guess, power-hungry users were upset, since they wanted the best possible configuration they could get.  Most wanted to see the Intel Kaby Lake SoCs on board, but supply issues were rampant at that time. In short, timing was a bit off. Rival Microsoft opted to delay its Surface Pro series, releasing them in early 2017.  Apple could have followed the same tactic, only that the clamor for a new MacBook Pro was growing loud. Would have it made sense to delay the device until early 2017 as well? Probably.  Regardless, looming on the horizon is Apple releasing an updated version of its MacBook Pro line outside its normal scheduled route. Months apart, most are already anticipating Intel Kaby Lake chip-backed devices. Under normal circumstances, it would have been good news, but not for the ones who took Apple up on its offer with the MacBook Pro 2016.  It is a gamble that could put a dent on Apple’s credibility. Even with the backlash on the underpowered MacBook Pro 2016, many still took the bait. In fact, Trendforce reports a 15-percent year-on-year rise for the last quarter of 2016. With the cycle more than likely to be broken with a potential release of updated MacBooks next week, Apple will have to give a plausible explanation for doing so. While most know the reason behind it, one couldn't help but wonder what follows next later this year. This is assuming there will be another batch coming out.  The effects could be detrimental, with consumers being thrown off with an untimely release. Most want a powerful MacBook Pro, and the early 2017 version seems to be such. Looking ahead, will a new batch stay on schedule? Or will they save new variants for consumers before the year comes to a close?

It's our top pick for high-end gaming desktops. Origin Neuron editor rating: excellent Comments May 19, 2017 REVIEW Comments SPECS COMPARE View Gallery View All 8 Photos in Gallery Starting Configuration Price $964.00 Pros Extraordinary gaming proficiency. Plenty of storage, plus speedy M.2 SSDs. Stylish, relatively compact tower. Easy access for maintenance and upgrades. Customizable case and RAM lighting. Cons Pricey as configured. Bottom Line The Origin Neuron is a stellar gaming machine with practically unrivaled gaming power housed in an elegant design. It's our top pick for high-end gaming desktops. By Matthew Buzzi Consumer gaming and 3D performance are being pushed to absurd new heights on the back of Nvidia's Pascal graphics architecture and Intel's latest generation of processors. Both of these platforms are on full display in the Origin Neuron (starts at $964; $3,900 as tested), with dual GTX 1080 Ti graphics cards and an overlocked Core i7-7700K processor. These components help the Neuron blow past competitors in our gaming tests, it's also speedy with productivity pursuits, and comes with a huge amount of storage to boot. This configuration is expensive, but for what you get and relative to the Editors' Choice Digital Storm Velox, the pricing is fair. Given its superior performance and overall execution, the Origin Neuron is our new top pick for high-end gaming desktops. //Compare Similar Products Compare Digital Storm Velox (Core i7-7700K)   %displayPrice%%seller% CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra   %displayPrice%%seller% Falcon Northwest Talon (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock   %displayPrice%%seller% Corsair One Pro   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Predator G1-710-70001   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus ROG GT51   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS Tower Special Edition   %displayPrice%%seller% Falcon Northwest Tiki (2017)   %displayPrice%%seller% iBuyPower Snowblind Pro   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Omen X   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo IdeaCentre Y710 Cube   %displayPrice%%seller% Form, Function, and More Built into Phanteks' Enthoo Evolv mATX case, the Neuron is relatively unassuming if you look at it head on, but there's a lot to like inside once you start poking around. Its black aluminum frame stands 17.8 by 9 by 15.7 inches (HWD), with tempered glass panels on both flanks. The left side is nearly a full window, while the right is backed with aluminum and has a small cutout window for the SSDs. The case isn't a small-form-factor design, but it's on the smaller side for traditional towers. For size comparison, the Velox stands 22.2 inches tall, 9.25 inches wide, and 19.5 inches deep, taking up much more space. View All 8 Photos in Gallery The panels on either side are actually doors on rear hinges, held closed magnetically toward the front. They both swing open easily, making for one of the most accessible cases I've seen in a while. This lets you in to either side of the tower, which is good for swapping out components and cable and storage management beneath the motherboard. Having such easy access to the space with no screws or removable doors makes it a breeze to pop open and work in the case despite the size, and everything is organized neatly within. This includes neatly cut and routed cables, which are clipped together and funneled behind the motherboard. The CPU cooler stands vertically along the front panel and vents out the front, with a rear case fan in the back and slits along the top panel for more ventilation. The top panel lifts away if you remove one rear hand screw, though there's not much reason to take it off. The bottom of the case is raised about 2 inches by front and back feet, so most of the bottom is above surface level. This allows the bottom vent more room to breathe, and a removable filter over it keeps out dust and debris. The front panel pops off, revealing case fans behind another removable dust filter. The Editors' Choice CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra, one of the first Ryzen-equipped systems we reviewed, uses the same case. CyberPower plastered its logo over the corner of the door window, whereas Origin places a smaller logo on the front panel and on the CPU cooler. Since the case on our review unit is all black, the only color comes from an array of LED lights. The customization is handled through the included Asus Aura software, for which there's a slight learning curve. It's not immediately clear where each setting is (the arrow to switch between each lighting element is particularly small), but once you spend some time poking around, you should get the gist of it. The color and effects of an interior LED light strip, the RAM, the LED ring around the power button, and a slim strip on the front panel can all be changed. The RAM in our unit is G.Skill TridentZ RGB, which is illuminated in customizable segments. You can change the colors of five discrete sections of each stick, which can lead to some cool designs and color combinations, or make lighting "flow" down each stick in conjunction with the case lighting, which is a really cool effect. All of the lighting can also fade in and out slowly, or you can have the LED strip and RAM alternately strobe on and off. The case is not only well designed for maintenance, but is packed with the high-end components you'd hope for at this configuration's price. Everything is powered by an 850W EVGA SuperNOVA G3 power supply, which can run the demanding dual graphics card setup (two Nvidia GTX 1080 Tis in SLI), and the wattage leaves you some headroom. A lightning-fast Intel Core i7-7700K processor, overclocked to 5.0GHz out of the box, serves as the heart of the system. To supplement that, there are 32GB of the 3,000MHz G.Skill memory in our model, and since it's set up as four 8GB sticks, there are no free DIMM slots. Storage comes in the form of two 250GB Samsung 960 EVO NVMe M.2 SSDs in a RAID 0 array, along with two 2TB Seagate Firecuda hybrid drives—a one-two punch that delivers a massive amount of storage and a super-fast boot drive. It adds to the price, for sure, but if you do a lot of media work, you'll appreciate the added speed, and there's more than enough room for many projects and games. As configured, there are still two 2.5-inch and two 3.5-inch storage bays free. The Neuron won't leave you wanting for connectivity options. At first glance, it doesn't seem as if the case has any front-facing ports, but a small panel at the top retracts to reveal two USB 3.0 ports, as well as a headphone jack and a mic jack. The top panel has no ports, just the LED-ringed power button. The rear panel holds the vast majority of connections: There's a USB-C port, a USB-A port, four more USB 3.0 ports, and two USB 2.0 ports. Via the graphics cards, there are a total of seven DisplayPort connections and three HDMI ports. The system also has built-in Bluetooth and dual-band 802.11ac wireless. Origin includes lifetime 24/7 support and free lifetime labor, alongside a one-year part-replacement warranty. Insane Power for Gaming and Productivity With such premium parts, it's no surprise that the Neuron is a performance dynamo. If you're paying for a dual 1080 Ti desktop, you should expect no less than top-end speed, which it delivers across all tests. In terms of general productivity, it was one of the fastest computers we've tested. Its PCMark 8 Work Conventional score beat all comers, such as the Digital Storm Velox, the 2016 Falcon Northwest Talon, and the Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock. In the multimedia test results (timed Photoshop and Handbrake tests, plus the CineBench score), the Neuron didn't lead the pack in such dominant fashion, but it was right up there with the best of the category. Gaming and 3D performance is where the Neuron really separates itself from the pack. The competitors are all fast desktops, many of which are equipped with GTX 1080s in SLI, but the 1080 Ti upgrade pushes the Neuron to the front, scoring a category-best 21,481 points on 3D Mark's Fire Strike Extreme test. Its Cloud Gate score is on the top end, as well. It should be noted that in real-world use, the Falcon Northwest Talon's dual Pascal Titan X cards should provide more power, which doesn't fully translate on the synthetic tests, but the Talon configuration we tested rings north of $9,500. See How We Test Desktops The Heaven and Valley gaming tests tell the same story of the Neuron's capabilities. Set to Ultra quality and 1080p resolution, the Neuron averaged 278 frames per second (fps) on Heaven and 175fps on Valley. When cranked up to 4K, the desktop averaged 95fps and 113fps on these same tests, proving it's more than capable of smooth 4K gaming. I further confirmed this by playing DOOM in 4K at maximum settings, and the in-game frame counter hovered around 100fps or higher for most of my gameplay. I also played The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 4K with all the settings and effects on Ultra, and had a smooth experience. A Clear Leader in Desktop Gaming Sure, the Neuron is more expensive than single-GPU desktops like the Gamer Master Ultra, but you get what you pay for. It's still thousands of dollars less than other high-end systems like the Falcon Northwest Talon or Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock (though those PCs do come with their own top-end advantages), and the stylish but functional case provides a great home for the premium hardware. If you can afford the high-end components, it's tough to beat the power, design, and organization offered by the Origin Neuron. The Digital Storm Velox (Core i7-7700K) is a fast computer, but it's also even more expensive than the Neuron, which is a superior all-around performer with better graphics cards. For its design, pricing, and impressive gaming capability, the Origin Neuron is our new Editors' Choice for high-end gaming desktops.

Investigators believe Kushner, who is married to the President's eldest daughter Ivanka, has significant information relevant to their inquiry. However, it does not mean that they suspect him of a crime or intend to charge him, US officials briefed on the probe told NBC News on Thursday night. Points of focus that pertain to Kushner include: the Trump campaign's 2016 data analytics operation; his relationship with former national security adviser Michael Flynn; and Kushner's own contacts with Russians, according to the officials. Kushner met at least once in December with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and he also met last year with Sergey Gorkov, chairman of VneshEconomBank, a Russian government-owned institution that has been under US sanctions since July 2014. It remains unclear if the FBI plans to talk to Kushner. "Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings," Kushner's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, told NBC News. "He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry." The FBI is investigating possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia in connection with Moscow's alleged interference in the 2016 election, reports USA Today. Flynn, along with former Trump campaign associates Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and Carter Page, are active subjects of the investigation. --IANS ksk (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Pre-order: Surface Laptop | NEW Surface Pro Clamshell vs. Kickstand Surface Laptop vs. Surface Pro: Spec showdown and form factor wars By Jez Corden Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 5:03 pm EDT 37 Comments Jez Corden is a Senior Editor for Windows Central, focusing on Xbox, Windows 10, and gaming. He worships David Lynch, Italian food, and is rarely seen without tea. Follow him on Twitter and Instagram! Microsoft just unveiled the new Surface Pro with shiny new internals and an array of upgraded features. The 2-in-1 tablet form factor remains a divisive point, so much so that Microsoft recently unveiled a classic Surface Laptop clamshell for people who find the Surface Pro's hybrid configuration a little off-putting. Still, I'm of the opinion that the Surface Pro remains a great option, even with the clamshell configuration now available. But is it right for you? Let's discuss the "pros" and cons (see what I did there? Pros?... sorry.) Tech Specs Both the Surface Pro and the Surface Laptop are incredibly similar on the inside, but there are a few differences worth noting. We've highlighted in bold when a device wins the spec battle.

Interestingly, the i5 version of the Surface Pro is, like the m3, fanless in design, which means it will be practically silent compared to its i7 counterpart. Every version of the Surface Laptop is equipped with a fan, though we've yet to spend any time with either the new Surface Pro or the Surface Laptop in an isolated and quiet setting where we could put them under load and see just how noisy the fans are. Previous Surface Pro models have struggled with throttling due to heat generation. Kaby Lake Intel processors could go some way to improve the situation, but if you'd prefer peace of mind when it comes to thermals, the Surface Laptop might be a better bet. But this is, again, something that's hard to judge without a thorough analysis. In any case, both devices should perform similarly, with the Surface Laptop edging the Surface Pro into second place when it comes to battery life. Part of that, however, might be due to Windows 10 S, which blocks Win32 programs like Chrome which are known to impact battery life. Windows 10 S vs. Windows 10 Pro The Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S, Microsoft's new super-secure OS locked to the vetted Windows 10 Store. It is upgradeable for free until the end of 2017, giving you access to the full compliment of Win32 programs on the market: Steam, Adobe CC, and beyond. After 2017, it will cost around $50 to purchase a Windows 10 Pro upgrade license, which is still cheaper than usual. Students will probably get far more out of the Surface Pro for note taking, due to its form factor. The Surface Pro comes with Windows 10 Pro as standard, because Microsoft expects it to be used by professional artists who rely on programs like Clip Studio and Adobe Photoshop. I think Microsoft missed an opportunity, though, at least with the fanless m3 and i5 versions, as I feel these would make for pretty great tablets with Windows 10 S, but perhaps that's for another discussion. Because Windows 10 S is so easily upgraded, it shouldn't really factor into your purchase decision between the two devices, but if you're a student simply looking for a standard clamshell that will run Office programs and a web browser efficiently, the Surface Laptop is a safe bet even without the upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. That said, students will probably get far more out of the Surface Pro for note taking, due to its form factor. Form factor wars While the Surface Laptop supports inking, it's not something you'll enjoy doing. The screen doesn't tilt back nearly as far as the Surface Pro, and being a laptop you can't quite curl up with it in a chair and draw. Expect to use inking on the Laptop more for utilitarian purposes — signing and annotating documents, for example — than artistry. If you intend to make extensive use of the pen — sketching, drawing, taking notes by hand, etc — then the Surface Pro tablet is a great option. The Surface Pro's kickstand/tablet configuration is oft-criticized as having poor "lappability," i.e. it's difficult to use on your lap like a, well, laptop. The kickstand has been improved yet again with the new Surface Pro — it's more stable for lap-typers and more flexible for artists that want to fold it back nearly flat (a full 165 degrees). This will work well with the newly supported Surface Dial, another huge boost for artists. Price This is where things get a little complicated. The price listings for the Surface Pro only include the tablet. No keyboard, and no pen. The keyboard alone adds $160 to the equation, throw in the new tilt-shifting pen (which we expect to be $100), and a Surface Dial ($100), and that Surface Pro starts to look extremely expensive by comparison. If you want the Surface Pro form factor, chances are you're going to want at least the pen and the keyboard. The 512 MB, Core i7, 16GB RAM Surface Laptop costs $2,199, the same as the Surface Pro. Throw in the keyboard cover and pen, and the Surface Pro becomes $2,459, which is a significant bump. If you're spending money at the high-end, an additional $260 might not bother you so much, but if you're going for the lower-end devices to save money, it's something worth considering. You're going to have to really want that Surface Pro drawing, inking configuration to justify the extra costs. Which is right for you? The new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop are mostly evenly matched on specs and are fairly close in price. It comes down to a matter of form factor, and that's a debate for the ages. If it's art or handwriting or flexibility that's your draw, then the Surface Pro's 2-in-1 tablet design is likely the best for you. If you're planing on doing a lot of typing — or simply have no need for digital inking in your life — the Surface Laptop should rank higher on your list. Of course, there is Surface Book to consider as well, artfully bridging the divide between the tablet and laptop. Though right now, after the unveiling of the Surface Laptop and new Surface Pro, the Book is comparatively out-of-date when it comes to the chips inside.

What a piece of crap. The Surface tablet is obviously better than the laptop version. If the Surface Laptop had a detachable display and came with a full OS like the Surface Book I think it could've been a pretty good product. At the very least Surface Laptop should've been able to flip over like a Lenovo Yoga and every other modern ultrabook. The fact that this is the first "Surface" device that you can't use as an actual surface to work on is a huge branding fail for Microsoft. -7 8 hours ago Reply RobbCab I agree that the Surface Pro is better. but it is most definitely not cheaper. The Core M3 is $100 cheaper without the $159 type cover (=$60 more). When you price comparable i5/4gb/128gb devices with the type cover, the Surface Pro is $159 more expensive than the Laptop. 4 8 hours ago Reply Sin Lee Ng A comparable tablet with a detachable keyboard should be more expensive than the laptop, isn't it? That's why the Surface Laptop is targeted at students who need those power but not blow their money on tablet features. 1 3 hours ago Reply ia_win If you think about the price difference (150-200) in the long term (duration of device: 2-3 years), is not that big factor. For me the biggest gap in favour of Surface Pro are the SD card, natural pen support and mobility factor. Not sure why i5/16GB and i7/32GB configurations are not available. These are the best for 'real' pros like architects, developers, designers. My company is in the process of replacing several thousands desktops with mobile devices. Surface Pro is considered as well. However, Dell's XPS 15 will win the order because offers above configurations. I really don't get it. Nowadays, memory is so cheap. All Surface devices should come with min 8GB. That's win-win for everyone. 0 0 sec ago Reply IllusionMH SP 2017 doesn't have pen in package for i5/i7 versions? 1 8 hours ago Reply Cryio Nope. 100$ extra. 1 7 hours ago Reply L0n3N1nja They increased the price of the pen for the new version?

It is pity that new device comes without pen and there is no noticeable change in price. I was ok to add $150-160 for keyboard and have really good 2-in-1 device where pen was nice bonus to SP3. But now it looks less attractive than before. If I'll go to change SP3 to new device I'll still prefer Surface Pro over Surface Laptop, but most likely won't buy pen. It is interesting if there will be i7 LTE versions and price difference for LTE. Have you seen any info on this? 2 6 hours ago Reply Enza Knight To hard to choose I'll just get both.

If that is not important to you get the Laptop. 1 7 hours ago Reply Montgomery Badleford If you have the money to buy both, you'd be better off buying a Surface Book with Performance Base instead. 1 1 hour ago Reply Enza Knight I did contemplate that Monty but don't like having to detach and turn around the screen to convert to tablet mode. Oh and I do "mind the gap". 0 37 min ago Reply cool8man Microsoft needs to get over it's Apple envy. They're ahead of Apple with Surface Studio, Surface Pro tablet, and Surface Book. The 2-in-1 form factor has killed the iPad and Mac. Apple fans have never been more frustrated and angry with their company. The Surface Laptop just makes Microsoft look like they are more comfortable being followers rather than leaders in this industry. Windows owns the 2-in-1 category and the touch screen PC market. Microsoft should be more proud of what they accomplished and stop second-guessing themselves with the form factors of yesterday. Surface Laptop was a huge misstep that only makes Apple look less ridiculous than they actually are. -10 8 hours ago Reply Enza Knight Disagree, the laptop completes the Surface family for this screen size and there is now something for everyone. 2 35 min ago Reply WillBthr I went to a MS Store and tried both SP and SL and they are both very nice designs. You can preorder without a commitment to actually buy when they are available. An aside: The reason I had to go to the store is that my Surface Dock for my SP4 failed after one and a half years and I had to buy a new one. No good at all. If fact I am pretty irritated. I was offered the Student (10%) discount but when you add Jerry Brown Sales Tax it was still $200. The Dock should be functioning for years and there is not any excuse for this poor quality. The failure was the PS part (15V) and you can't fix it or buy just the part. 1 7 hours ago Reply WilliamC1972 Getting both. 4 7 hours ago Reply L0n3N1nja Surface Pro all the way, I like inking and I prefer tablet form factor for browsing on the couch. 1 7 hours ago Reply Xboxer Eyts Where are you Surface phone?

I personally love my SP4 i7 and was really hoping the new Surface Pro would have a bit larger screen as it feels really small when I need to spend hours at uni working on assignments. But, given that it didn't happen and given that the new Surface is now overall more expensive, I'll be probably going for the Surface Laptop. 2 3 hours ago Reply ananve If you need the screen real estate, Yes I agreed the laptop is made for you.

The Surface Laptop looks gorgeous, but I'm just too accustomed to be able to whip out the pen and draw or write on my (ageing) SP3. I'd miss being able to do this for my engineering work, note taking and the occasional doodling. Also, I'm in love with the kickstand, mostly for its aesthetics, but also stability (no wobble ever!). 0 2 hours ago Reply sanjeet_deshwal Pro.

If it flippd under, it is out of teh way, but a second keyboard is needed.  0 1 hour ago Reply SammyD97 At this point I would take the Laptop because that's the form in which I'd use the Pro in because it's too big (FOR ME) to use as a tablet. If I'm gonna use something it'd rather use it in its uncompromised state. That alone would lead push me towards a the Laptop 0 51 min ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Pre-order: Surface Laptop | NEW Surface Pro Entry-level gaming Acer Nitro 5 entry-level gaming laptop unveiled ahead of Computex By Richard Devine Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 7:32 am EDT 1 Comment Before Computex 2017 begins in Acer's home city, Taipei, the company has announced a pair of new laptops. One of them is this, the Nitro 5, an entry-level gaming laptop with either NVIDIA or AMD power. Consumers can choose from models that feature up to NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti graphics with 7th Generation Intel Core™ processors or AMD Radeon™ RX 550 graphics with 7thGeneration AMD A-series processors. Specifically you're looking at either a Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 or i7 processor with the NVIDIA version, or 7th-generation AMD FX, A10 or A12 processors with the RX 550 model. Both will support up to 32GB of DDR4 2400 RAM, and of course, come with Windows 10. "Selected" models will come with a combination of PCIe SSD (up to 512GB) and HDD storage to cover both fast boot times and sheer volume, making sure you don't run out of space for your favorite games. You'll also find a USB 3.1 Type-C port, one USB 3.0 port with power-off charging for your phone or tablet, two USB 2.0 ports, and an HDMI 2.0 port that supports up to 90Hz refresh rates. When it comes to cooling: The Nitro 5 features dual fans with Acer Coolboost™technology, which delivers heightened fan speeds and cooling ability, and allows users to manually control the cooling process when heavy use requires an added boost. Out front, you'll be looking at a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS display and some red backlighting on the keyboard, while your ears will be treated to Dolby Audio Premium and Acer's TrueHarmony. The Nitro 5 is set to launch in July in North America and China with prices starting at $799. A launch in the EMEA region will follow in August.

PHOTO: REUTERS Published4 hours ago More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/4ubh Copy WASHINGTON (NYTIMES) - President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is facing a mounting tangle of potential legal troubles arising from his business dealings with foreign entities and his interactions with both executive branch and congressional investigators. One set of problems stems from Russia. In 2015, Russian-linked companies paid Flynn more than US$65,000, including about US$45,000 from the state-backed Russian television network RT for a December trip to Moscow, where he delivered a speech and sat next to President Vladimir Putin at a dinner. In December, a US wiretap of the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, intercepted conversations he had with Flynn discussing the Obama administration's imposition of sanctions on Russia for meddling in the election. The other set stems from Turkey. Last year, Flynn's lobbying firm, Flynn Intel Group, was paid more than US$500,000 by Inovo BV, a Dutch corporation. Inovo is owned by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish-American businessman with ties to the administration of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up The work centred on research to discredit Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, and whose extradition Erdogan has been seeking. Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, declined to comment. But in a letter to the Senate this week, Kelner and other lawyers portrayed Flynn as being treated unfairly, saying he was "the target on nearly a daily basis of outrageous allegations." Here is a breakdown of some of the possible legal problems for Flynn. Making False Statements Investigators are scrutinising whether several of Flynn's statements violated a statute that makes it a felony, punishable by five years in prison, to make a false statement to the government. To convict, prosecutors must prove that the violation was knowing and willful, not merely inadvertent. In January 2016, Flynn, a former three-star general who retired in 2014 after being forced out as head of the Defence Intelligence Agency, applied to have his security clearance extended. As part of the process, he filled out and signed a SF-86 form. It directed him to disclose his foreign travel, compensation and contacts. It also referred to the false-statement statute as part of a certification that the information was truthful and complete. After viewing the form, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said Flynn had concealed his Russia trip and the compensation when he filled it out. In February 2016, investigators reviewing Flynn's application to renew his security clearance interviewed him. According to a letter this month from Cummings, documents suggest Flynn falsely stated in that interview that US companies had funded his Moscow visit and that he had only "insubstantial contact" with foreigners, despite the dinner with Putin. Flynn's legal team has said he briefed the Defence Intelligence Agency about the trip. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and adviser, also failed to mention encounters with Russian officials on their SF-86 forms. Separately, four days into the Trump administration, FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his conversations with Kislyak in December. Several news outlets have reported that he initially told the FBI that he had not discussed sanctions on Russia but then backtracked and said he could not remember. Taking Foreign Payments Without Permission The Constitution's emoluments clause prohibits people who hold government positions from receiving payments from foreign governments without prior consent from Congress. This rule extends to retired military personnel, and Congress enacted a statute to carry it out. It says retired military personnel may accept such compensation only if they get permission from their service secretary and the secretary of state. Flynn apparently did not obtain permission before taking compensation from RT or Inovo. That failure is complicated by the fact that they are companies, not governments, but the US government has portrayed RT as an arm of the Kremlin. Alptekin has told reporters he hired Flynn with his own funds and did not coordinate with the Turkish government. But congressional investigators have expressed skepticism after receiving classified briefings. "As a former military officer, you simply cannot take money from Russia, Turkey or anybody else," Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said in April. "And it appears as if he did take that money. It was inappropriate, and there are repercussions for the violation of law." Such a violation would not constitute a criminal offence; a Pentagon ethics document says the penalty is forfeiting the funds through withheld retirement pay, not prison time. The acting inspector general of the Defence Department, Glenn Fine, told Congress that his office had begun investigating whether Flynn violated emoluments rules. Failure to Register As a Foreign Agent The Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, requires that people representing foreign governments or political parties register with the Justice Department within 10 days. Under departmental regulations, this rule extends to lobbyists hired by foreign companies if the "principal beneficiary" of their work is a foreign government. In September, after signing the contract with Inovo, the Flynn Intel Group registered as an ordinary lobbyist for that firm but did not make a FARA filing, which requires greater disclosure. However, in March, after his ouster from the Trump administration, Flynn's lawyers filed a belated FARA registration about the arrangement "to eliminate any potential doubt." "Because of the subject matter of Flynn Intel Group's work for Inovo BV, which focused on Mr Fethullah Gulen, whose extradition is sought by the government of Turkey, the engagement could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey," the lawyers wrote. Violating FARA is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, although legal specialists say the Justice Department rarely prosecutes that charge. Failure to Comply With Subpoenas Several congressional committees have been seeking information about Flynn's activities, and there are signs more subpoenas are coming. The Senate Intelligence Committee voted unanimously Thursday to give its top Republican and Democrat broad authority to issue subpoenas. The most advanced subpoena is one the Intelligence Committee issued to Flynn on May 10 seeking all records of his meetings and communications with Russian officials, and of his communications with Trump's campaign about Russia in the 18 months before Trump's inauguration. On Monday, Flynn's lawyers told the committee that he was invoking his right against self-incrimination to avoid complying with the subpoena. Although invoking the Fifth Amendment is usually associated with live testimony, his lawyers argued that it fell under a precedent for document production requests that are so broad that the act of acknowledging whether any such files exist could amount to self-incriminating testimony. The committee can vote to hold anyone refusing to comply with a subpoena in contempt of Congress. If the full House or Senate chamber votes likewise, the dispute moves into court. The Justice Department would have to decide whether to prosecute the subpoena recipient for criminal contempt of Congress, which carries a penalty of one to 12 months in prison. Lawmakers could also file a lawsuit asking a federal judge to order compliance with their subpoena.

C'est un mouvement original et significatif des bouleversements actuels de l'industrie automobile. Renault a annoncé mercredi le « projet d'acquisition » des activités de recherche et développement d'Intel en France, soit 400 salariés répartis sur deux sites, Sophia Antipolis (Alpes-Maritimes) et Toulouse. Les experts d'Intel sont spécialisés sur les logiciels de connectivité et les solutions embarquées. Le logiciel représente aujourd'hui de 15 à 25 % de la valeur d'une voiture, et ce sera plus de 50 % après 2020. Renault doit donc maîtriser cet univers en interne. Pour éviter que la culture software des ingénieurs d'Intel ne soit dissoute dans celle, plus mécanique, de l'Alliance Renault Nissan, les deux sites et leurs écosystèmes seront totalement préservés. Au final, l'opération vient renforcer significativement le poids de la R&D de Renault en France, qui compte à ce jour environ 6.000 ingénieurs. @CDucruet Suivre @CDucruet Ailleurs sur le web Commentaires Tous droits réservés - Les Echos 2017 Suivez nous Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Newsletter Service Client Abonnement Rediffusion Publicité Abonnement presse numérique sur epresse.fr Fréquentation certifiée par l'OJD Cookies CGU - CGV Charte éthique Plan du site Election Plan du site Rechercher dans : Tout le texte Le titre Le titre et le chapô Auteur Limiter la recherche sur : Toutes les sources Les Echos Investir Dépêches d'agence Enjeux Série Limitée Capital Finance Type de documents : Tous les documents Articles Interviews Dossiers Infographies Blogs Vidéos Sur la période : Du Au 7 derniers jours 30 derniers jours 1 an 2 ans Fermer Bienvenue !

Thunderbolt 3 with USB-C connectors brings us close to realising that dream. And to help with that Intel is planning to do two things: integrate Thunderbolt 3 into CPUs and releasing the Thunderbolt Protocol Specification to industry. By integrating Thunderbolt into the CPU Intel says "computer makers can build thinner and lighter systems with only Thunderbolt 3 ports". While the prospect of Thunderbolt-only systems has given rise to the #donglelife as people have had to carry extra adapters to support older USB devices, Thunderbolt and USB-C does offer significant benefits over the incumbent standards. And by making the Thunderbolt protocol specification available to the industry under a nonexclusive, royalty-free license next year Intel is hoping to greatly increase Thunderbolt adoption by encouraging third-party chip makers to build Thunderbolt-compatible chips. Moving between standards is not easy. USB-A connectors have been incredibly popular and, as a result, there is a massive base of devices that will require either replacement or the use of unwieldy adapters. For now, i think devices like the HP Spectre X360 I've been testing offer a good compromise with both USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 and USB-3 with USB-A connectors.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Curtiss-Wright Qualifies its Conduction Cooled Supercomputer-Class DSP Modules for ISR Applications to Extreme Ruggedization Level Curtiss-Wright’s Defense Solutions division today announced that it is the embedded industry’s first COTS supplier to successfully qualify its full range of supercomputer-class Intel® Xeon®-D based conduction cooled 3U and 6U OpenVPX DSP modules to the -40°C to 85°C operating temperature range. This notable achievement ensures that Curtiss-Wright’s family of CHAMP-XDx DSP modules is able to deliver unmatched performance in extremely harsh deployed defense and aerospace environments, including an unprecedented ability to mitigate processor “throttling” across the -40°C to 85°C (Level 200) operating temperature range. The boards were also successfully qualified to perform optimally in the intense shock and vibration conditions encountered by the most demanding defense and aerospace platforms, such as the extreme forces resulting from the maneuvers and acceleration typical of fighter jets. These types of platforms operate at high speeds in high altitude environments where a lack of atmosphere eliminates the ability to cool with forced air techniques, making conduction cooling essential. Now qualified for operation over the full military temperature range, the rugged conduction cooled CHAMP-XDx modules have earned Curtiss-Wright’s Level 200 (L200) designation, one of the industry’s highest ruggedization levels. With its L200 rating, the 6U CHAMP-XD2, already the industry’s only dual Xeon-D DSP module, now delivers the highest performance and highest level of conduction cooling available for a COTS DSP module. With their ability to operate optimally with the extreme heat of an 85°C card edge, Curtiss-Wright’s CHAMP-XDx modules are the industry’s first DSP modules able to mitigate the risk of the performance degrading throttling typically experienced by lower-rated conduction cooled modules when operated at the extreme limits of the processor’s operating temperature range. The L200 CHAMP-XDx modules’ ability to mitigate throttling is especially important for demanding applications, such as airborne active electronically scanned array (AESA) Radar, for which deterministic timing is critical. “We are extremely proud to announce that our industry-leading conduction cooled Xeon-D-based DSP modules are now qualified for operation in the extremely harsh -40°C to 85°C temperature range to support the most demanding deployed ISR applications,” said Lynn Bamford, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Defense Solutions division. “This level of ruggedization is one of the hardest objectives to achieve for a conduction cooled COTS module design, and enables the DSP processor to operate at higher temperatures without performance throttling, which can, for example, reduce the operational effectiveness of an aircraft’s AESA radar, especially when the pilot needs it most.” About Level 200 Ruggedization Curtiss-Wright’s L200 manufacturing and qualification process is one of the most extreme in the industry. It is designed to ensure that conduction cooled COTS modules can survive the extreme environmental conditions that warfighters and their platforms must endure. L200 performance specifications include: • Operating Temp.: -40°C to 85°C • Non-operating Temp.: -55°C to 125°C • Operating Humidity: 0-100% non-condensing • Non-operating Humidity (Storage): 0-100% condensing • Vibration Sine: • 10 g peak 5-2,000 Hz • Vibration Random: • 0.005 [.] 5 Hz • @15 Hz • @2,000 Hz • Shock: 40 g peak • Altitude: -1,500 to 60,000 ft • Conformal Coat Mitigating Throttling When some processor modules aren’t cooled to proper temperatures their on-board processor(s) can reach a specific internal temperature that initiates a “throttle-back” condition, reducing the device’s performance in order to protect against over-heating. This type of temperature-induced throttling can result in the uncontrolled degradation of the processor clock and is highly undesirable for compute intensive applications such as AESA Radar that depend on maximum computation and real-time deterministic timing performance. The L200-rated CHAMP-XDx modules are able to keep their Intel Xeon-D processors cool at extreme levels of performance, effectively mitigating the risk of throttling. Curtiss-Wright’s intensive qualification and testing process results in detailed information, including full characterization of the modules’ throttling mitigating performance, and can be provided to system integrators. This data enables integrators to fully understand how CHAMP-XDx modules significantly reduce the risk of throttling at 85°C operating temperatures in comparison to competing designs that can only be qualified for operation at 71°C. The Conduction Cooling Experts: Advanced Thermal Management Equals Reliability With a heritage of more than 30 years, Curtiss-Wright has long been recognized as the COTS industry’s leading expert in the design of conduction cooled standards based modules. The CHAMP-XDx family of modules features some of the most sophisticated thermal frames yet developed by the Company, leveraging next-generation thermal interface materials and advanced heatpipe technology that enables great amounts of heat to be rapidly dissipated. Their groundbreaking design results from research and investment in the latest thermal dissipation technologies. The ability to successfully cool the Xeon-D processors and other components on the CHAMP-XDx modules delivers far greater reliability, extending product MTBF, so that platform mission hours are maximized. Modules qualified to the wider operating temperature ranges will have fewer failures in the harsh tactical fighter environment, for example, than those qualified to less stringent requirements. What’s more, the platform operator will spend less on spares and repairs due to fewer failures. The result of advanced conduction cooling is more reliable hardware with higher levels of operational readiness and full operational capability.

After being fired by Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT and helped fund the company that became Pixar. Jobs’ return to Apple was brought on by Cupertino’s February 1997 purchase of NeXT for $427 million. Thanks to the acquisition, Apple would have the tools necessary to introduce a new operating system for Mac a few years later. Pixar was purchased by The Walt Disney Company in 2006 for $7.4 billion. It has produced some of the biggest films of the past 25 years, including the Toy Story franchise and Finding Nemo. 2. 2000–2001: Saying Hello to Mac OS X Apple celebrated the dawn of 21st century by introducing Mac OS X (now called macOS How To Install macOS & Save The Installer How To Install macOS & Save The Installer It's really easy to save the macOS installer to avoid multiple downloads, and worth doing even if you only have the one Mac. Read More ) in March 2001. At WWDC 2000 and WWDC 2001, Apple demonstrated the new operating system to developers and the public during numerous how-to sessions. In 2001, the company announced Mac OS X Server, which was big news for business users. Mac OS X 10.0 served as a radical departure from the classic Mac OS and introduced a new Darwin Unix-like core and a completely new system of memory management. 3. 2005: Cupertino Looks to Intel At WWDC 2005, Apple announced it would transition the Mac platform to Intel x86 processors from PowerPC processors, which had been developed by Apple, IBM, and Motorola. The move was described as a “seismic shocker” at the time. Why did Apple make the switch? As Macworld explained: “The reason, industry analysts say, is that (Steve) Jobs has a clear goal in mind: innovative designs. And such designs require the lowest-voltage chips, which IBM and Freescale were not going to make with the PowerPC chip core…” The switch would allow Apple to eventually introduce new and speedier Mac products, including the MacBook Air. 4. 2006: Windows Comes to Mac OS X Apple introduced the Mac Pro as a replacement for the Power Mac G5, which was the company’s final PowerPC-based Mac. At WWDC 2006, Apple also launched Time Machine and Boot Camp for Mac OS X. With Time Machine, you can backup your Mac with easy. The latter allowed you to access Windows from a Mac computer for the first time. This change was significant in that it allowed folks who would have ordinarily needed to buy a Windows-based computer to purchase a Mac instead. 5. 2007: The Birth of the iPhone In January 2007, Apple unveiled iPhone, a product that would transition the company from a computer maker to something much more. At WWDC 2007, which focused mostly on the impending arrival of OS X Leopard, Jobs finally announced the release date for iPhone: June 29. The date was revealed during one of Jobs’ signature “one more thing” moments that ended that year’s keynote address. 6. 2008: App Store Arrives Though Mac remains an important part of WWDC, beginning in 2008, the main focus of the event began shifting towards iPhone and what would become iOS. This was also the year that Apple announced the App Store, which launched in July 2008. A few years later, the Mac App Store arrived, forever changing how you purchase applications for your computer. As of January 2017, the App Store features over 2.2 million apps for iPhone and iPad. 7. 2010: The Final Summer iPhone At WWDC 2010, Apple revealed the iPhone 4, the last Apple handset to launch at the annual event. Since 2011, new iPhones have been announced in the fall, which has dramatically changed when consumers purchased new smartphones each year. Instead of using the WWDC keynote to announce new iPhones, WWDC instead now serves as a launching pad for next-generation versions of iOS. This is one of the primary reasons the WWDC keynote has become popular with non-developers since it’s a preview of things to come iOS devices. 8. 2013: iCloud Keychain In 2013, Apple introduced iCloud Keychain Should You Use iCloud Keychain to Sync Passwords on Mac & iOS? Should You Use iCloud Keychain to Sync Passwords on Mac & iOS? If you primarily use Apple products, why not use the company's own password manager completely free of charge? Read More , which serves as a secure database for user information that’s accessible from multiple devices. This data includes website login passwords, Wi-Fi network passwords, credit/debit card management, and other account information. AES (256-bit) encryption protects the data. Meanwhile, Apple Pay, which launched in 2014, launched because of iCloud Keychain. It allows you to make mobile and online purchases without handing over your debit or credit card information to strangers making it a more secure solution. 9. 2014: Swift Apple used the WWDC 2014 keynote address to announce Swift, a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language Apple's Swift Is Going Open Source: So What? Apple's Swift Is Going Open Source: So What? Even if you aren't a programmer yourself, Apple's decision to open source Swift will impact you. Want to know why and how? Read More for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux development. Swift has been positioned as an alternative to the Objective-C language that employs modern programming language theory concepts and strives to present a simpler syntax. In doing so, it’s one of the easiest languages to read and maintain. Because Swift is now open-source, developers can develop iOS and macOS apps on non-Apple systems and have the assurance of 100 percent compatibility. This means more apps for you to try in the future. 10. 2015: Apple Music, Beats 1 Launch Apple launched the first iPod in 2001, which brought with it the iTunes Store. For over a decade, iTunes was the place to go to buy digital music, which overtook CDs in the early 2000s. The popularity of buying music has ebbed considerably in recent years, however, thanks to the rise of music streaming services such as Spotify. Cupertino’s entry in this field, Apple Music, launched at WWDC 2015. Like similar subscription plans, Apple Music membership allows you to rent and listen to unlimited music across multiple platforms 10 Essential Apple Music Tips You Really Need to Know 10 Essential Apple Music Tips You Really Need to Know Since its launch in 2015, Apple Music has come a long way, baby.

Though Apple Music continues to trail Spotify in terms of the number of subscribers, it would be foolish to count Apple out. This was the company that changed how we consumed music, after all. Perhaps we’ll hear more about the company’s future plans for Apple Music at an upcoming WWDC. Yes, WWDC Is Important Apple developers will be the ones gathering in San Jose for the annual WWDC.

(Alexander Scheuber/Getty Images) By Larry Klayman Thursday, 25 May 2017 09:59 AM Current | Bio | Archive Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The revelations yesterday that the National Security Agency (NSA) under the Obama administration had been systematically spying on hundreds of millions of Americans under Section 702 of the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act comes as no surprise. Indeed, Freedom Watch and I had already obtained two preliminary injunction orders ordering this stop in a case styled Klayman et. al v. Obama et al., which I had filed in 2013 before the federal court in the District of Columbia. The judge, the Honorable Richard J. Leon, ruled that this spying was illegal, that it is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment to our Constitution, which the Framers had conceived of to prevent "unreasonable searches and seizures" of our citizenry, the likes of which the colonialists had experienced under the tyrannical rule of King George III. This gross abuse was one of the principle reasons why the Founding Fathers declared independence and formed a new nation on July 4, 1776. (See "Obama Intel Agency Conducted Illegal Searches on Americans for Years," Circa News, May 24, 2017.) This further confirmation of the Orwellian state — as Judge Leon put it in ruling in my favor in what perhaps is the biggest victory against the federal government in many decades, and perhaps the biggest in American history given the heretofore unbridled power of the NSA and its sister intelligence agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) — came as no surprise. But what is surprising is the scant attention paid in the mainstream media to this gross invasion of the privacy rights of the populace and the cover-up by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees on Capitol Hill of these on-going crimes against all of us. Indeed, in the last several months I have waged a full court press to have these committees obtain the 47 hard drives and over 600 million pages of classified information which my client, Dennis Montgomery, a former NSA/CIA contractor had provided over two years ago, under grant of immunity, provided to FBI Director James Comey and his Special Agents, Walter Giardina and William Barnett of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Montgomery, who possessed information about spying on President Trump prior The Donald’s election, and who disclosed spying on the chief justice of the Supreme Court, other SCOTUS justices such as Antonin Scalia, 156 judges, and other prominent Americans such as yours truly, offered to come forward to not just the congressional intel committees, but also the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, since the judiciary was victimized. But, despite my "door to door" lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill, as had occurred years ago before I met Montgomery when my client tried to come forward as a whistleblower, no one in our Congress was interested. And, why is this? The simple answer is twofold: one, either the congressmen and senators on these oversight committees already had knowledge of this criminal conduct, or two, they are too afraid to weigh in and conduct investigations for fear that information obtained illegally by the intelligence agencies about them will fly out of so called files to attempt to destroy their personal and political lives, much as has occurred with Lt. General Michael Flynn and recently even the president himself. In essence, based on my experience, I believe that both scenarios apply. While it is nice that this new information has come to light, nicety is not enough. There exists a massive government-wide cover-up of the full extent of the unconstitutional spying on all of us, and indeed we live in a tyrannical police state as a result. As I have said many times, if King George III had had the surveillance powers of the NSA and CIA, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, and their colleagues in the Continental Congress, would never have made it to Philadelphia to advocate for, agree on, and sign the Declaration of Independence. Their plans to form a new nation, free from the tyranny of the British Crown, would have been discovered and they would have been arrested, imprisoned, and executed before they convened in the City of Brotherly Love. The time as come for we Americans to rise up and demand that those responsible for these on-going crimes against the Constitution and the citizenry be held to account before the bar of justice. That goes for former President Barack Obama, the heads of the intelligence agencies who perpetrated these criminal acts, and those in Congress and the FBI, including one James Comey, who covered it all up. Special Counsel Robert Mueller must be authorized by the Trump Justice Department to investigate these matters before a grand jury, and in the end bring indictments. To this end, my public interest group, which already has demonstrated its resolve and success, pledges to work with the Special Counsel to restore our God given constitutional rights to be secure in our person and property. And, if my offer falls on deaf ears, then peacefully and legally We the People must again wage a revolution, to restore the visions of our Founding Fathers. We have no choice if the republic is to survive. To join our revolution, go to www.freedomwatchusa.org.

By Hady Amr and Steve Feldstein, opinion contributors - 05/25/17 02:40 PM EDT 30   © Getty With President Trump lurching from crisis to crisis, each more unsettling and damaging than the last, it is time to ask what has previously seemed improbable: Are we approaching the end of the Trump presidency? If Vice President Pence ascends to the top job, what would his foreign policy look like? This may seem premature. Much depends on what actually emerges from special counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry. An actual impeachment may need to wait until after midterm elections are held. Then, they might only proceed if the Democrats regain the majority. But if the unpredictable first 120 days of the Trump presidency are any guide, there is no telling what the coming period will bring. Indeed, it took essentially 120 days — from May 9, 1974, when the House Judiciary Committee opened formal impeachment proceedings against President Nixon, until his resignation on August 9 — for the Watergate scandal to conclude. Beyond impeachment, there's a chance Trump may simply resign.  ADVERTISEMENT The two of us have spent a combined 20 years in the United States government, in key foreign policy institutions — Defense, Homeland Security, State, the Agency for International Development and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — and one of us hails from Pence’s home state of Indiana. Given the current volatility, we thought it important to share ideas on what President Pence’s foreign policy might look like.    Two major aspects would characterize Pence’s foreign policy: a re-embrace of the Republican establishment and an aggressive uptake of Christian social conservative thought.  Among the Republican establishment, particularly the neoconservative wing, Pence has an impeccable reputation. Many describe him as a “hawk’s hawk.” He was a strong proponent of the Iraq War, has vigorously stood up for a strong military and "American values" and, as vice president, has taken on an informal role as an emissary to NATO and other alliances. All of this contrasts starkly to what candidate Trump said on the campaign trail. Likewise, Pence’s evangelical Christian faith is central to his identity. He has proudly built up a reputation as one of the most conservative lawmakers in the country and frequently describes himself as “a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.” There is a high probability that Pence would explicitly embed religious morals in U.S. foreign policy and push an activist social conservative agenda. For example, as the governor of Indiana, Pence signed one of the strictest abortion provisions in the country and approved a controversial law intended to allow businesses to deny services to members of the LGBT community for religious reasons (only after intense blowback did he backtrack). Translated into the foreign policy realm, it is not hard to imagine Pence defending Christian minorities around the world, possibly to the exclusion of other religious groups. He will undoubtedly continue Trump’s expansion of the “global gag rule," and it is possible he may try to push a “clash of civilizations” strategy, primarily seeking alliances with countries that have a “Judeo-Christian” character. But a Pence presidency could also mean re-adopting a “values agenda,” with a greater emphasis on human rights, democracy and development that would be closer in line with President George W. Bush’s policies. Under Bush, funding for development — particularly global health programs — expanded, bringing together an unlikely coalition of secular development advocates and faith-based stakeholders. It is not hard to envision a similar coalition coming together under Pence’s watch. A Pence presidency also may lead to a shoring-up of security and economic alliances. Just as Trump has cast the free-trade regime into jeopardy, castigated NATO (at least before an abrupt about-face last month) and signaled massive funding cuts to the Bretton Woods Institutions, Pence may reverse many of these pronouncements. In the current configuration of the Trump administration, three separate groups tangle for foreign policy primacy: the economic nationalists/populists led by Stephen Bannon, the military pragmatists represented by Secretary of Defense James Mattis and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and the economic globalists fronted by National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Under Pence, the Bannon wing would likely make a quick and graceless exit. The economic globalists and the military pragmatists would stay entrenched in strong positions, but old groups would likely return, such as the neoconservatives and religious faith leaders.  A Pence presidency would bring big style changes. Gone would be the late night tweets and blustery rhetoric. More than likely, “America First” would gradually disappear, with a return to a more traditional form of American exceptionalism. The impulsivity, erratic swings of policy and casual disregard for intelligence and briefing material would also likely pass. These changes alone would considerably ease fears about an accidental stumble into a major war or nuclear confrontation. On the other hand, the divisive culture wars that have framed Pence’s political career would presumably return in a major way and likely spill over into the foreign policy arena.  On a regional basis, we can also expect significant differences. In the Middle East, President Trump has focused on three issues thus far: Israeli-Palestinian peace, countering ISIS and containing Iran. While it is unlikely that President Pence would jettison any of these efforts, what is likely is that he would reprioritize and change the tenor of engagements. On the Israeli-Palestinian front, Pence might be less likely to swing for the fences to achieve an unlikely peace and might side even more closely with Israel. He would also most certainly continue to counter ISIS, but would do so in a manner less aligned with Russia, which might mean more direct pressure on the Syrian regime. On Iran, President Pence would likely not reverse Trump’s policy to both stick to the nuclear agreement but build pressure on Iran through closer ties to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council, but he might inject a push for greater democracy and human rights, which would certainly strain ties. Turning to Asia, Pence’s approach to North Korea may not vary appreciably from the current strategy — ramp up economic pressure and sanctions and convince China to play a more assertive role in reigning in Kim Jong-un — but Pence will refrain from Trump’s Twitter baiting and will tamp down the bellicose rhetoric. Instead, expect a more concerted, behind-the-scenes effort to force the North Korean regime to the negotiating table. When it comes to China, we can anticipate more consistent pushback from Pence, including reestablishing clear markers on the South China Sea and efforts to put together a TPP-like economic alliance to counter China’s ambition.  Finally, there is Russia. If Congress forces Trump out of office, it will be due in large part to charges of collusion with Russia. Undoubtedly, this will reverse the current rapprochement that Trump is engineering. It is also a safe bet that, under Pence, the days of sharing codeword-level intelligence with Russian diplomats in the Oval Office would be over. Most likely, we would see a return to an icy standoff between the United States and Russia, characterized by increasingly hostile rhetoric and mistrust. While we are not advocating impeachment, we view it as increasingly possible. Thus, the implications of a Pence presidency are valuable for all of us to ponder —Democrats and Republicans alike.

COMMENTARY Here's how to not waste your precious BD resources By Bill Scheessele May 25, 2017 EDITOR's NOTE: This is part 2 of a two-part series looking at the strategy and culture of business development. Click here for Part 1. From the discussion in Part I, we recommend an aligned culture and strategy for sustained revenue growth. Business development strategy is a compilation of BD objectives, plans and tactics. BD culture is the embedded BD thinking, including the principles, values and ethics, displayed in support of the strategy. BD Culture - Process:  Proactive Shaping vs. Reactive BD Processes Proactive vs. reactive culture and process are two distinctly different approaches to qualifying  and winning opportunities. The first approach requires proactive, early qualification and shaping. This approach is based on hard facts and validated human intelligence gathered as part of a documented customer engagement process to make informed choices on which opportunities to pursue. The reactive approach is frequently based on assumptions, limited data, limited human intel and what pops up on the latest industry RFP list.  The first approach is driven by a balance between business development purpose and goal. The emphasis is upon creating a personal dialogue with the customer focusing on solutions to problems, including discussion on the technical characteristics or specifications required to solve the problem. The information exchanged is mutually beneficial, with the BD professional focused on the root cause of the requirement; a requirement pull, rather than a solution push. The outcome being the advancement of a business relationship between the two parties. The resulting human intelligence is used to make informed business decisions in order to pursue or not to pursue the opportunity at each stage of the BD lifecycle. The ability to mutually disqualify a pursuit early on enables budget and personnel resources to remain committed to where intel indicates there’s a higher probability of winning business. Proactive vs. Reactive BD Processes Reactive Culture and Process. The second path is categorized by the reactive, RFP capture -driven organization where opportunity identification happens as the RFP is released. The collective mindset is that an aggressive capture effort with best written proposal wins. These organizations base their growth and pursuit decisions upon: If the RFP lists something that matches a key capability. How much capacity currently exists to write the proposal. Who internally might have intel on the opportunity, since it’s likely too late to develop a relationship and secure the intel.   In this type of pursuit, organizations are missing a critical component: the customer’s personal input. In preparation for making a pursue/no pursue decision, BD resources fail to contact the client to build a relationship and discover the real issues that exist. They also fail to discover if the pursuit has already been shaped by a competitor and as such, they are wired to win. Without a person–to-person dialogue and client relationship, there is no internal advocate acting on behalf of the customer.   The proposal is written based upon assumptions and data with the desire to impress the customer with technical knowledge and a possible “unique” solution. Consequently, their probability of win is calculated based upon some assumption or other form of internal validation. If the resulting calculation is greater than a specific number, the opportunity is pursued with time, personnel and attending resources committed. It’s game on, the clock starts running, and B&P funds are committed. Frequently one or more of these reactive RFPs are won, and this is a system that is rationalized that works. B&P resources are then heavily invested to ramp this process up under the rationalized belief this is how the company can sustain growth. Given that rationalization is the key to mental health, the outcome can become a downward spiral of submitting more proposals with an ever-decreasing win percentage, which is then inundated with more proposals attempting to achieve the desired win rate. Industry best practices show that an opportunity identification and qualification process based on the gathering of human intelligence is the “missing link”. Human intelligence is an integral part of your internal and external business procurement procedures in support of your capture and proposal teams and provides critical first person Intel gathered directly from client decision makers and influencers. The key here is to be HUMINT driven, allowing for intelligent and impartial decision-making established with information derived from direct client feedback, not based on internal desires or emotions.   Can an Organization Do Both Proactive Shaping and Reactive Qualification of Different Pursuits? Given the reality of business, there are times when an organization has both processes occurring simultaneously due to different situations or business lines. However, unlike the processes, industry-leading organizations have one predominant BD culture within an organization, and it is the culture that ultimately determines which of the two approaches prevails.     The longer-term shaping of opportunities requires additional time and upfront resources, but produces significant benefits: A pipeline comprised of validated, high probability pursuits. A more streamlined proposal process resulting from the HUMINT developed on the pursuit. Yields a higher win percentage. According to our studies, opportunities where the client was engaged with customers for over one year in advance of the RFP release, had a win rate of over 75 percent. For engagements less than one year, the win rate calculated was less than 40 percent. Imagine the organization resources wasted by reactively “chasing” low probability “pop-up” opportunities.   So how can you move to a more proactive Culture and Process? Successfully shifting to a more proactive BD process depends upon the implementation of an opportunity identification and qualification strategy of bidding smartly, by this we mean having a documented external (CEP) which gathers HUMINT. This is done by asking your prospects the hard questions to fully understand their needs, and then using this information to disqualify low probability or un-shapeable opportunities early in the BD Lifecycle. We train our clients to implement a Smart Capture Philosophy with a proactive BD culture that fosters early shaping of opportunities and a process of early Intel gathering of valuated HUMINT to intelligently choose which opportunities to pursue. This allows the following questions to be answered early in gate review: Can we or have we shaped the relationship? Can we shape the problems/issues? Can we shape the requirements? Can we shape the RFP? Can we position ourselves to win? Is it worth winning? The smart capture philosophy requires ongoing programs of education, coaching and professional development to all personnel involved in customer contact and provides them with the skills, process and discipline to effectively engage in person-to-person dialogue that’s required to secure high value human intelligence. With the ability to obtain human intelligence early in the process, a smart capture decision can be made to invest in shaping the pursuit or to risk investment in a reactive pursuit process.

Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti review: The monster graphics card 4K gamers have... Video Surface Pro 4 vs. Surface Book: How to decide Nvidia’s taking another stab at its “GeForce GTX Battlebox” PC concept, and for the first time, AMD’s finally inside—though obviously not Radeon. Boutique system builders craft Battlebox PCs to minimum specifications laid out by Nvidia. The idea’s similar to any other certification-style program: If you buy a GeForce GTX Battlebox, you’re guaranteed a baseline level of performance. It’s what the legion of failed Steam Machines should’ve offered, and Nvidia’s program launched around the same time as Valve's failed endeavor. Mentioned in this article AMD Ryzen 7 1700 Processor with Wraith Spire LED Cooler $304.93MSRP $329.00View on Amazon Previous Battlebox configurations relied solely on Intel processors, as AMD’s older Bulldozer-based CPUs were decent for budget gaming but lagged far behind top-end Core chips for premium experiences. Ryzen changes that, so for the first time, you’ll be able to buy Nvidia Battlebox PCs with AMD inside. Here’s what you find in the two tiers of Battleboxes. Hit the links to see PCWorld’s verdicts on the hardware: Battlebox Ultimate GPU: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti CPU: Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 (minimum) Memory: 16GB or more DDR4 RAM Battlebox Essential GPU: 6GB GeForce GTX 1080 Ti CPU: Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 (minimum) Memory: 8GB or more DDR4 RAM Nvidia also requires system builders to include SSD storage, Windows 10, and a G-Sync monitor if the system includes a display. Battlebox Ultimate rigs were designed for no-holds-barred gaming experiences, including 4K gaming and virtual reality, while Battlebox Essential PCs are optimized for solid 1080p gameplay. Maingear Maingear Battlebox PCs. You can buy GeForce GTX Battlebox PCs from Origin, Maingear, Digital Storm, Cyberpower, Velocity Micro, and Xidax right now. Mentioned in this article GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition  PCWorld rating $679.89MSRP $699.99View on Amazon Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1080 Ti is the most powerful graphics card ever, capable of no-compromises 4K gaming. It's cheaper than expected, too. Read PCWorld's full review The story behind the story: Nvidia’s Battleboxes don’t come cheap, but custom-built systems never do. Boutique PC builders not only create gorgeous systems (with impeccable cable management), they deliver a DIY-like PC experience without DIY headaches. All of the building and testing is done for you, and boutique builders back up their systems with crucial technical support and warranties. Sure, you can probably build similar PCs for less if you don’t mind rolling up your sleeves, but there’s a lot to be said for just opening the box and gaming on rigs like these. And Nvidia’s GeForce GTX Battlebox certification means you know what you’re getting into. Now if only Nvidia actually sold the fancy angular Battlebox case shown at the top of this post, rather than just using it for marketing… To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

I've been using one almost full time for the last two months. Here's the good and the bad on this tiny ultrabook. By Robin Harris for Storage Bits | May 25, 2017 -- 13:27 GMT (06:27 PDT) | Topic: Apple I've been using the MacBook for hours every day -- doing everything from writing to light gaming and photo and video editing. Here's what I've learned about the mid-range 'Book. Not your father's MacBook The two-year-old MacBook reboot is nothing like its namesake. It costs more than the MacBook Air, the machine that once defined Ultrabooks. That buys features that make the once elite MacBook Air the entry-level Mac notebook: Excellent Retina display. Just over 2-pound weight. Force Touch trackpad. Quiet, fan-less design. Clean keyboard backlighting. The MacBook Air's chief spec advantage is its Thunderbolt 2 port. Useful if you plan to use it as a desktop, too. Versus MacBook Pro see also iPad Pro vs MacBook: Which to buy and why Weighing getting a svelte MacBook against an iPad Pro? I just went through the decision tree myself. Here's what I learned - and bought. Read More The non-Touch Bar 13-inch MacBook Pro has better specs. For $50 less than a loaded MacBook, you get two Thunderbolt 3 ports, better graphics, faster CPU, larger display, and almost a pound of more weight. MacBook portability costs. I chose the MacBook for portability as a quad-core Retina iMac handles my desktop chores. Versus the 12.9-inch iPad Pro? Here's the rundown.. The good news: The MacBook price is in line with similarly spec'd Windows Ultrabooks. No Apple tax. Keyboard I'm an unfussy touch typist. The MacBook keys have little travel. If you like hammering the keys, you probably won't like it. But after a few days, I got used to its light touch. Another surprise: The MacBook keyboard backlight has no light spill. More pleasant in low light conditions. Applications I mostly write in lightweight text editors, and sometimes in Apple's Pages. But Scrivener, the long-form writing app I'm using for a novel, has several hundred megabytes of research and is just as perky on the MacBook as it is on the quad-core iMac. Gaming The MacBook is not a gamer's machine, but it runs Valve's Half Life 2 and the puzzle game The Witness well. The action is smooth and the system responsive. The MacBook gets warm, but not much. Read also: Apple needs to learn to love Android and Windows | Best MacBook and Mac accessories | Speed up your Mac in a few clicks with CleanMyMac 3 | How I saved nearly $7,000 on Apple gear this year In theory, Intel's 515 graphics aren't as good the Intel 6000 graphics on the MacBook Air -- with 48 shader processing units -- but I don't see any difference. And, of course, the 515 is in a 5-watt part, while the 6000 is 15 watts. Video editing I have a 50GB video project. Full HD video, with the FCP Library stored on the MacBook system SSD. No heavy effects -- jump cuts, simple titles -- and skimming is painless, tool switching is fast, and the display is lovely. Downside: The m7 processor chokes on transcoding. If you use a camcorder that writes ProRes, the MacBook would work for rough cuts. It's amazing that it works as well as it does on this tiny machine. Stability The MacBook ran flawlessly for 34 days before I shut it down for an OS upgrade. My mail and browser are open all the time, as well as a VPN, and a variety of other apps are opened and closed daily. Solid! The Storage Bits take The display was the main reason I upgraded. I recently got high-end lens implants in both eyes and now can tell the difference between Retina and non-Retina displays. But I've also noticed that my 3-pound, 13-inch MacBook Air was getting heavier, so the 2-pound MacBook was an upgrade there too. Finally, the 7 hour battery life of my 2012 i7 MacBook Air had caused me problems, which the MacBook's 10-hour battery eliminated. And the performance isn't much different. But is the top of the line -- fast 500GB SSD, 8GB RAM, 1.3GHz m7 -- MacBook worth it? For email and browsing, absolutely not. Save hundreds with a MacBook Air, or more with a consumer Windows machine or a Chromebook. But I'm a pro user. I'm always working remotely, even in my home office, and my livelihood depends on reliable kit. So, that's the final piece of the puzzle for me. Apple notebooks are simply more reliable than other brands. Reliability is an investment that pays long term dividends.

Intel's Thunderbolt 3 controllers have swept away some of this confusion by providing USB 3.1 Gen2 support along with Thunderbolt's swift 40 Gb/s transfer rate, ensuring that a USB Type-C connector hooked up to such a controller will Just Work™ with most any USB Type-C device. Thunderbolt 3 also lets PC makers implement the USB Power Delivery standard so that a USB Type-C port can charge a notebook PC's battery. Partially because Thunderbolt 3 relies on a discrete controller chip at the moment, however, manufacturers have reserved the feature for premium notebooks and motherboards—if it's implemented at all. This morning, Intel announced plans to spur adoption of Thunderbolt by integrating support for the protocol directly into its future CPUs and making the Thunderbolt protocol specification available under a "nonexclusive, royalty-free license" in 2018. That means third-party peripheral manufacturers can start developing their own Thunderbolt-compatible controllers, as well. Intel's integration of Thunderbolt into the CPU should be an appealing move for notebook and tablet designers who might have otherwise balked at finding room for another discrete component in today's increasingly thin-and-light PCs. Potentially, the technology could do away with the need for proprietary docking connectors on devices like Microsoft's Surfaces. It could also allow for the development of blistering external storage and single-cable VR headsets. There's plenty to like about the idea of Thunderbolt everywhere. Intel being Intel, however, we'd expect to see significant feature segmentation by price point with Thunderbolt-equipped silicon. Less-expensive PCs might get only the USB 3.1 side of the bargain (or even fewer features), while Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs might be the only ones with every feature of the Thunderbolt controller flipped on. We'll have to wait and see just how the company's more open approach to Thunderbolt is received by the PC industry and peripheral manufacturers as time goes on, but we're still hopeful that the technology will be the one to drive every USB Type-C port from here on out.

Intel The move has major implications, as it would make it much easier for hardware manufacturers to embed the technology in their devices. Thunderbolt 3 is one of the standards currently in use for USB Type-C ports, which they switched to from mini display ports in the previous generation. Thunderbolt 3 is widely considered to be one of the most versatile USB-C applications available, with both fast transfer speeds of up to 40 Gbps and fast charging, not to mention it connects to 4K devices. However, Intel’s licensing fees have made it so that it’s more expensive to use, which is why he technology has been sparsely used in the past six years of its existence. Now, the company is getting rid of that fee, in hopes it broaden USB Type-C’s adoption across the device ecosystem.  Intel is also supposedly working to integrate Type-C into upcoming CPUs, something that should help speed up that adoption rate.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Security Properties Acquires Andante Apartments in Phoenix, AZ SEATTLE, May 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — On May 22, 2017, Security Properties and Pacific Life Insurance Company purchased Andante Apartments, a 576-unit multifamily property built in 2000 and located in Phoenix, AZ, for $85,250,000.  Security Properties now owns a total of five assets in the Phoenix marketplace. Andante is located within the highly desired Phoenix suburb of Ahwatukee. Located in the valley’s southeast corner, Ahwatukee is best characterized by its affluent demographic, low crime rate, strong school district and close proximity to employment corridors. Additionally, the suburb’s unique location at the foothills of the 16,000 acre South Mountain Park provides residents a convenient escape to over 50 miles of hiking, biking and horseback riding trails.  Onsite, residents enjoy access to multiple retail centers including Lakeside Plaza, just one mile west with Trader Joes, Safeway and Fry’s as well as the Ahwatukee Foothill Towne Center one mile to the north and anchored by Target, Best Buy and Home Depot Ahwatukee is adjacent to the Chandler submarket, home to the largest concentration of technology jobs in the entire state. The corridor includes approximately 25,000 jobs including: Intel (11,400 jobs), Wells Fargo (5,100 jobs with a planned expansion to 12,000 jobs), Bank of America (3,900 jobs), Freescale Semiconductor (3,000 jobs), PayPal (1,900 jobs) and Microchip (1,600 jobs). Additionally, Intel recently announced it is investing ~$7B to complete a state-of-the-art semiconductor production facility at its Ocotillo Campus, which is located approximately 12 minutes southeast of Andante and expected to add over 3,000 new jobs.  The business plan is to renovate the clubhouse to offer top of the market amenities.  The interiors will also be updated to a final scope that includes lowering the bar top and installing new hard surface countertops, appliances, flooring, paint, lighting fixtures and plumbing fixtures.  The renovated units will still be priced materially below new construction rents providing a great value proposition for the area. According to Davis Vaughn, Director at Security Properties, the acquisition was made because, „Ahwatukee has been a target submarket for us for years.  With excellent schools and demographics, plus proximity to high-paying jobs, all of the fundamentals were in place at Andante for us to implement our value-add reposition program.” The property will be managed by Security Properties-affiliate Madrona Ridge Residential.

(NASDAQ: SMCI), a global leader in compute, storage and networking technologies including green computing, announces the new (SSG-6048R-E1CR45H/L) 45-Bay, capacity maximized, top loading, 4U, storage server that is 17% shorter than 60-bay systems. The 45-Bay system supports Dual Intel® Xeon® processors and complements our existing, 60 and 90 bay, top-loading, storage systems. Supermicro’s 45, 60 and 90-Bay Storage Servers The new 45-Bay storage server comes with the industry's most flexible and innovative design. It features tiered storage, packing hot, warm and cold storage in one compact 4U enclosure.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 24 great B2B and B2C brand journalism sites Advocate Heath Care is asking whether breastfed babies are smarter. Semiconductor chip maker Intel has insights on the top five most impressive game explosions. Power drink maker Red Bull wants you to know about three generations of a high-flying family and its “skytyping” business. All three are examples of a trend that has accelerated in the past six years: brand journalism sites. Recently, I was asked for stellar examples. After hitting up several experts, I offer the list below. Why practice brand journalism? Ragan Communications chief executive Mark Ragan, a former national political reporter and an early advocate of brand journalism, offers his philosophy: Stop begging the media, and become the media yourself. “Newsrooms have been decimated,” Ragan says. “If you want your company’s story told, you’d better write it or shoot it yourself. “But brand journalism works only if your story is credible, is helpful to the reader and eschews all corporate-speak and jargon. If the story is self-serving or it is designed to sell, it’s not brand journalism. It’s marketing.” (Ragan heads Ragan Consulting Group, which works with businesses to establish brand journalism sites.) From videos to white papers David Meerman Scott , another early advocate, defines brand journalism as the creation of web content—videos, blog posts, photos, charts, graphs, essays, e-books, white papers—that deliver value to the marketplace and position organizations as worthy of doing business with. “Brand journalism is not a product pitch,” he says. “It is not an advertorial. It is not an egotistical spewing of gobbledygook-laden corporate drivel.” He adds that those with the traditional skills of marketing, public relations, advertising and copywriting are not the right people to create brand journalism content. “Instead, you need the skills of a journalist,” he says. [RELATED: Learn how to infuse storytelling and great writing into all your communications at the Business Writing Summit.] Here are the sites we came up with: B2B brand journalism The good news, for a B2B company, is that you needn’t sit out this trend as flashy B2C companies like Red Bull hog the limelight. Consider the following. Cisco Systems, the networking hardware company, covers everything from innovative technology hitting the theater stage to IT that skills offer opportunities for Jordanian women. American Express’ OPEN Forum started out as a forum for small businesses, but it has grown into a leading brand journalism site. And just how is virtual reality going to shape the future of consumer experiences? IQ by Intel, in showcasing technology, offers not only the explosions article, but one on athletes and fans preparing for an e-sports competition Down Under. Adobe’s CMO will fill you in about everything from artificial intelligence to the U.S. Census Bureau, all in an effort to interest potential customers in the marketing department. Guys, HSBC Global Connections (and your female colleagues) think it’s high time you figured out “What Women Want—And What Businesses Need To Know.” GE has experimented with polished Facebook Live-casts tied to the Rio Olympics and “drome week.” If you’ve ever wondered how pilots rescue people from an avalanche in the Italian Alps, here’s where to go. UPS’ Longitudes has hosted series on trade and offers a piece titled, “3D Printing—Evolution Rather than Revolution.” Boeing has provided a wealth of stories and videos for aviation fans. A Veterans Day feature might sound internal: “Corps Education: Employees share how lessons learned during militaryservice have helped them at Boeing.” Because the aerospace company’s customers include the Pentagon and many veterans in the airlines industry, it made sense as an outward-facing story, as well. Speaking of the Pentagon, Scott recommends the U.S. military’s Armed with Science site. Where else could you find out how the military is capturing sunlight at Nellis Air Force Base? B2C brand journalism Although giant consumer brands such as Coca-Cola were pathfinders in this area, many hospitals have joined the stampede as they find the public is eager for news about health care and healthy living. Coca-Cola Journey fills us in on testing augmented reality for bottling equipment maintenance. It’s also a good place to go if you want to see how a 125-year-old company digs into its archives for interesting story ideas. (Just who was Dr. Joseph Jacobs?) The Red Bulletin stays true to its adventure-seeking theme, because after all, don’t we all feel like diving with killer whales in Norway after guzzling a sports drink? Walmart Today, which has been highlighting a major U.S. manufacturing initiative, reports on a Polish candle-making company (and Walmart supplier) that put one of its factories in the United States. Advocate’s health enews offers good-living advice from doctors, nutritionists and other experts. Advocate isn’t the only hospital in this arena. Cleveland Clinic is the granddaddy in the field, and Cape Cod Health and Health Beat at Spectrum Health provide similar information in their markets. Among other things, Cape Cod will tell you what to do if your child is a picky eater. (Ragan consulted on Advocate, Spectrum and Cape Cod Health’s sites.) The Cleveland Metropolitan School District has also jumped in on the trend, with stories such as the one on a senior who won a $40,000 scholarship in a “Stop the Hate” contest. Alberta Energy Regulator’s reSource—like Denver Water’s Tap, Duke Energy’s Illumination and Omaha Public Power District’s The Wire—proves that utilities can get in on the game. (Ragan also provided consulting or training for these companies.) JLL, a professional services and investment management company, shows how companies needn’t be constricted by a limited definition of what interests their clientele. The latest issue reports on the surge in skyscraper hotels and how India is making cites safe for women. The site earned coverage in The Wall Street Journal. Universities are getting in on the act, too. Metropolitan State University Denver has a new brand journalism site that tells about teaming up with the IRS’ Criminal Investigative Unit (also a Ragan client). An international consortium of universities offers scientific research in a journalism format at Futurity, where you can find out what mice and rats can teach us about anorexia. Upset that we left something out? No need to release underfed lab rats in our Chicago office or skywrite your disappointment over Lake Michigan. Just add your favorites to the comments.

Among other things, Cape Cod will tell you what to do if your child is a picky eater. (Ragan consulted on Advocate, Spectrum and Cape Cod Health’s sites.) The Cleveland Metropolitan School District has also jumped in on the trend, with stories such as the one on a senior who won a $40,000 scholarship in a “Stop the Hate” contest. Alberta Energy Regulator’s reSource—like Denver Water’s Tap, Duke Energy’s Illumination and Omaha Public Power District’s The Wire—proves that utilities can get in on the game. (Ragan also provided consulting or training for these companies.) JLL, a professional services and investment management company, shows how companies needn’t be constricted by a limited definition of what interests their clientele. The latest issue reports on the surge in skyscraper hotels and how India is making cites safe for women. The site earned coverage in The Wall Street Journal. Universities are getting in on the act, too. Metropolitan State University Denver has a new brand journalism site that tells about teaming up with the IRS’ Criminal Investigative Unit (also a Ragan client). An international consortium of universities offers scientific research in a journalism format at Futurity, where you can find out what mice and rats can teach us about anorexia. Upset that we left something out? No need to release underfed lab rats in our Chicago office or skywrite your disappointment over Lake Michigan. Just add your favorites to the comments.

Home Secretary Amber Rudd warned the U.S. Wednesday about “irritating” leaks despite assurances from American officials. Images from the attack appeared in The New York Times just hours later, which was the final straw for British authorities. Prime Minister Theresa May will raise the issue with President Donald Trump at a NATO summit Thursday in Brussels. Officials believe the leaks are coming from U.S. law enforcement, rather than the White House. The same leaks appeared after the 7/7 bombings on the London subway system in 2005, when 52 people were killed by four suicide bombers in coordinated attacks. “I’m afraid it just reminds me exactly of what happened after 7/7 when the U.S. published a complete picture of the way the bombs in 7/7 had been made up and we had the same protests,” said Lord Ian Blair, the former chief of the Metropolitan Police, according to The Guardian. U.S. media outlets released the initial death toll and details about the attack before British police released the information to the U.K. media.

The Elbrus-8S packs eight cores, and is manufactured using a 28 nanometer process. In comparison, the current-generation Intel Kaby Lake processors use a 14-nanometer process. According to Ruselectronics, the chip is between three and five times faster than the previous Elbrus-4S processor, and has I/O channels that are eight times higher. The Elbrus-4S, which came out in 2015, was sharply derided in the tech press for slow performance, with PC World editor Mark Hachman comparing it a CPU from 1999. While the Elbrus-8S doesn’t compare to contemporary Intel and AMD silicon, it does represent a significant leap forward. Ruselectronics also said that the chip contains features that “guarantees its users a high level of information security,” although it’s not immediately obvious what these are. The PC running this chip, called the Elbrus 801-PC, runs a Linux-based operating system called the Elbrus OS. In addition to applications built for the platform, it can also run x86/x86-64 applications through a compatibility layer, although I imagine that comes with a pretty steep performance hit. In recent years, Russia has attempted to wean itself off US-made technology with its own domestic offerings. The justification for this is part economic, but also from a national security perspective. Last year, it announced that it is working on a Sailfish-based operating system as the basis of its own Android-alternative, which will be used within Russian government agencies and state-owned corporations. The country is also home to a thriving hardware scene, with several indigenous computer manufacturers and silicon makers. Last May, Russian brand T-Platforms released a 21.5-inch all-in-one computer running a MIPS-based Baikal-T1 SoC from Baikal Electronics. Deputy CEO of Ruselectronics Arseny Brykin said that we can expect the first batch of PCs running the Elbrus-8S by the second quarter of 2017. Is the Elbrus-8S likely to dethrone Intel — or at least pose a realistic threat to the company? No. But I’m a big fan of competition, and I’d love to see the desktop silicon world become anything but a two horse race.

With this acquisition, Groupe Renault will be bringing in a full spectrum of skills to reinforce developments in next-generation embedded vehicle software. This brings valuable experience in areas such as personalized services and remote, autonomous, realtime updates with no outside intervention. This acquisition is right in line with Groupe Renault’s strategy of offering new connected services and improving the experience of its customers. The Intel employees joining Renault hold highly relevant skills in what is a strong competitive technical field, where the Alliance is one of the world leaders. Groupe Renault thereby continues to support French innovation and economic development in France. —Carlos Ghosn, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Renault Intel’s French R&D teams hold established software development expertise complementary to Renault’s. They’ll be bringing Renault expertise, advanced methods and tools, plus access to a sound network of suppliers, laboratories and partner companies. Some teams already have automotive-specific skills in multimedia and connectivity. The acquisition operation will proceed by Groupe Renault purchasing a company formed by Intel to take in the embedded software R&D activity at the Toulouse and Sophia Antipolis sites in France. The new company will be attached to the Groupe Renault Alliance Systems Engineering Department. Finalization of the acquisition is pending on the conditions normally applicable to this kind of operation, and should be completed by the second half of 2017.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 26, 2:43 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Acer Announces Nitro 5 Gaming Laptop, Upgraded Convertible & Two Android Tablets By Ken Manbert Salcedo On 05/25/17 AT 5:24 AM Close Acer has announced the Nitro 5, a new gaming laptop designed for casual gamers. The computer maker also announced a 2-in-1 machine, as well as two Iconia Android tablets. Acer Nitro 5 The Acer Nitro 5 gaming laptop is being offered in several configurations. The laptop can come with Intel’s 7th-generation Core i5 or i7 processors, which can go alongside the Nvidia GeForce GTC 1050 Ti GPU. There’s also an option for an AMD GPU, and customers will be able to choose from the A-Series FX, A12 and A10 APUs with up to a Radeon RX 550 GPU, according to Digital Trends. “The Nitro 5 series provides a good balance of powerful features with a sharp and stylish design,” Acer said in its press release. “Acer is offering a variety of configurations that feature popular graphics and processors, providing consumers with a wide selection to meet different budgets and needs.” All configurations of the Nitro 5 will come with Windows 10, and can be configured to come with 32GB of DDR4 2400 MHz RAM. Some models, depending on region, can come with up to 512GB of PCIe SSD storage. Customers also have the option of pairing that SSD with an additional HDD storage of up to 2TB. Acer has also added its dual-fan Coolboost technology as the gaming laptop’s thermal solution. The company says that it will be able to deliver heightened fan speeds and cooling ability, and will also give users manual control over it when necessary. The Nitro 5 comes with a 15.6-inch full HD 1080p IPS display, one USB Type-C port, one USB 3.0 port, two USB 2.0 ports and an HDMI 2.0 port, which Acer says can support up to 90 Hz refresh rates. Unfortunately, no information was given about the Nitro 5’s battery capacity. The Acer Nitro 5 will be available in North America in July with a starting price of $799. New Acer Spin 1 This is actually more of an updated version of Acer’s Spin 1 convertible notebook from last year, according to Engadget. The new Spin 1 now comes with a 14mm metal chassis and some new hardware. The new Acer Spin 1 comes with Intel’s Celeron or Pentium processors with 2GB of DDR3L RAM eMMC storage options of 32GB, 64GB and 128GB. It also comes with an 11.6-inch full HD 1080p touchscreen display, one USB 3.1 port, one USB 2.0 port, one HDMI port and a microSD card slot. Like its predecessor, users will be able to prop up the new Acer Spin 1 in tent, display or tablet mode thanks to the return of the 360-degree hinge. The company didn’t give out the device’s battery capacity, but Acer claims that the new Spin 1 has an eight-hour battery life. The new Acer Spin 1 is also set to arrive in North America in July starting at $329. Acer Iconia Tab 10 and One 10  Acer also announces a pair of new Android tablets with the Iconia Tab 10 and Iconia One 10. Both come with 10-inch IPS displays, five magnet speakers with DTS-HD Premium Sound, quad-core MediaTek processors and Android 7.0 Nougat. Although the two tablets share a lot in common, each are targeting specific crowds. The Iconia Tab 10 is the premium device from the two, and is intended for consuming media. This is why the Iconia Tab 10’s display comes with Quantum Dot technology, which provides a wider color range, higher brightness levels, better color accuracy and deeper saturation. The Iconia One 10 on the other hand is intended for enhanced productivity. The most important feature on this tablet is that users can charge and connect external devices to it. This means that users will be able to connect additional external storage and more accessories like a mouse and keyboard. It comes equipped with two microUSB ports, one of which comes with On-The-Go (OTG) support. Acer didn’t give out details on pricing, availability and other specifications for the new Iconia tablets. The company is epected to announce more details on the Nitro 5, the new Spin and its new pair of 10-inch Android tablets during Computex 2017 in Taipei, Taiwan which kicks off on May 30, according to CNET. Acer just announced a new gaming laptop called the Nitro 5, along with a pair of 10-inch Android tablets and an upgraded Spin 1 convertible PC.

Quickly fix PC issues and prevent others from happening with this software: Download ReimagePlus (100% safe download and endorsed by us). Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. It seems like the Apple’s iPad Pro is facing a new enemy, which is Microsoft’s new Surface Pro. Microsoft brought up the new device at a media event in Shanghai and is already available on the market! The company says that their new product is better than the iPad Pro. Let’s find out if they’re right! Display The Apple company launched the 12.9in version of iPad Pro in 2015 which is very close to the size of its enemy. A year after, a smaller 9.7in display version was launched in March. When it comes to the design, the new Surface Pro is basically the same. The Surface Pro is 292 x 201 x 8.5mm, weighing 1.69 lbs for Intel m3 version and 1.72lbs for the Intel Core i7 version. Dimensions iPad Pro, however, is 12.9in and 305.7 x 220.6 x 6.9mm. It’s slightly thinner than the new Surface Pro and also lighter at 1.57lbs for the Wi-Fi version and 1.59lbs for the Cellular model (which also includes Wi-Fi). Design The Apple iPad Pro has the same typical design as we all expected, You’re getting it in Space Grey, Rose Gold and Gold colors. Surface Pro comes in a Platinum color but there will be more to choose from, soon enough. The new Surface Keyboard is also available, wrapped in Alcantara material. Although the cover of this keyboard will add an extra 0.68lbs, Microsoft thinks that this is the most luxurious keyboard ever created. Apple’s Smart Keyboard comes with an additional 0.74lbs to your device, which is heavier than the Microsoft’s. Camera In this field, Apple gives us 2 options: an 8 MP rear camera with a 1.2 MP front camera for the iPad Pro, or a 12 MP rear camera and a 5 MP front camera for the newer 9.7in iPad Pro, perfect for those who consider this feature important. The 12.9in iPad Pro tablet can run 1080p videos but the recent one can easily record 4K. You can get an 8 MP rear camera and a 5 MP front camera along with 1080p video support, when buying Microsoft’s new device. Prices In India, the iPad comes at a price of 65.900 Rs if you aim for the 32 GB version with Wi-Fi, and 81.900 Rs for the 256 GB one. The Cellular version coupled with Wi-Fi is now 85.900 and 93.900 Rs for the 128 and 256 GB versions, respectively. Unlike Apple, Microsoft offers a wide range of options. The Surface Pro’s price starts at $799 if you want the 128 GB version, accompanied by Intel Core m3 processor and 4 GB RAM. For the Intel Core i5 version, the price is $999. For the price of $1299, you receive the 256 GB version, coupled with i5 processor and 8 GB RAM. In order to get the new i7 version of the processor, you need to have $1599 or $2199 for extra 8 GB RAM and 512 GB solid-state drive. Of course, there is also the 1 TB version, at $2699 for those who can afford it, but if you are a student you can easily get a discount.

The Essel Group (Zee) will continue to hold 20% in the company. Ebiz is a supplier of on-demand software and e-commerce services. Ebix supplies software to the insurance, financial, e-governance and healthcare industries, and currently operates in 40 countries, including India. Under the terms of the agreement, ItzCash, which is probably India’s oldest wallet company, was valued at a total of approximately $150 million. Ebix will pay upfront cash of $76 million and a contingent earn out of up to $44 million payable over a period of 3 years from the closing of the deal. This is the second instance of a listed company buying a wallet license holder in India, after Calpian bought Money On Mobile, in 2014. Note that ItzCash is increasing its offerings and is looking at the Ebix investment to diversify into the insurance segment. Ebix has a telemedicine service and wants to create an offering for consumers through ItzCash’s physical 75,000 outlets. “It offers insurance carriers and brokers a gateway into reaching out to this vast network described above, helping create new integrated insurance and finance offerings,” the company said in a statement. The investment will also allow ItzCash to expand to markets like Australia and Brazil where Ebix has expertise in distribution. Advertisement ItzCash is among the oldest payments cards companies, beginning in 2006 as a prepaid card and wallet service. It also expanded into a domestic remittance service business with franchise operations as ItzCash World Financials and new businesses The payments company has reported revenues of Rs 250 crores for the financial year 2016-17 (FY17), a growth of 40% year on year (from approximately Rs 180 crore), and more importantly, turned profitable. Bhavik Vasa, Chief Growth Officer at Itz Cash said in a statement that the company is now diversifying into financial services and corporate products. Some of the new businesses started by ItzCash include: – Cross-border remittance: It partnered with Prabhu Money Transfer, a remittance company in Nepal, allowing Nepali migrants in India to send money back home. – Third party POS terminals: The company said in April that it will deploy 100,000 POS terminals targeting small businesses and shopkeepers in the year. It had started the POS business in early December 2016 and so far has deployed 30,000 terminals. This is a new segment for ItzCash, and is a space that already has competition from Mswipe, Ezetap, Oxigen and PayU. – Invested in Finly: In February, ItzCash made an undisclosed equity investment in Bangalore-based expense management company Finly which works in the corporate expense management space. –  BBPOU: In July 2016, it got an approval from the RBI to launch a Bharat Bill Payments Operating Unit (BBPOU). The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) set up the Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS), a centralized interoperable bill payment system. BBPOUs are units which can create an agent network and will be responsible for on-boarding billers and aggregators. 011 Related #Digital Payments #Ebix #Internet #itzcash #Mobile Related ItzCash clocks in Rs 6,000 crore in utility bills transactions in 2015-16 Accel-funded HealthcareMagic gets acquired by US-based Ebix ItzCash can issue virtual and NFC cards through a deal with Visa ItzCash enters the POS machine business; targets 100,000 merchants ItzCash has got a licence to set up an operating unit under the BBPS ItzCash makes equity investment in expense management company Finly < Previous Next > Free data app maker Mavin partners with Chola Finance for loyalty program AI & IoT focused venture capital firm pi Ventures secures $3M from IFC Daily Newsletter Sponsored All Introducing our Digital Payments in India Report: Demonetization Edition – #Ad Why the Indian startup scenario needs an event like STARup 2017 – #Ad Take your venture to the next level with Conquest 2017! – #Ad 5th SpicyIP Fellowship 2017-18: Applications Close on March 10 – #Ad Final call for #NAMApolicy: Fake News, Rumors & Online Content Regulation, 22nd Feb, Delhi – #ad More in Ebix NASDAQ listed Ebix acquires 80% in Itz Cash for $120 million Accel-funded HealthcareMagic gets acquired by US-based Ebix Digital Jobs Hiring Marketing Manager & Executive in Pune Require Hardware Engineer For Cashgate Scandal Malawi Compositor Executive – Social media marketing Area Sales Manager Comments Anand: I have decided I will close my bank account give...

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Chuwi SurBook 12.3 inch Apollo Lake tablet launches for $299 and up (for crowdfunding early birds) 05/24/2017 at 5:00 AM by Brad Linder 3 Comments Chuwi’s 12.3 inch tablet with a Microsoft Surface Pro-style display is now up for pre-order from crowdfunding site Indiegogo. Like Microsoft’s premium tablet, the SurBook features a 2736 x 1824 pixel display and a built-in kickstand that lets you connect an optional keyboard and use the tablet like a notebook PC (on a flat surface, anyway). But while Microsoft’s newest Surface Pro sells for $799 and up, Chuwi is offering its tablet for as little as $299 to early bird backers of the Indieogogo campaign. One key difference? Microsoft’s new Suface Pro tablets have Intel Kaby Lake processors. The Chuwi SurBook has a 6 watt Intel Celeron N3450 Apollo Lake processor. You’ll also probably get better build quality and support from Microsoft, as well as support for that fancy new Surface Pen.  But if you’re looking for a budget option, there’s a lot to like about the SurBook. The tablet featrues 6GB of RAM, a USB Type-C port and two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, a 10,000 mAh battery and an optional pen and detachable keyboard. Chuwi’s tablet measures 11.7″ x 8″ x 0.37″ and weighs about 2.1 pounds without a keyboard, and the company says it should offer up to 8 hours of battery life. It’s also fanless, has a magnesium alloy body, and features 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 and stereo speakers. A pledge of $299 reserves a tablet with 64GB of storage that should ship in July. Or you can pledge $349 for the same tablet plus a keyboard and a pen with support for 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity. And a $399 pledge reserves a 128GB tablet/keyboard/pen combo. Those prices are only available for the first 200 Indiegogo pledges at each level though. After that, the prices go up to: $369 for a 64GB tablet $473 for a 64GB tablet/pen/keyboard combo $498 for a 128GB tablet/pen/keyboard combo Note that this is actually the second time we’ve written about the launch of an Indiegogo campaign for this tablet. It looks like someone jumped the gun last week by launching a campaign a bit early, and then pulling down the web page. This time Chuwi gave me a heads up that the campaign is set to go live, so I’m pretty sure the campaign isn’t going anywhere. Chuwi is a pretty well established PC maker in China at this point and the company probably doesn’t need to run a crowdfunding campaign for the new tablet. The campaign goal is set at $30,000 which is not nearly enough to cover the costs of research, design, and manufacturing this sort of tablet. But a crowdfunding campaign does provide a way to build some buzz and gauge the level of interest in the product.

For instance I was looking at Clevo’s laptop range and only the desktop-equivalents (which I refuse to call laptops) have it. Among tablets, I think we’re limited to the Dell XPS 12 but I’m not 100% sure on that. I have yet to see it on anything coming out of china’s design houses.

This subtly named model is the new flagship Intel Z270-based motherboard in MSI's Gaming series, and thus displaces the well-reviewed Z270 Gaming M7. Though now officially unveiled, MSI did not provide an extensive specifications breakdown for this new model. However, certain elements can be deduced just by looking at the motherboard itself. First and foremost, given its unusually large width, this is clearly an Extended ATX form factor model. This is most evident if you look at the amount of PCB space between the DDR4 memory slots and the edge of the motherboard. In that top-right corner you will also notice a debug LED, power and reset buttons, and the familiar MSI Game Boost Knob. The Z270 GODLIKE appears to have good storage connectivity, with one U.2 port, six SATA 6Gb/s ports, one USB 3.1 Gen2 header, two USB 3.0 headers, and three USB 2.0 headers. The triple M.2 slots with M.2 Shields are obviously one of the defining features of this new model. There are four steel-reinforced mechanical PCIe x16 slots, as well as a single PCIe x1 slot. The onboard audio duties are handled by the new AUDIO BOOST 4 XTREME implementation, which features fully isolated audio circuitry, an ESS DAC, and two audio CODECs that will allow gamers the option of using headphones and speakers at the same time. As you would expect on a gaming motherboard released in 2017, MSI's Mystic Light RGB LED lightning feature has clearly found its way to the Z270 GODLIKE GAMING. There are fifteen RGB LEDs spread throughout the motherboard, all of which can be independently controlled, along with a 4-pin header that can power an LED light strip. Thanks to the Mystic Light Sync integration, the included Phanteks Rainbow Strip can be made to match the colors and effects of the onboard RGB LEDs. This same sync concept applies to any future Mystic Light Sync compatible products. One interesting development is that the Z270 GODLIKE Gaming is going to be first motherboard to utilize the brand new ASMedia ASM3142 USB 3.1 Gen2 host controller. While we don't know much about the new controller, it is the clear successor to the ASM2142, which was the first USB 3.1 Gen2 controller connected with two PCIe 3.0 lanes and thus capable of handling up to 16Gb/s. ASMedia claims that the new ASM3142 controller will not only improve performance, but consume at least 50% less power than previous USB controllers. The performance claims are interesting, since the ASM2142 already had a pretty solid performance advantage over the Intel Alpine Ridge controllers.  Another industry first - and apparently an exclusive feature - is the inclusion of Rivet's new Killer xTend technology. By combining the network capabilities of three Killer E2500 LAN controllers and an onboard Killer Wireless-AC 1535 WiFi module, Killer xTend essentially turns the motherboard into both a network switch and a Wi-Fi extender. How these network expansion capabilities work for a wired setup is that one of the three ethernet ports act as a WAN port - in other words the internet input - while the other two act as conventional LAN ports to which you can connect other PCs or even gaming consoles. The Wi-Fi module can be used to wirelessly connect the primary gaming PC to the internet, or as a 867Mbps wireless link to the other PCs/connected devices when using a wired internet connection, or it can even handle both wireless connections when acting as a Wi-Fi range extender. This removes the need to purchase additional networking hardware, simplifies configuration, and of course prioritizes traffic to the Killer-powered gaming PC over that of other connected devices. We have no word with regard to pricing or availability, but we definitely expect additional information at Computex 2017.

POST A COMMENT 14 Comments View All Comments Renagade - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link A flagship MB like this, and STILL a PS/2 connector. When will those go away? Reply unityofsaints - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link PS/2 has n-key rollover, USB doesn't. Also, when extreme overclocking (e.g. LN2), USB can hurt stability. Reply fazalmajid - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link Will n-key rollover still work when it's not a real PS/2 keyboard but a USB one with adapter, as most are nowadays? Reply Samus - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link Of course. The keyboard controller detects when PS/2 is used and can simply pass more simultaneous keystrokes (or more specifically...simultaneous grid connections) Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Thursday, May 25, 2017 - link You're not wrong, but the technical reason is that keystrokes detected over a PS/2 port are treated as hardware interrupts, which basically halts CPU's current processing to immediately handle what caused the hardware interrupt (in this case, it needs to immediately register that a key was pressed). It doesn't poll the port (as USB does) at a regular interval to detect if any changes happened, it simply registers the key stroke immediately. Additional Reading: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt "Hardware interrupts are used by devices to communicate that they require attention from the operating system.[2] Internally, hardware interrupts are implemented using electronic alerting signals that are sent to the processor from an external device, which is either a part of the computer itself, such as a disk controller, or an external peripheral. For example, pressing a key on the keyboard or moving the mouse triggers hardware interrupts that cause the processor to read the keystroke or mouse position." https://superuser.com/questions/341215/is-there-a-... "While it is very useful for mice, it's just about meaningless for keyboards. Let's assume for a minute that all switches have the 5ms debouncing time of Cherry MX switches (which is being very generous). Even if you had super human speed and reflexes, every single key would be delayed by at least that much. So really, any polling rate over 200Hz (at best) is absolutely useless, and nothing but market hype. It may even be a bit detrimental, because you'd be wasting CPU time polling the keyboard unneededly. And unlike USB keyboards, PS/2 boards aren't polled at all. They simply send the signal to the PC whenever they are ready to, which causes a hardware interrupt, forcing the CPU to register that keystroke." Reply 29a - Thursday, May 25, 2017 - link I hope they never go away since I have a PS2 keyboard. Reply Ro_Ja - Thursday, May 25, 2017 - link Because some people don't want to end up buying a mouse if their main ones broke. Reply North01 - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link Interesting how they have a 6.35 mm (1/4 inch) headphone jack on the back. Reply mr_tawan - Thursday, May 25, 2017 - link Guess they will add XLR in the future. Reply Cellar Door - Thursday, May 25, 2017 - link I find it a very welcome feature - since a lot of high end users also have high end headphones. I myself use optical to a receiver but used to run an Auzentech card with a proper headphone amp that included a 1/4 jack. I wish more manufacturers included it on their top tier boards.

It will certainly add some additional transistors to Intel cpus looking ahead, however, and Thunderbolt has had years to achieve widespread adoption and so far has gathered little interest--being custom-cable-dependent has a lot to do with it, imo. Probably looking at another Firewire story--although I suspect Firewire even though it failed ultimately garnered a far wider adoption than has Thunderbolt thus far--and for the same reason--the Tbolt cables, again.     waltc3 View Public Profile Find all posts by waltc3   (#3) hpascoa Newbie     Videocard: AORUS Radeon RX580 8G Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 1700 Mainboard: ASRock X370 Taichi Memory: 16GB G.SKILL DDR4-3200 Soundcard: Realtek ALC1220 (onboard) PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 650 G3 05-24-2017, 21:03 | posts: 22 | Location: USA Quote: next year Intel plans to make the Thunderbolt protocol specification available to the industry under a nonexclusive, royalty-free license. That's excellent news. I really do like the idea behind TB, it's a shame Intel was never willing to let 3rd parties in on the game. Hopefully this will also mean that we will eventually see TB available on AMD systems. Quote: IMO, not very interesting as the expensive/complex part of Thunderbolt is in the cables The reason why the cables are expensive is because the technology hasn't become mainstream yet. It's like HDMI back in the day when it first came out and the cables cost a fortune. Once production reaches critical mass, then prices will come down. They could have driven up adoption of TB3 back in 2015, if they had built it into the 100 series chipset when they released Skylake, instead of relegating it into the separate (and expensive) Alpine Ridge controller. Motherboard manufacturers didn't want to drive up prices, or lower their margins, on their mainstream boards by including Alpine Ridge, so the feature was available only on some high-end motherboards (and MacBooks), and as such never reached the mainstream.     hpascoa View Public Profile Find all posts by hpascoa   (#4) typhon6657 Newbie   Videocard: Zotac GTX 1080 SLI Processor: I7 7700k de-lid 5.2ghz Mainboard: ROG MAXIMUS IX HERO Memory: F4-4266C19D-16GTZR Soundcard: STR-DH550,Klipsch R-15M's PSU: SeaSonic 1200 SS-1200XP3 05-24-2017, 21:24 | posts: 38 | Location: Madera CA Sweet cant wait for that shizzel to drizzel on my comzzel     typhon6657 View Public Profile Find all posts by typhon6657     (#5) FeDaYin Newbie   Videocard: MSI GTX 780 reference Processor: i5-2500K @ 4.6 Ghz Mainboard: GIGABYTE Z68X-UD3H-B3 Memory: KINGSTON 4x4GB Soundcard: Chord Mojo+JBL LSR305 PSU: Corsair RM1000i 05-24-2017, 21:43 | posts: 34 | Location: ROMANIA USB 3.1 gen2 in 2020 ?     FeDaYin View Public Profile Find all posts by FeDaYin   (#6) terremonde Newbie     Videocard: asus amd 6670 ddr5 Processor: amd a-10 5800k Mainboard: Msi a88x gaming g45 Memory: G.skill snipers 1.25v cl9 Soundcard: onboard PSU: thermaltake smart m750 05-24-2017, 22:09 | posts: 17 | Location: canada as a fanboy.

Took them long enough sheesh.

Current 7th generation chipsets can't even produce full T3 bandwidth due to the DMI 3.0 bottleneck between the CPU and PCH. Even worse, PCIe SSDs have to share the same choke point. Meanwhile 16 pcie lanes are wasted on graphics cards, where 8 lanes are needed at most, and many people use the CPU graphics. This is the dirty little secret that Intel will address. Hopefully, we also get to see M.2 slots directly connected to the CPU soon too.     Markk02474 View Public Profile Find all posts by Markk02474   (#11) Clawedge Maha Guru     Videocard: Intel HD 4600 Processor: Intel 4790s Mainboard: MSI H81M-PRO-VH Memory: 16GB HyperX Soundcard: Onboard PSU: Silverstone SFX ST45SF Yesterday, 22:12 | posts: 1,888 | Location: Earth copper or fibre optics?     Clawedge View Public Profile Find all posts by Clawedge « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

I always been under the impression if there nothing wrong and thing are working as they should, dont update mb bios, most download pages for them say same thing. At one point I update my X58 SLI LE to it latest bios when I had no issue and it droped my cpu default speed by 100mhz, and only reason i did this was in hopes the bios update would fix dissapearing ram issue it always had which id didnt fix, to this day that system still has that issue and there remains with 6gb (2x3) cause that only set out 6+ set i tried that ever work and never lost stick. What are your opinions?

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway. Use the arrow keys above/below the images to navigate the list, or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope.

LOCAL L.A. Now Trump wants to cut funding for earthquake early warning system, which probably would kill project Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times A magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Napa in 2014. A prototype of the earthquake early warning system gave researchers in San Francisco about eight seconds of warning before shaking began. A magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Napa in 2014. A prototype of the earthquake early warning system gave researchers in San Francisco about eight seconds of warning before shaking began. (Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times) By Rong-Gong Lin IIContact Reporter Earthquakes Tornadoes and Wind Storms Donald Trump National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Adam Schiff Hurricane Sandy (2012) Ken Calvert President Trump’s budget would eliminate federal funding for an earthquake early warning system being developed for California and the rest of the West Coast which, if enacted, probably would kill the long-planned effort. The budget proposal for the year ending in September 2018 also seeks to eliminate U.S. funding for critical tsunami-monitoring stations in oceans and reduce funds for a next-generation weather forecasting system. Scientists said the loss of federal funding would derail the early warning system, which officials hope would one day send public earthquake alerts to smartphones seconds or even minutes before a temblor. “It probably would kill the early warning system if we thought there were no more funding coming from the U.S. Geological Survey,” said John Vidale, director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and a seismology professor at the University of Washington. “The money we’ve received is essential,” Vidale said. In a statement announcing the USGS budget, the Department of the Interior said the budget “focuses on core USGS science and efficiency,” and asserted that the budget would be able to fund monitoring of the nation’s earthquakes. Bill Leith, the USGS acting associate director for natural hazards, said a decision was made to focus on USGS’ service core capabilities — services that are already offered, rather than a new service such as the earthquake early warning system. The budget document posted on the U.S. Department of the Interior’s website did not elaborate on the reason for cutting the alert system, saying only: “This elimination would end USGS efforts to implement the ShakeAlert earthquake early warning system.” New hires haven’t been approved by Trump administration The earthquake early warning system, being built by the USGS in conjunction with several major universities, still needs more seismic sensors installed across Washington, Oregon and Northern California, and it needs a staff of 40 to 50 people to install and maintain equipment as well as monitor the computer systems. Already, hiring has proven difficult. Since Trump was inaugurated, the Department of the Interior has frozen hiring of senior scientists, including those needed to operate the early warning network. “There are people we’ve identified and interviewed and we’d like to hire them as soon as we have permission,” Vidale said. “These are the people who would keep the computer doing what we need to to get the early warning system up and operating.” Without ongoing funding, the ShakeAlert system would need to lay off employees, said Tom Heaton, a Caltech professor of engineering seismology. “If that funding went away, we would have to lay off a number of the developers and the development would basically cease,” Heaton said. “I’m not sure how we could possibly recover from that.” Such a blow probably would lead Heaton, who said he is nearing retirement, to work on other issues. “I’ve been kind of excited at the possibility we’ll have a system up and running by the time my career was done. That hope would be dashed in that case,” Heaton said. Lucy Jones in 2015 discusses California's prototype earthquake early warning system. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Companies have been seeking to use the system Companies have started to notice the potential benefits of an earthquake early warning system. Intel, for example, “is very eager to use early warning to make their manufacturing safer,” Vidale said. Computer companies can use seconds of warning before shaking comes to halt sensitive manufacturing processes — preventing equipment from clanging together and being damaged in the shaking. That would enable factories to resume operations much faster after the earthquake. And factories using toxic chemicals can prevent problems by securing operations before shaking arrives, too, Vidale said. And just telling people that shaking is coming so that they can drop, cover and hold on could save lives and reduce injuries. “This is a simple technology. We know how to do it,” Vidale said. “Even Mongolia is doing it.” The budget proposal would also reduce $800,000 in funding for earthquake monitoring in Alaska and the central and eastern United States, where earthquakes are a risk on the East Coast, in the South and in the Midwest. The reduction may “slow the rate of updates to seismic provisions in building codes and provide less science to support risk mitigation actions. The USGS would also suspend its annual forecast of hazard related to both natural and induced seismicity.” An additional $561,000 would be cut under the proposal from earthquake hazards operations, diminishing the government’s ability to monitor and report on earthquakes, assess earthquake hazards and send earthquake results to emergency responders, the budget document said. Video of how the earthquake early warning system operated in Japan during the great 2011 earthquake. Congressional response A champion of the earthquake early warning system, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank), said it would be foolish to end it. “After years of educating the public and Congress to the benefits of the earthquake early warning system, we have been able to deliver $23.4 million in federal funding to help build out an early warning system across the West Coast,” Schiff said in a statement. “But we cannot stop now, just as monitoring stations are being built out and the system is expanding its reach. Support for the early warning system in Congress is sustained, growing and bipartisan, and we will not accept this attempt by the president to cut a vital funding stream for a program that will protect life, property and critical infrastructure,” Schiff said. A spokesman for Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Corona), who serves on the House appropriations committee, said late Thursday that the congressman was on a plane and could not be immediately reached to comment on the proposal to end funding for the esystem. He referred to an earlier statement on the overall budget, which said: “The budget also proposes some reductions for agencies that fall within the Interior subcommittee’s jurisdiction. Those agencies perform important work, so the members of our committee will be faced with making some difficult decisions.” Watch the earthquake early warning appear on a TV broadcast in Japan before the great magnitude 9 2011 earthquake. The alert shows up about 36 seconds into the video, and a startled news anchor interrupts the broadcast after about 2 minutes into the clip as shaking grips Tokyo. U.S. far behind other nations The United States is far behind other nations in developing an earthquake early warning system. In Japan, for instance, national TV broadcasts and cellphones are interrupted with warnings about incoming shaking, and for significant quakes, high-speed trains automatically slow down, as slower speeds reduce the threat of a deadly derailment. “All of Japanese society is very happy for their early warning system,” Heaton said. “Nobody in Japan really wants to turn it off. They view it as a great step ahead for them. Californians will, too.” In the last few years, lawmakers in Washington and Sacramento have started to devote significant dollars to developing the system. In fact, the budget deal reached in Congress for the current budget year that ends in September penciled in $10.2 million for the system, which represented an increase from the previous year’s $8.2 million for the system. The system needs about $16.1 million in yearly operating and maintenance costs, and $38.2 million to build it. Seismologist Lucy Jones said she was “deeply disappointed” to see Trump’s budget proposal. “Eliminating the $10 million a year that the government has been spending would stop the program and waste the $23 million that has already been invested,” Jones said in an email. “The talented scientists and technicians that are working on the project now will go to other jobs, so their experience and expertise would be lost. “Many life- and money-saving measures would not be available when the next earthquake strikes,” she added. Workers begin to demolish the Northridge Meadows apartment building, whose ground floor collapsed in the 1994 earthquake. (Richard Derk / MCT) How the early warnings work The earthquake early warning system works on a simple principle: The shaking from an earthquake travels at about the speed of sound through rock — slower than the speed of today's communications systems. That means it would take more than a minute for, say, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that starts at the Salton Sea to shake up Los Angeles, 150 miles away, traveling on the state’s longest fault, the San Andreas. The prototype system has had some early successes. When a magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Napa in 2014, the system gave researchers in San Francisco about eight seconds of warning before shaking began. Last year, 30 seconds of warning reached downtown L.A. before the ground shook from a magnitude 4.4 quake centered near Banning. As the system gets built, officials have talked about allowing places such as classrooms, offices, shopping malls, amusement parks and police and fire stations to have ready access to alerts. Eventually, bigger benefits are expected: technology to open elevators at the next floor, sparing occupants from being trapped, and warnings that could halt the flow of natural gas through major pipelines, preventing catastrophic fires. The waters of the tsunami were still evident in the Japanese town of Ishinomaki days after the March 11, 2011 tsunami. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Tsunami sensing stations could lose all funding The proposed budget also affects other agencies monitoring natural disasters. The U.S. Department of Commerce, which oversees the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, faces eliminating funding — $12 million — that pays for a crucial network of buoys in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The network can sense an incoming tsunami, enabling officials to send watches and warnings for the United States. This is known as the Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis, or DART. A budget document said that the termination of the program “is anticipated to have a 20% or greater impact on the accuracy, certainty, and timeliness of NOAA’s tsunami watches and warnings.” The DART buoys are essential for telling local authorities whether the public needs to be evacuated from the coast, Vidale said. “Those DART buoys are our eyes out in the sea for incoming tsunamis from distant earthquakes.” “The zeroing out of the DART buoys is just startling,” said University of Washington atmospheric sciences professor Cliff Mass.

(Bryant Anderson / Associated Press) The agency is also facing a proposed reduction of funding for a network of automated weather stations that can indicate rapidly deteriorating weather conditions, called Mesonet. That means NOAA won’t be able to monitor these conditions in all 50 states, but will have to “prioritize states most susceptible to tornadoes and severe weather.” The budget also proposes reducing funding for an array of sensors in the ocean designed to detect El Niño, which officials said may delay the recognition of the onset of phenomenon and hamper the ability to deal with its effects, such as heavy rain or drought.

Scientists and officials have been pushing for a major upgrade to the weather service’s forecasting system, which is well behind European modeling systems, Mass said. That shortcoming was seen in the U.S. forecasting of Hurricane Sandy as it struck New York, he said. “What they’re proposing to do is cutting a large amount of money out, which would delay it at best and kill it at worst,” Mass said. “If you look at the statistics for virtually any place in the country, you’ll see the American model is well behind.” The proposal would also end an effort to extend operational weather outlooks from 16 days to 30 days, saving $5 million, and halt a project that would improve tornado forecasts in the southeastern United States, which would also save $5 million. In an executive summary accompanying the budget proposal, the Commerce Department said that “the termination and rescaling of programs, while challenging and impactful, is necessary as we move toward a more efficient government model that refocuses on national security and core government functions.” Support our journalism Already a subscriber?

MSI unveils new PCs and gaming gear ahead of Computex By Rich Edmonds Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 8:29 pm EDT 9 Comments MSI is gearing up to announce some new gaming gear and computers at Computex 2017 next week. Whether you're looking to invest in a new gaming rig, a machine that can handle 4K and VR entertainment with ease, or simply a new motherboard to add some "killer" features and lighting effects, MSI has you covered with the company's latest, award-winning product announcements for the upcoming Computex event. MSI GT83VR Titan SLI Notebook Sporting not only the latest in processing power from Intel, the GT83VR also comes with either Nvidia's GTX 1070 or 1080 in SLI configuration. That's right, this thing has dual graphics processing for enhanced gaming performance. This makes it a compelling choice for 4K and VR entertainment, packing a Cherry MX Silver mechanical keyboard. Other cool features include ESS Sabre Hi-Fi DAC, Dynaudio speakers, and per-key RGB backlighting. MSI VR One Backpack PC The VR One is an incredibly thin and light VR-capable backpack PC. Don't allow the small dimensions and weight fool you into thinking it's not a powerful Windows machine. Featuring a unique cooling system and hot-swappable battery packs for prolonged sessions with an immersive headset, MSI wants this PC to be the go-to for all VR gaming fans who want to go for hours without returning to reality. MSI Vortex G25VR Desktop Not only do we have a new notebook and portable PC for VR gaming, but also a compact PC, too. The Vortex G25VR has dual fans and eight heat pipes to maximize available cooling performance in tight spacing. Ideal for home theater and living room VR experiences, this unit comes with Hi-Res audio and Nahimic 2+/VR. MSI Infinite Series Desktops If you're not quite into the whole VR business, MSI's Infinite Series gaming desktops may be right up your alley. These down-to-earth platforms offer the latest and greatest from Intel, Nvidia and AMD. They're designed for owners to upgrade specific components without issue to remain at the top of the leaderboard. What makes these interesting for system builders is the MSI Silent Storm Cooling 3 thermal design, which makes them super quiet. MSI PRO 20EX AIO PC Should you wish to enjoy having your entire desktop PC inside a single unit, the PRO 20EX all-in-one machines are powerful solutions for various applications. A bunch of I/O options joins a smart-looking crystal frame and blue light-reducing display. Designed for both business and downtime, the PRO 20EX offers strong desktop performance for productivity and entertainment. Components and gear MSI also announced some new components for system builders and accessories for gamers, including: MSI Z270 GODLIKE GAMING motherboard. MSI X370 GAMING M7 motherboard. MSI GTX 1080 Ti Lightning Z GPU. MSI GTX 1080 Ti GAMING X 11G GPU (with USB Type C). MSI Immerse GH70 GAMING Headset. MSI X1000 IoT Gateway. We'll keep our eyes peeled for availability and pricing details and relay them once they're released by MSI. We'll be covering Computex closely, so remain tuned to Windows Central for the latest from the event.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway. Use the arrow keys above/below the images to navigate the list, or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

I understand it likely is to improve the article to advert ratio, but its annoying as hell to do to a list… Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:20 April March says: I doubt it’s an advertising thing, because it doesn’t reload the page between slides, so they aren’t getting additional views. That or I’m really dumb about how it works. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 19:09 someoneelse84 says: I’m not one to normally complain.

I’m currently loaning my new GPU to my brother, so i’m rocking my old 6950 GPU at the mo, which is well below the listed minimum specs so i had discarded that as an option for now. But if it’ll somewhat run on an intel IGP it’ll run on that for sure… Would mean tearing myself away from Rimworld though :P Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:20 Expose Gaming1 says: Wow, two of my favorite game are on this list.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:22 torkan217 says: An older workstation at much lower price will get you decent specs, especially cpu’s like the qm line which perform on par with some modern cpus in the passmark tests. I’ve got a Dell Precision m4600, 15.6″, 1080p, i7-2620m@2.7ghz/3.4 turbo dual core, 8GB RAM, quadro 1000m 2GB. From what I saw on the web the quadro 1000m is 20% overall less than an hd 4400. Most reviewers don’t even try newer or games perceived to be too demanding, this is a serious error. 30+ FPS means over 30 in normal play and usually above this up to 45 FPS.

It’s poorly optimized and lags on non-topoftheline cpu’s. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:02 Bernardo says: Yes, I’m having the same problem. It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:49 HoboDragon says: Motorsport Manager, esp. in the 2D mode runs well. Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2…. (most games RPS recommended if I recall :-D) Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:06 Bernardo says: Recent Games that run smoothly or at least reasonably well on my integrated Intel HD 4400 Ultrabook not on this list: Salt and Sanctuary Shrouded in Sanity Order of Battle Thea: The Awakening Pillars of Eternity Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 23:05 Bernardo says: Not that recent, but Legend of Grimrock 1 and 2 also work like a charm (medium setings).

CEO Tim Cook said in an interview on CNBC’s Mad Money “I’m proud to tell you… putting in billion dollars in the fund.” Cook did not say who the who the company was but it makes Apple one of the latest to jump on the growing trend of adding U.S. jobs. Companies like Amazon have pledged to create 100,000 jobs in the next two years and Intel says it will invest $7 billion dollars in an Arizona-based chip-making plant. Cook says that these new jobs will create even more jobs later on SOT "By doing that, we can be the ripple in the pond. Because if we can create many manufacturing jobs around, those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them." And so it does seem like President Trump’s urging of companies to bring jobs back to the United States is having an effect. 8/9(*VO-Reuters apple china/VB tax) Although Cook did also say that he thinks the Trump Administration should give tax breaks to companies that bring money back from overseas.

Skip to main content PC Games news and reviews from PCGamesN.com Reviews Hardware About Vanquish|Posted 15 hours ago Vanquish PC graphics, performance, and 4K analysis - the PCGamesN tech review By Matt Purslow Back in 2010, PlatinumGames released one of the most absurd third-person shooters ever made. Vanquish is a game where you mow down robots in their hundreds while powersliding at 100 mph, thanks to an afterburner bolted to your back. There’s genuinely nothing quite like it, and after seven long years, it’s finally made it to PC. How does the port hold up? Well, it’s even better than the Bayonetta port from last April.    Related: the best shooters on PC. Our tech reviews are written to offer you the broadest picture possible, focusing on hardware similar to what the majority of players have installed in their machines. We test the game on all graphical settings using an i5 powered rig with 8GB of RAM, and try to hit 60 fps with four of the most popular graphics cards. Even if your PC is not identical to our test setups, you should still be able to estimate the performance levels you can expect from your own machine. Graphics options (larger image)   Like all of Platinum’s PC ports, Vanquish sticks to the basics. You won’t find any fancy niche rendering techniques to fiddle with here, but nor would we expect them: this is a seven year-old Xbox 360 game, after all.   Thankfully, the settings that we demand are all here; multiple resolutions cater for above and beyond 1080p, plus there’s both EDGE and FXAA anti-aliasing, as well as up to 16x texture filtering. The majority of options have low, normal, and high options, including the overall quality preset selector. It’s worth noting that the high preset doesn’t assign everything to max; there are several settings that can be cranked higher if you’ve got the horsepower. A handy VRAM meter will warn you if you’re putting too much strain on your graphics card.   Outside of graphics settings there’s support for full key remapping, as well as sensitivity sliders for camera movement and aiming. Naturally, the game supports controllers, but this is certainly the one Platinum title that you’d want to consider using keyboard and mouse for. The PC controls feel slick and responsive, and slow-mo-to-fast-mo shooting is even better with precise mouse input. Graphics analysis Tested on an Intel i5 6500 @3.2GHz, 8GB of RAM, Nvidia GTX 1060, Windows 10 For our graphics analysis we traditionally compare screenshots taken on the four standard presets of ultra, high, medium, and low. Vanquish has just three presets - low, normal, and high - so we’ve tested those as well as seeing what happens when we crank every option up as high as they’ll go. These settings can be changed on the fly from the in-game menu, with no need to reboot to apply new textures. Maximum (larger image) First thing’s first: Vanquish looks like a game from 2010. It may have been spruced up for the PC release, but it’s still a game that’s starting to show its age. That doesn’t mean there’s no muscle to flex, though, especially with every setting turned up to max. Sam Gideon’s character model is strong, with lots of clear detail on his Augmented Reaction suit. The world is well modelled, but textures are a bit hit-and-miss; the floor looks exceptionally sharp, but the metal barricade that Sam is leaning against is very smeared. If you’re running a similar rig to our test PC, you’ll get to play Vanquish at the kind of frame rate is was clearly made for. On average, it performs at 106 fps, dipping to lows of 75 fps when things get heavy. The 60 fps cap that Bayonetta and Nier: Automata have is nowhere to be seen, and that’s worth celebrating. High (larger image)   The change in quality from maximum to high is all in the lighting. While textures and models remain identical, you’ll notice that the shadows are significantly harsher at high. At maximum settings, the silhouettes and the light sources appear much more natural in comparison. Aside from this, however, Vanquish still looks excellent.   Sacrificing those shadows does little for performance, boosting the average frame rate to just 107 fps, and the minimum to 76. That’s just a single frame gained for a notable downgrade in the lighting department. Unless you’re running significantly less powerful hardware, there seems no point in dropping from maximum settings.   Normal (larger image)   Once again, the difference between presets is slight, and it’s still all about the lighting. Normal settings reduce the number of detailed shadow maps; for example, the shading around the panels and items on the Reaction suit. You can see this most clearly on the vent fins mounted to the shin armour.   Dropping down to normal comes with a more satisfactory performance boost. Normal, on average, will produce 114 fps on a GTX 1060. The minimum frame rate, however, stays still at 76 fps.   Low (larger image)   Low really does mean low in Vanquish’s book, with this preset looking significantly uglier than any of its higher-grade siblings. Textures are incredibly low resolution, turning into mosaic-like messes on any surface beyond a meter or so away from the camera.   This causes anything in the distance to look incredibly blurry, and even close-up items lack definition. This is very obvious on the Reaction suit, where decal designs are merely smudges of colour and the definition between armour plates is lost almost entirely. A complete lack of anti-aliasing also means that every item is marred by a jagged edge.   Dropping to low will scrape 124 fps which, considering the downgrade in quality, is not a huge leap. The minimum frame rate is also just 79 fps, painting a clear picture that there’s little benefit to using these settings unless you have a notably underpowered PC.   Performance benchmarks   To see how Vanquish performs on various hardware setups, we have tested the game on four graphics cards; two from Nvidia, and two from AMD. We’ve sampled the most popular cards from the current and last generation of GPUs in order to offer the most useful information. All four cards were tested at maximum settings, with every option turned up as high as they’ll go. For the test we played a three-minute sample that involved heavy combat and some powerslide boosting. In the graph below you can see how all four cards perform. While there’s notable difference between AMD and Nvidia performance, all four cards provide excellent results. The uncapped frame rate allows even the weakest card to hit almost 80 fps, meaning that even on lower-powered systems the PC version of Vanquish is the definitive one. Both current and last-gen Nvidia cards perform within two frames of each other. While both offering in excess of 100 fps is great news, I am surprised that the GTX 1060 doesn’t provide anything more. The lower-powered AMD cards see a more distinct change between generations, with a roughly 10-frame advantage to the more modern RX 470. The big picture here, though, is that as long as you’ve bought a gaming GPU in the last few years, you’ll be able to play Vanquish at blisteringly high frame rates. That seems pretty good news to me. How does Vanquish run in 4K? Vanquish runs exceptionally well at 1080p, but what if you own a 4K display? Our UHD test rig - rocking an i7 6700K CPU, an Nvidia GTX 1080, and displaying on an Acer Predator 4K monitor - looks and performs wonderfully. At 3840 x 2160 resolution on maximum settings,  Vanquish runs at an average of 81 fps, and a minimum of 73 fps. That means you get super smooth combat at a resolution that allows you to to really appreciate the intricate armour paneling on literally every single one of Vanquish’s absurd characters. How to run Vanquish at 60 fps If you’re running one of the cards we’ve tested you’ll no doubt be feeling pretty confident about your ability to run Vanquish at a great frame rate. In this section I’d normally outline what kind of tweaks you’d need to make in order to squeeze an average of 60 fps from you GPU, but with Vanquish there’s just no need. Simply max out every graphics setting and you’ll be certain to experience a lovely smooth, high-end frame rate.   (larger image)   With results as good as these at 1080p, it also means there’s plenty of room to play at higher resolutions on the same mid-tier hardware. 1440p isn’t out of the question, and those with beefier cards should certainly be looking at 4K, should they have the monitor for it.   Conclusion   We’re in an interesting period right now where many older console games are finally making their way to Steam. Japanese PC ports have had a bit of a bad reputation over the years, and even the good ones, like last month’s Bayonetta, are hampered by frame rate locks and a very limited feature list. Vanquish breaks that trend, and should be seen as the correct standard for a straight PC port.   While it doesn’t make the game look as if it was released yesterday, it does have a reasonable list of PC options and allows the game to be played at sky-high frame rates. Undoubtedly this is the best way to play Vanquish, and if it’s the first time you’ve played Platinum’s bonkers shooter you’ll not be disappointed.   Sign in to Comment Vanquish Review Be the first to review Vanquish Sign in ReviewNo reviews yet.

Some Twitter executives have praised Trump's prolific Twitter habit, saying it brings welcome transparency to government. Others lament the way Trump has used the social media platform in his rise to power. Trump used Twitter to help him connect directly with his base in the 2016 presidential race and has often marveled at its ability to shape the agenda and drive coverage on cable news. "Without the tweets, I wouldn't be here," Trump told the Financial Times in April, adding, "I don't have to go to the fake media." ADVERTISEMENT Since his inauguration, Trump has been using Twitter to call out his detractors, target companies and conduct foreign policy. Wall Street analysts have said that Trump's tweets -- and the free publicity it generates -- have boosted Twitter's financial fortunes after a long period during which the company was criticized for stagnant user growth. The company's stock soared after its last quarterly earnings report, which contained figures on user growth that shattered Wall Street estimates. Trump was largely seen as the reason. One financial analysis firm, BTIG, specifically advised clients to buy shares of Twitter because of the president. "The incessant news flow from the Trump administration playing out on Twitter and the ensuing global reaction pushes Twitter users to be increasingly engaged with the platform," BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield wrote in a letter to clients. Twitter has acknowledged the Trump bump but publicly attributed the growth to "product changes" and "marketing" during its last earnings call. But even if Trump has improved Twitter's bottom line, not everyone involved with the company is happy about it. Read more here.

GROUP ASKS FCC TO TAKE DOWN FAKE NET NEUTRALITY COMMENTS: Individuals whose identities were used without their permission on comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are speaking out to the agency. In a letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai signed by 14 people, the group offers support for the principle of net neutrality, after the fake comments under their names called for the end of those rules. They also called for the comments to be removed. "We are disturbed by reports that indicate you have no plans to remove these fraudulent comments from the public docket," the group wrote in a letter posted on Fight for the Future's web site Read more here. ZUCKERBERG'S HARVARD SPEECH: Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg challenged the graduating class of Harvard University to fight against isolationism and nationalism on Thursday. "We live in an unstable time," he said. "There's pressure to turn inwards. This is the struggle of our time," Zuckerberg told the crowd at his alma mater's commencement. "The forces of freedom, openness and global community are up against the forces of authoritarianism, isolationism and nationalism. "The forces for the flow of knowledge, trade and immigration against those who would slow them down. This is not a battle of nations, this is a battle of ideas." Zuckerberg used his commencement speech to lay out a vision for America, covering political topics such as climate change, the prison system, automation and healthcare. Read more here.

POLL FINDS SOME AMERICANS ABANDONING CARS FOR RIDE-SHARING: A new survey finds that some drivers are giving up their cars and using ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber as their primary means of transportation. Almost a quarter of Americans sold or traded in their cars over the last year, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Thursday. Nine percent of that group moved to ride-hailing apps as their primary means of transportation. And the poll found a similar number plan to do so in the next 12 months. While the numbers don't clearly indicate a trend, ride-hailing companies touted the poll. Read more here. APPLE NEWS POACHES NY MAG EDITOR: New York Magazine executive editor Lauren Kern will become Apple News's first editor in chief. "I am not happy to report that we are losing our beloved Lauren Kern to the Apple corporation," NY Mag Editor-in-Chief Adam Moss wrote in a Wednesday staff memo obtained by CNN Money on Thursday. Politico first reported Thursday that Apple had made Kern its first editor-in-chief of Apple News, its mobile news aggregation app launched in the summer of 2015. "I mean, I'm happy for Lauren certainly," Moss added. "It's an exciting opportunity to be the editor in chief of Apple News, to bring a journalistic vigor and intelligence to an operation that has always seemed to me so full of promise." Read more here.

Mark Milley assured the senators he had the same concerns and was assessing WIN-T as part of a “rigorous, thorough and painful review of the entire communication electromagnetic capabilities of the U.S. Army of which WIN-T is one part of.” He acknowledged that “these systems may or may not work in the conditions of combat that I envision in the future.”  Milley added that he will have a report on WIN-T and the network it operates on in four to six weeks.  “I have some serious, hard questions that have not yet been satisfactorily answered,” Milley said. “It's whether it's going to work. And I believe I'll come to that resolution within the next six weeks or so.” Sen.

Milley acknowledged he has seen such reports, and said the current review will allow lawmakers to decide on any changes to funding or schedule during budget markups in June.  The four-star general also blamed WIN-T’s issues on the Pentagon’s slow information technology acquisition process. “It's already been in development for 10 years,” Milley said. “By the time we even come up with requirements and start doing prototyping and experiments and tests, these systems are already out of date.”  WIN-T was developed to allow soldiers to communicate across the battlefield wirelessly, but has been plagued by cost overruns and development issues for years. General Dynamics is the prime contractor.  Tags John McCain Tom Cotton   View the discussion thread. Most Popular Most Popular Discussed Past: 1 day 1 GOP winner in Montana special...

That means it's time for notebook manufacturers to update their lineups in anticipation of those end-of-summer sales events. Accordingly, Acer has a new Spin convertible and a lineup of Nitro 5 gaming notebooks to show off at Computex this year—all with affordable price tags. The Spin 1 notebook is a thin-and-light 11.6" convertible notebook with a metal chassis. It weighs only 2.8 lbs (1.24 kg) and is 0.55" thin (14 mm), so it'll slip easily into a backpack or satchel. The touch-enabled IPS display has a resolution of 1920x1080, generally a good fit for a smaller laptop screen. Acer touts how well the notebook pairs up with a stylus and the latest tools in the Windows 10 Creators Update, though we don't know if the laptop comes with a pen. Buyers get to pick one of Intel's "latest" (we presume seventh-generation) Pentium or Celeron processors, and 32, 64, or 128 GB of eMMC storage. The systems pack 4GB of DDR3L memory, and their battery should be good for about eight hours. Peripheral connectivity comes courtesy of a USB 3.1 port and a USB 2.0 connector. There's also an HDMI output and a microSD card slot. For networking purposes, the Spin 1 uses an 802.11ac 2x2 Wi-Fi adapter. Users who like their notebooks served with a side of gaming might take a peek at Acer's Nitro 5 lineup. Acer equips these 15.6" notebooks with a 1920x1080 display and more horsepower than the lightweight Spin 1 models. Users can get a machine with two combinations: a choice of Kaby Lake Core i7 CPUs paired with GeForce cards up to a GTX 1050 Ti, or an AMD seventh-generation A-series processors coupled with a Radeon RX 550. Acer says the notebooks support up to 32GB of DDR4-2400 RAM. The company doesn't say what's the baseline storage configuration, but notes that buyers have options for PCIe SSDs and an optional HDD as secondary storage. The Nitro 5s come with one USB 3.1 Type-C port, one USB 3.0 connector, two USB 2.0 ports, and an HDMI 2.0 output. Wireless networking comes by way of an 802.11ac Wi-Fi adapter with 2x2 MIMO support. The systems are kept cool with two fans that exhaust heat out the back, and have a black-and-red "gamer" style finish. These notebooks will all start selling in July. Pricing for the Spin 1 starts at a remarkably affordable $329, while the Nitro 5 models start at $799.

Higher speeds and lower latencies are desirable for getting the most out of a Ryzen chip. Outside of a few motherboards with external base-clock generators, however, the memory multipliers for Ryzen CPUs have maxed out at 32. With a 100-MHz default base clock, that means builders have been limited to running overclocked RAM at DDR4-3200 speeds. Today, that all changes. AMD has announced that its AMD Generic Encapsulated System Architecture, or AGESA, version 1.0.0.6 will expose 26 new RAM tuning settings to tweakers looking to extract the most from their Ryzen systems' RAM. These updates should bring AM4 motherboards' firmware settings for memory tweaking more on par with that of the Intel competition. Of the wealth of memory overclocking options AGESA 1.0.0.6 will offer, the two most important settings to me are an extended range of memory multipliers (up to 40, or DDR4-4000) and the option to set command rates at one tick or two ticks (1T or 2T). For example, the hot G.Skill DDR4-3866 memory I have here requires a 38.66 multiplier and a 2T command rate, but those settings simply couldn't be dialed in on Ryzen motherboards under the current AGESA (1.0.0.4) without resorting to changes in the base clock that also controls important bus rates like PCI Express. Changing that base clock rate could result in unexpected behavior, so it's a relief that the masses won't have to resort to that approach any longer.  Of course, AMD is quick to point out that using memory speeds above DDR4-2667 or settings not in accordance with JEDEC values is considered overclocking. Overclocking RAM with these new knobs will void a Ryzen CPU's factory warranty, even if you're using the company's Ryzen Master utility. Still, the temptation of performance gains will probably be too much to resist for many Ryzen owners. In news that will be music to the ears of another class of users, AMD also says that AGESA 1.0.0.6 will improve support for PCI Express Access Control Services, or ACS. According to the company, these improvements will allow users who run virtual machines on their Ryzen systems to better manage the assignment of PCIe devices within IOMMU groups. In short, the company says this feature will let VM wizards dedicate multiple graphics cards within a Ryzen system to the operating systems of their choice, whether natively installed or virtual, among other benefits. AMD says motherboard firmware incorporating AGESA 1.0.0.6 will be available starting in "mid-to-late June." The company notes that some motherboard makers have already begun issuing beta firmwares for some products with the new AGESA on board, most notably Gigabyte with its AX370-Gaming 5 and Asus with its Crosshair VI Hero. Folks eager to push Ryzen memory performance to its limits will doubtless welcome this update warmly.   Tags: CPUs Memory Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

By Jefferson Morley / AlterNet May 25, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Euronews/YouTube The view that President Trump is a menace to safety of the American people is hardly confined to the political left. Senator Jim Corker, a conservative Republican from Tennessee and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, dubbed Trump “the wrecking ball president.” Now Trump’s wrecking ball is damaging America's alliance with Europe and its procedures for handling the country’s most sensitive secrets, leaving U.S. military and intelligence, and their foreign counterparts, aghast. Trump’s congenital carelessness is dangerous, they say. In his speech to NATO leaders on Thursday he scolded them for failing to live up committments to increase defense spending while failing to mention Article 5, the NATO mutual-defense pledge — something other leaders had been hoping to hear. The Associated Press described the speech as an "unprecedented one-two punch" that "further rattled" an already anxious Europe. One Democratic leader called the remarks "condescending" and an "embarrassment." And that was before Trump described the Germans as "evil, very evil" for running a trade surplus with the United States. The trail of wreckage left by Trump's big mouth is growing longer by the day.  Intel on ISIS On May 15, the Washington Post reported that Trump had revealed highly classified information to the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in a White House meeting. “This is code-word information,” said a U.S. official familiar with the matter, using terminology that refers to one of the highest classification levels used by American spy agencies. Trump “revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.” The details emerging over the next week. The information, obtained from Israel, concerned specific terrorist plotting by the Islamic State, including Islamic State advances in bomb-making that could be used to mask an explosive device inside a laptop, according to USA Today. Trump’s defense fell apart quickly. He claimed he never mentioned Israel in his talks with the Russians. Whether that is literally true or whether he was lying (again), doesn’t really matter. Israeli officials were “furious” about the disclosures, Foreign Policy reported, and Israeli defense minister Avigdor Lieberman acknowledged that that Israel had “tweaked its intelligence-sharing protocols with the United States after Trump’s off-script remarks, “I can confirm that we did a spot repair and that there’s unprecedented intelligence cooperation with the United States,”  Lieberman told Israeli Army Radio. “What we had to clarify with our friends in the United States, we did. We did our check” Former CIA director John Brennan testified Tuesday that if the President shared classified Israeli intelligence with Russian officials at the White House as reported, he violated intelligence-sharing protocol. “It appears as though, at least from the press reports, that neither did it go in the proper channels nor did the originating agency have the opportunity to clear language for it,” Brennan said. “That is a problem.” Submarine Location Then came the disclosure that Trump had told Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, revealed that the U.S. had two nuclear submarines stationed near North Korea.  “We have a lot of firepower over there,” Trump said, according to a transcript obtained by The Intercept. “We have two submarines—best in the world-we have two nuclear submarines not that we want to use them at all.” BuzzFeed News reported that "Pentagon officials are in shock after the release of a transcript between President Donald Trump and his Philippines counterpart reveals that the US military had moved two nuclear submarines towards North Korea. "We never talk about subs!" three U.S. officials said. Rank and file military personnel also expressed surprise at the breach of normal security procedures. @CitizensFedUp @sartorialskwirl @BraddJaffy I am a Navy wife, my husband was on subs. WE were never allowed to know where they were or allowed to talk about the dates of deployment— Kate Jones (@katejns8) May 25, 2017 A Pattern In February, Trump “astounded” White House veterans with his decision to turn the public terrace of his Florida home into a situation room after he learned of a North Korea missile launch. Trump and Japanes Prime Minister Shinzo Abe remained at the table and discussed their response. "While waiters came and went — and while one club member snapped photos — the two leaders reviewed documents by the light of an aide’s cellphone,” the Washington Post  reported, adding that presidents typically “move to private, secured settings to hash out such an event.” In fact, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate has an on-site Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, a specially outfitted room for storing top-secret records and holding confidential conversations.  The White House denied any classified information had been seen or discussed at the impromptu dinner table conference but that hardly addresses the qualms of security professionals. “Assuming the smartphones staffers held aloft were consumer devices, they’re basically bugs waiting for someone to activate them,” noted Wire’s Brian Barrett, “Android phones are notoriously insecure outside of the most recent update, and even then aren’t guaranteed safe. “The idea that somebody could target these phones is not science-fiction,” says Matthew Green, cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University. “It’s actually a pretty standard, well-understood threat.” Not by the President of the United States, it seems.     Jefferson Morley is AlterNet's Washington correspondent.

By Igor Bobic WASHINGTON ― The Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to give its leaders “blanket authority” to issue any subpoena they deem appropriate in their investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. election and possible ties between Moscow and President Donald Trump’s campaign. Under regular committee rules, Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and ranking member Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) could only issue subpoenas after a full committee vote on the matter. Thursday’s vote, however, allows the two leaders to act jointly without the approval of their fellow members ― thus speeding up the process. On Wednesday, the committee issued two new subpoenas specifically targeting former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s businesses, Flynn Intel LLC and Flynn Intel Inc. Flynn was fired earlier this year over failing to disclose that he had had conversations with Russian officials prior to Trump’s inauguration. Burr and Warner maintained that Flynn’s decision to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination does not apply to his businesses and documents, adding he could be subject to a contempt charge if he doesn’t turn over the materials. “We would like to hear from Gen.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway.

I’m currently loaning my new GPU to my brother, so i’m rocking my old 6950 GPU at the mo, which is well below the listed minimum specs so i had discarded that as an option for now. But if it’ll somewhat run on an intel IGP it’ll run on that for sure… Would mean tearing myself away from Rimworld though :P Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:20 Expose Gaming1 says: Wow, two of my favorite game are on this list. Rocket League and League of Legends. I am surprised at some of these picks, like Prey and Elder Scroll Online, I thought you need an amazing PC to run these. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:22 torkan217 says: An older workstation at much lower price will get you decent specs, especially cpu’s like the qm line which perform on par with some modern cpus in the passmark tests. I’ve got a Dell Precision m4600, 15.6″, 1080p, i7-2620m@2.7ghz/3.4 turbo dual core, 8GB RAM, quadro 1000m 2GB. From what I saw on the web the quadro 1000m is 20% overall less than an hd 4400. Most reviewers don’t even try newer or games perceived to be too demanding, this is a serious error. 30+ FPS means over 30 in normal play and usually above this up to 45 FPS.

It’s poorly optimized and lags on non-topoftheline cpu’s. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:02 Bernardo says: Yes, I’m having the same problem. It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:49 HoboDragon says: Motorsport Manager, esp. in the 2D mode runs well. Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2…. (most games RPS recommended if I recall :-D) Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:06 Bernardo says: Recent Games that run smoothly or at least reasonably well on my integrated Intel HD 4400 Ultrabook not on this list: Salt and Sanctuary Shrouded in Sanity Order of Battle Thea: The Awakening Pillars of Eternity Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 23:05 Bernardo says: Not that recent, but Legend of Grimrock 1 and 2 also work like a charm (medium setings).

Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:30 poliovaccine says: As an owner of a terrible laptop, longtime lover of the immersive sim (since way before we had that term, i.e. back when Deus Ex looked like Deus Ex), and someone who’d previously ogled at Prey but felt forlornly resigned to spend the next year or so admiring it on others’ rigs from afar, I can safely say I care not an ass!

The company was doing "NUC-likes" before the NUC existed, and it continues to produce some of the more interesting mini-PCs around. At Computex, Zotac will be showing off no less than nine new takes on the Zbox idea, plus an intriguing gaming machine called MEK. Zotac Zbox EN1050K The E-series is primarily aimed at gamers and enthusiasts who need high performance. Zotac will have five new E-series machines to show off at Computex, including the EN1050K, EK51060, EK71070, ER51060, and the ER51070. The first model, the EN1050K, is externally identical to the Magnus EN1070 we reviewed. We can surmise from the model name that it probably includes a GeForce GTX 1050 or GTX 1050 Ti, but the rest of the hardware is a mystery for now. Zotac Zbox ER51070 The other four E-series machines utilize a taller chassis like that found on the EN1080 Magnus. The extra height gives them room to accommodate a standard desktop graphics card rather than having to rely on mobile-specific hardware. The two "EK" models, EK51060 and EK71070, use Kaby Lake Core i5 and i7 processors respectively. Those CPUs are paired with GeForce GTX 1060 or 1070 graphics cards depending on the model. Zotac Zbox ER51070 Meanwhile, the ER51060 and ER51070 are mini-PCs based on AMD's Ryzen processors. Zotac doesn't specify exactly which chips, although it says that the CPUs in question have a 65W TDP rating. Given that fact and the "R5" in the model numbers, we could probably make a fair guess. Besides the different internals, these machines appear to be identical to their Intel-based counterparts. That means you get a desktop-style (Zotac says "full-size") GeForce GTX 1060 or 1070 card. Zotac Zbox MA551 The M-series comprises Zotac's bread-and-butter mini-PCs. Zotac says the M stands for "multi-function", but it could as easily be "mainstream." The company will be bringing two M-series machines to Computex, the MI553 and MA551. These two little computers are nearly identical, except that one uses a Kaby Lake Intel processor, while the other uses a 65W Ryzen CPU. Zotac Zbox MA551 The Intel-powered MI553 comes with Thunderbolt 3 support, although it loses an HDMI port versus its Ryzen cousin for the privilege. Meanwhile, the Ryzen-based MA551 has a whole bunch of video connections. That leaves us wondering if it includes a discrete graphics card in some form, or if it will be based on an as-yet unannounced Ryzen-based APU. We're as eager to know as you are. Zotac Zbox PI225 The smallest of Zotac's mini-PCs are the Zbox P-series, formerly known as Zbox Pico. The company calls these its smallest Zboxes yet. The info sheet refers to the PI225 as "card-sized," and while the machine appears to be a a little too big for that moniker, it's doesn't appear to be larger than a typical smartphone. Zotac PR says the passively-cooled pocket PC is "4K display ready." Another fanless pocket PC, the PI335, will also be debuting at Computex. That model is thicker and closer to what we've seen from previous Zbox P-series models. Zotac Gaming MEK Finally, there's the MEK Gaming PC. While this machine doesn't exactly qualify as "mini PC," it's nonetheless interesting. The MEK is Zotac's first product from its new Zotac Gaming brand. The machine appears to be a more-or-less standard Mini-ITX gaming PC. The company didn't say much about what kind of internals will be available in the, but given its expertise with cramming hardware into micro machines, we have high expectations for the MEK's firepower.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway.

Tech Insider BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. The USB jack we've been using since 1996 could soon become obsolete Antonio Villas-Boas May 25, 2017, 2:13 PM 142,733 facebook linkedin twitter email print The good ol' fashioned USB cable and connector.Business Insider The time is almost up for the USB jack — called USB type A — that we've been using for over 2o years, as Intel has paved the way for the new USB-C standard to take over. On Wednesday, Intel said it would make its Thunderbolt 3 technology royalty-free, which gives any device manufacturer much better incentive to use the technology. It said that would take effect "next year." Intel's Thunderbolt 3 technology uses the USB type C, or USB-C, standard to plug devices into computers and other peripherals. Here's what that means for you: View As: One Page Slides It'll change the way we connect our devices. Your external hard drives, keyboards, mice, printers, and pretty much any peripheral that has been using the standard, common USB type A standard to connect to your computer could soon ship with a USB-C cable instead of a USB type A cable. If you put a USB-C and a USB type A cable side by side, you'd notice the USB-C cable is significantly smaller. It's almost as small and slim as Apple's Lightning jack, used for charging iPhones. It's great news. Intel's Thunderbolt 3 technology and the USB-C standard offers several benefits over USB type A. For one, it means much faster transfers between computers and external hard drives. The latest version of USB 3.1, which uses type A, transfers data at 10 gigabits per second, while Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C can transfer data at 40 Gbps. Essentially, Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C is four times as fast as USB 3.1. Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C adoption also means we can use USB-C cables to connect devices that traditionally use other standards, like monitors and HDMI or DisplayPort cables, with USB-C. We could even charge and power our computers with USB-C. And because USB-C can be used for so many different peripherals, you could use a single USB-C dock with several USB-C ports to connect all your accessories, and the dock would use only a single USB-C port on your computer. That's especially alluring for laptop users, as it would allow them to unplug a single USB-C dock instead of several connections. For example, to unplug my laptop from my desk setup, I need to unplug the power cable, monitor cable, and USB type A dock. When USB-C becomes ubiquitous, I'll unplug a single USB-C dock. And it could fix one of the most annoying things about regular USB. As a bonus, the USB-C jacks can plug into your computers and devices in any direction, whereas USB type A could be connected in only one direction. Gone will be the days when you try to plug in a device and realize it's upside down. Growing pains. It'll take some time for the switch from USB type A to Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C to become ubiquitous. People will invariably continue to use older computers that exclusively feature USB type A ports, even after USB-C becomes the new standard. And if someone with an older computer wanted to buy a new accessory that comes with a USB-C cable, they'd have to buy some sort of adapter or dock to plug it in. On top of that, Intel hasn't put Thunderbolt 3 support into some of its more recent processors, which means people with even fairly recent computers may not benefit from Thunderbolt 3's speeds. Intel will bake Thunderbolt 3 support into its future processors. Apple users have a head start in the switch to USB-C, as its latest lineup of MacBook Pro laptops features only USB-C ports. It's for the best. There surely will be some growing pains as people shift toward the new Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C standard, but I'm certain it's for the best. Get the latest Intel stock price here.

Eric Abent - May 25, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit We’ve been waiting about a year and a half for a new Surface Pro, and a couple of days back, Microsoft finally revealed it. Unlike the others, this isn’t a numbered entry in the line up, with Microsoft simply referring to it as the Surface Pro. Looking at side-by-side lists of specifications, the new Surface Pro and the Surface Pro 4 seem to be quite similar, so are there enough differences between the two to warrant an upgrade? It ultimately depends on what you’re looking for. If CPU power is the most important thing to you in a device like this, then you’re not going to notice a dramatic increase in the performance of the Surface Pro. With the Surface Pro 4, Microsoft used sixth-generation Intel Core processors build on Skylake architecture; in the new Surface Pro, on the other hand, we find seventh-gen Kaby Lake Core processors. Don’t get me wrong, there’s certainly a difference in performance between the two, and one of the more notable improvements we can point to is an increase in clock speed. We’ll take a look at the Core i5 since mid-range models seem to be the ones that will appeal to consumers most. The Intel Core i5-6300U, found in the Surface Pro 4, offers a clock speed of 2.4 to 3.0 GHz. By comparison, the new Surface Pro’s Intel Core i5-7300U bumps that range up to 2.6 to 3.5 GHz. The clock rate your CPU runs at depends on things like Intel’s Turbo Boost mode, but on the low end of that range, we aren’t looking at a very big difference. There is a difference in power, especially at the higher end of those ranges, but I have to wonder if the average user is going to notice that difference. My guess is “probably not.” READ MORE: Surface Pro vs Samsung Galaxy Book vs Huawei MateBook EIf we were moving from something like Haswell processors – which featured in the Surface Pro 3 – to Kaby Lake, then the difference in power might be enough to warrant an upgrade. As it is, though, the Skylake range of Core CPUs are still very good pieces of hardware. If you need to squeeze every bit of power out of your CPU or you want to upgrade to the newest generation as a means of future-proofing your device (in a sense, at least), then maybe you want to pick up a Surface Pro, but for everyone else, the CPU probably shouldn’t be the reason to dive in. So what about the display? We see much the same thing here. Both the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Pro offer 12.3-inch PixelSense displays at 2736×1824 resolution. There are a lot of similarities between the two, and though the new Surface Pro has a slight edge thanks to things like support for P3 wide color gamut, it doesn’t really seem like they’re different enough for one to be the clear winner. Remember, it was only a year and a half ago that DisplayMate said that the Surface Pro 4 had “one of the very best and most accurate displays available on any mobile platform and OS.” With that in mind, most people are probably going to be pleased with the display no matter which Surface Pro they have. Storage options are the same between devices, as are the options for RAM. Both will be running Windows 10 Pro out of the box, so there won’t be any difference in software at all. We’re quickly running out of things to compare and contrast here, though there are still some advantages that the new Surface Pro can boast over its predecessor. For instance, the kickstand now features a hinge that allows for a 165-degree angle, putting the Surface Pro at an angle reminiscent of the Surface Studio. The Surface Pen has also been significantly revamped for this release, as it’s now capable of recognizing 4,096 levels of pressure, a huge increase over the previous Pen’s 1,024. The fanless design found in Core m3 models of the Surface Pro 4 has expanded to Core i5 models in the new Surface Pro. Toss in a few other features like like LTE functionality and few aesthetic improvements (lower overall weight and slimmer bezels), and we’ve got pretty much all differences in the new Surface Pro. So, is it worth the upgrade for folks who already own a Surface Pro 4? The answer for most people will be no. If you need the extra power afforded by Kaby Lake processors or you specifically want something like LTE support, then an upgrade becomes easier to recommend, but everyone else is probably better off waiting for the next Surface Pro iteration.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway. Use the arrow keys above/below the images to navigate the list, or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

I’m currently loaning my new GPU to my brother, so i’m rocking my old 6950 GPU at the mo, which is well below the listed minimum specs so i had discarded that as an option for now.

It’s poorly optimized and lags on non-topoftheline cpu’s. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:02 Bernardo says: Yes, I’m having the same problem. It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope.

Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2….

Ga verder Meer informatie Software-update: Kodi 17.3 Door Bart van Klaveren, donderdag 25 mei 2017 19:43, 10 reacties • Feedback Bron: Kodi, submitter: Idiocracy Versie 17.2 van Kodi kon al een paar dagen geleden worden opgehaald, maar nu is wegens twee vervelende fouten ook alweer een opvolger beschikbaar gekomen. Deze crossplatform-mediacentersoftware wordt ontwikkeld voor Windows, macOS, Linux, Android en iOS. In versie 17.0 is de mogelijkheid voor het afspelen van 10bit- en hevc-materiaal toegevoegd, in combinatie met gpu's van Intel of Nvidia die daar ondersteuning voor bieden. Ook de standaardskin is gewijzigd naar Estuary en voor apparaten met een aanraakscherm is dat Estouchy geworden. Sinds versie 17.1 zijn de volgende verbeteringen aangebracht: Kodi v17.3: A minor bug fix and security release Sorry for this quick bump to v17.3 however we deemed it necessary. In the previous v17.2 we had a slight issue due to packaging certain binary add-ons like PVR, visualisation and Inputstream. Sadly we only uncovered this too late after release. Additionally on the older distros like Ubuntu 14.04 in combination with the available GCC 4.8 compiler an issue surfaced which we had to fix as well. This v17.3 release fixed both these issues and should be completely working again including the missing add-ons. Fixes done in this release: Fixed missing binary add-ons on release time Fixed crash on older distros like Ubuntu 14.04 with GCC 4.8 compiler From previous v17.2 release: Fix selection after channelgroup switching in PVR guide window Fix handling of gaps that caused eradic behaviour in EPG grid Allow backing out of fullscreen pictures by mapping longpress guesture Quick fix for wake up command not being called in PVR power management Use alternative method to check if platform updates have been installed on Windows Set the minimum version in the code which is currently OSX 10.8 Fix possible security flaw which could abused .zip files which try to traverse to a parent directory Use the correct ttc font from the video file for subtitles on Windows Detect and delete zero-byte database files which causes crashes Security You may have read in the news that malicious subtitle zip files could potentionally infect and harm your media player including Kodi. When Check Point researchers uncovered this flaw they contacted us up front to let us know about this flaw. Our developers fixed this secuity gap and have added the fix to this v17.2 release. As such we highly encourage all users to install this latest version! Any previous Kodi version will not get any security patch. We have began the roll out of this version and Android Play Store as well as Windows Store have this update pending and will roll out as soon as possible. Please be patient if you are using these store versions. Our official download page of course has the regular install files available for the supported platforms. To be clear this possible vunrability is only present when you first enable a subtitle dowload add-on and then actually download zipped subtitles. Any subtitles that you already have as text file, are embedded in the video stream or are included with you DVD or Blurays are safe.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Laptop News 4 VAIO launches a special edition Mercedes Benz laptop in Japan by Mark Tyson on 25 May 2017, 12:09 Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadhvd Add to My Vault: If you are interested in luxury laptops and automobiles, VAIO has a treat for you in the form of the new VAIO Z Mercedes Benz Collection 13.3-inch laptop. We have seen laptops with branding and livery from the likes of Lamborghini, Ferrari, and Porsche previously but this is the first Merc laptop that I can recall. Unfortunately this Mercedez Benz laptop doesn't bring anything really new to the market, other than various branding and design flourishes. As Liliputing points out, the hardware beneath the branding extras is the very same VAIO Z Flip 13.3-inch laptop that launched in Japan and USA over a year ago. The underlying hardware is compact and appealing; you can choose from Intel's capable Skylake processor options and there is a 13.3-inch, 2560 x 1440 pixel touchscreen display. Living up to its 'FLIP' name there's a hinge behind the display which lets it flip to face away from you. Moving onto the 'special' Mercedes Benz features, there are multiple logos, insignia and designs from the automaker here and there around the laptop as you can see in the images. There are two design variants to choose from; one featuring the Vision Tokyo concept car, and the other featuring a classic Mercedes Benz 300SL. The VAIO Z Mercedes Benz Collection 13.3-inch laptop has one more automotive enthusiast trick up its sleeve; it offers a Mercedes Benz boot up sound as embedded below. In Japan this new luxury convertible Intel Core i7 laptop is listed on Amazon for between ¥250,000 and ¥285,000 ($2,232 to $2,545). However the non-Mercedes edition, identical except for the fripperies mentioned above, can be bought in the US at $1,299 from the Microsoft Store. The premium for a few etchings plus the vroom-vroom boot up sound seems rather high.

X John Morrissey’s appeal over €30.5m Anglo loan dismissed Dublin businessmen had argued fund not entitled to sue him over property debt about 13 hours ago Anglo Irish Bank signage. Photograph: Bryan O’Brien         The Court of Appeal has dismissed a businessman’s appeal over whether an investment fund was entitled to sue him over a €30.5 million debt it bought from Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC). John Morrissey claimed the alleged general illegal conduct of IBRC’s predecessor, Anglo Irish Bank, precluded the fund, LSREF III Stone Investments, pursuing him for the property loans debt. The appeal court found Mr Morrissey, Palmerston Road, Rathmines Dublin, was bound by some of seven previous and unappealed High Court rulings related to the loans. One of these, in particular, related to a finding that Anglo’s conduct was outside the scope of his action unless he could show the relationship between him and the bank was fiduciary in nature, the court said. One of those judgments, in May 2013, found the relationship between Mr Morrissey and the bank did not go beyond the ordinary contractual relationship and there was therefore no fiduciary relationship. The courts previously heard Mr Morrissey is a qualified actuary who worked in a number of sectors, including Guinness Peat Aviation, before setting up his own aircraft leasing business. In 1994, he sold that leasing company to Royal Bank of Scotland before going on to study experimental physics in Trinity College Dublin. While there, he met the founder of a software company Havok, with which he also became involved, and which was later sold to computer technology giant, Intel. Around 1999, he got into the property business primarily acquiring and renovating period properties in Dublin 6 which he either sold or rented. It was now too late for the wider issue of Anglo’s conduct to be raised by way of defence, Mr Justice Hogan said Dismissing his appeal on Thursday, Mr Justice Gerard Hogan, on behalf of the three-judge appeal court, said Mr Morrissey was allowed to admit fresh evidence at the outset of his appeal which related to the conviction in July 2016 of three former Anglo executives for conspiracy to defraud. At the heart of his appeal was his claim, due to alleged illegal conduct of Anglo, IBRC, and following the sale of his loans, LSREF III Stone, was debarred from recovering the debt, Mr Justice Hogan said. The parameters for the defence to the claim Mr Morrissey owed the debt were established in a previous High Court decision which was not appealed and the wider issue of illegality could only be raised where there was a fiduciary duty, the judge said. It was now too late for the wider issue of Anglo’s conduct to be raised by way of defence, Mr Justice Hogan said. Mr Morrissey, who had successfully claimed he was overcharged €143,000 in interest, had argued this showed bad faith on the part of the bank but the overcharging was the result of, “at worst careless computation” with no evidence of any intention to deceive, the judge said. There was no basis for Mr Morrissey’s claim the sale of the loan to LSREF III Stone was champertous, he also held. Champerty is a form of maintenance where financial support is provided by a party with no connection to a dispute in exchange for a share in the spoils of any proceeds from litigation or some other profit. A 2015 High Court decision striking out the majority of Mr Morrissey’s defence and counterclaim was also correct, the judge said. Mr Morrissey also had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of that part of the 2013 Act setting up IBRC, permitting the sale of the loans, because he would not benefit in any tangible or practical way from a finding of unconstitutionality, he ruled.       Topics: John Morrissey Anglo Irish Bank Guinness Peat Aviation Havok Intel Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Royal Bank of Scotland Read More Tayto Park unveils plans for €48m hotel and health spa Lone Star to check out of Jurys Inn hotel chain US-backed Broadhaven pays more than €90m for Dublin sites Two Dublin office investments for sale at €4.4m and €1.6m New retail lettings at Blanchardstown Centre to create 50 full-time jobs Two Dublin developments show the impact of new rent rules Hibernia Reit shares surge as it signals generous payouts Irish companies take a shine to rooftop solar Land between suburbs of Malahide and Swords for sale at €5.25m  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy China’s giant funds industry eyes Dublin as European HQ after Brexit Work Comeback kids: Entrepreneurs who survived the bust Soccer Keane doubts soccer can heal Manchester’s pain Construction Wild Geese: the Tipperary man drawing the map of Sydney Sponsored The Story of Home: a potter’s life Life through a lens: Samsung S8 brings photography to next level The Story of Home: A Kerry mountain retreat Truth serum: how serums won a place in our beauty regimes Latest Business Aryzta appoints James Leighton as non-exec director 07:35 Frequent flyer happy to call Australia home 07:03 CoderDojo to merge with makers of €5 computer 07:00 Future Proof: SL Controls managing director Keith Moran 06:49 Planet Business: Central Bank items set for auction and crypto-currencies 06:44 Most Read in Business 1 Putting Mr Men characters at heart of staff recruitment 2 CoderDojo to merge with makers of €5 computer 3 China’s giant funds industry eyes Dublin as European HQ after Brexit 4 Getting a fix on multinational input to Irish economy 5 Motor insurance premiums may rise to pay for insolvencies fund 6 Comeback kids: Entrepreneurs who survived the bust 7 Setanta saga winds up with policyholders footing the bill 8 Europcar’s Colm Menton on the ‘tough business’ of car rentals 9 Ryanair may have to stop selling UK flights next year 10 Frequent flyer happy to call Australia home Never miss a story.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway.

I’m currently loaning my new GPU to my brother, so i’m rocking my old 6950 GPU at the mo, which is well below the listed minimum specs so i had discarded that as an option for now. But if it’ll somewhat run on an intel IGP it’ll run on that for sure… Would mean tearing myself away from Rimworld though :P Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:20 Expose Gaming1 says: Wow, two of my favorite game are on this list.

It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope.

Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2….

It’s got all the things you need on a decently specced gaming laptop, and it’s mainly built for gamers with a small budget. For $799, you get Intel’s latest and greatest Core i7 processors, and the NVIDIA GeForce GTXX 1050 Ti. And if you are a fan on AMD, you can get the device with AMD’s A-series processors, as well as the Radeon RX550 GPU from AMD.

Experience Tour. Organized around music, gaming, action sports and other events, Razer will give event attendees a chance to immerse themselves in advanced gaming and virtual reality technology, or to compose their own electronic music tracks with state-of-the-art computers and software at the Razer Music demo. Razer's summer tour begins Sunday May 28 at the SoundSet Music Festival in Minneapolis, hitting major college campuses nearing its conclusion in September. On the way, the rolling entertainment experience will stop at events including Comic-Con International (San Diego), E3 (Los Angeles), Rooster Teeth's RTX (Austin), the Free Press Summer Festival (Houston) and QuakeCon (Dallas). More than 20 interactive demo stations featuring Razer's newest Razer Blade laptops and accessories will give visitors the ideal environment to experience PC and virtual reality games. They'll be able to test their skills in custom racing pods with Project CARS™ 2, which is a game currently in development by Slightly Mad Studios and being published by BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc. The competitor who records the fastest time each day will win additional prizes. Event attendees can also play the latest games titles on the high-performance Razer Blade series laptops. The systems are powered by VR-ready Intel® Core™ i7 processors and NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 10-Series graphics, as well as Razer's newest gaming mice, keyboards, headsets and console products. Consumers will also have the ability to create custom Razer Blade "X-Rays" using green screen technology, choosing from popular gaming heroes to reveal their inner gaming character and share with friends. Shifting from consuming entertainment to creating it, the Razer Music experience section will show how music production software like Image-Line's FL Studio integrate Razer Chroma lighting to add a visual element to audio production. Full licenses of Image Line's flagship music production suite, FL Studio: Producer Edition (a $200 value), are available to all registered owners of 2016 or newer Razer Blade laptops.

Julius Delos Reyes | Air Force Academy Cadet 1st Class Hayley Weir and Dr. Ryan Burke, assistant professor with the Department of Military and Strategic Studies, designed armor prototypes capable of stopping 9 mm, .40-caliber Smith and Wesson and .44 magnum pistol rounds fired from close range. The project is now under provisional patent status, and Weir and Burke have a year to improve the technology before they can file the official patent to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. (U.S. Air Force photo/Tech. Sgt. Julius Delos Reyes)  see less | View Image Page U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY, CO, UNITED STATES 05.10.2017 Story by Tech. Sgt. Julius Delos Reyes  United States Air Force Academy ✔ ✗ Subscribe 10 A cadet and professor at the Air Force Academy concocted a thick gel that can stop a bullet fired from a .44 Magnum. Cadet 1st Class Hayley Weir and military and strategic studies professor Ryan Burke created the gel that enhances body armor when inserted into the right material. They designed the materiel for the body armor, too. Their model uses 75-percent less fabric than typical military-style body armor, weighs far less and is half as thick. So far, their invention has grabbed the attention of the Department of Homeland Security, various public and private research organizations including Intel Corp, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Success didn’t always seem to be in the cards, as the duo struggled to answer Weir’s original question that sparked the research: can a fiber coated with the right thickening fluid stop a bullet? According to published studies it can, but it took Weir and Burke more than 20 attempts over two months to design the right materiel and fluid. “The goal was to create lightweight, flexible body armor,” Weir said. ‘Let’s do it’ Weir is a military and strategic studies major. Her concept took flight in 2014 when her chemistry professor challenged students to stop a speeding bullet with carbon fiber, Kevlar, and epoxy. Weir wondered if she could create an armor that was thinner, lighter and flexible. Much of the body armor that stops or disperses the impact of a bullet is heavy and inflexible. The answer, she learned, combined chemistry, physics and material science and design. She spent weeks researching material for a prototype. As for the fluid, Weir focused on non-Newtonian fluids that become solid when stressed. “The fluid was the key component I was researching,” she said. The research gained momentum, but there was a bump in the road. Weir needed to switch majors from materials chemistry to military and strategic studies. “I’d already done six months of research on the project and I didn’t want to just toss that away,” she said. It was then she met Burke. Burke holds a doctorate in public policy and knows how to research. To top it off, he’s a former Marine who is intimately familiar with body armor. “It’s heavy, cumbersome and inflexible,” he said. Still, Burke was ready to partner with Weir and give it a college try. “When she came to me with this idea, I said ‘let’s do it,’” he said. “Even if it is a miserable failure, I was interested in trying.” They started their work in April 2016. Weir’s conceptual knowledge and Burke’s research knowledge formed the foundation for their research. “It is her concept,” Burke said. “I’ve become a self-educated chemist in some respects.” Testing and more testing Burke and Weir went to work testing different material and finding a safe place to store and handle potentially dangerous substances. They began testing their prototype in October. They had the Academy’s firing range, bullets, weapons and a high-speed camera. Weir believed the fluid inside the prototype body armor would harden upon a bullet’s impact and contained the bullet in the armor. They just needed to prove they were right. For nearly two months, Weir shot dozens of prototypes with a 9mm pistol. Each prototype failed. Twenty bullets went through 20 prototypes with little to no change in bullet speed. “It was frustrating,” Weir said. They watched the high-speed camera, went back to the drawing board and changed the materiel’s layering sequence. “Alright, let’s not get our hopes up,” Burke said. Weir considered giving up. “Maybe there’s nothing here,” she remembers thinking. Weir and Burke began another round of testing Dec. 9. Even with a clear sky and calm winds, they were hesitant. Weir fired and Burke caught the playback on the camera. “Hayley, I think it stopped it,” Burke said. They replayed footage and gave each other “high fives.” For the first time, their prototype stopped a bullet. “It was surreal,” Burke said. Now The Air Force Civil Engineer Center’s Blast Programs Technologies Group invited Weir and Burke to their ballistics testing range at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, where their prototype body armor stopped a .44 magnum bullet fired at close range. The Tyndall research has produced 13 armor prototypes capable of stopping 9 mm, .40-caliber Smith and Wesson and .44 magnum pistol bullets fired at close range. “We just combined different things that already existed and turned it into something that ended up working,” Weir said. Weir and Burke are the only cadet and professor to achieve patent-pending status on a research project at the Academy this academic year. They have a year to improve the technology before filing for an official patent. Weir said the effort was worth it. “I thought that was the coolest thing I’d ever done as a cadet,” she said.

Snigdha Sengupta (From left) Nexus Venture Partners’ co-founder Suvir Sujan, managing director Anup Gupta, co-founder Sandeep Singhal and co-founder Naren Gupta. Mumbai: By this time, Nexus Venture Partners, one of India’s top venture capital firms, should have been sitting on a substantial pile of cash from the sale of its stake in troubled e-commerce company Snapdeal. Instead, for more than three months, the Mumbai-based firm has fought a bitter (but losing) boardroom battle to save its investment. At this juncture, it may have little choice but to walk away from what could have been its most lucrative bet with its principal investment and pride barely intact. Delhi-based Snapdeal (Jasper Infotech Pvt. Ltd)—it has been widely reported—is up for sale and for a song. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp., Snapdeal’s largest investor, is desperately trying to merge the company with its larger Bengaluru-based rival Flipkart in an all stock transaction that values the former at about $1 billion. Snapdeal was valued at $6.5 billion at its peak not too long ago. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son. Photo: Bloomberg As part of the transaction, SoftBank, which owns about 33% of Snapdeal, has offered to buy the stakes of Nexus and Kalaari Capital, another early venture capital investor in the company, for $60 million and $30 million, respectively. They each own about 10% and 8% of Snapdeal and enjoy veto rights on critical matters such as the proposed distress sale. Until recently, both were opposed to the terms being offered by SoftBank. But, early this month, Kalaari Capital managing director Vani Kola resigned from the company’s board. That doesn’t necessarily mean the Bengaluru-based venture capital firm loses its veto rights. However, if the move signals acquiescence to SoftBank’s terms, which is more likely than not, it leaves Nexus with little leverage in its standoff with the Japanese media and internet conglomerate. It isn’t difficult to understand Nexus’s dogged resistance. The venture capital firm hasn’t liquidated any of its stake in Snapdeal, acquired at an estimated investment of more than $40 million over multiple funding rounds. On the other hand, Kalaari Capital, whose overall investment is estimated at $27.5 million, has already harvested a reported $100 million by selling a portion of its original stake to SoftBank more than two years ago. Nexus’s predicament, however, brings up a couple of pertinent questions. One, like other early-stage investors, why didn’t it sell its stake, even partially, before Snapdeal fell off the wagon? According to three people familiar with developments at the company who spoke on condition of anonymity, the venture capital firm had at least two prime opportunities to do so well before matters spun out of control. Two, does Nexus need to re-evaluate its own strategic direction as an early-stage investor in the Indian technology start-up market? Nexus declined to respond to an e-mailed questionnaire. A fatal error in judgement? When SoftBank entered Snapdeal in October 2014 with a $627 million investment, it is believed to have made offers to buy the stakes of some of the company’s existing investors. Since Snapdeal’s valuation had vaulted to a reported nearly $2 billion with SoftBank’s entry, many of its early investors stood to reap a significant upside. Apart from Nexus and Kalaari, the other early investors in the company at the time included Bessemer Venture Partners, Intel Capital, eBay Inc. and Saama Capital. Some passed up on the offer. Others such as Kalaari and Bessemer decided to cash in. Bessemer, which owned a 4% stake, sold shares to SoftBank and hedge fund Stanley F. Druckenmiller (see chart). SoftBank declined to respond to queries. Nexus is also believed to have been among those who passed up on the offer to sell. It had its reasons. Just months before SoftBank arrived, the firm had rolled up its investment in Snapdeal by participating in a $134 million funding round led by Nasdaq-listed e-commerce marketplace eBay. The investment was reportedly made from its $110 million India Opportunities Fund, a sidecar fund raised for the specific purpose of follow-on investments in potentially successful later stage portfolio companies such as Snapdeal. It probably reckoned that with the financial muscle of SoftBank on board, the going could only get better. And, for a brief while it did. About nine months later, Taiwanese manufacturing company Foxconn Technology Group, Chinese e-commerce marketplace Alibaba and SoftBank led a $500 million funding round in Snapdeal. Existing investors Temasek Holdings, BlackRock, Myriad Asset Management and Premji Invest also participated in the round. Snapdeal’s post-money valuation jumped to $4.8 billion. This time, eBay decided to cash in. It sold 1.16% of its 9% stake to Foxconn. Around the time that the Foxconn-Alibaba funding round was being closed, Canada’s largest professional pension fund, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP), came calling at Snapdeal. It made offers to buy the stakes of some of the company’s remaining early investors. Bengaluru-based venture capital firm Saama Capital cut a deal to sell its entire stake to OTPP. The deal closed in November 2015. Saama Capital managing partner Ash Lilani told Mint in March last year that the sale was profitable enough for the firm to return its second fund, the $26 million Saama Capital II, to its investors or limited partners. Saama had invested about $4 million over multiple funding rounds in Snapdeal. Lilani declined to share details about the size of the stake sold. Again, Nexus is believed to have been among those that OTPP approached. The venture capital firm passed up on the offer. At the time, Snapdeal’s valuation had climbed to over $5 billion and Nexus’s stake would have been worth well over $500 million. Email queries to OTPP remained unanswered at the time of going to press. “There was a small mismatch in the valuation… Nexus turned down the (OTPP) offer because it wanted a slightly higher valuation,” says one of the three people cited earlier. That error of judgement may have cost Nexus possibly the most profitable exit from its portfolio. Snapdeal hasn’t been able to raise any significant primary capital since the Foxconn-Alibaba round and its valuation has plummeted due to external and internal factors. “Timing is everything in the venture capital business. Especially when it comes to exits. In this case, greed seems to have obscured that judgement,” says the second of the three people cited earlier. Whether it was greed or whether Nexus allowed itself to be blindsided by SoftBank’s financial muscle is something there are no clear answers to yet. What’s incredible though is how a frontline venture capital firm failed to see that it could never be anything but incidental to a devastating game of oneupmanship that was playing out between two of the most powerful investors in India’s start-up market at the time. Nikesh Arora vs Lee Fixel Before SoftBank announced its arrival in India, New York-based hedge fund Tiger Global Management enjoyed unobstructed access to some of the country’s fastest growing technology start-ups. The hedge fund employed a swift pace of dealmaking and higher-than-market valuations to edge out some of the most experienced venture capital investors at the deal tables. By late 2014, the firm’s private equity arm, led by secretive fund manager Lee Fixel, had put an estimated $2 billion to work in buying up prime stakes in frontline start-ups such as cab hailing services Ola, online classifieds platform Quikr and Flipkart. Tiger Global’s rising fortunes in the Indian market soon attracted a myriad of global investors from hedge funds to sovereign wealth funds to strategic investors. Like Tiger Global, they were often willing to pay a hefty premium to corner a piece of the world’s fastest growing consumer internet market. Among them, SoftBank had the most resources and ambition and, it lost no time in matching Tiger Global dollar for dollar. Led by Nikesh Arora, a former high profile Google executive who had recently taken charge as vice-chairman, SoftBank quickly deployed nearly $2 billion across start-ups such as Snapdeal, Ola, property listings platform Housing, budget stays aggregator OYO Rooms and grocery e-tailer Grofers in a matter of months and, not surprisingly, at peak valuations. Venture capital firms such as Nexus, though relegated to the sidelines of the battle between these two investors, didn’t have cause for complaint. Valuations were only headed north and as long as the money continued to flow in, they were happy to ride the wave. Their investee companies, among them Snapdeal, Flipkart and Ola, also rode the wave. Encouraged no doubt by their deep-pocketed investors, they threw caution to the wind and went on a spending spree to corner market share. Vanity metrics such as GMV (gross merchandise value) trumped boring ones such as unit economics. Then the music stopped. Some time during the last quarter of 2015, Tiger Global and a host of non-traditional start-up investors were compelled to scale back their investments. China had just devalued the yuan and global public markets were in turmoil. With the hot money gone, it didn’t take long for valuations to crash across the board. India’s start-up market, especially the consumer internet sector, slipped into a downturn that continues to this day. Layoffs, fire sales and investment write offs became commonplace. And suddenly, the premium valuations that investors such as SoftBank had paid during the good times became untenable. Things may not have turned as bad as they did for Snapdeal and Nexus, in particular, but for one surprise development in the middle of last year. Arora, who was tipped to succeed SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son as chief executive officer, suddenly quit. The reason for his somewhat unceremonious departure was that Son wanted to keep the CEO’s job for a few more years. Arora didn’t think it was worth his while to wait. His departure, however, almost immediately turned off the funding tap for SoftBank’s portfolio companies in India leading Nexus to its current predicament. Time to change track Nexus is no minnow in India’s venture capital market. It commands a portfolio of more than 75 companies and has raised $1.2 billion across four funds, making it the country’s second largest venture capital firm. It is also fairly popular with global limited partners (investors in venture capital funds). It latest fund, the $450 million Nexus Ventures IV, was raised in the midst of the ongoing downturn and is the biggest it has ever raised. Despite those credentials, however, the Snapdeal debacle may compel the venture capital firm to revisit how its wants to play the market, especially in India, in the years ahead. Founded over a decade ago by Naren Gupta, Sandeep Singhal and Suvir Sujan, Nexus has always been a bit different from other homegrown venture capital firms. It has one foot in the US and one in India and spreads its investments across the two markets. Gupta, a successful former technology entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, leads the firm’s overseas investments from Menlo Park in California. Singhal, who earlier co-founded Mumbai-based venture capital firm eVentures India, and Sujan, co-founder of online auctions platform Baazee, lead investments in India out of the firm’s Mumbai and Bengaluru offices. The dual market strategy has helped the firm to deliver exits from the portfolio relatively early in its history and, unlike many of its peers, fairly consistently year-on-year. It scored one of its earliest ones in 2011 when DimDim, a web conferencing services firm, was acquired by Salesforce.com for a reported $31 million. Other early exits from the portfolio include Cloud.com, acquired by Citrix for a reported $200-250 million, Gluster (acquired by Red Hat), Netmagic (acquired by NTT Docomo) and Astrid (acquired by Yahoo Inc). In all, the firm has exited 16-odd companies from the portfolio. But, there’s a catch. Ten of those exits, nearly all of them very profitable, are from investments in overseas companies, usually based in Silicon Valley. Many of those companies do have fairly extensive back-end operations in India but essentially constitute the firm’s overseas portfolio. On the other hand, the handful of exits it has been able to push through from its India portfolio are less remarkable. Among Nexus’s better known exits from the India portfolio are hotel aggregation platform MagicRooms, which was acquired by Yatra in 2011 for an undisclosed sum, classifieds platform OLX (it sold its stake to South African internet and media conglomerate Naspers), and the sale of its stake in Komli Media’s India business to SVG Media for an undisclosed sum. The consumer internet portfolio, in particular, has been a rough ride for the firm. In early 2015, Mumbai-based Housing, one of its earliest investments which also, incidentally, had SoftBank as co-investor, turned into a public spectacle when the company’s founder and CEO Rahul Yadav engaged in an ugly and very public spat with its investors. Yadav was ultimately ousted by the investors led by SoftBank and Housing was merged with rival PropTiger this year in an all stock transaction. The outcome of that investment now depends on how well PropTiger performs. Another early investment, budget stays aggregator Stayzilla, recently shuttered operations after it was unable to raise fresh capital and is now trying to pivot to a new business model. The firm has also had trouble with its investments in TinyOwl and Roadrunnr. About a year ago Mumbai-based food ordering service TinyOwl closed its operations and merged with Bengaluru based Roadrunnr, a hyperlocal delivery service, in an all stock transaction put together by the investors of the two firms. The merged entity was rebranded and relaunched as Runnr. Recent media reports suggest Runnr is now up for sale after being unable to raise fresh capital. A profitable Snapdeal exit would have helped the firm reverse that track record and establish its credentials as a bankable investor in India as much as one in the US. There is an outside chance that the firm may still be able to salvage its investment in Snapdeal. It isn’t clear yet whether the payout being offered by Softbank for its 10% stake includes a stake in Flipkart if the merger materializes. But, if that is not the case, it may be time for Nexus to rethink its future direction. Incidentally, last year, the firm upped investments in the US market. Seven out of the 12 deals it closed involved start-ups based there. It would not be surprising, and probably neither unwelcome to its limited partners, if the firm decided to shift strategy to being a largely US-focused investor while continuing to invest opportunistically in India.

Today, we're spotting some actual decent pricing on Alienware's Aurora premium gaming desktop. Typically, we see these machines priced far above the $1,000 mark but as of writing there are two models well below the $900 price point. In fact, the cheapest Alienware Aurora now starts at $733 after instant savings plus coupon. While you're definitely still paying a premium compared to building your own rig, these three deals are a far cry from their usual price tag (with the Core i7 variant having a list price of $1,550). Alienware Aurora Desktop Deals Use code: 50OFF699 Alienware Aurora R6 Core i5-7400, Radeon RX 560 2GB, 1TB HDD, 8GB RAM — $733.99  (list price $800) Alienware Aurora Core i5-7400, GeForce GTX 1060 6GB, 1TB HDD, 8GB RAM — $832.99  (list price $1,100) Alienware Aurora Core i7-7700, GeForce GTX 1070 8GB, 2TB HDD, 16GB RAM — $1,175.99  (list price $1,550) Above, you'll find three models, all with the Aurora chassis that's tool-less accessible and comes with those AlienFX lighting zones with 20 different colors. Which, depending on who you ask, are either pretty cool or an unnecessary drain on the wallet. All models come with the latest Intel 7th Gen Kaby Lake processor, with the two sub-$900 model equipped with a Quad Core i5-7400 (a CPU priced around $190). The base model comes with a Radeon RX 560, which is just a rebranded Radeon RX 480 that's slightly higher clocked (currently priced at about $110). This model comes in at $733 and is essentially a VR-ready gaming rig for a decent price. Throw in another $100 and you'll step up from the RX 560 2GB GPU to a configuration with a GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB of RAM (priced around $230 to $250). By all accounts, we think this is the model to go with given you'll get far better performance in high-resolution gaming and will be able to run games at higher settings. Finally, the priciest deal above is the Core i7-7700 model (a $300 CPU) that comes with a spiffy GTX 1070 8GB, which can run almost all games currently on the market at high/max settings -- unsurprising, given that it's a ~$350 CPU. This configuration clocks in at $1,175 and comes with 16GB of RAM and a 2TB HDD (though honestly, you should price in an SSD for better performance). For the sake of comparison, we priced out a similar config and come up with a similar street price of about $1,193 before rebate -- so the deal on the Alienware Aurora Core i7 with GTX 1070 is priced quite competitively all things considered, particularly since we went and picked cheaper parts when available. Similar Config to Core i7 Alienware Aurora Core i7-7700 - $294.99 Cryorig H7 cooler - $34.89 Gigabyte GA-Z270MX Micro ATX SLI mobo - $157.33 2x8GB DDR4-2400 Memory - $105.99 Seagate Barracuda 2TB - $69.89 Zotac GeForce GTX 1070 - $349.99 Deepcool TESSERACT SW ATX Mid-Tower Case - $39.99 EVGA 450W 80+ Bronze PSU - $42.89 Windows 10 Home - $87 Total - $1,193.85 Let us know if the items we picked seem reasonable. We think it's safe to say that some of the items picked may be higher quality parts than what Dell will be tossing into the Aurora, while some are on par or worse (e.g., the case chassis is subjective). Most of the OEM savings are via the software where Dell probably gets Windows 10 for dirt cheap, whereas the average Joe will need to fork over about $80+ for a copy. If you've been looking for an Alienware gaming desktop for cheap, we think these three deals are as good as it'll get until we hit holiday season 2017. If you're not into these rigs, well, feel free to add to the usual flame that accompanies any mention of Alienware machines. Deals from Dealzon. Sales help support Destructoid. You are logged out.

At first glance, it appears virtually identical to the Surface Pro 4 that it launched in October 2015, but the updated model features over 800 improvements, including Intel's latest seventh-generation Core processors. With the new Surface Pro due to launch in numerous markets around the world on June 15, Microsoft is apparently clearing out stock of the Surface Pro 4. In the UK, the company has now slashed up to 24% off the entire Pro 4 range: Model Regular price Current price Savings Intel Core m3 (No Pen) 4GB RAM / 128GB SSD £749 £636.65 £112.35 (15%) Intel Core i5 4GB RAM / 128GB SSD £949 £721.65 £227.35 (24%) Intel Core i5 8GB RAM / 256GB SSD £1099 £917.15 £181.85 (17%) Intel Core i7 8GB RAM / 256GB SSD £1,369 £1,104.15 £264.85 (19%) Intel Core i7 16GB RAM / 256GB SSD £1,549 £1,231.65 £317.35 (20%) Intel Core i7 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD £1,899 £1,529.15 £369.85 (19%) Intel Core i7 16GB RAM / 1TB SSD £2,359 £1,869.15 £489.85 (21%) Those discounts are scheduled to remain available until June 30, but with the new Surface Pro due to be released in just a few weeks' time, we're likely to see further price cuts to help shift the remaining inventory of the older models. In face, these latest reductions come just a few days after the last discounts on the Surface Pro 4 ended, during which Microsoft offered up to 19% off across the range. Alongside the Surface Pro, the Surface Studio will also launch in the UK on June 15, as will the new Surface Laptop, which Microsoft unveiled earlier this month.

The prospect of new congressional subpoenas came one day after the committee’s Senate counterpart served its own subpoenas to Flynn’s businesses. The FBI also informed a House committee that it would not be complying with a Wednesday deadline to turn over memos written by former FBI Director James Comey detailing his discussions with President Donald Trump. One memo reportedly shows Trump pressuring Comey to shut down the bureau’s investigation into Flynn’s Russia ties. Meanwhile, former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page told the Associated Press he will testify next month before the House intelligence committee. And The New York Times reported that U.S. intelligence services obtained information during the 2016 presidential election that showed senior Russian officials discussing how to influence Trump through his campaign advisers. Citing three current and former American officials, the Times said U.S. intelligence officials collected information last summer showing Russians zeroed in on Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, a former head of U.S. military intelligence who was a key Trump campaign adviser. The Russian officials thought Manafort and Flynn could be used to influence Trump’s views on Russia. The Times said some of the officials bragged about ties to Flynn. Others thought they could use Manafort’s association with former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who led a pro-Russian political party, to their advantage, the Times reported. A day earlier, former CIA Director John Brennan told a House committee that he had seen intelligence that “revealed contacts and interactions” between Russian officials and Americans “involved” in the Trump campaign — a cause for concern in case the Russians could get the Americans to cooperate. During a breakfast Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the House intelligence committee’s top Democrat, told reporters that Flynn declined to turn over records to the committee, and he said it will be “following up with subpoenas.” Schiff said the subpoenas will likely go out this week. He did not elaborate on what materials the committee was seeking. The attempts to compel Flynn to produce documents were just another sign of the intense focus on Trump’s former national security adviser, who was fired in February after the White House said he misled administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his contacts with Russian officials. In addition to the congressional scrutiny, Flynn is currently a target of an FBI counterintelligence investigation, a federal probe in Virginia and a Defense Department inspector general’s inquiry into the propriety of foreign payments he accepted. In a letter to the Senate committee on Monday, Flynn invoked his Fifth Amendment protection from self-incrimination in deflecting the panel’s subpoena for a wide array of documents and information related to his contacts with Russians. Flynn’s attorneys argued that the Senate’s request was too broad, and if Flynn were to comply, he could be confirming the existence of some documents and, in effect, providing testimony that could be used against him. They also said an “escalating public frenzy” against Flynn and the appointment of a special counsel had created a legally perilous environment for Flynn to provide the information. In response, the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday sent a letter narrowing its request for documents. It also issued subpoenas seeking documents from two of Flynn’s businesses— Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm owned by Flynn and his business partners, and Flynn Intel Group LLC, a company he used for other projects, such as his paid speeches. Flynn could choose to contest the congressional subpoenas seeking his business records, but legal experts said he would not prevail. Solomon L. Wisenberg, a Washington defense lawyer who worked as a prosecutor during the Starr investigation of President Bill Clinton, said both of Flynn’s corporate structures would likely have to turn over all business records sought by the committee. “The Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to business entities, period,” he said, adding that both Supreme Court and District of Columbia Circuit Court rulings would weigh on the committee’s side. While Flynn decides what, if anything, he’ll provide to Congress, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said the FBI will not be turning over memos and other materials that detail discussions between Comey and Trump. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said in an interview on CNN that the FBI sent his committee a two-sentence email saying that it would not be turning over the materials now that the Justice Department has appointed a special counsel. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who was appointed as special counsel, is overseeing an investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and whether there was any collusion with Trump associates. Chaffetz said he is considering issuing a subpoena for the documents, and he wants a better explanation from the FBI about why it’s not turning them over. “It isn’t going to be good enough to just offer two sentences and say: ‘Hey, there’s a special counsel. We’re not going to let Congress do its job,”’ he said. Chaffetz said he also asked Comey this week about the memos, but Comey declined to say whether they were in his personal possession or still at the Justice Department. The FBI declined comment. Meanwhile, Page said Wednesday that details are still being worked out about his testimony before the House intelligence committee next month. Page said he expects to testify sometime during the week of June 6 and wants at least part of his testimony to be public. ABC News first reported Page’s planned testimony. Page is one of several people associated with Trump’s campaign who are under investigation over their ties to Russia. Page has denied any involvement in Russian attempts to influence the election. ——— Associated Press writers Stephen Braun and Eric Tucker contributed to this report.     Tags: flynn, committee, intelligence, former, trump, officials, Other stories from today: Islamic State-linked militants besiege Philippine city Large inflatable obstacle course stolen in Phoenix burglary Demand rebounds for state pollution permits     Print this Page  |  << Back            Daily Journal Quick Poll   Development trends on the Peninsula ...

Gartner Announces Rankings of the 2017 Supply Chain Top 25 Unilever Retains the Top Spot in Rankings as Amazon Joins the "Masters" Winners Revealed at Gartner Supply Chain Executive Conference in Phoenix, AZ. May 25, 2017 10:34 AM Eastern Daylight Time PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gartner, Inc. has released the findings from its annual Supply Chain Top 25, identifying supply chain leaders and highlighting their best practices. Analysts announced the results at the Gartner Supply Chain Executive Conference, which is being held this week at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge Resort and Spa in Phoenix, AZ. "2017 marks the 13th year of our annual Supply Chain Top 25 ranking," said Stan Aronow, research vice president at Gartner. "This year we have an impressive group of leaders with new lessons to share, including two more recent entrants from the high-tech and consumer product sectors." "Despite some striking performances, however, today's supply chain leaders face a much different business environment than just 12 months ago," said Mr. Aronow. "A general trend toward protectionism, as evidenced by Brexit and the policies of the current U.S. administration, has caused some companies to shift supply network design decisions and create contingency plans in anticipation of new trade policies. Continued investment in innovative supply chain capabilities will be required to meet this changing landscape." Unilever topped the Supply Chain Top 25 ranking for the second consecutive year in 2017, followed by McDonald's, Inditex, Cisco and H&M (see Table 1). Two new companies made the Supply Chain Top 25, with Nokia rejoining after a seven-year hiatus and Diageo making the list for the first time. Perennial supply chain leader Amazon joined Apple and P&G in qualifying for the "Masters" category, which Gartner introduced in 2015 to recognize sustained leadership over the last 10 years. "Hardly a day goes by without another announcement of Amazon's foray into a new market, ownership of its own logistics capabilities or filing of patents to improve customer experience," said Aronow. One indicator of Amazon's outsized influence on retail is the simultaneous real estate boom in distribution centers and bust of brick and mortar stores in the U.S. over the past two years. Apple continues to improve and innovate both its solutions and the means of producing them. While the company has backed off plans to produce its own cars, it is still actively working on autonomous vehicle technology and experimenting with augmented reality (AR) technologies. Consumer product giant P&G continues to innovate through digital automation of workflows, and the use of algorithm-driven tools to reduce exceptions and enable end-to-end planning. In recent years, P&G has also accelerated its investment in people and environmental initiatives. Along with the Masters category, the Supply Chain Top 25 continues to offer a platform for insights, learning, debate and contributions to the rising influence of supply chain practices on the global economy.

Source: Gartner (May 2017) Three key trends stand out this year for the supply chain leaders that are accelerating their capabilities, separating them further from the rest of the pack. Digitalization of Supply Chain The past few years have seen a massive shift in companies creating digital connections within and across their supply chain operations. Leading companies view digitalization as an opportunity to not only provide agile support for existing products, but to reduce time to market for new ones. Some of the most disruptive and impactful technologies include solutions combining Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, cloud computing and advanced analytics. Simulation and optimization capabilities have moved into the mainstream and now cognitive computing capabilities, including machine learning, are in the labs of the most advanced supply chains. The digital pieces of the supply chain puzzle are coming together in a way that will enable more holistic, real-time management of the entire ecosystem. Adaptive Organizations and Capabilities Interrelated with digitalized supply chains is the ability of companies to be more adaptive to changes in their value chains. More specifically, leaders are creating adaptive organizations and capabilities to survive and win independent of future supply-related constraints or customer needs. "Some of the more impressive supply chain organizations have created a modular supply chain service model that allows for variants of functional capabilities to be combined into "plug-and-play" segments, such as make-to-stock, configure-to-order or engineer-to-order manufacturing profiles," said Aronow. "This approach allows them to more quickly and flexibly support different business needs and outcomes, and speeds up activities such as M&A integration." Developing and Fostering Healthy Ecosystems Leading companies realize that supply chain success depends on the health and well-being of the critical ecosystems within and around them. The people aspect of supply chain ecosystems applies to relationships with suppliers, partners, employees and customers along the value chain. Leading supply chains focus as much on ethical sourcing and supporting customer well-being, as they do on talent acquisition and development. Environmental sustainability is another priority for top supply chain organizations that set ambitious stewardship goals in the areas of emissions, water and other natural resources. Companies that are further along in developing mature corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices tend to have moved beyond mere regulatory compliance and are linking these efforts back to support for their underlying corporate strategies. Gartner clients can read more in "The Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 for 2017." About the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 The Supply Chain Top 25 rankings comprise two main components: business performance and opinion. Business performance in the form of public financial and CSR data provides a view into how companies have performed in the past, while the opinion component offers an eye to future potential and reflects leadership in the supply chain community. These two components are combined into a total composite score. Gartner analysts derive a master list of companies from a combination of the Fortune Global 500 and the Forbes Global 2000. In an effort to maintain the list of companies evaluated at a manageable level a general annual revenue threshold of $12 billion has been applied.

New Surface Pro 2017 vs MacBook Pro: What’s the difference? by Sean Keach 17 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments New Surface Pro vs MacBook Pro: When you’re looking for a work laptop, you’ll probably consider the Microsoft Surface Pro or Apple MacBook Pro, but which is best? The MacBook Pro has long been a staple of Apple’s computing roster, offering solid performance and an ever-attractive design for a generally high price. Microsoft’s attempt to dethrone Apple as the go-to provider of work machines for hip professionals is the Surface Pro series. These laptop/tablet hybrids have proved popular with those looking for a versatile machine with decent power and a Windows operating system. Choosing between the two is a difficult task, so read on to learn the key differences between the two devices. Note that the new Surface Pro was only announced on May 23, and although it’s available for pre-order, it won’t begin shipping in the UK until June 15, 2017. Related: Best laptops New Surface Pro 2017 vs MacBook Pro Design: What’s the difference? The MacBook Pro comes in two variants: 13-inch and 15-inch. This dictates the size of the screen (diameter), so you’ll want to work out whether paying a premium for those extra two inches is worth it. Related: New Surface Pro 2017 vs Surface Pro 4 On the newer MacBook Pro models, there’s an option to add a Touch Bar: an OLED strip that replaces the row of function keys on a standard MacBook Pro. The strip shows different function keys depending on the app you’re in. So if you’re using Photoshop, you’ll get relevant shortcut keys; listen to Spotify and you’ll be able to control music. All-in-all, the MacBook Pro is a fairly conventional laptop, boasting a slim and stylish metal chassis and a large, accurate trackpad. The keyboard has Apple’s new shallow-actuation design for keys, so typing should be very low-effort compared to older models. Importantly, despite the fact it has tonnes of power, the MacBook Pro is very slim and light. In fact, it weighs just 1.37kg and has a thickness of 14.9mm – that’s about two iPhone 7 handsets stacked on top of each other. But the Surface Pro is also a slick piece of kit, featuring a swanky hybrid design. This means that it can be used like a tablet, or attached to a keyboard for a laptop-style experience. Related: Best PC games The only screen size available for the Surface Pro is 12.3-inches, which some power users may find limiting. That said, the 12-inch to 13-inch mark is probably the safest size range for notebook devices, so it should suit the needs of most users. Like the MacBook Pro, the Surface Pro is very attractive and svelte, and will look gorgeous sitting on almost any surface. That’s partly thanks to the fact it has an incredibly slim 8.5mm body, and weighs a feathery 768 grams (up to 784 grams, depending on your configuration). Bringing the Surface Pro in at under the 1kg mark is a real win for Microsoft, as it will woo those who regularly have to cart their notebook around. There’s no clear winner in terms of design, rather two very different options that will require your personal judgement. The MacBook Pro is great for anyone who wants a sturdy, traditional laptop with a tried-and-tested design. If you’re looking for a more lightweight hybrid device, the Surface Pro is obviously the way to go. New Surface Pro 2017 vs MacBook Pro Specs: What’s the difference? Hardware Both the Surface Pro and MacBook Pro have high-resolution displays, but Microsoft’s hybrid is marginally superior with a display resolution of 2736 x 1824 pixels to Apple’s 2560 x 1600 pixels. Given the fact that MacBook Pro panels are slightly bigger, the Surface Pro comes in with a hefty 276ppi pixel density compared to the MacBook Pro’s 227ppi. As far as processing goes, the Surface Pro and MacBook Pro are on relatively equal footing. They both use Intel’s latest 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs. What you get in terms of performance depends on how much you’re willing to spend on pricier configurations. Storage is fairly equal between the two devices, as both come with 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB options. Surface Pro has a minor advantage however, in that there’s a 128GB configuration available too, for those who don’t need heaps of storage and want to keep costs down. The cloud is your friend, folks. Memory is consistent again, with both devices featuring 8GB and 16GB RAM configurations. But once more, Microsoft’s Surface Pro edges out with a 4GB option. Both products use 1866MHz LPDDR3 memory, though this is upgradeable. One of Surface Pro’s big wins over the MacBook Pro is its camera tech. The Surface Pro has two cameras (8-megapixel and 5-megapixel) on the back and front, both of which are capable of capturing 1080p (Full HD) video. By comparison, the MacBook Pro’s singular camera can only capture 720p (HD) footage, which means video calling won’t look as sharp. Apple’s controversial port strategy also causes some problems for the MacBook Pro: there’s no SD card slot. There are two (or four) Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports though, as well as a headphone jack. The Surface Pro, meanwhile, features a full-size USB 3.0 port, a headphone jack, Surface Connect support, a MicroSDXC card reader, and a Mini DisplayPort. And finally, thanks to a number of enhancements, Microsoft’s Surface Pro promises an incredible 13.5-hour battery life. That’s compared to Apple’s 10-hour charge cycle claim for the MacBook Pro. Ouch.

This is because both companies have crafted exceptional operating systems, and you’ll probably get along fine with either. If you’re already used to one, then the obvious advice is to just stick with the OS you’ve become familiar with. You’ll work much faster on a machine that you know the ins and outs of. Both Windows and MacOS support workflow continuity to their respective smartphones, so if you’ve got an iPhone then you might want to invest in a MacBook Pro. Similarly, if you’re one of the very few people using a Windows 10 phone, maybe a Windows machine is for you. Apple MacBooks have a reputation for being safer in terms of cybersecurity, if only because they have a very locked-down software setup i.e. the App Store. But you’ll find that Microsoft – although arguably more vulnerable – still has a wider selection of software available to it, particularly when it comes to niche apps. In any case, whichever OS you choose, you won’t be disappointed. New Surface Pro 2017 vs MacBook Pro Price: Which laptop is better value? The issue of value is difficult because both devices come in so many different configurations. The cheapest MacBook Pro will set you back £1,449 while the most expensive costs £2,699. By contract, the cheapest Surface Pro costs £799, with the top-end model also costing £2,699. For a good comparison, a 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar costs £1,449. That gets you 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and an Intel Core i5 processor. The closest two Surface Pro models to that price point are as follows: Option 1 (£1,249): Intel Core i5 / 8GB RAM / 256GB storage Option 2 (£1,549): Intel Core i7 / 8GB RAM / 256GB storage So in both cases, it’s a fairly similar proposition. What it will probably come down to is your preference in terms of design and usability. However, it’s worth noting that the Surface Pro arguably has a better array of ports, and offers some advantages, including better battery life, a more pixel dense screen, and a better camera setup. Still, you’re likely to find similar value for money from both devices at a similar price point – after all, they’re designed to compete with each other. New Surface Pro 2017 vs MacBook Pro Summary: What’s the difference? Here’s a quick breakdown of the key differences between the new Surface Pro and MacBook Pro. Design: Both devices are very attractive, but the key difference is the MacBook Pro is a laptop, while the Surface Pro is a tablet/laptop hybrid. Specs: Both devices offer basically the same configuration options, although the Surface Pro seems to be a more complete offering. Price: The MacBook Pro starts at £1,449, while Microsoft undercuts Apple with a lower-configuration option at £799, but both devices eventually work their way up to a similarly configured £2,699 beast.

Air New Zealand is pinning its hopes on the Microsoft Hololens, a 'mixed reality' headset that allows users to see holograms alongside the physical world. When a flight attendant looks at a customer, the Hololens displays personal details including their preferred meal and why they're travelling. The HoloLens app is still in its Beta testing stage, but the airline hopes the devices could help staff to better understand their customers' emotions and needs. Scroll down for video  Air New Zealand hopes the Microsoft HoloLens (pictured), a 'mixed reality' headset that allows users to see holograms alongside the physical world, will help improve in-flight service HOLOLENS The headset is designed with multiple environment understanding sensors and powered by a custom-built Microsoft Holographic Processing Unit (HPU) and an Intel 32-bit architecture. The device weighs just a little over one pound and consists of a 64GB of Flash memory and 2GB of RAM. The battery lasts for about two to three hours, with up to two weeks of standby time, says Microsoft. HoloLens has 'see-through holographic lens' that use an optical projection system to create multi-dimensional full-colour holograms.  In order to achieve this, the device has an optimal holographic density of 2.5k radiants. The Microsoft HoloLens has not yet been released to the public.  Leeanne Langridge, cabin crew manager at Air New Zealand, said: 'Our customers are first and foremost people. 'We always want to treat them as individuals by understanding personal needs. 'Exploring new technologies for us to learn even more about the people that step on board our aircraft is incredibly exciting. 'Some people come on board and they could be travelling for a special occasion. Or alternatively, they may be under some stress. 'This technology could allow us to interpret our customers needs and tailor our service so from the moment they step on board, we're giving them exactly what they need to feel safe, comfortable and taken care of.' The HoloLens can display a range of personal details about a customer, including how long it's been since they had their last drink, according to Air New Zealand. The device may even be able to detect a passenger's emotional state from cues including facial expressions or heart rate. The HoloLens is still under development and has not yet been released to the public. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Leaked footage from top-secret Area 51 military base shows...

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe.

Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag.

CNET First Look Microsoft's slightly evolved Surface Pro Small updates and new accessories for the number-free new Surface Pro. 1:15 / May 23, 2017 Transcript After an unexpectedly long wait the successor to Microsoft's Surface Pro Four is finally here. But it's not called the Surface Pro five, it's not even called the Surface Pro four and a half even though that's what it essentially is. Instead this is simply the Surface Pro no number needed. What exactly is new about the Surface Pro? It's slightly, thinner, lighter with rounder edges. But I was hard pressed to tell the difference, even side by side. It gets newer Intel processors and the kickstand folds down a little bit further. Some models are even going to be completely fanless. If you saw the colored [INAUDIBLE] fabric covering the recently announced. Surface laptop. This is similar option here too. The surface keyboard cover would come in basic black but also fabric covered color options. Sadly, all the covers are still sold separately and the colored versions will cost even more than the standard one. Yeah the stylist pen is now going to run you another hundred bucks too. But it does work with a bunch of new Microsoft office features giving you better stylist drawing tools in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. While this is a very modest set of updates the Surface Pro is still hard to top as the all around best example. Of a high powered Windows 2-in-1, even though we still can't seem to convince them to throw the must have keyboard in the box for free.

(Photo: The Motley Fool) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE You probably heard this: Billionaire Elon Musk just came up with this crazy idea that all his Tesla electric cars will soon be self-driving. Yes, Musk is a genuine genius and I’m a huge believer in where Tesla is steering the entire auto industry. But I have never seen so many people get so excited about a single peach while ignoring the entire orchard. All of the talking heads in the media go on and on about Tesla, but they’re not telling you the really BIG story behind it all. It’s the giant prize that Tesla and hundreds of other companies are chasing. And before you ask, no… it’s not self-driving cars. Self-driving cars could be almost insignificant compared to this new technology. Consider that the global self-driving market is supposed to reach $42 billion by 2025, according to Boston Consulting Group. But the tech I’m talking about? Cisco believes it will be a $19 trillion market before 2025. That’s 452 times bigger than self-driving cars! And as huge as that number is, consulting firm Accenture says 87% of consumers don’t even understand what this technology is. What an opportunity that presents! It’s going to be so big that companies like Cisco and Intel are budgeting billions to be a part of it. Even stodgy old General Electric is impressed… it sees an opportunity bigger than the entire economy of China! But again, 87% of consumers don’t yet understand what it is. 7 out of 8 people you see walking down the street have never even heard of it. And we believe that presents a huge opportunity for us individual investors, especially if we get in before the crowd. But that crowd may be just around the corner… I’ve already seen this technology being pitched on ABC’s Shark Tank show, and one of the investors on there went gung-ho for it by making one of the biggest investments in the show’s history. So, the masses will soon be catching on as this tech gets more and more popular. And I suspect when they do, they’ll be focusing on obvious names… like Cisco and Intel… as they look for their share of the pie. But, one renegade investor in Virginia is quietly recommending shares in a few not-so-obvious under-the-radar companies BEFORE this technology really goes mainstream. <!--iframe--> Think about how many amazing technologies you've watched soar to new heights while you kick yourself thinking, "I knew about that before everyone was talking about it, but I just sat on my hands." Don't let that happen again. This time, it should be your family telling you, "I can't believe you knew about and invested in that technology so early on." Heck, not long ago, I saw it featured on the show Shark Tank. Click here to gain instant access to this video. It’s free to you!

Home My Account Classifieds Share What is Happening Now Tools Solano News California / US / World Opinion Features Entertainment Sports Business Real Estate Obituaries Gallery 7,878 123 FAIRFIELD-SUISUN, CALIFORNIA California/U.S./World Subpoenas pile up for Michael Flynn’s documents By The Associated Press From page A1 | May 25, 2017 ShareTweet ShareTweet WASHINGTON — Subpoenas for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn piled up Wednesday as the House intelligence committee pressured Flynn to cooperate with its investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The prospect of new congressional subpoenas came one day after the committee’s Senate counterpart served its own subpoenas to Flynn’s businesses. The FBI also informed a House committee that it would not be complying with a Wednesday deadline to turn over memos written by former FBI Director James Comey detailing his discussions with President Donald Trump. One memo reportedly shows Trump pressuring Comey to shut down the bureau’s investigation into Flynn’s Russia ties. Meanwhile, former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page told The Associated Press he will testify next month before the House intelligence committee. And The New York Times reported that U.S. intelligence services obtained information during the 2016 presidential election that showed senior Russian officials discussing how to influence Trump through his campaign advisers. Citing three current and former American officials, the Times said U.S. intelligence officials collected information last summer showing Russians zeroed in on Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, a former head of U.S. military intelligence who was a key Trump campaign adviser. The Russian officials thought Manafort and Flynn could be used to influence Trump’s views on Russia. The Times said some of the officials bragged about ties to Flynn. Others thought they could use Manafort’s association with former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who led a pro-Russian political party, to their advantage, the Times reported. A day earlier, former CIA Director John Brennan told a House committee that he had seen intelligence that “revealed contacts and interactions” between Russian officials and Americans “involved” in the Trump campaign — a cause for concern in case the Russians could get the Americans to cooperate. During a breakfast Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the House intelligence committee’s top Democrat, told reporters that Flynn declined to turn over records to the committee, and he said it will be “following up with subpoenas.” Schiff said the subpoenas will likely go out this week. He did not elaborate on what materials the committee was seeking. The attempts to compel Flynn to produce documents were just another sign of the intense focus on Trump’s former national security adviser, who was fired in February after the White House said he misled administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his contacts with Russian officials. In addition to the congressional scrutiny, Flynn is currently a target of an FBI counterintelligence investigation, a federal probe in Virginia and a Defense Department inspector general’s inquiry into the propriety of foreign payments he accepted. In a letter to the Senate committee on Monday, Flynn invoked his Fifth Amendment protection from self-incrimination in deflecting the panel’s subpoena for a wide array of documents and information related to his contacts with Russians. Flynn’s attorneys argued that the Senate’s request was too broad, and if Flynn were to comply, he could be confirming the existence of some documents and, in effect, providing testimony that could be used against him. They also said an “escalating public frenzy” against Flynn and the appointment of a special counsel had created a legally perilous environment for Flynn to provide the information. In response, the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday sent a letter narrowing its request for documents. It also issued subpoenas seeking documents from two of Flynn’s businesses— Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm owned by Flynn and his business partners, and Flynn Intel Group LLC, a company he used for other projects, such as his paid speeches. Flynn could choose to contest the congressional subpoenas seeking his business records, but legal experts said he would not prevail. Solomon L. Wisenberg, a Washington defense lawyer who worked as a prosecutor during the Starr investigation of President Bill Clinton, said both of Flynn’s corporate structures would likely have to turn over all business records sought by the committee. “The Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to business entities, period,” he said, adding that both Supreme Court and District of Columbia Circuit Court rulings would weigh on the committee’s side. While Flynn decides what, if anything, he’ll provide to Congress, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said the FBI will not be turning over memos and other materials that detail discussions between Comey and Trump. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said in an interview on CNN that the FBI sent his committee a two-sentence email saying that it would not be turning over the materials now that the Justice Department has appointed a special counsel. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who was appointed as special counsel, is overseeing an investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and whether there was any collusion with Trump associates. Chaffetz said he is considering issuing a subpoena for the documents, and he wants a better explanation from the FBI about why it’s not turning them over. “It isn’t going to be good enough to just offer two sentences and say: ‘Hey, there’s a special counsel. We’re not going to let Congress do its job,’” he said. Chaffetz said he also asked Comey this week about the memos, but Comey declined to say whether they were in his personal possession or still at the Justice Department. The FBI declined comment. Meanwhile, Page said Wednesday that details are still being worked out about his testimony before the House intelligence committee next month. Page said he expects to testify sometime during the week of June 6 and wants at least part of his testimony to be public. ABC News first reported Page’s planned testimony. Page is one of several people associated with Trump’s campaign who are under investigation over their ties to Russia. Page has denied any involvement in Russian attempts to influence the election.

Mike KirchubelMay 25, 2017 - 6:40 am Hannity went off last night, trying to sell the fact that there has been no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. I'm sure he convinced a lot of right wingers that this investigation is all b.s. But this is where we are, we are subpoening Flynns documents. The idea is to lock down the low level guys first and build your case. We'll work up the food chain soon enough, dont worry.Reply Report abusive comment Richard DaleMay 25, 2017 - 7:31 am So Hannity was correct. Currently there is no evidence. Thanks for confirming that MK.Reply Report abusive comment Mike KirchubelMay 25, 2017 - 9:56 am I have not confirmed that the investigation is b.s. The investigation turns up new, damaging information every day. Beyond the Trump Russian connection is Trump's obstruction of justice. A separate issue, unattached to the collusion probe. Maybe he only gets impeached for obstruction. That's ok.Reply Report abusive comment Tom ChalkMay 25, 2017 - 10:11 am Well, well, well. Seems the Dems are abandoning the "Trump/Russian collusion" BS and pivoting to an equally empty bag of "carp"-- obstruction of justice. What next--failure to brush after every meal? Lol!Reply Report abusive comment Richard DaleMay 25, 2017 - 12:06 pm You have nothing. Understood the first time.Reply Report abusive comment JimboMay 25, 2017 - 4:53 pm So Dick, are you are saying you are loony enough to follow the advice of someone so off their rocker that FOX sent them on a unscheduled vacation and advertisers are fleeing his show? That is all I read here.Reply Report abusive comment Richard DaleMay 25, 2017 - 7:30 pm I'm still waiting for the evidence Jimbo. As I recall that was pretty important regarding Hillary. I am just trying to follow the high level of standards established by your side.Reply Report abusive comment Tom ChalkMay 25, 2017 - 8:07 pm RD: That's right. MK has nothing but bluster, hatr*d, and half-a$$ed predictions of doom for Trump and all Republicans. He also predicted a Hillary landslide! Lol! I'm not a fan of Trump, the person, but I am a fan of the office of POTUS. Elections will decide the future occupant of the Whitehouse in due time. Fine with me.Reply Report abusive comment Richard DaleMay 25, 2017 - 9:11 pm Tom, all I really ask is that both sides play by, and be judged by, the same set of rules. I can live with that, Democrats can't and don't.Reply Report abusive comment Deplorable JimMay 25, 2017 - 8:05 am Non-News. Dems got what they wanted when Flynn got fired, and the Dems just want to continue stirring the pot of nothingness. What a waste of time and taxpayer dollars.Reply Report abusive comment CD BrooksMay 25, 2017 - 8:08 am Deplorable Jim, have you taken over for pornac in the satire category?Reply Report abusive comment Mike KirchubelMay 25, 2017 - 9:51 am CD, you have to try hard to be as dense as these guys.Reply Report abusive comment Deplorable JimMay 25, 2017 - 12:33 pm Project, much?Reply Report abusive comment JimboMay 25, 2017 - 4:46 pm Aww, some snowflake is melting over its inability to control what news is.Reply Report abusive comment JimboMay 25, 2017 - 4:45 pm Just a reminder, Nixon visited Saudi Arabia during the Watergate scandal.

The latest is Acer, which has just announced four new products: The Nitro 5 laptop, the Spin 1 convertible (2-in-1), and two Iconia 10 tablets. Starting with the laptop, Acer says its all-new Nitro 5 line is aimed at casual gamers, which translates to lower prices and GPUs that max out at Nvidia’s GTX 1050 Ti. There’s also the option of an Intel i5 or i7 processor, or you can go team red and pair a Radeon RX 550 with AMD’s 7th generation A-Series FX, A12, or A10 APUs. All models come with a 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080 IPS display, keyboards with red backlighting, and PCIe SSD storage (up to 512GB) paired with an optional HDD (up to 2TB). Ports include one USB 3.1 Type-C (Gen1), one USB 3.0 with power-off charging, two USB 2.0s, and an HDMI 2.0, which can support up to 90Hz refresh rates. Acer is making a lot of the laptop’s cooling setup. “Dual fans with Acer Coolboost™ technology deliver heightened fan speeds and cooling ability, and allows users to manually control the cooling process when heavy use requires an added boost,” the company writes. The Acer Nitro 5 will be available in the US this July starting at $799. Acer is also introducing a new 2-in-1: the 11.6-inch Acer Spin 1. The all metal-chassis, Windows 10 device is the latest version of the Spin 1 convertible. Weighing just 2.76Ibs and with a thickness of 0.55 inches, the Spin 1 offers either a Pentium or Celeron processor, 4GB of DDR3L memory, and a choice of 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB of eMMC storage.

Whether you are looking for a short-term fix or investing in a solid model from last season's batch there are some key points to consider.  Here's our guide to make sure you get the model that is right for you.   This month's best laptop deals: Lenovo Ideapad 100s: A cheap portable laptop that comes in at under £100. £89 (used in White) at Amazon Acer Chromebook 11: A budget Chromebook with decent battery life, ideal for simple web-based tasks. £149 from PC World Acer Chromebook 15: For a bigger screen on a Chromebook this Acer now comes in at under £250. £190 (new in white) from Amazon Asus X555YA: A great everyday laptop with a large 15 inch screen and 1TB hard drive. £297 from Amazon HP Pavilion 15: A laptop with a big screen and good battery life which has recently seen a price drop. £349 from Currys Lenovo Yoga 510: A fantastic price for a decent hybrid laptop that can be used like a tablet. £399 from Currys Asus ROG GL552VX: Game for less with this powerful laptop for less than £800. £743 from Amazon Dell XPS 13: Get Dell's flagship laptop with high-end performance for less than £1,000. £979 from Amazon Macbook Air: Prices have dropped on Apple's Air for this 2015 model. £849 from BT Shop What do I want my laptop for? If you only want a quick stand-in or portable device you can easily pick up a Windows laptop or Chromebook for £250 or even less. There are plenty of brands out there built for those who just want something simple, and cut price Dell, Acer and Lenovo laptops can all be found for just a couple of hundred pounds. If you want a device that is a little more powerful for running run several programs without feelings the heat you will need to spend a bit more. You can find good deals on laptops with slightly cheaper Intel or AMD processors. Often last year’s models will still be highly viable everyday laptops, and you can find a decent machine for around £500. Even for gaming laptops there are plenty of deals. While you are unlikely to see many going for less than £750, you can still find models that have had their prices slashed and will still perform well on the latest games. For all the details on the kind of things you should be looking for when buying a new laptop, take a look at our best laptops to buy article for a full buying guide. Where can I get a good laptop deal? Most major retailers will offer deals around the year. One-off events such as the January sales, Amazon Prime Day in July or Black Friday can also be the answer to securing a great deal. UK retailers such as John Lewis, Currys, PC World, Argos and Tesco all offer deals and discounts on laptops, often with options to throw in cases, hardware, security systems and programs such as Microsoft Office. Several of the main manufacturers have their own websites offering outlet price models at a discount and online retailers such as Amazon, Very and AO all have discounted deals and bundles. What are the best laptop deals for students? Many major laptop providers offer an education discount for students buying a laptop. This can help save you around 10% or better on even high-end models. While you may be tempted to just go for the cheapest model, even top of the range Apple products offer a 10% discount to students, as does Microsoft for its Surface Book and Surface Laptop. Other manufacturers including Dell, Lenovo and HP all offer chunky savings if you buy using an education discount. Should I buy a new or refurbished model? Buying a new model is the safest bet to get decent performance and specs up to the level of what the developer called for. However, it is easy to pick up a refurbished model online. Generally these will be memory wiped, cleaned and factory reset, but there is no clear standard for buying a refurbished laptop. Some major suppliers such as Dell will resell their own refurbished models in outlet stores or online. With a major developer you can have some guarantee of quality, but you should always check what warranty the model comes with and what operating system will be installed. Jargon buster | A rough guide to tech terminology Under £250 Cheapest Windows laptop: Lenovo Ideapad 100s Credit: Lenovo Screen size: 11.6 inches Weight: 998g Battery life: 8 hours This little laptop is not going to blow anyone away in terms of power, but for price and size it is designed to compete against Chromebooks and you can pick up a used one in white now for less than £100. For a new one, the asking price online is currently starting out at around £170. If you want a Windows laptop for the lowest price, this is your starting point. Lenovo Ideapad 100s Best Chromebook deal: Acer Chromebook 11 Credit: Acer Screen: 11.6 inches Weight: 1.25 kg Battery life: 9 hours One of the best budget Chromebooks you can buy, the Acer 11 has now dropped under £200 from some retailers. While this version lacks the flexible flip screen of its big brother the Acer R11, it runs on the same processor so will deliver similar results. It’s not very powerful and uses Chrome OS, meaning limited storage, but for simple web-based tasks and portability it is a bargain. Acer Chromebook 11 Best big Chromebook deal: Acer Chromebook 15 Credit: Acer Screen: 15.6 inches Weight: 2.2kg Battery life: 9 hours While it is large and chunky for a Chromebook, this Acer is a bargain if you want a bigger screen but only want a budget model. Asking prices have now fallen to around £190 on some major retailers for a new model, making this 15 inch Chromebook a bargain if you just need a stopgap laptop for simple tasks. Acer Chromebook 15 Under £500 Best everyday deal: Asus X555YA Credit: Asus Screen size: 15.6 inches Weight: 2.3kg Battery life: 6 hours Grab a cheap deal with £30 off on this Asus X555 for under £300. This model features an AMD A6 Quad Core processor which will be ample for everyday needs and comes with a 15.6 inch screen and 1TB of hard drive capacity. While big laptops at this price won’t excel at every task, and the screen resolution on this one could be said to be on the cheaper side, this is definitely a deal if you need a cheap model now. Asus X555YA Best deal for practicality: HP Pavilion 15 Credit: HP Screen size: 15.6 inches Weight: 2.3kg Battery life: 9.5 hours You can now save £150 on this HP Pavilion 15, which is a bargain for a decent laptop with a large screen size. Designed for everyday tasks with a 9 hour battery life and large enough that you could watch films or Youtube videos with ease and with three USB slots, an HDMI connector and a SD card reader it is fairly connective. The new base price has now dropped to around £350, down from around £150 at the start of this year, which makes this a good time to pick up this still fairly recent release. HP Pavilion 15 Best deal for a hybrid: Lenovo Yoga 510 14 Credit: Lenovo Screen size: 14 inches Weight: 1.75kg Battery life: 5 to 6 hours This two-in-one laptop has now dropped well below £500 in its most basic form, which uses a Intel Pentium 4405U processor for managing most simple tasks. With a 128GB SSD it will run smoothly, although this version only features 4GB of RAM may mean the laptop lacks power for some people. Prices on this model have now fallen to £399, making this a cheap tablet/laptop convertible you can pick up which will still deliver decent performance. Lenovo Yoga 510 14 Under £1,000 Best deal for gaming: Asus ROG GL552VX Screen size: 15.6 inches Weight: 2.4kg Battery life: up to 6 hours A gaming laptop for less, this Asus Republic of Gamers (ROG) model is now down below £700. A highly respectable build, this model has a 15.6 inch screen and a 6th generation Intel Core i5 processor and a 128 SSD. This heavy beast is highly connective for gaming headphones and gaming mouse, but white it has the specs to perform as a decent mid-range gaming laptop, the only drawback here is the battery life, unlikely to push more than 6 hours or so. Asus ROG GL552VX Best deal for performance: Dell XPS 13 Credit: Dell Screen: 13.3 inches Weight: 1.29kg Battery life: 13 hours By shopping around you can now find almost £200 off the brilliant XPS 13 laptop, considered one of the main current challengers to Apple's Mac range. The XPS 13 features a virtually borderless 13.3 inch Infinity Edge display, which is available with touch. Dell also claims the laptop offers up to 22 hours of battery life, although in practice this is more like 12 to 13 hours when streaming video. This latest model runs on Kaby Lake processors, Intel's newest and more powerful seventh generation processor. Dell XPS 13 (2017) Best deal for Apple: Macbook Air Credit: Apple Screen: 13.3 inch Weight: 1.35 kg Battery life: 12 hours Apple's highly successful Air has just had a price cut in the UK, bringing it down to around £850, perhaps in anticipation of the launch of Microsoft's competitor laptop the new Surface Laptop in June. This does, however, only bring the price of the Air closer in line with what it was on release date, with Apple having since hiked up prices in the UK. You can also get Apple products from the Apple Store with a 10% discount for students.

Andy KrollMay 25, 2017 6:00 AM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Retired Lt. General Michael Flynn, at podium, and then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump attend a campaign event with veterans at the Trump International Hotel on September 16, 2016. Tom Williams/Congressional Quarterly/Newscom via ZUMA Press Ekim Alptekin, a well-connected Turkish businessman at the center of one of the many scandals swirling around President Donald Trump and his White House, stood before a crowd of several hundred people in downtown Washington and sought to clear up a few things. "There's been a lot of media attention on it," he later told a reporter, "so I just wanted to address the issue." The "issue" in question was no small matter. Last year, Alptekin paid $530,000 to retired Lt. General Michael Flynn to lobby on behalf of Turkish interests. At the time, Flynn was a top adviser to Trump's presidential campaign, and after Trump's shock victory, the president-elect rewarded Flynn with the job of national security adviser. But it later emerged that Flynn had failed to register as a foreign lobbyist for this work, as required by law, and that he was under federal investigation for his secret lobbying for Alptekin. (Flynn was fired in February, after only 22 days on the job, amid reports that he had communicated with the Russian ambassador and lied about it.) So it was a bit awkward when Alptekin appeared in Washington this week for the 36th Annual Conference on US-Turkey Relations. (He chairs one of the conference's two main organizers, the Turkey-US Business Council.) In a speech on Monday, Alptekin addressed the Flynn controversy directly. "As many of you have read in the media," he said, "I hired the Flynn Intel Group in 2016 before the election with a mandate to help me understand where the Turkish-American relationship is and where it's going and what the obstacles are to the relationship." His willingness to confront such a thorny issue—legally and politically—caught some in attendance by surprise. Yet there was also a surreal quality to Alptekin's remarks, if only for this reason: He delivered them at the Trump International Hotel, owned by the president himself. International intrigue notwithstanding, the 36th Annual Conference on US-Turkey Relations was typical of the glitzy conventions and forums hosted in Washington. There were panels on e-commerce, NATO, and cybersecurity, all with the theme of encouraging greater cooperation between the governments and industries of the United States and Turkey. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and now a Zelig of Washington's paid-speaking and overseas-junket circuit, spoke at a luncheon sponsored by several major Turkish conglomerates, where he poked fun at the president and plugged his forthcoming book, Understanding Trump. For his part, Alptekin pointed out that the venue had been chosen well before Trump was elected president. In October 2016, the American-Turkish Council, a group devoted to building up business connections between the two countries (and the conference's other organizer), booked the Trump hotel in downtown DC, a short walk from the White House. According to Alptekin, the Turkish interest groups had first toured the hotel even earlier, in 2015, before Trump had declared his candidacy. Howard Beasey, president of the American-Turkish Council, told NPR, "Unfortunately, in our contract with the hotel, there is no I-became-president-so-you-get-to-break-your-contract-with-us clause." And so it was that Alptekin, whose hiring of Flynn helped plunge the Trump White House into turmoil, spent several days this week roaming the marble lobbies and conference rooms of Trump's DC hotel. He schmoozed with attendees, posed for photos, and sat for interviews with largely international news outlets, all the while surrounded by the name TRUMP. Aside from his opening remarks, however, Alptekin had little to say about Flynn. He denied to ABC News that he and his company had represented the government of Turkey. (In his retroactive filing, Flynn noted that his work for Alptekin "could be construed to have principally benefitted the Republic of Turkey.") Alptekin blamed the "highly politicized situation" in the United States for the "misunderstanding and misperceptions" around his company and hiring of Flynn. There are many lingering questions about Alptekin's role in the Flynn controversy: Why did Alptekin hire Flynn in the first place? Did Flynn tell Alptekin he wasn't going to register as a foreign lobbyist? Had Alptekin ever spoken with Trump himself? If Alptekin were subpoenaed by Congress or law enforcement as part of the Flynn investigation, would he cooperate and provide documents? Alptekin addressed none of these. He refused to comment to ABC News when asked whether he had been questioned or served a subpoena as part of the Flynn investigation. In the main lobby of the Trump hotel, I tracked down an assistant of Alptekin's and asked for an interview. She said Alptekin was no longer giving interviews. At that moment, Alptekin stood a few feet away, speaking on camera with a small TV crew. After he finished, he and his entourage sped past me in the direction of the hotel's ballrooms, presumably to rejoin the guests for a final panel on Turkey's shipbuilding industry.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Intel May Give Thunderbolt the Go Universal Push with CPU Integration May 25, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts MateBook X is a Perfect Bounce Back Attempt by Huawei Facebook Messenger New Update is All about Easy Access to What You Care About Thunderbolt is still confined to Macs. However, it might soon be changing as the high-speed USB technology is about to go universal as per Intel’s plans. Revealing its intentions to spread the technology across multiple devices, Intel has announced that it’s planning to integrate Thunderbolt 3 into future processors from the company. This will be followed by Intel releasing Thunderbolt Protocol Specification to the Industry that would finally have the technology at everyone’s disposal. While the current USB standards offer high speed transfers, the entry of Thunderbolt to all the mainstream devices is still of huge relevance. That’s not just because it can offer transfer speeds of 40 GB per seconds, four time faster than of USB. Instead, the addition of Thunderbolt would add a whole new dimension to current-gen PCs. These include varied applications like in offering multiple 4K monitor support, support for external drives and GPUs, connectivity with docking stations, and connectivity for virtual reality headsets. The free-licensing of Thunderbolt 3 would mean that peripherals of the above mentioned would well be embracing the technology to let faster and efficient transfer of data shape up between the devices and PCs. The harsh truth however is that it will indeed take some time to accomplish the vision of Thunderbolt everywhere. But if Intel gives the real push, then things might speed up. They shouldn’t hush down like in previous instances. To recall, Intel has been envisioning Thunderbolt integration for quite a time, but it now appears that everything is heading in the right direction.

The CRYORIG R5 high-end single tower and the Cu Series of Copper Fin enhanced coolers. The R5 is the second cooler in CRYORIG’s R series of flagship coolers.  The R5 is the missing piece to CRYORIG’s PC cooling lineup. It is a high-end dual-fan single tower that is designed to stay within the mainboard’s CPU Keep-Out-Zone. This means that the CRYORIG R5 has Zero RAM Interference, even on Intel’s X99/X299 based platforms. Made with performance in-mind the R5 contains multiple CRYORIG cooling innovations including: Convex-Align cooler base optimization, Multi-Seg™ Quick Mount System, 6 CRYORIG High-end Copper Heatpipes, CRYORIG Dual Fan Fin Optimizations and more. Dual XF140 800-1400 rpm PWM fans will be attached front and back for enhanced performance. The R5 will also see the debut of CRYORIG’s brand new Quick Lock Mounting, that promises to simplify the way coolers are mounted. CRYORIG’s Cu (Copper) enhanced Performance Edition coolers is a new twist to CRYORIG’s award winning CPU coolers. In traditional heatsink fin designs Aluminum provides a good combination of performance, weight and cost. But Copper provides roughly twice the heat conductivity compared to Aluminum. This is why CRYORIG is hand picking some of their most acclaimed coolers and fitting them with brand new pure copper fins. The Cu Series will first make it’s debut at Computex 2017. The CRYORIG C7 will be the first cooler to receive the Cu enhanced treatment, with further products to be announced later. At this time specs are not finalized yet. Rate this story Rating: 1 ...

By Liam Tung | May 25, 2017 -- 09:43 GMT (02:43 PDT) | Topic: Windows 10 Chuwi's SurBook is a low-price 2-in-1 tablet PC. Image: Chuwi In the wake of the Microsoft Surface Pro unveiling in Shanghai, Chinese hardware maker Chuwi has launched its crowdfunding campaign for a Surface Pro lookalike. Chuwi's Windows 10 SurBook fundraising campaign has been live on Indiegogo for days and so far has gained 399 backers who've pledged a total of $142,904. ed bott Six months with the Surface Pro 4: Patches, lappability, and battery life are key Six months ago, I decided to replace my desktop PC with a Surface Pro 4 and a Surface Dock. Read More The cheapest option available is the $300 64GB SurBook, but the one most fans have gone for is the $400 model, which includes a backlit keyboard, stylus, 6GB memory, and 128GB storage. The company teased its forthcoming Windows 10 2-in-1 in April as a "powerful but affordable" device with strikingly similar dimensions to the Surface Pro 4. It has an identical 12.3-inch display at a 2,736 x 1,824-pixel resolution, but runs on Intel Apollo Lake processors. Microsoft's new Surface Pro runs on the more expensive Intel Kaby Lake processors, and starts at $800 for the Core m3 model with 4GB RAM. Visually, the new Surface Pro doesn't differ that much to the Surface Pro 4. There are several key differences other than the processor. While Chuwi's device starts with 6GB RAM, Microsoft's entry-level Surface Pro has 4GB RAM. Chuwi also throws in the keyboard and stylus at no extra costs, while Microsoft charges extra for these. The SurBook features one USB Type-C port and two Type-A USB ports compared with the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Pro's single USB Type-A port. However, the SurBook is 200 grams heavier and slightly thicker than Microsoft's Surface Pro. Also, the new Surface Pro has a 13.5-hour battery life, while the SurBook has an eight-hour life. Though the SurBook promises to match many features of the Surface Pro at a lower price, it won't suit those who need the higher performance of Microsoft's own device and larger capacity storage. According to Chuwi, the SurBook 2-in-1s will be shipped around July. Chuwi has set out its comparison of the SurBook, Surface Pro 4, and iPad Pro.

By Jason Perlow for Tech Broiler | May 25, 2017 -- 10:57 GMT (03:57 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Which is better: Star Trek or Star Wars? Forty years ago today, George Lucas' Star Wars premiered at Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. It ushered in a culture of film and accompanying merchandising the world had never before seen, culminating in a $6 billion dollar purchase of Lucasfilm and its intellectual property in 2012 by Disney. Star Wars was really the beginning of the mainstreaming or dumbing down of Science Fiction. May of 1977 was an interesting time in history especially if you examine it from the perspective of the technology industry and from a sociological standpoint. Star Wars came out before the PC Revolution. Apple didn't have a personal computer product in the market until a month before the film's release and there were no Intel PCs until IBM released one in 1981. If you said "'handheld device" more than likely someone would probably think you were talking about Mattel's electronic football game or a Texas Instruments calculator. The pinnacle of home entertainment technology, the Atari 2600, would not be available until a few months after Star Wars was released. We were on the cusp of a technological revolution. It was on our minds, but out of sight for most of us. The Apollo program had ended only a few years before and space travel was very much been there, done that. CNET: Star Wars at 40 | 27 Star Wars goodies you can download and 3D print right now | TechRepublic: Video: 3 leadership lessons from Star Wars | The IT workers of Star Wars Politically, we were in the Carter Administration, the "Empire" and our enemy was the Soviet Union. We were in a recession. There was an oil embargo and people were lining up for hours to buy gasoline. We were two years out from the end of Vietnam. This was the backdrop against which moviegoers were trying to escape in air conditioned comfort for two hours for what would be a very hot summer. I saw the film opening week when I was eight years old. I had the toys, the lunch boxes, the pajamas, the playsets. As I look back it as an adult, Star Wars was really the beginning of the mainstreaming or dumbing down of Science Fiction. And while I enjoy the films, I don't have the same fondness for them as I do other popular sci-fi franchises, such as Star Trek. Star Trek 50 years of positive futurism and bold social commentary The combination of positive, visionary futurism with relevant social commentary distinguishes Star Trek from every other science fiction television program that has followed it. Read More Alas, Star Trek was intelligent and innovative but it would not really come into its own until it entered syndication post-cancellation and the films and The Next Generation which came much later. It was Star Wars' commercial film success that enabled Star Trek to return and be successful. Star Wars legitimized sci-fi for everyone else. You didn't have to be a total bookworm or social justice warrior to appreciate it. Star Trek had cool gadgets and deep character interaction, but Star Wars had a sweeping story arc and swashbuckling. In many ways, decades later, they continue to be the Yin and Yang of popular SF mythos. We know what Star Trek's technological and social legacy is. What of Star Wars? At first glance, it's the weaponry. The planet-killing Death Star is undoubtedly the ultimate representation of a weapon of mass destruction and an accurate reflection of people's greatest fears at the time. We were so close to the brink of annihilation in that past decade that so few of the successive generations will appreciate the state of constant fear all of us lived under on a daily basis. It should come as no surprise that the media collectively latched onto this a few years later by referring to our military R&D effort into shooting down enemy ICBM's using fantastical energy weapons as "Star Wars". While the energy weapons are flashy, ultimately, however, I think Star Wars' technological legacy comes down to the droids. It is the fundamental, albeit lofty idea that robots can be friends, not hell-bent on destroying humanity like HAL from 2001:A Space Odyssey or scary B-movie stuff like Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still. Everyone who walked out of that film in the summer of 1977 wanted to own a droid. I think the big question is are we any closer to getting one now than we were 40 years ago? There's no question that robotics and artificial intelligence has gotten way, way more sophisticated in the last 40 years. But we don't yet have general-purpose robots like Artoo and Threepio. And I don't think we're going to get them anytime soon. Robots and machine intelligence are everywhere, but they aren't necessarily in plain sight. Nevertheless, they are integral to the manufacturing of just about every complex durable good you can possibly think of and are very quickly displacing human beings in those industries. Amazon, the world's largest retailer, uses robots extensively in its shipping centers to prep orders for its millions of customers every day. Automated machine tooling via Computerized Numerical Control, referred to as CNC, is also widespread throughout the entire manufacturing industry. 27 Star Wars goodies you can download and... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 27 NEXT PREV And of course, 3D printing in the commercial, industrial and consumer sectors is growing like wildfire. Autonomous-capable vehicles, such as Tesla's luxury electric vehicles and Google's fleet of mapping cars are becoming more commonplace. It will be only a few years before there are purist autonomous designs used in commercial transportation and less than a decade before we see it used in consumer transportation at a wide scale. Robots are still very much in the vanguard of space exploration and they have brought us to the farthest reaches of our solar system and on the surface of Mars. They will continue to be the biggest bang for the buck in this area as they are far more cost-effective and safer than sending people. Robots are also used extensively in telemedicine, where skilled doctors can be thousands of miles away from a patient they are performing surgery on. Quick-serve restaurant companies like McDonalds and Starbucks are investigating the use of robots in their restaurants in order to streamline operations and to remove the human element from the customer experience. Robots can't give you food poisoning in your burger due to bad hygiene and due to their repetitive and precise nature, will always make that latte perfectly. All of these robots, however, are crafted for a specific purpose and use case. They aren't walking around and interacting with us on a daily basis and offering us advice on whether or not to fly through an asteroid field. These aren't meant to be our friends or our colleagues. These are meant to be our slaves. As they should be. But the reality is, we've become slaves to them as much they have become slaves to us. We've now conditioned ourselves to take our robot intelligence with us at all times and put it all over our homes. Our smartphones can run highly sophisticated agents that with only the sound of our voice can find the best local pizza restaurant, tell us the upcoming weather, or the latest sports scores. And that is just barely scratching the surface of what they can do, because the more sensors we attach to everything around us, and the bigger we make their databases, the more sophisticated their collective analytical capabilities will become. Many of us now have installed intelligent listening devices -- such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home -- that we've put in our living rooms and sleeping quarters that will not only do all of the above but will also control our appliances and play us our desired music at our command. All of this powered by extreme heavy lifting done by shared compute resources in the cloud. So it would seem that our desires to be filled with constant content and information and for the cloud to cater to our every whim is fueling the development of Skynet, Colossus, and HAL rather than Artoo and Threepio. And if current development in autonomous drones and advanced cruise missiles and other military UAV projects is any indication, we're starting to touch on Terminator territory. As an eight-year-old, I desperately wanted my very own Artoo and a Threepio. Forty years later, I hope we figure out how to keep our jobs away from them, that they don't acquire too much information on us as individuals, and that ultimately they won't destroy us. Are we heading towards Artoo and Threepio, or Gort, HAL and The Terminator? Talk Back and Let Me Know.

Mark Warner as he heads for a policy meeting in Washington on May 16. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)More “Well, I’m not bored anymore,” Mark Warner told me when I got him on the phone this week. It’s an unusual thing for a senator to admit, that he’s often found the job to be a little pointless. But Warner’s never been coy about his abiding frustration with the Capitol. For most of his seven-plus years in the Senate, the Virginia Democrat, once a national star, has haunted the halls like some tall and gangly ghost, a lonely specter from the time when senators imagined themselves to be above the partisan furies of the day. His entreaties to Republican colleagues, mostly rebuffed, exasperated his own party’s leaders, who barely tolerated him. When I mentioned to Warner that there were times when he seemed to be questioning his career decisions, he actually started laughing. “You think?” he said. Sometimes, though, if you hang around on the perimeter long enough, the action comes to you. And so it is with Warner, who somehow finds himself the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, just in time for a high-stakes, high-intrigue investigation into the executive branch that raises eerie parallels to Watergate. Even as Warner and I talked, news was breaking that Michael Flynn, the president’s favorite disgraced former general, had decided not to cooperate with the committee’s subpoena. Within hours, Warner and the Republican chairman, North Carolina’s Richard Burr, would jointly decide to issue more subpoenas aimed at Flynn’s companies — no small act of escalation. There are multiple investigations, of course, into possible connections between the Trump campaign and Russian spies. But with the special counsel’s criminal probe walled off in secrecy, and with the House intelligence committee burdened by blatant (and sometimes weird) partisanship, the Senate’s effort looks like the best hope for a broadly accepted, public accounting of how all this came about. Now, instead of haunting the halls, Warner is trailed by packs of iPhone-wielding reporters. And if you ask me, the consensus-building instincts that once made him a walking anachronism are exactly what the moment demands. “I can’t imagine almost anything that would be worse at this point than to have totally divergent conclusions,” Warner told me. “If you had a Democratic conclusion that said there was a smoking gun, and you had a Republican conclusion that said there was no there there, with the tension that’s in the country right now? I don’t know what that would do, other than cause more chaos, which is what the Russians wanted. “The only person who would be happy with a truly partisan split here,” Warner said, “is Vladimir Putin.” View photos To really understand what Warner is doing, it helps to go all the way back to the legend of his governor’s race in 2001, which is when I first spent time with him. Warner’s résumé to that point — telecom millionaire, state Democratic chairman — made him an unlikely choice for a state that had just voted handily for George W. Bush. Warner went again and again to southwestern Virginia, to coal towns and gun shows and a massive fiddler festival. When he won the race that November, national Democrats hailed him as a model. The lesson they took away was that Democrats actually could win in rural areas if they just pretended to like guns and fiddles. They missed the point. Warner didn’t show up pretending to be anything he wasn’t; he just showed up, relentlessly and shamelessly, without evincing any of the fear of rejection that normal humans might experience. Somewhere along the line, Warner had picked up the conviction that if he met you enough times, he could make you trust him. He had a confidence I’d rarely seen in politics — and haven’t seen much since – in his ability to win over people who weren’t supposed to like him. It worked for him as a governor, too. Warner’s early efforts to befriend leaders of a Republican-dominated Legislature ended in what most people would have considered failure, or even humiliation. He kept at it, ultimately managing to enact wholesale reform of the tax code, among other things. By the time he left office in 2005 (Virginia’s governors, for some boneheaded reason, get only one term), Warner was the most popular governor in the country and an oft-mentioned contender for president. (I wrote about him again during this period for the New York Times Magazine, although all anyone really remembers of that long profile is the strange, color-manipulated photo, which Warner still likes to say doomed his brief campaign.) In fact, what doomed Warner then was something more ominous; winds were shifting in American politics, and new, Web-driven communities of activists were taking charge of the left. Bipartisanship and glad-handing were out. Party loyalty and ideological fealty were in. Warner got himself elected to the Senate in 2008, but when I saw him next he seemed vaguely disoriented, sort of like Bill Murray’s character in “Lost in Translation.” “I thought my place would be hammering out a bunch of deals or a tax reform deal,” Warner told me this week. No one was doing that kind of deal anymore. Warner hurled himself into debt reform, forging a bipartisan coalition whose ideas went nowhere. For the last year, he’s devoted most of his energy to coming up with a badly needed agenda for the “gig economy.” Chances are you haven’t heard about it. Meanwhile, Warner won reelection by a shockingly thin margin — Virginia, alas, has become as inflexibly partisan as everyplace else — and found himself eclipsed on the national stage by his onetime protégé, Tim Kaine. If there were going to be a vehicle for Warner’s reclamation, the Intel Committee, as it’s known, wouldn’t have seemed very likely. Throughout the Obama years, as the committee fought with intelligence agencies and wrestled internally over its mammoth investigation into American torture, Warner served without much distinction, crowded out by Democratic colleagues like Ron Wyden and Sheldon Whitehouse. View photos But through the arcane pinball game of Senate seniority, Warner bounced into the vice chairman’s spot this year. And within weeks, the committee was at the center of the bizarre, unfolding saga of the Siberian Candidate – a scandal that started as a tangle of questions about whether Trump aides might have colluded with Russian agents, but which has now led to the firing of the FBI director and allegations that the president has tried to strong-arm his own intelligence chiefs. Warner and Burr knew each other mostly because they were both close to Saxby Chambliss, the Georgia Republican who retired in 2015. But that — along with the trivial fact that Burr was born in Charlottesville, which is just the kind of local connection Warner loves to seize on — gave Warner enough of an opening to press himself on Burr in the same way he once openly courted legislators in Virginia. “He likes to make it sound like I’m the first person to bug him in the morning and the last person to let him go at night,” Warner told me. “But you know, if you don’t want to be called, don’t give me your cellphone number.” If you listen to insiders and read between the lines of Warner’s half-joke about the cellphone, you get the sense that Burr has tried to deflect him at times, as much with silence as outright disagreement. “We both went through some bumps,” is how Warner puts it. And yet, at least to this point, the two have taken every significant step in unison. They’re bearing down on Flynn while also compelling the cooperation of other Trump aides and preparing to hear testimony from the former FBI director, James Comey. “We have to recognize that he’s under some pressure, just as I’m under enormous pressure,” Warner said. “You’ve got 50, 60 percent of Republicans who want this to go away, and you have 60, 70 percent of Democrats who think the president’s guilty of something. “And I think over the last few weeks, as we’ve both had incoming, the relationship has gotten stronger.” **** In fact, Warner finds himself in the familiar place of being judged insufficiently loyal in his own party — or, worse, pathetically gullible. Democratic senators and senior aides have raised a series of concerns about the scope and capacity of the investigation, some of which seem valid from the outside. View photos They worry that Warner, in his passion for consensus above conflict, hasn’t insisted that the investigation look at Trump’s personal financial ties to Russia. And also that the committee’s paltry staff level – now up to nine, compared with scores of aides who worked on the Benghazi investigation in the House, and not including any Russia experts — signals a lack of seriousness. “All right, I hear that,” Warner told me, when I raised the criticism. “And time will tell. I don’t accept those characterizations.” He says the committee is getting “unprecedented access to information from the intel community, in particular, that’s never been granted before.” But as part of the agreement brokered to get that material, Warner acknowledged, he and Burr had to limit the number of staff who had clearance to view it. (He left open the possibility that they could renegotiate that agreement.) He vowed that he and Burr would expand the scope of the investigation as needed, depending on whatever “credible information” comes through the door. The central question here, of course, isn’t so much whether Warner is genuine about his commitment, but whether Burr actually shares it. Or, to put it another way, has Burr managed to co-opt his partner into running a shallow investigation that will ultimately please the White House? Burr is a tobacco-spitting politician who finds himself at a similar crossroads as Warner; a longtime salesman of lawn equipment before running for Congress 25 years ago, he’s among the former House members who brought with them to the Senate a more predictable, if more understated, kind of partisan instinct. Nothing about Burr suggests that he would relish the opportunity to be in the middle of a national crisis, arrayed against a president of his own party and its congressional leadership. When I talked to Burr this week, he cited the Flynn subpoenas as proof that he’s not about to be rolled by his fellow Republicans. “I’d only ask you to judge me based upon what I’ve done to date,” he told me. “We were pretty quick out of the chute to serve three subpoenas now on Gen. Flynn. Not my preference. But I will go to any lengths I need to encourage somebody to share their story.” But when I asked Burr about the importance of avoiding a split decision in the committee (what Warner had called the worst imaginable outcome for the country), he surprised me. “Even if Mark looks at the facts and comes to a different conclusion than I do, but the American people get an opportunity to evaluate the facts, I feel like we will have succeeded,” Burr told me. “I’m less concerned with how this ends. I’m more concerned that we get the investigation completed.” This is a significant difference between the two men, and it represents the gravest danger not just to the committee’s investigation, but to Warner’s political balancing act. If Burr isn’t set on reaching a consensus, and if he’s instead perfectly happy to let dueling factions of the committee settle on different conclusions, then Warner may ultimately have to choose between the united front he’s working so hard to preserve, on one hand, and his Democratic colleagues on the other. It would not be an enviable choice. View photos I can see how you might contemplate all this and decide that Warner’s just being naïve. I could probably walk a mile in the capital these days and not run into a single person who thinks bipartisan cooperation is possible anymore, or even desirable. Fine. But maybe that’s why Warner is exactly the kind of accidental investigator the country needs. After all, if you go back through ugliest chapters in 20th century American politics — McCarthyism, Vietnam, Watergate — you’ll find that it wasn’t the sharpest, most partisan critics who finally brought the public around to the truth. It was the more sober, independent voice of a Joseph Nye or a William Fulbright or a Sam Ervin, people who couldn’t easily be accused of protecting those in power or trying to ruin them for sport. In his unflagging drive for consensus, Warner may be the closest thing we have to that kind of presence in the swirl of investigations that now engulf the capital.

Trump to meet with leaders of military alliance After months of tension, President Trump and leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization come face-to-face Thursday as Trump's first presidential trip abroad continues. The meetings are likely to revolve around Washington's commitment to the military alliance, and the issue of military contributions from the rest of its members. While Trump has retracted his campaign claim that NATO is "obsolete," he is expected to demand that NATO countries make good on their pledges to increase defense spending to 2% of their gross domestic product. NATO leaders, meanwhile, say they want Trump to recommit to Article 5 of the NATO treaty, in which members agree that an attack on one member is an attack on all.

USA TODAY 40 years ago, in a theater likely not that far away ...  Unless you've spent the last 40 years on the Dagobah system, your life has been impacted in some way, shape or form by Star Wars since the release of the original movie on May 25, 1977. This film and its successors are now part of our collective unconscious. To paraphrase Ben Obi Wan-Kenobi, it surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds our pop culture together. It has impacted stars (the Hollywood kind) and it has created a pantheon of unforgettable characters (check out the most searched characters by each state). OK, not everyone is over the Endor moon about Star Wars' success, but given the profits the films keep raking in, don't take the title of the next film, The Last Jedi, too literally. In fact, don't be surprised if we're celebrating the 80th anniversary of the franchise 40 years from now.
