Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 28 March 2017 | MYT 6:00 AM Intel tries to fire up high-end PC demand with new memory chips Super fast: Intel's new memory module is 14 times faster at loading a program from a standard hard drive. — Reuters Intel Corp is going back to its roots as a memory chipmaker in a bid to get consumers excited about high-end desktop computers. The world’s largest chipmaker, whose processors power eight out of ten PCs sold worldwide – and provide the bulk of Intel’s revenue – is offering a new memory chip package it says will improve desktop performance in a way that consumers will notice and be willing to pay for. Every day a typical consumer powers their PC on and off twice and uses 11 different programs, launching each one seven times. A machine equipped with Intel’s Optane memory package will perform those routine tasks much quicker than computers currently in use, Intel said. The new memory module is 14 times faster at loading a program from a standard hard drive. According to research provided by Intel, more than 70% of desktops still use spinning magnetic hard disks. “It’s basically all about responsiveness,” said Gregory Bryant, an Intel vice president. “People are spending too much time waiting.” For Intel, which was founded in the 1960s as a maker of memory chips, the push back into that business is part of chief executive officer Brian Krzanich’s attempt to diversify the company’s revenue sources beyond processors for servers and PCs. While previous attempts to return to the market it exited in the 1990s haven’t been successful, this time Intel is bringing a new type of chip not offered by other manufacturers that it hopes will give it a sustainable edge. Optane packages are based on Intel’s 3D Xpoint memory. They’ll function as a giant fast cache, storing files frequently used by the processor and allowing much quicker load times. The new offering doesn’t replace computer storage or main memory. The memory chip only works with Intel processors. That may help the company rebuff an attempt by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to claw back some of the market with a new range of processors it says rival Intel’s best. It’s also aimed at one of the few areas of the PC market – which has been declining since it peaked in 2011 – that has remained strong: High-end gaming PCs will grow about 12% this year, according to a prediction provided by Intel. That growth will be driven by gamers’ willingness to fork out for the highest performing hardware. Optane is available in two modules, a 16GB version for US$44 (RM195) and 32GB package for US$77 (RM340). —  Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Workflow app is free to download after Apple acquisition Germany blocked Russian hacking attacks in 2016 Tech changes rules of fan engagement for sports leagues Digi spearheads digital learning trend among employees Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

Reuters/Tyrone Siu Intel may be releasing previews of models under its new Kaby Lake X architecture in response to the recent reveal of AMD's new Ryzen models. According to the Intel Kaby Lake X leak, the Kaby Lake X products will be the first chips available for Intel's X299 chipset for motherboard platforms. Although Intel fans can expect these new chips in the market soon, not a lot of details have been revealed about them. However, it appears SiSoftware has revealed specifications for the new Kaby Lake X line.  The Kaby Lake X chips will be placed in ASRock X299 Professional Gaming i7 motherboards. This allows the Kaby Lake X to utilise the X299 chipset, which helps it be a direct competitor with the new Ryzen chips.  The Intel Kaby Lake X leak supports rumours on the Kaby Lake X being direct competition of AMD's newer Ryzen products. The initial rumour has come from Intel's Q4 2016 earnings call in Jan. 26.  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said Intel's product roadmap is "the best ever it's been." This pertains to Intel's strategy that involves retaining Kaby Lake's quad-core technology.  "We’re always focused on really, our own product roadmap and making sure that we have the highest performance product," he said. WCCFTech said this is an indication that Intel expects the 4-core Kaby Lake X to directly compete with AMD's 8-core variants.  The chip is based on the latest 14nm + process node. This improves Intel's existing 14nm FinFET technology. According to SiSoft's Intel Kaby Lake X leak, the chip's clock speeds appear to reach 4GHz base. This appears to directly compete with the recent Ryzen 5 1600, which has a base clock speed of 3.19GHz.  The Kaby Lake X products may be released alongside its sister the Skylake X. The latter features stronger specifications, which are rumoured to exceed the performance of Intel's current Broadwell E chips.  According to Videocardz, the new Skylake X and Kaby Lake X CPU series may release sometime later in 2017. Rumours also point towards a reveal at Gamescom 2017, which will take place in Germany from Aug. 22 to 26.  The products to make the reveal may include Kaby Lake X's 4-core, 6-core, 8-core, and 10-core variants. The 6, 8 and 10-core variations will be based on the more powerful Skylake architecture. Meanwhile, the 4-core model will be based on the Kaby Lake architecture. Regardless of these variants, all chips are expected to be under the Core i7-7000 series of Intel processors.  Unfortunately, Intel has not made an official comment about the Intel Kaby Lake X leak. There is no official statement on the Kaby Lake X products, including their release date and prices.  Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Microsoft Surface Pro 5 could come with AMD chip House Intelligence still waiting for proof; Trump defends wiretap claims Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 'Curb Your Enthusiasm season 9' will cause a lot of controversy, assures Mary Steenburgen 0 Shares 2 Premier Jeff Kennett calls for drug decriminilisation 0 Shares 3 Dogs now entering plastic surgery scene with botox, other cosmetic treatments 0 Shares 4 Iron ore drops to six-week low 0 Shares 5 Cannabis stocks rise by significant margin 0 Shares 6 OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 3T update 0 Shares 7 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Diana Gabaldon heading to South Africa 0 Shares 8 Joint patrols by Australia, Indonesia in South China Sea 0 Shares 9 Trump sends cease-and-desist to 17-year-old student over cat website 0 Shares 10 ‘Vikings’ season 5: Ivar and Bjorn will ‘explode in time’; The Boneless ‘doesn’t recognise boundaries’ 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed Qantas and Slingshot Venture Fund tap startups for airline innovation Fair Work Ombudsman launches Record My Hours app Optus warns customers not switching to NBN service Tabcorp to sell Odyssey business to save Tattss deal Spotify acquires MightyTV, helps users decide what to watch European retailer TK Maxx chose 303 MullenLowe More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance Malcolm Turnbull backs extratradition treaty with China Donald Trump vs 17-year-old’s cat website story may be false; US President’s lawyers deny sending C&D Peter Dutton responds on CEOs same-sex marriage proposal Melania Trump hosts International Women's Day luncheon, talks gender equality Aussie academic not allowed to leave China Zelda Therapeutics strikes deal with CannPal More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East Australian captain Steven Smith apologises for emotional outburst during fourth Test Tom Brady elite quarterback until his mid-40s says Patriots owner Mercedes will be back stronger than ever, assures Toto Wolff Roger Federer sails past Juan Martin del Potro at Miami Open, reaches fourth round Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets live stream: Watch NBA live on TV, preview, start time Kobe Bryant defends LeBron James, says Cavs star has 'earned the right to rest' More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More 'The Last of Us 2' theories point to Joel being dead OnePlus 5 vs Apple iPhone 8 'Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age' will be released in July Microsoft unveils new features to Skype for Business 'Pokemon Stars' may be a new addition to the Switch games list 'The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim' release date for the Switch will be in Fall 2017 More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design 'The Block' season 13: An empty lot and the Gatwick Hotel 'Pretty Little Liars' audiences will 'be happy' with Uber A reveal Eminem's daughter Hailie Mathers is popular on Instagram: Find out interesting facts about her ‘Game of Thrones’ season 7 spoilers: Brienne and Jaime romance ‘Vikings’ season 5: Ivar and Bjorn will ‘explode in time’; The Boneless ‘doesn’t recognise boundaries’ 'NCIS' Season 14 episode 19 spoilers: Quinn and Torres’ best-kept secret is revealed; team seeks help from a grouchy veteran on ‘The Wall’ More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

Hagai Amit and Shuki Sadeh Mar 27, 2017 12:29 PM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon Dr. Shmuel Harlap at a finance conference in Israel, March 21, 2017. Moti Milrod Opinion Mobileye-Intel: The good, the bad and the ugly How Israel's Hebrew University lost a Mobileye windfall Dr. Shmuel Harlap was already a very rich man two weeks ago. His controlling interest in Israel’s largest car importer, Colmobil, put him 21st on the list of Israel’s wealthiest people with an estimated fortune of $1.4 billion. But even for him, the events of March 15 constituted a significant financial upgrade: Intel’s $15.3 billion purchase of Mobileye yielded Harlap about $1 billion. The businessman had invested some $12 million in the driverless-vehicle technology firm (along with Colmobil) about 15 years ago, and held about 7% of the company’s shares. He doubled the value of his paper assets overnight. Harlap, 72, has no yacht or private jet and says he doesn’t know what he’ll do with the money he earned from the Mobileye sale. An amateur marathon runner, he grew up in Rehovot, Jerusalem and Haifa, and served in the Golani Brigade’s elite commando unit in the army. His father, Amichai, founded the family business in 1963 after receiving the franchise to import Mercedes-Benz cars into Israel. Shmuel himself – who was studying Platonic philosophy when he completed his doctorate in philosophy at Harvard University – only joined the company in the early 1980s, at age 38, after teaching political science at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The events that made Colmobil number one in its field took place during his tenure. In 1988, the company began to import Mitsubishi cars and in the early 1990s the Japanese automaker assumed Subaru’s place as the most widely sold car brand in Israel. In 1994, Colmobil also received the franchise to import Hyundai, and in the past five years the Korean firm has become Israel’s most popular car brand. Harlap says he left academia for the car industry after reaching the conclusion that “the important ideas I had weren’t new, and the new ideas I had weren’t important.” Even though he doesn’t need to work anymore, Harlap says he has no plans to retire. “It’s fun, it produces adrenaline and it’s activity,” he explains. “I had a philosophy professor who wrote a book in which he describes a ‘dream machine’ – in other words, a hypothetical situation in which you get an offer to enter a container of formaldehyde and attach electrodes all over your body, which enable you to have any experience you want, according to your choice. Would you choose such a life? The answer is no, because people want to do things, not only to have experiences. The greatest satisfaction comes from doing. Why do people run marathons? For that reason. The greatest satisfaction in life comes from asceticism, not hedonism. Hedonism is a bottomless pit. There are many billionaires who buy yachts and planes, and don’t get enjoyment out of that.” Sometimes it seems you’re trying to enjoy the best of all worlds. You talk about asceticism, but sell brand names... “I’m not an ascetic person, but it’s good to experience active asceticism, in the sense of physical effort, in order to understand that it provides more satisfaction. But I’m no monk.” What do you think of the trend of billionaires saying they won’t leave their money to their children? “Everyone has a right to do what he wants with his money. I’m sure, as Warren Buffett said, that I don’t want to be the richest man in the universe. “I’ll give you my formula for life: When your needs are greater than your possibilities, live according to your possibilities. When your possibilities are greater than your needs, live according to your needs. Always live according to the lower of the two. I live according to my needs, not according to my possibilities.” In 2012, the Zelekha Committee (headed by Prof. Yaron Zelekha) was established in order to examine how to improve competition in the car industry. Among other things, it recommended that importers cannot own more than one leasing company and one garage, and an importer whose market share is higher than 8% will be limited to one brand. It also recommended that discounts to leasing companies would be restricted and that importers would be required to provide technical literature and equipment to every garage, at a controlled price. When Zelekha submitted the report he said: “Although I have a great deal of experience in antitrust laws, I have never come across a market as uncompetitive as the car market. The importers’ profit margins are scandalous, and it’s a disgrace for Israeli governments that they haven’t dealt with the problem until now.” Part of the Mobileye driving-assist system on the dashboard of a vehicle in Jerusalem. BAZ RATNER/REUTERS Indeed, a survey published this week by the Chief Economist’s Office in the Finance Ministry showed that Israel’s 12 car importers, headed by Colmobil, earned 1.9 billion to 2 billion shekels (about $520 million to $550 million) in 2013 and 2014 – an aggregate profit twice that of 2006 in real terms. At the same time, there was a sharp increase in profitability to an average rate of 9.3% – an exceptional rate for a commercial industry. The continued increase in vehicle sales in the past decade led to a bonanza in the industry. According to the treasury report, from 2007 until 2014 the 12 car importers had an aggregate profit of 14.1 billion shekels (at 2014 prices). In other words, an average annual profit of 1.6 billion shekels. Compared to the years 2003 to 2006, this was a real increase of 72%. For the sake of comparison, the country’s annual revenues from purchase tax and customs tax on vehicles increased during that same period at a real rate of only 16%. Harlap has maneuvered himself into a win-win position: He is benefiting from the unprecedented growth of the Israeli car industry in its present state, and also from the direction in which it is moving – the autonomous car. So how does he answer claims about the importers’ excessive profitability? “I don’t know what other importers think, I know what I’m doing. Everyone has his own considerations; my consideration is market-oriented. It’s a sophisticated market, and I constantly have to think about my competitors. If I were working alone in the market, maybe it would be different. There’s some myth here that Israel is a price market, and that’s not true. Israel is a brand-name market. The prices are similar and the public decides what to buy according to the brand.” Hagai Amit Haaretz Contributor Hagai Amit Send me email alerts for new articles by Hagai Amit Send Close Email * Please enter your email Hagai Amit For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

Nunes struggled to provide an explanation for the unusual trip on Monday even as Democrats demanded that he step aside as leader of the investigation into Russia’s meddling in the U.S. presidential election. The visit raised questions about whether the White House itself was the source of the mysterious intelligence that Nunes, but no one else on Capitol Hill, has seen. Nunes has vowed to protect his source while offering contradictory descriptions of what the documents reveal. The White House provided little clarity, directing all inquiries to the chairman himself. Since the Trump White House does not make visitor logs public, it remains unclear whom Nunes met with or who let him into the secure facility in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. On Capitol Hill, Senate Minority Leader Charles SchumerCharles SchumerMcConnell: ObamaCare 'status quo' will stay in place moving forward NRA launches M Supreme Court ad Senate about to enter 'nuclear option' death spiral MORE (D-N.Y.) called for Speaker Paul RyanPaul RyanMcConnell: ObamaCare 'status quo' will stay in place moving forward The Hill's 12:30 Report House GOP insists: We’re not giving up on ObamaCare repeal MORE (R-Wis.) to remove Nunes as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, while the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee called the trip “more than suspicious.” The committee’s ranking member, Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSpicer: If Trump uses Russian salad dressing 'somehow that’s a Russian connection' Schiff: Yates would have testified on Flynn at cancelled hearing Nunes rebuffs calls for recusal MORE (D-Calif.), called for Nunes to recuse himself from the panel’s Russia investigation. On Tuesday, Nunes reportedly climbed into an Uber, leaving staff members behind, and went to the White House grounds to view classified information brought to his attention by a source. The next morning, without looping in the top Democrat on his committee, Nunes stepped up to microphones and said he had seen classified information that exposed widely disseminated intelligence collected incidentally — and legally — on Trump transition team members. Nunes served as a member of the Trump transition team’s executive committee. The chairman briefed Ryan on his findings that morning, but committee Democrats — and many Republicans — were left in the dark. Then, that afternoon, Nunes returned to the White House to brief Trump on what he had learned. The strange sequence of events has roiled the Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the election. Nunes has claimed that his findings had no relevance to the Russia probe, yet the committee is examining the unmasking and leaking of surveillance information as part of that investigation. Nunes on Monday denied that there was anything untoward in his Tuesday visit to the White House, pushing back on reports that the venture took place at night and calling the visit “pretty common.”  “At least once a week, if not more than that, we have to go to the executive branch in order to read classified intelligence,” he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.  “The sun was out,” he said. “If I really wanted to I could have snuck onto the grounds late at night, but I wasn’t trying to hide.” Nunes said he was “quite certain that no one in the West Wing knew I was there.” But Democrats have accused Nunes of acting as an agent of the White House and say he can no longer lead a credible investigation. “Chairman Nunes is falling down on the job and seems to be more interested in protecting the president than in seeking the truth,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Monday. “If Speaker Ryan wants the House to have a credible investigation, he needs to replace Chairman Nunes.” Republicans were largely silent on the subject Monday. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating Russian election interference, has kept its distance from the controversy. Nunes did get some cover from a former chair of the committee, former Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.), who held the gavel from 2004 to 2007. “The only important issues are: what was in the materials, are they credible and not fakes. If you get affirmative answers that they are real it doesn’t matter who supplied them,” Hoekstra told The Hill in an email on Monday. Nunes, meanwhile, said he went to the White House “to confirm what I already knew” about the alleged surveillance. In an interview with Bloomberg columnist Eli Lake, Nunes said he had heard for over a month about intelligence reports that included details on the Trump transition team, but was only able to view them himself last Tuesday evening. Nunes told Lake that the source was an intelligence official, not a White House staff member — although press secretary Sean Spicer and Nunes have refused to categorically deny that the White House itself was the source. Fanning the suspicions further, Trump in a recent interview on Fox News said that he would be “submitting things before the committee very soon,” without providing further details.  Critics have speculated that Nunes’s actions were an attempt to justify Trump’s claim that former President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the campaign. Nunes has said repeatedly that the intelligence he viewed did not substantiate that claim. According to a spokesperson for Nunes, the chairman met with his source at the White House grounds in order to “have proximity to a secure location where he could view the information” — but that explanation did not satisfy intelligence experts. The House Intelligence Committee makes frequent use of a secure facility in the Capitol — the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. His use of the National Security Council office of the Eisenhower building — which, outside of the White House Situation Room, is the main area in the complex to view classified information — is deeply unusual, experts say. A spokesperson for Nunes said that “because of classification rules, the source could not simply put the documents in a backpack and walk them over to the House Intelligence Committee space. “The White House grounds was the best location to safeguard the proper chain of custody and classification of these [executive branch documents], so the Chairman could view them in a legal way.”  But that explanation strains credulity, multiple intelligence and classified information experts told The Hill.  “It’s not remotely credible,” said Patrick Eddington, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute who formerly worked for ex-Rep. Rush Holt (D-N.J.) and at the CIA as an analyst. “The source had to transmit them to the White House in some fashion. Did they take it in a backpack to the White House? Because that would be no different.” “He’s really digging himself in deep,” Eddington said. Nunes told Lake that he met the source at the White House because it was the most convenient secure location connected to the closed computer system that included the reports, which are only distributed within the executive branch.  “We don’t have networked access to these kinds of reports in Congress,” he said. Generally speaking, the executive branch can share classified information with the committee electronically, although there are multiple different systems used within government. It is possible that the House Intelligence Committee does not have access to the system in question.    Jordan Fabian and Jonathan Easley contributed.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest Intel just painted a target on IBM Watson’s back Jack Gold, J.Gold Associates@jckgld March 27, 2017 3:10 PM Tags: IBM, Intel, Jack Gold, machine learning, Naveen Rao, Nervana, Watson Above: A still from an Intel "Unleashing the Next Wave" video. Image Credit: Intel Newsroom's YouTube channel Intel announced late last week that it has formed a new AI group to consolidate a number of its programs and acquisitions. It’s headed by Naveen Rao, the former head of Intel acquisition Nervana. This means Intel is making sure is has a major seat at the table as artificial intelligence and machine learning branch out to touch virtually everything — from autonomous driving to IoT to enhancing corporate systems — over the next 5-7 years. In the short term, the group will focus on research related to its software and hardware (Nervana, Xeon/Lakecrest chips and subsequent families) to deliver AI for drones and autonomous vehicles, smart cities, health care, personal appliances, etc. But I expect a longer-term play. Intel will be putting together a complete set of products to bring to traditional manufacturers in its chip business across the full breadth of edge computing to big data center platforms for things like Xeon Phi based AI solutions that power financial models, biological research/modeling, and scientific research. For example, plans for Intel’s Mobileye and Nervana acquisitions will fall under this group’s charter. Mobileye is known as an enabler of vision for cars and drones, but its vision based models, together with AI and ML could prove highly valuable in fields like security, visual analysis of health-related issues, and real-time forecasting. Additional technologies like Saffron (with its AI-as-a-Service model), which Intel acquired in 2015, have already started to give the Intel visibility into customer needs, enabling it to learn about future requirements and experiment on solutions. Nervana gives Intel the ability to experiment with optimized architectures in addition to Xeon Phy massively parallel processing systems that will power next generation AI systems. And Intel’s close alliance with the research and open source communities gives it the ability to learn as well as influence future directions in AI/ML. But the company will also deploy customized solutions through its consulting services and will eventually offer these as off-the-shelf enterprise cognitive computing toolsets for verticals like financial modeling, genetic research, transportation best routing, etc. The ultimate target: compete head to head with IBM Watson in particular and other up and coming solutions in general. IBM is on a different path. In the current early phase of the emerging AI market, IBM has a lot of momentum. It has signed agreements with high profile companies (a partnership with Salesforce, for example) and acquired its own stable of AI related properties (such as Weather.com). IBM is investing heavily in Watson and related service offerings and has devoted substantial resources to make it successful. It’s highly likely IBM will be making additional acquisitions in this space over the coming 1-2 years. IBM considers Watson its primary general purpose platform for AI, much as it did with Websphere for web services, and is building on top of this platform with customized solutions through its service organization and through partnerships. And it will acquire complementary technology as required. But Intel thinks IBM has a distinct challenge that it can exploit. Watson is taking a wide approach to cognitive computing by trying to do everything for everyone. It does have some vertically focused solutions, but IBM, as it has in the past with other products, is positioning Watson as a general purpose capability. This is a difficult road to take. Intel’s more focused approach could ultimately prove more successful. By looking for specific needs and “templates” to make neural networks do specific things that are then optimized for its hardware assets, Intel thinks it can beat the other contenders with targeted solutions fully optimized for specific markets and tasks. Intel is leveraging standards and open source tools rather than developing proprietary solutions. It’s working with Tensorflow, the open source ML library developed by Google, and Neon, the open source deep learning language and library based on Python, which will be optimized for Intel hardware but remain open sourced. Indeed, Neon even runs on GPUs from Nvidia, a key rival. Intel is offering some of its own innovations to the open source community and is building relationships with key players like Google and Microsoft. This is much more aligned with Intel’s past experiences and business practices and should provide it with a model it can comfortably implement. I expect Intel to make a number of additional acquisitions over the next couple of years in this rapidly evolving market. A piece-meal approach to specific problems is actually more in line with most business needs. Intel looks for targeted vertical solutions to solve defined business challenges rather than deploying broad-based systems. And it can productize these targeted offerings to be used by partners/solutions providers — its traditional channel. The new Intel AI group has maximum focus as it reports directly to CEO Brian Krzanich. There is no doubt this group is critical to Intel’s future and will be a major revenue generator in the next 3-5 years. AI can touch nearly every product line, merging with existing capabilities to move to the next step incrementally. But it’s hard to fully comprehend what computing architectures are needed for AI. Taking standard CPU and GPU computer architecture and shoe horning them for AI may not be enough, which is why Intel has acquired technology like Nervana chip architectures due out this year. Intel has also made a Cloudera investment, looking to roll that into Xeon chips and other big data capabilities in the future. Where the architectures go over the next few years is still unknown but could be very compelling. Bottom line: with this commitment, Intel is clearly signaling it does not intend to be left behind in AI. In fact, it expects that, with its extensive resources, it can be both a major implementer of new technologies/research, as well as a key contributor to better market understanding, which will give it a leg up in knowing what’s needed to power the next generation of its computing systems and reshape its business longer term. Intel has laid down the challenge, and AI-focused solutions companies like IBM Watson and hardware companies like Nvidia should take heed. ​Jack Gold is founder and principal analyst at J.Gold Associates, LLC., a technology analyst firm based in Northborough, MA., covering the many aspects of business and consumer computing and emerging technologies.

Baig, USA TODAY Monday, March 27, 2017 comments NEW YORK—Intel is taking a high-octane route to bumping up PC speed, launching what it calls Intel Optane memory to help PC users get more out of their system. Those of us who use PCs everyday tend to be an impatient bunch—we want the machines to respond to our tasks way faster than it takes to finish reading this sentence. We want instant access to movies and high-res photographs, zippy game play, and boot times that don’t take forever. Intel claims Optane will dramatically cut down on the wait. Corporate vice president Gregory Bryant says Optane represents the “first big step forward in memory technology in two decades.”  Will Optane live up to such hype? It's certainly going to take a while before Optane is accepted by the mainstream PC user, says Shane Rau, a chip analyst with IDC. "It's a case of crawl, walk, run," he says. Desktop only For starters, Optane requires a PC with the latest 7th generation Intel Core processor technology, meaning a machine at the high end of the market. And Optane is a desktop-only solution out of the gate; it does not work with laptops.  "It is reliable? Is it fast enough? For whom is it fast enough?" Rau asks. "A lot of questions need to be answered by this segment of folks who are not mainstream PC users." According to Intel, when you couple Optane memory on a PC with the required 7th generation Intel Core-based system, you’ll be able to power on your computer up to twice as fast, improve overall system performance up to 28% faster and bolster storage performance by 14 times. Apps will launch faster too, Intel promises: up to six times faster for Microsoft Outlook, up to five times for the Chrome browser and up to 18% faster for certain games. Though the explanation can get kind of geeky, an Optane memory module sits between your hard drive and processor and functions as an “accelerator.”  Traditional hard drives still account for 79% of the primary storage solutions in desktop PCs today, Intel says, as folks choose more generous storage capacities over the faster speeds offered by solid state drives and other alternatives. In simple terms, Optane learns your computing behavior and helps accelerate frequent tasks by intelligently identifying the files and data you summon most often and storing them in the Optane module where they’re easily accessible.  Computer users comfortable with cracking open their computer case can install an Optane module directly on a compatible motherboard. Such modules will be available in 16GB and 32GB for desktops PCs from various Intel partners beginning on April 24. Starting in the second quarter of this year, PC manufacturers like HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, Acer will begin shipping both consumer and commercial products equipped with Intel Optane memory already installed.   The list price Intel charges its partners for a 16GB module is $44; a 32GB module costs $77. Such companies will likely bump up the price that an end user will ultimately pay, at least initially. But IDC's Rau suggests that if Optane proves successful,  costs could be lowered as PC manufacturers eliminate components that no longer need to be there.  Email: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter More On: USA Today Share this Article Join the Conversation Top Business Stories automotive NuTonomy to keep testing after driverless Uber crash jack encarnacao business & markets Biggest jet soon a Boston regular donna goodison business & markets New Balance shines spotlight on Boston stars donna goodison business & markets Exploring new worlds inside a 2,000-square-foot arena jordan graham Trending Now Punk legend Johnny Rotten supports Trump, Brexit vote Aaron Hernandez’s brother a witness for DA Grandpa on duty! ‘Papa Steven’ Tyler gives granddaughter Lula Rose her bottle in sweet new snap Black Academy of Arts & Letters forms in #Boston #HeraldArchives 1969 #HeraldArchive @BostonHerald @HeraldRadio… Market Summary and Investments Tweets by @bostonherald ✖ Boston Herald News Local Coverage Local Politics Columnists National US Politics International Offbeat News Obituaries Opinion Op Ed Letters to the Editor Editorials Send a Letter Sports Red Sox Patriots Celtics Bruins Columnist College Soccer Golf High School Other Entertainment Inside Track Celebrity News Arts & Culture Movies Music Television LifeStyle Food & Beverage Style & Fashion Travel Health & Fitness Business Automotive Real Estate Technology Markets More… Classifieds Radio Horoscope Lottery Crossword Contests Weather RSS Feeds Archives Log In Legal Notices Advertise Purchase Back Copies Send a News Tip Contact Us Home Delivery e-Edition Mobile Apps Herald Newsletters Send a Letter to the Editor Boston Herald In Education Mass Literacy ©Copyright by the Boston Herald and Herald Media No portion of BostonHerald.com or its content may be reproduced without the owner's written permission.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Intel announces Optane high-speed memory for desktop PCs, offers 28 percent faster system performance 1 by Pradeep  @pradeepviswav Mar 27, 2017 at 22:00 GMT22 hours ago Last week, Intel launched the Intel Optane SSD series memory technology for servers. They offer blazing fast storage or caching tier for servers in the datacenters. Ever since that announcement was made, I was wondering why Intel is not bringing this technology to desktop PCs which general consumers can buy. Intel today cleared my doubts by announcing Intel Optane memory for desktop PCs. Intel Optane memory will deliver significantly more performance and faster load times across a broad range of experiences. Intel claims that Intel Optane memory and a 7th Gen Intel Core processor-based PC will see overall system performance up to 28 percent faster with storage performance up to 14x faster. Also, due to the fast storage, applications like Microsoft Outlook will launch up to nearly 6x faster, the Chrome browser launches up to 5x faster, games launch up to 67 percent faster, and levels load up to 65 percent faster. Intel Optane memory module 16GB and 32GB for desktops will be available from April 24 for customers. To use Intel Optane memory,  you need to have one of the 130 Intel Optane memory ready motherboards available from manufacturers including Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, ASRock and others. Also, PC OEMs like HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, Acer and others will begin shipping both consumer and commercial products equipped with Intel Optane memory from second quarter this year.

Here are a few you may not know about. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Mar 27, 2017 at 4:25PM Artificial intelligence (AI) has been making headlines lately, and there are a dizzying number of companies making strides in the area. Market intelligence firm Tractica estimates that revenue related to AI will reach nearly $37 billion by 2025, so with that much at stake, it's no wonder companies are lining up to get a piece of the action. With so many entrants joining the fray, investors may only be aware of the most visible players in the field and miss out on others. Companies may come to AI as a result of changes in technology, it may be an integral part of the company's evolution, or it may be the result of acquisitions. Let's look at three companies you may not realize are making significant plays in AI: graphics processing pioneer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Chinese search giant Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), and chip titan Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). NVIDIA GPUs are at the forefront of AI research. Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA NVIDIA is best known for its chips that render images in computer games, and any serious gamer likely has one of the company's flagship graphics processing units (GPUs) at the heart of their system. Deep learning requires sifting through massive amounts of data to detect patterns, and NVIDIA GPU's were the early choice due to the speed and massive parallel processing capabilities they possessed. Those same competencies also provide the data crunching necessary for autonomous driving solutions, another area NVIDIA is seeking to exploit. Competitors are pursuing potential alternatives to its GPUs, but so far the company has been able to maintain its early lead. NVIDIA has partnered with the biggest tech companies, numerous car makers, and a variety of automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) suppliers, which provides an excellent foundation to continue its winning streak. In its most recent quarter, NVIDIA produced revenue of $296 million and $128 million in its data center and auto segments, respectively, accounting for nearly 20% of total revenue, so the company has a lot riding on AI. Jing Wang, senior vice president of Baidu. Baidu Baidu has been called the Google of China -- and with good reason. The company has modeled itself after its American cousin, followed similar technological paths, even producing many of the same "innovations." It should come as no surprise that the company began pursuing AI at about the same time as Alphabet (Google's parent name) and developed the Baidu Brain deep neural network. Baidu focused its efforts on four functional areas of deep learning: voice recognition and synthesis, image recognition, natural-language processing, and user profiling.  Baidu's results have been impressive and the company has been investing in AI to energize its stagnating growth. The company has been using the results of its AI research to improve user engagement and efficiency, and to pursue new lines of business. Baidu is also deeply involved in autonomous driving and expects to have self-driving cars in small-scale production by 2018. Since AI is infused in a vast majority of the company's business and isn't a separate segment, it would be difficult to quantify its effect on revenue or profitability. Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the data center group for Intel. Intel Intel is known for its CPUs that power the majority of the world's data centers, but the company has been on a buying spree in the last few years, with a focus on opportunities in AI. Those acquisitions have included companies that specialized in data analytics and cognitive computing, natural language processing and gesture recognition, and a variety of technologies related to drones and computer vision. Until recently, its most intriguing purchase was AI start-up Nervana Systems, taking the company further into the discipline of deep learning. By combining the Nervana's AI acumen with its chip technology, Intel hoped to make further inroads against NVIDIA's GPUs, which provide the bulk of the heavy lifting for AI processing. Intel made headlines last week when it announced the acquisition of Israeli computer vision and machine-learning specialist Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY) for $15.3 billion, the company's second-largest acquisition ever. This puts Intel squarely in the driver's seat in its aspirations to enter the autonomous driving segment, which also has its foundations in AI. Intel has chips in 99% of data centers, and the company estimates that AI applications run on only 7% of those, so it is difficult to assess how this factors into the company's financial results. Foolish final thoughts There are many companies making progress in AI and it's no wonder that investors may not know them all. While developments in the technology are accelerating, the field is still in its infancy. At this stage in the game, and with so little insight into the exact contribution of AI to financial results, any investment should be based on the fundamentals of each company's previously existing business lines, and the opportunities afforded by the company's AI aspirations should be considered a delightful bonus.

Intel is making some impressive claims about Optane’s ability to accelerate performance in desktop workloads for all types of users. But it’s not clear how much Optane’s performance actually differs from an SSD cache drive. It’s been a few years since we wrote about cache drives, but you often see these configurations in midrange laptops to boost performance without costing the OEM very much costing consumers more money. An SSD cache drive is designed to cache the most commonly accessed data based on its analysis of the most common drive workloads and capabilities. Back in 2012, we did a comparison of Intel’s SRT cache program versus Nvelo’s caching architecture. The slideshow below captures some of our results in that test. Again, these slides are only comparable in the broadest sense. Click on each slide to open it in a new window. Our benchmarks show that the biggest gains in performance with an SSD cache drive, at least back then, came from pairing a slower mechanical Caviar Black with an SSD. The hard drive Intel is using is a Western Digital Caviar Black WD1003FZEX, the hard drive we tested 4.5 years ago was a Caviar Black WD1001FALS. All else being equal, we’d expect the WD1003FZEX to be slightly faster, since it offers more cache (64MB vs 32MB) and support for SATA 6G as opposed to SATA II. Intel’s Optane will offer impressive performance acceleration if the company’s metrics are accurate. One thing I want to make extremely clear is that I’m not claiming that an Optane cache drive offers no benefits over and above an SSD cache drive. Eyeballing the numbers, it looks as though the Optane M.2 is faster than an SSD cache relative to baseline performance. The only point I’m making is that SSD cache drives have been offering substantial improvements over and above mechanical hard drives for years, and it’s not yet clear how much Optane improves performance compared with this alternative. Its low-level metrics are substantially faster than any SSD cache drive, as is its endurance. It’s also possible that Intel’s baseline measurements are higher, meaning the Optane drive would still be faster than an SSD cache at the same percentage performance improvement. These new Optane drives are keyed to support M.2 type B and M.2 type M, but only use two PCI-Express lanes and will not function in a motherboard that only offers SATA connectivity through the M.2 slot. Users should also keep in mind that Optane is only compatible with Intel’s 200-series chipsets. Both the 16GB and 32GB drives can be pre-ordered immediately, for $44 and $77 respectively. That’s not immediately a great deal, given that 128GB and 256GB SSDs are available at those price points, but we’ll have to compare Optane’s performance before we can say how much these drives improve over mechanical-only results.

Twitter Facebook Intel's next-gen hyperfast Optane SSDs for PCs to ship in April PCs will be able to boot twice as fast on Optane SSDs Lucas Mearian (Computerworld (US)) 28 March, 2017 05:21 - - - - print email Comments Intel will begin shipping its next-generation non-volatile Optane memory for PCs beginning April 24. Intel, which developed the Optane memory with its partner Micron under the name "3D Xpoint," said the new storage will allow PCs to boot twice as fast and increase internal storage performance by 14 times. Additionally, Intel claims the mass storage devices will launch applications faster. For example, Microsoft Outlook will launch up to 5.8 times faster; games will launch up to 67% faster; and files stored in memory can be located up to four times faster. Intel has shown that its Optane memory cards have performed 10 times faster than conventional solid-state drives (SSDs). Intel Intel's Optane M.2 form factor memory module. The Optane memory will come in an M.2 "gumstick" form factor and connect to PC motherboards via storage slots using the PCIe/NVMe 3.0 x2 I/O lane interface. The Optane memory DIMMs are intended to replace DRAM in servers and PCs. The Optane SSDs use Intel's Rapid Storage Technology (RST) driver, which when placed between a computer's processor and slower SATA-based storage (whether a hard drive or SSD), stores more commonly used data and programs closer to the processor. That allows the system to access that information more quickly and improve overall system responsiveness. In simpler terms, Optane acts as a high-speed cache. The Intel Optane memory is available in 16GB (MSRP $44) and 32GB (MSRP $77) capacities. Intel and Micron developed 3D Xpoint to fill a niche between NAND flash storage and DRAM, as it's vastly faster than the former and less expensive than the latter. Last week, Intel revealed its Optane drives for data center servers. The drives, with up to 1.5TB of storage capacity, are on their way and users now have a better understanding of how they'll perform. Intel's data center SSDs will fit as add-in cards in the PCI-Express/NVMe and U.2 slots. That means they could work in some workstations and servers based on AMD's 32-core Naples processors. Intel Intel's Optane SSD DC P4800X is targeted at data centers. Micron revealed last fall that it is targeting data center servers for its flavor of 3D Xpoint memory, which it calls QuantX. Those drives are also expected to ship in the second quarter. Sometime later, QuantX may find its way into mobile computer applications, but that won't likely be for some time, according to Jon Carter, Micron's vice president of storage solutions. As for Intel's consumer-grade Optane, starting in the second quarter of this year, PC manufacturers such as HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus and Acer will begin shipping both consumer and commercial products equipped with the new memory, the company said. "Intel Optane...will enable new levels of PC responsiveness for everything from compute-intensive engineering applications to high-end gaming, digital content creation, web browsing and even everyday office productivity applications," Navin Shenoy, Intel's general manager for the Client Computing Group, said in a blog today. The new Optane memory specificationsÂ indicateÂ it has a sequential read/write speeds of 1350MBps and 290MBps, respectively. But it is the memory's random read/write performance that eviscerates any previous flash memory product. Optane boasts a random read speed of 240,000 I/O per second (IOPS) and random write speed of 65,000 IOPS. Intel Intel has hyped up 3D Xpoint. Last June, Intel let slip its plans for releasing several product lines based on the new 3D XPoint memory, which it said it would release alongside its Kaby Lake processor platform. In January, Intel revealed its upcoming Optane non-volatile memory would ship in the second quarter. "Improving speed while maintaining large storage capacities is ideal for virtual reality, gaming, content creation and video editing and so much more," Intel said in a statement at the time. "The performance of a 7th Gen Intel Core processor plus the speed of Intel Optane memory boosts responsiveness across the system." 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 27, 2017 at 2:45PM In a note obtained by Barron's, analyst Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna Financial Group said that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which currently supplies cellular modems for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 series smartphones, "is putting more incremental back-end modem capacity in place over the next few months." This, Rolland says, supports his team's view that "Intel will increase share in this year's [iPhone] handsets with a strong possibility of 100% share in 2018." Image source: Apple. I don't have access to the full note -- just the blurb publicly published in Barron's -- but I think it's reasonable to expect Intel to put in more cellular modem manufacturing capacity. Moreover, I'd argue that this additional capacity doesn't necessarily reflect more share gains in the upcoming iPhone. Here's why. Intel's natural share gain Even if Intel gets a similar modem allocation in the new iPhones as it did with the iPhone 7 series devices, it's going to end up shipping more cellular modems over the next product cycle than it will during the iPhone 7 cycle. Why? It's simple -- the iPhone 7 series smartphones aren't likely to just go away with the launch of the next-generation models; they're likely to be kept around and sold as lower-cost options as Apple has done so often in the past. Right now, the iPhone 6s series smartphones -- Apple's "mid-range" models -- are all powered exclusively by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) modems. Once the iPhone 7 series is waterfalled down, the phones sold at those prices will presumably ship with either Intel- or Qualcomm-based modems (depending on the specific model). That means a natural increase in Intel-powered iPhone models and, therefore share gains, without necessarily implying that Apple's next-generation iPhone will see an increased mix of Intel cellular modems. Can Intel take it all in 2018? The analyst suggests that Intel could take 100% cellular modem share with the 2018 iPhone, but to be frank, I'm skeptical. Intel's product competitiveness should improve dramatically with its XMM 7560 cellular modem, which should have the required features/capabilities to allow Apple to source modems entirely from Intel for the 2018 iPhone. However, for reasons that extend beyond the technical capabilities of the product, I'm unconvinced. For one thing, while Intel is certainly building credibility with its cellular modem products, Apple would be unwise to go all in on Intel until the latter can prove that it can execute consistently well over several generations. Right now, Apple has a safety net named Qualcomm to fall back on if Intel messes up, but if Apple bets it all on Intel, that safety net goes away.  Beyond the risk associated with relying entirely on Intel for one of the most critical components of its key product line, there are benefits to trying to play multiple suppliers off each other. There is, of course, additional work on Apple's part to develop/distribute multiple variants of its iPhones, but by keeping both suppliers in the loop, Apple positions itself to keep them both honest in terms of pricing. All else being equal, the lower Apple's component costs, the better its gross profit margins. We'll have to see how it all plays out, but I would be surprised if Apple were to sole source the modem from Intel beginning in 2018.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Intel on Monday began selling its first Optane memory modules, which it says will transform the traditional relationship between PC memory and storage, making everything from gaming to web browsing much faster on the mainstream computers most people buy. It's a bold claim, especially since the approach Intel is taking with Optane has been done before. Optane memory's crowning achievement is its ability to intelligently allocate the data on a PC between the memory and the hard drive, all the while continuously monitoring your computing patterns to achieve faster app launches and boot times. That allocation approach will sound familiar to anyone who owns a computer with a hybrid drive configuration, which stores the applications you use most in a fast solid state drive (SSD) while relegating large files to the slower spinning drive. But Intel says that Optane's all-memory approach to data allocation is better than the hybrid drives that have been on the market for nearly a decade, both because of advances in memory technology and the fact that the Optane software configures everything automatically: you don't have to chose which data are kept in memory and which go on the storage drive. The upshot is that Optane memory will increase the speed of a traditional hard disk drive-based PC (which is nearly 80 percent of the PC market, according to Intel) by 28 percent, with up to 14 times faster storage performance, Intel says. The company didn't offer test results for Optane-powered SSD systems. In anecdotal testing during a press event at Intel's factory in Folsom, Calif., earlier this month, I saw a noticeable performance boost when replacing the conventional memory in a HDD-based Intel NUC with an Optane module. Boot times decreased by about 10 seconds with Optane, but the real difference was in some basic video- and photo-editing tasks Intel devised. A sample task using the Gimp open-source image editor took 13 seconds with conventional memory, 10 seconds with Optane freshly installed, and just over three seconds after the system was restarted a second time to allow the Optane software to work its magic. Related PC Trouble? How to Check for Memory Problems in Windows PC Trouble? How to Check for Memory Problems in Windows While this test was far from scientific (here's how we test system performance at PC Labs) it did suggest that the 10 years of research Intel has put into Optane resulted in memory that is remarkably attuned to the needs of each PC user. It's worth noting that SSDs and hybrid drives get faster as they learn your usage patterns too, though, and Intel isn't making the claim that Optane memory will replace SSDs, just that it will be a worthwhile alternative for mainstream desktops. In fact, Intel is also selling Optane-powered SSDs, which are currently available for enterprise servers but will also likely make their way to the consumer market later this year. Optane memory modules are now on sale in 16GB or 32GB versions. You'll need an Optane-ready system powered by a seventh-generation Intel Core processor to install one; Intel says there are now more than 130 Optane-ready motherboards on the market. Intel's MSRP for the 16GB module is $44, while the 32GB version is $77. Off-the-shelf enterprise and consumer systems from the likes of HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, Acer, and others will begin shipping with Optane memory starting in the second quarter.

He says he'll cut taxes, loosen regulations and increase spending on infrastructure -- all things that tend to rev up investment. At the same time, the markets and economy were doing just fine before Election Day. Trump, of course, is not shy about taking credit. And it's no surprise that companies are touting their job announcements. But how much credit he merits for many of the individual corporate moves is more complicated. In many cases, the jobs he has promoted are part of previously announced plans. Here are the facts. Ford (Part Two) On March 28, Ford announced a $1.2 billion investment in three Michigan facilities. What Trump said: The president sent a tweet touting a "big announcement" from Ford. "Car companies coming back to U.S.," he said. The facts: Ford said it plans to invest $850 million in its Wayne, Michigan, assembly plant. The company will also pump $150 million into its engine plant in Romeo, Michigan, and $200 million into a Michigan data center. Most of this investment was already agreed upon as part of a 2015 labor deal with the United Auto Workers union. At that time, Ford pledged to invest $700 million in Wayne and $150 million in Romeo, creating or retaining 130 jobs. So most of the news wasn't new. But the investment did ensure that the 3,700 workers in Wayne won't have their jobs shipped to Mexico anytime soon. Charter Communications On March 24, Charter Communications announced plans to invest $25 billion in the United States and to hire 20,000 American workers in the next four years. What Trump said: "Today, I am thrilled to announce that Charter Communications has just committed to investing $25 billion, with a 'B,'" Trump said in a joint announcement with the Charter chief executive in the Oval Office. He later tweeted his thanks. The facts: Charter, a telecommunications company, said it would invest $25 billion in broadband infrastructure and technology in the next four years. The company also committed to hiring 20,000 American workers during that period, and said it would bring back all overseas call centers and build a new call center in Texas. The 20,000 jobs, at least, have been in the works for more than a year. CEO Tom Rutledge said in 2015 that Charter would need to bring on 20,000 additional workers if the company's merger with Time Warner Cable and acquisition of Bright House Networks went through. A Charter spokesman reiterated the claim in April 2016. (Time Warner Cable is not affiliated with Time Warner, the owner of CNN.) The FCC approved the deal last May, and Rutledge said in January that the company had plans to hire 20,000 new employees within three years. Charter said Friday's announcement marked a firm commitment to hire, despite its earlier announcements. "We have spoken about our plans to hire 20k before but it wasn't a commitment," Charter spokesman Justin Venech told CNNMoney in an email. "Today we committed to a time frame of four years for those hires." The $25 billion investment, Venech said, had not been previously announced. General Motors (Part Two) On March 15, GM announced that it's adding or bringing back 900 U.S. jobs in Michigan over the next 12 months. What Trump said: "Just today -- breaking news -- General Motors announced that they're adding or keeping 900 jobs right here in Michigan," Trump said at a Detroit-area campaign speech after meeting with automakers. He added that the number of jobs in the region "would've been heading down big league if I didn't get elected." The facts: Just under 700 GM workers laid off earlier this month will get their jobs back. GM plans to reinstate 500 jobs at its Lansing plant in 2018, and it's creating 180 plant jobs in nearby Flint for accommodate some who were fired. The company will also hire 220 new workers at its plant in Romulus. GM did not directly attribute the announcement to Trump or his policies. The decision was predicated upon a "strong economy with a strong manufacturing sector," GM spokesman Tom Wickham said, as well as "anticipated strong demand" for crossover vehicles. However, the announcement came hours before Trump flew to Michigan to talk about fuel economy rules with top automakers, including GM CEO Mary Barra. "Today's event gave us a positive venue to share good news," Wickham said. The carmaker already announced in January that it would invest $1 billion in U.S. factories and create or retain 7,000 domestic jobs. ExxonMobil On March 6, CEO Darren Woods said the company is investing $20 billion in Gulf Coast manufacturing operations over 10 years, creating 45,000 jobs. What Trump said: Trump tweeted about the announcement five times, and the White House put out a laudatory press release. "This is a true American success story," the president said in a statement. Trump said in a video that Exxon's investment was happening "to a large extent because of our policies and the policies of this new administration." The facts: The jobs are part of an Exxon project called Growing the Gulf, which was launched in 2013 and aims to tap into the nation's shale boom. The company plans 11 natural gas projects along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. An ExxonMobil spokesman said he didn't know how many of the 45,000 jobs were created between 2013 and 2016. The investment is in line with Exxon's broader plans for growth. Woods has made natural gas a priority since he took the helm in January, and the company recently spent $5.6 billion to snap up shale assets in Texas and New Mexico. Exxon's press release announcing the jobs focused on the money to be made exporting chemicals linked to shale gas -- not on Trump. "These projects are export machines, generating products that high-growth nations need to support larger populations with higher standards of living," Woods said. "Those overseas markets are the motivation behind our investments." Still, Woods gave the White House a hat tip in a statement circulated by the president's team. "Investments of this scale require a pro-growth approach and a stable regulatory environment and we appreciate the President's commitment to both," Woods said. Intel On Feb. 8, Intel (INTC, Tech30) CEO Brian Krzanich announced at the White House that the tech giant would invest $7 billion in a new Arizona factory, creating 10,000 related jobs. What Trump said: Trump said at a press conference after the announcement that Intel "will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that it was probably never going to move ahead with, and that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs." Trump also promoted the Intel news at a joint press conference with the Canadian prime minister. Trump said Intel is "coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands and thousands of jobs" because he's moved to lower taxes and decrease regulation. The facts: The new computer chip factory will directly create about 3,000 "high-paying, high-wage, high-tech" jobs at its peak, according to Krzanich. In total, it will support more than 10,000 related jobs in the state. The investment was made "in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward," Krzanich said from the Oval Office. But the project isn't entirely Trump's doing. In fact, Intel previously announced a $5 billion investment in the same Arizona chip factory with former President Barack Obama in 2011. That money was used to build the "shell" of the factory, but it was left unfinished because of a lack of "general demand for the product," according to company spokesman William Moss. The project is resuming now that demand is picking up again. "We're making this investment now to meet demand that we now expect," Moss told CNNMoney. "That said, we certainly join other companies in supporting the administration's pro-business and pro-investment goals." General Motors (Part One) On Jan. 17, General Motors (GM) announced plans to invest at least $1 billion in U.S. factories. The company also committed to creating or retaining about 7,000 U.S. jobs in the next few years. What Trump said: Trump, then the president-elect, gave GM and Walmart a shout-out via Twitter the day of the announcement, thanking the companies "for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!" The facts: GM plans to shift 450 jobs from supplier plants in Mexico back to the U.S., and has pledged to protect 1,500 factory jobs that were previously at risk of leaving the country. GM is also adding 5,000 jobs to its finance and technology operations. Details will be rolled out later this year. The company didn't mention Trump in its announcement. "As the U.S. manufacturing base increases its competitiveness, we are able to further increase our investment, resulting in more jobs for America and better results for our owners," GM CEO Mary Barra said in a statement. These plans have been in the works for some time, according to a company executive, and aren't part of any arrangement with President Trump. Still, GM has been eager to show the new administration that it's serious about domestic job creation. Trump has attacked the automaker for making cars in Mexico and threatened to hit its imports with a "big" border tax. Barra serves on Trump's economic advisory council. Walmart On Jan. 17, Walmart (WMT), which employs more workers than any other American business, said it would add 10,000 U.S. jobs this year. What Trump said: Trump offered praise for Walmart in the tweet about GM. The facts: Walmart will add 10,000 jobs by expanding, renovating or relocating 59 Walmart and Sam's Club stores. It's also expanding online services. In addition, the project will create 24,000 temporary construction jobs, the company said. Walmart didn't mention Trump in its announcement. "With a presence in thousands of communities and a vast supplier network, we know we play an important role in supporting and creating American jobs," Walmart executive Dan Bartlett said in a statement. It's unclear whether Trump or his policies affected the decision, announced days before the inauguration. Walmart declined to comment. CEO Doug McMillon serves on Trump's economic advisory council. Lockheed Martin On Jan. 13, defense giant Lockheed Martin (LMT) said it would add 1,800 jobs to its F-35 fighter jet program in Texas. What Trump said: Trump mentioned Lockheed Martin's job creation in a Jan. 18 tweet. He said the jobs "came back because of me!" The facts: Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson told reporters about the new jobs while leaving a meeting at with the president-elect at Trump Tower. She said Lockheed is "close to a deal" that will bring down the cost of the F-35 and bring "thousands and thousands of jobs" to the U.S. Trump criticized the cost of Lockheed Martin's F-35 program in late December. He said "the tremendous cost and cost overruns" led him to ask Boeing to price a comparable jet. Lockheed stock dropped. Lockheed has every reason to charm Trump: It is the largest U.S. government contractor, according to the most recent most recent data. But these new jobs would have been added with or without him. The positions Hewson announced are linked to production increases that have been in motion for years, a Lockheed spokesman told CNNMoney. Lockheed plans to deliver 150 jets in 2019, compared with 36 aircraft in 2014. Amazon On Jan. 12, Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) announced plans to create more than 100,000 U.S. jobs in the next 18 months. What Trump said: "The announcement was made after the president-elect met with heads of several other tech companies and urge them to keep their jobs and production inside the United States," Sean Spicer, the incoming press secretary, said on a call with reporters that day. "The president-elect was pleased to have played a role in that decision by Amazon." The facts: Amazon didn't mention Trump in its press release. "Innovation is one of our guiding principles at Amazon, and it's created hundreds of thousands of American jobs," Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. "These jobs are not just in our Seattle headquarters or in Silicon Valley -- they're in our customer service network, fulfillment centers and other facilities in local communities throughout the country." Amazon would probably add tens of thousands of jobs regardless of who is president. The e-commerce company is growing rapidly, and Amazon adds fulfillment centers each year to expand its shipping operations. "The bottom line is they were going to create jobs anyway, but it's the messaging that has changed," James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt, told CNNMoney. This announcement "appears to calibrate to current political sensitivities." During the campaign, Trump repeatedly took on Bezos. He said once that Amazon is "getting away with murder tax-wise." Chinese tech giant Alibaba On Jan. 9, Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba (BABA, Tech30), met with Trump and promised to help create 1 million jobs in the U.S. through the company's e-commerce platforms. What Trump said: Ma "had no intention of doing it until I got elected," Trump said in an interview with Fox News. He also said Alibaba and other companies will spend a "tremendous amount of money" in the United States. The facts: Ma is on record as early as 2015 saying he wanted to create U.S. jobs by helping businesses sell American goods to China, and Asia generally, on Alibaba's e-commerce platform. After the January meeting, a reporter asked whether Ma and Trump talked about any investments in the U.S. "No," Ma replied. "We specifically talked about ... supporting 1 million businesses, especially in the Midwest of America." Alibaba's pledge to help create 1 million jobs in the U.S. is vague and misleading. Ma is not going to build factories. He is not planning to set up Alibaba operations centers that would employ tech-savvy Americans. And he is not touting a big investment. In other words, Ma isn't promising what most experts would define as job creation. He's talking about stimulating trade by helping 1 million small businesses sell American goods in China and Asia. Why the Midwest? Chinese consumers want more foreign food supplements and baby goods -- think milk products from a farm in Wisconsin. Fiat Chrysler On Jan. 8, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) announced a $1 billion investment to expand factories in Ohio and Michigan, spurring the creation of 2,000 jobs by 2020. What Trump said: "It's finally happening - Fiat Chrysler just announced plans to invest $1BILLION in Michigan and Ohio plants, adding 2000 jobs," Trump tweeted the next day. The facts: The announcement is the latest phase in an "industrialization plan" the company announced a year ago. In a 2015 deal with the United Auto Workers union, the company committed to investing $5.3 billion in American plants to open up additional union jobs. Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a press conference that the decision was neither a response to Trump's pressure on the auto industry nor an effort to avoid Trump's ire. "I wish I could give him credit for this," Marchionne told reporters. "But the thinking was in place beforehand." Still, Trump's public criticism of GM and Ford factories in Mexico has surely made Fiat Chrysler and its investors wary. Marchionne called it "incredibly imprudent" for Chrysler to invest in Mexico until the industry gets some clarity on tariff threats. Ford On Jan. 3, Ford (F) announced that the company is canceling plans to build a plant in Mexico. Instead, the carmaker will invest $700 million in Michigan to create 700 U.S. jobs. What Trump said: Trump hailed Ford's decision on Twitter the next day. "Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S.," he tweeted. "This is just the beginning - much more to follow." After Fiat Chrysler's announcement the following week, the president-elect applauded Ford again. "Ford said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U.S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico," he tweeted. "Thank you Ford & Fiat C!" The facts: The Ford Focus will now be built at an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, and the $700 million investment in Ford's Flat Rock, Michigan, plant will allow the company to ramp up production of electric and self-driving cars. Ford CEO Mark Fields said the investment is a "vote of confidence" in the pro-business environment Trump is working to foster. However, he stressed that Ford did not negotiate a deal with the president-elect. "We didn't cut a deal with Trump," Fields told CNN's Poppy Harlow. "We did it for our business." Falling small car sales probably played a major role. At the same time, Trump's unrelenting criticism of Ford on the campaign trail could have been a factor. Last year, Ford announced that it would invest $1.6 billion to transfer production of the Focus from Michigan to Mexico as a cost-saving move. Trump repeatedly blasted the automaker for sending U.S. jobs to Mexico (Ford said no jobs would be lost because of the move) and threatened to place a 35% tariff on Ford vehicles made in Mexico and sold in the U.S. Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank On Dec. 6, after meeting with Trump, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son pledged to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 jobs. What Trump said: The president immediately claimed credit, tweeting, "Masa said he would never do this had we not won the election!" The facts: Before the election, SoftBank (SFTBF)and the government of Saudi Arabia said they were forming a $100 billion fund to invest in tech companies around the world. Son told The Wall Street Journal that the money he promised to Trump would come from the SoftBank Vision Fund. A SoftBank spokesman disputed that Son said the investment would come entirely from the Vision Fund, saying, "it is a commitment from SoftBank." SoftBank announced it would pump $1 billion into Florida startup OneWeb on Dec. 19, a move it said would create 3,000 jobs over the next four years. The company described the investment as "the first step" in Son's promise to Trump. But it is not clear how much of the huge investment would have ended up in the U.S. regardless of who won the White House. The OneWeb deal wasn't cobbled together after the election. Softbank had been in talks with the startup for "a long time," said SoftBank spokesman Matthew Nicholson. Sprint, which is also owned by SoftBank, confirmed late last year that it would "create or bring back to America" 5,000 jobs, also part of Son's commitment to create 50,000 jobs. Carrier On Nov. 30, air conditioning, heating and refrigeration company Carrier said it cut a deal with the incoming Trump administration to keep jobs in Indiana from moving to Mexico. What Trump said: Trump touted his team's involvement in the Carrier deal from the start. "I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana)," he tweeted on Nov. 24. "MAKING PROGRESS." Once the deal was inked, Trump visited the plant to claim a victory. "Carrier stepped it up, and now they're keeping -- actually, the number is over 1,100 people," he said. "Which is so great." The facts: The company said the deal was possible because the incoming administration emphasized "its commitment to support the business community and create an improved, more competitive U.S. business climate." It also credits an incentive package offered by the state of Indiana. Carrier says the agreement really saved 800 jobs -- not 1,100 -- from moving to Mexico. The company confirmed to CNNMoney that it never planned to move 300 administrative and engineering positions from Indianapolis. Carrier will receive $7 million in financial incentives from the state of Indiana over the next 10 years -- a fraction of what Carrier expected to save if it moved the jobs to Mexico. Carrier's parent company, United Technologies (UTX), is a major defense contractor.

Intel still has ambitions for Optane in client PCs, but competing with NAND SSDs on both a speed and capacity basis would prove prohibitively expensive given Optane's roughly $4-per-gigabyte cost right now. Instead, Intel is taking a different tack for the moment: improving the performance of hard-drive-only systems for a reasonable cost. The company says that people considering desktop PCs want three things above all: performance, security, and storage capacity. Right now, hard drives tick the capacity box, but anybody who's used an SSD knows that spinning rust doesn't perform anything like flash. Hard drives still make up the vast majority of storage devices shipping in today's PCs, however, and Intel anticipates that'll continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. Enter Optane Memory. Intel's first client Optane product uses a hardware-and-software stack that purports to cache a user's most commonly accessed files on a fast slice of PCIe 3.0 x4-connected storage. Its reliance on newer tech aside, Optane Memory as a whole sounds similar in principle to what Apple does with its Fusion Drive-equipped iMacs. It also sounds similar in principle to Intel's own Turbo Memory technology, a small slice of NAND on a riser card that did basically nothing for system performance when it debuted in some notebooks back in 2005. Given Intel's history with elaborate solid-state caching layers, I was skeptical about the prospects of another take on the idea. Optane has some fundamental differences that promise a better showing this time around, however. For one, Optane doesn't need a large number of dies to achieve maximum performance like most NAND devices do, so one Optane die (as one will find on Intel's 16GB Optane Memory device) or two dies (as found on the 32GB gumstick) should offer enough parallelism to deliver a performance increase over devices with small amounts of NAND on board, like SSHDs. Even more importantly, Optane Memory devices enjoy the same class of high QD1 performance that the SSD DC P4800X does, so they can offer maximum performance at the low queue depths typical of desktop workloads. For its part, Intel thinks Optane Memory will boost system responsiveness above all—the major beef with hard-drive-only PCs. Using the Sysmark benchmarking suite, the company claims only minor increases in application performance, but the suite's responsiveness test comes away with twice the performance of a system with a hard drive alone. To bolster the point that QD1 performance matters most for desktop users and that Optane is ideally suited to boosting system responsiveness, Intel shared some internal data about the read and write queue depths for the synthetic PCMark Vantage benchmark and some demo workloads from its labs. Intel also performed trace analysis for the launch performance demands of several commonly-used applications one might find in the typical workplace. Finally, Intel collected application traces from a number of its employees' PCs to show the queue depth demands of more productivity-focused workloads. The point of these graphs is clear: most random desktop workloads level off at about QD4, and the majority of accesses happen at QD1 or QD2. Given those characteristics, Optane Memory seems ideally suited to speed up application launches and perhaps to lessen the wait for commonly-accessed files, at least so long as those accesses are primarily random. Presuming that's the case, Optane Memory seems much better poised to offer some kind of speedup to a user's commonly-used applications than a small NAND cache like Turbo Memory might have. Optane Memory isn't much good without its companion software, an unobtrusive utility that sits in the system tray. Intel says this application will render the Optane cache transparent to the user experience. The only storage device that should show up with an Optane Memory system is the user's primary system drive (along with any other non-Optane Memory storage devices that may be installed). There's a lot of black-boxiness to how the app's caching algorithm works, but Intel suggests Optane Memory won't be caching entire applications like games on the Optane device itself, simply because they'd often be too large to fit in 16GB or 32GB of space. Instead, I got the impression that the Optane Memory app will look for common files (like shared libraries and operating system files) that are often accessed by many programs and cache those instead.

Five level paging allows raising the Linux x86_64 limitation of 256 TiB of virtual address space to 128 PiB and raises the physical address space limit from 64 TiB to 4 PiB. While 64 TiB of memory may seem like a lot, some Intel customers are already hitting this limitation. The new paging mode is exposed via the CONFIG_X86_5LEVEL Kconfig switch. Future Intel CPUs will support 5-level paging. The latest set of 5-level paging patches have been posted to the kernel mailing list and looks like the developers are aligning them for merging into the Linux 4.12 merge window that will open at the end of April. 7 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The former is cheap, bulky, and slow. The latter is expensive, light, and fast. There has been zero middle ground. You've had to compromise between price and speed. But Intel's hoping to eradicate that compromise with its new Intel Optane Memory. According to Intel, installing this single memory stick in your computer could supercharge even the slowest hard drive and give you the SSD's best feature: speed. Let's do a quick refresher on what the hell computer memory is to begin with. Random Access Memory (RAM) is one part of a computer's speed equation. DRAM-those sticks of memory you pop in your computer-stores regularly addressed information and feeds it to the processor. More memory means more data stored means a faster computer. But RAM only stores info as long as the program is open, and it is volatile-which means it forgets everything as soon as you power the computer off. That means it can't learn your habits to speed up the launch of programs you use the most and it will never affect how quickly your computer boots up. Non-volatile memory-like the NAND memory at the heart of solid state drives, your iPhone, and any other storage device that doesn't have a bunch of moving parts in the hard drive-remembers everything when the computer is powered off. Only it's much slower, and much more expensive. So it's great for storing all your music photos, and even your operating system, but it is impossible to use in the traditional "computer memory" mode. You'll never use NAND memory as you would DRAM. "This is the biggest advance in memory in decades." Intel's new Optane memory is, according to Intel, an entirely new type of computer memory. It's based on the 3D Xpoint memory architecture Intel announced back in July 2015 . It's as fast as the DRAM memory found in every computer used today, but as stable as the NAND memory found in the SSDs central to most of your pricier laptops. Intel Senior Vice President Navin Shenoy claims "this is the biggest advance in memory in decades." Which sounds like absolute hokum, until you consider that 3D Xpoint architecture Optane is based on. A non-volatile version of DRAM has been a goal for computer engineers since almost the instant DRAM was invented. While it might not be the biggest advance in computer memory (NAND is itself impressive). 3D Xpoint-based memory is still a big fucking deal. And according to Intel, when its slotted into a computer alongside DRAM it speeds that computer up incredibly-giving you the kind of benefits traditionally only seen when you used a solid state drive. Intel claims computers power on twice as fast as they would without Optane, browsers launch five times faster, and games can launch up to 67 percent faster. Intel Optane memory works as a kind of supercharger for a computer's storage system. It doesn't replace any components already in a computer, instead it's an add-on, clipped into the motherboard. In a computer's processes it sits between the hard drive and the processor-remembering regularly accessed data, like RAM might, but retaining that information even when a program is closed or the computer is turned off.  Yet it isn't necessary to the function of the computer. If it fails, it's not catastrophic, like the failure of a hard drive. You can't lose data from it's failure. Instead you'd just pull the bust Optane stick out and keep on computer, albeit, according to Intel, more more slowly than with Optane in. Currently Optane memory will only be available for desktop computers with Kaby Lake processors and "Optane memory ready" motherboards (check the documentation for your motherboard to confirm). So you current computer is unlike to enjoy the benefits Intel claims. But Intel is also extremely serious about this tech. Nearly every new motherboard built for Kaby Lake and above will have a slot for Optane memory, and you can expect Optane to start appearing in laptops later this year. For people who currently own a computer that's Optane memory ready, it will fit into the M.2 slot on your motherboard-the same one currently used by the fastest solid state drives available, and as with DRAM memory, more is better. Optane memory will come in two sizes when it goes on sale April 24: 16GB ($44) and 32GB ($77). When you couple an Optane memory chip with a traditional drive it's a lot cheaper (and Intel claims faster) than the fastest SSDs available. A 500GB M.2 SSD currently retails for $168. A traditional 1TB hard drive and a 32GB Optane memory chip will retail for just $127. That's a lot of extra speed and storage for a lot lower price. Intel does insist that Optane memory will work with any internal storage though. While Intel's flashy benchmark results were from testing a traditional hard drive versus a hard drive and Optane memory chip, Intel says Optane will boost the speed SSDs and M.2 SSDs too. Unfortunately, the only benchmarks of Optane memory currently available are from Intel itself. So we can't confirm just how dramatic the speed increases actually are. But we'll definitely be performing our own tests of Optane memory closer to its April 24 launch date.

Intel Optane technology is a unique combination of 3D XPoint memory media, Intel Memory and Storage Controllers, Intel Interconnect IP and Intel software. Intel Optane technology is coming to market in consumer Solid-State Drives, Data Center solutions and even as add-in M.2 system accelerator cards! Today, we’ll be focusing on Intel Optane Memory, which would be the add-in M.2 add-in accelerator card. When combined with a large rotational primary OS drive, the Intel Optane memory M.2 module accelerates computer performance, while maintaining capacity. The kicker is that to use Intel Optane memory you’ll need to be using a 7th Gen Intel Core i-series ‘Kaby Lake’ processor along with an Intel 200 series motherboard. This is not a technology that will be supported by older processors or motherboard series. For those that have a 7th Gen Intel Core processor and Intel 200 series motherboard with an open M.2 PCIe NVMe 1.1 port you should be able to pop one of these Intel Optane memory modules into your system to get an improved PC experience with shorter boot times, faster application launches, quicker game loads and a responsive web browsing experience. You’ll also need Intel Rapid Storage Technology RST 15.5 drivers on the system to properly enable Intel Optane Memory. The good news is that you don’t have to re-install the OS to get the performance benefits of Intel Optane Memory! You can basically think of Intel Optane Memory modules as a high-speed caching drive. This ideas isn’t really ‘new’ as Intel released Smart Response Technology (SRT) in 2011 on the Z68 chipset. When you dig deeper into Intel SRT versus Intel Optane Memory you’ll see that they are virtually identical on a high-level as they are basically SSD caching devices, but Intel Optane Memory features the new 3D XPoint memory chips, is connected on the PCI Express interface and has new Intel RST software for improved performance, Intel Optane Memory M.2 modules will be offered in a 16GB module for $44 ($2.75 per GB) and a 32GB module for $77 ($2.41 per GB). The price per GB is rather high, but Intel pointed out that it less expensive than an SSD. The WD Blue 1TB 7,200 RPM 3.5″ desktop hard drive runs $49.99 shipped, so you’d be able to get a 1TB HDD with a 16GB Intel Optane Memory M.2 Module for $93.99 together. Intel thinks that having a high-capacity hard drive and high-speed caching drive will be able to offer a nice performance boost without breaking the bank. Model Name Intel Optane Memory Series Memory Capacity (GB) 16GB, 32GB Components Intel Optane memory module with 3D XPoint memory media Intel Controller and Firmware Intel Rapid Storage Technology 15.5 or later Interface PCIe 3.0×2 with NVMe interface Form Factor M.2 2280-S3-B-M Latency (avg sequential) Read: 6 µs (TYP) Write: 16 µs (TYP) Height/Weight Up to 1.5mm / Up to 40 grams Reliability 1.2 million hours Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) 1 sector per 1017 bits read Uncorrectable Bit Error Rate (UBER) Temperature Operating: 0 to 700c Non-Operating: -40 to 85c Performance @ QD 4 Sequential R/W: Up to 1200/280 MB/s 4KB Random R/W: Up to 300k/70k IOPS Power 3.3V Supply Rail Active: 3.5W Drive Idle: 900mW to 1.2W Endurance Rating 100GB Writes Per Day Operating System Support Windows 10 64-bit Supported Platforms 7th Gen or newer Intel Core Processor-based Platforms Compliance NVM Express 1.1 PCI Express Base Specification Rev 3.0 PCI M.2 Hardware Specifications Ecological: European Union (ED) RoHS Compliance Directives Software Tools Intel Optane Memory Software Intel Rapid Storage Technology Software Intel SSD & Memory Toolbox Note that the Intel Optane Memory module has an impressive endurance rating of 100GB of writes per day! Who is Intel targeting with Intel Optane Memory? Most of our readers are enthusiasts and Intel Optane Memory is not targeted to you. Most all of our readers are using NAND based SATA and PCIe SSDs already, so an Intel Optane Memory solution won’t give you much of a performance boost to make it worthwhile. Notice on the chart Intel believes that the hardcore enthusiast will be looking at using Intel Optane SSDs as Intel does have 3D XPoint based PCIe SSDs coming in the 2H of 2017!  The chart above shows that Intel Optane Memory M.2 Modules can not be used to accelerate systems that have multiple drives in RAID, on an Intel 100 series chipset platform with an 7th Gen Intel Core processor, to accelerate a non-boot drive in a system with multiple drives or on a 6th Gen Intel core processor when using on an Intel 100 series or 200 series motherboard. Intel Optane memory does work when a PC is using a standalone HDD/SSHD/SSD or in a system with a dual-drive setup (SSD and HDD). Intel tries to sell the value of investing more intro Intel Optane memory than system memory in the slide above where they look at a system with 8GB of memory and a hard drive versus a system with 4GB of memory and a 16GB Intel Optane Memory solution. They saw higher scores in SYSmark 2014 SE with less system memory and the Intel Optane memory module. By showing a 97% increase in system responsiveness they believe that end users can safely reduce the money they put into DRAM and put it towards Intel Optane Memory for a better overall system. This is something that we look forward into looking at when we get our Intel Optane memory samples as running 4GB of memory in a brand new system here in 2017 does seem a bit silly. In fact, we looked and we couldn’t even find any desktop DDR4 modules that were 2GB in capacity available for sale on Amazon or Newegg! You can get 2GB DDR4 SO-DIMM kits for Intel NUC desktop PCs, but Intel’s value message is a bit strange as we don’t see too many systems being shipped by the big box retailers that have less than 8GB of memory in them. When it comes to the performance benefits from using Intel Optane Memory this is the money slide. Intel compared a system with a 1TB HDD by itself and then again with a 16GB Intel Optane Memory module inside and found pretty massive performance gains. They got up to a 67% performance boost when launching a PC game and a 65% performance boost when loading a game level! Those scores are impressive for PC gamers, but Intel also noted that they are getting up to 14x faster storage performance, up to 2x more responsive in every day tasks 5.8x improvement in launching e-mail, up to 2x in boot times and up to 5x faster in web browsing. These are monster improvements, so let’s see how Intel was able to pull this off. A lot of the performance gains Intel is seeing is coming from improved low Queue Depth (QD) performance. QD is the number of I/O pending requests (SCSI commands) that can be queued at one time on a storage controller. Each I/O request from the host’s initiator HBA to the storage controller’s target adapter consumes a queue entry. The slide above shows the QD depths found in PCMark Vantage and you’ll see that most are under QD8 with the majority taking place at QD1 and QD2. Here is look at 11 real-world applications and the read-write queue depths when opening each of these applications. Notice that almost all read/write queue depths take place at a depth of 3 or less! The point here is why are storage drive makers and reviewers looking at drive performance up at QD depths of 32, 64, 128 and beyond when pretty much no client applications ever get that high on a desktop computer? To further drive the message home one Intel employee ran an internal Intel queue depth trace analysis on his work PC for 10 days and again showed that most everything takes place between QD1 to QD4, but there were times that he was hitting up to QD10 at times. So, low queue depth performance matters and luckily for Intel that is where Intel Optane Memory really excels and comes to live. The slide above shows QD and 4K random read IOPS and how Intel Optane Memory destroys HDDs, SATA SSDs, PCIe NVMe SSDs in the area that matters most for client workloads and that is in the QD1 – QD4 range that the trace data showed was most heavily used. That is how Intel was able to get up to 14x improvements as at very low queue depths the older storage technologies can’t compete with Intel 3D Xpoint memory. This is a very good sign for those that are waiting for Intel Optane SSDs!   Intel also claims victory with regards to latency and shows that the Intel Optane Memory in conjunction with the hard drive greatly reduces the latency seen when running the PCMark Vantage benchmark suite. Intel Optane Memory should be available to pre-order later today and will run you $44 for the 16GB module or $77 for the 32GB module. Intel Optane Memory isn’t an upgrade option for people with older systems, so we see the bulk of Intel Optane Memory modules selling through system builders like Dell, Lenovo, HP, CyberPowerPC and others. If you are buying a new $500+ desktop PC with a hard drive it would make sense to include one of these with the purchase of the system as it will speed it up. If you are building a higher-end gaming PC with SATA or PCIe NVMe SSDs a caching drive might not be for you. Hardcore enthusiasts should be excited though as the low queue depth performance of the Intel Optane Memory modules thanks to 3D XPoint memory is impressive. That means with the larger capacity Intel Optane SSDs ship later this year we should see some impressive performance numbers. We’ll hopefully have an Intel Optane Memory module or two to try out here soon and we’ll report back our findings as soon as we can! Dorian Kunch Thanks Nate, great demystification of confusing tech.

This week, 3D XPoint memory comes to the client and consumer market in the form of the Intel Optane Memory product, a low-capacity M.2 NVMe SSD intended for use as a cache drive for systems using a mechanical hard drive for primary storage. The Intel Optane Memory SSD uses one or two single-die packages of 3D XPoint non-volatile memory to provide capacities of 16GB or 32GB. The controller gets away with a much smaller package than most SSDs (especially PCIe SSD) since it only supports two PCIe 3.0 lanes and does not have an external DRAM interface. Because only two PCIe lanes are used by the drive, it is keyed to support M.2 type B and M slots. This keying is usually used for M.2 SATA SSDs while M.2 PCIe SSDs typically use only the M key position to support four PCIe lanes. The Optane Memory SSD will not function in a M.2 slot that provides only SATA connectivity. Contrary to some early leaks, the Optane Memory SSD uses the M.2 2280 card size instead of one of the shorter lengths. This makes for one of the least-crowded M.2 PCBs on the market even with all of the components on the top side. The very low capacity of the Optane Memory drives limits their usability as traditional SSDs. Intel intends for the drive to be used with the caching capabilities of their Rapid Storage Technology drivers. Intel first introduced SSD caching with their Smart Response Technology in 2011. The basics of Optane Memory caching are mostly the same, but under the hood Intel has tweaked the caching algorithms to better suit 3D XPoint memory's performance and flexibility advantages over flash memory. Optane Memory caching is currently only supported on Windows 10 64-bit and only for the boot volume. Booting from a cached volume requires that the chipset's storage controller be in RAID mode rather than AHCI mode so that the cache drive will not be accessible as a standard NVMe drive and is instead remapped to only be accessible to Intel's drivers through the storage controller. This NVMe remapping feature was first added to the Skylake-generation 100-series chipsets, but boot firmware support will only be found on Kaby Lake-generation 200-series motherboards and Intel's drivers are expected to only permit Optane Memory caching with Kaby Lake processors. Intel Optane Memory Specifications Capacity 16 GB 32 GB Form Factor M.2 2280 single-sided Interface PCIe 3.0 x2 NVMe Controller Intel unnamed Memory 128Gb 20nm Intel 3D XPoint Typical Read Latency 6 µs Typical Write Latency 16 µs Random Read (4 KB, QD4) 300k Random Write (4 KB, QD4) 70k Sequential Read (QD4) 1200 MB/s Sequential Write (QD4) 280 MB/s Endurance 100 GB/day Power Consumption 3.5 W (active), 0.9-1.2 W (idle) MSRP $44 $77 Release Date April 24 Intel has published some specifications for the Optane Memory drive's performance on its own. The performance specifications are the same for both capacities, suggesting that the controller has only a single channel interface to the 3D XPoint memory. The read performance is extremely good given the limitation of only one or two memory devices for the controller to work with, but the write throughput is quite limited. Read and write latency are very good thanks to the inherent performance advantage of 3D XPoint memory over flash. Endurance is rated at just 100GB of writes per day, for both 16GB and 32GB models. While this does correspond to 3-6 DWPD and is far higher than consumer-grade flash based SSDs, 3D XPoint memory was supposed to have vastly higher write endurance than flash and neither of the Optane products announced so far is specified for game-changing endurance. Power consumption is rated at 3.5W during active use, so heat shouldn't be a problem, but the idle power of 0.9-1.2W is a bit high for laptop use, especially given that there will also be a hard drive drawing power. Intel's vision is for Optane Memory-equipped systems to offer a compelling performance advantage over hard drive-only systems for a price well below an all-flash configuration of equal capacity. The 16GB Optane Memory drive will retail for $44 while the 32GB version will be $77. As flash memory has declined in price over the years, it has gotten much easier to purchase SSDs that are large enough for ordinary use: 256GB-class SSDs start at around the same price as the 32GB Optane Memory drive, and 512GB-class drives are about the same as the combination of a 2TB hard drive and the 32GB Optane Memory. The Optane Memory products are squeezing into a relatively small niche for limited budgets that require a lot of storage and want the benefit of solid state performance without paying the full price of a boot SSD. Intel notes that Optane Memory caching can be used in front of hybrid drives and SATA SSDs, but the performance benefit will be smaller and these configurations are not expected to be common or cost effective. The Optane Memory SSDs are now available for pre-order and are scheduled to ship on April 24. Pre-built systems equipped with Optane Memory should be available around the same time. Enthusiasts with large budgets will want to wait until later this year for Optane SSDs with sufficient capacity to use as primary storage. True DIMM-based 3D XPoint memory products are on the roadmap for next year. Source: Intel Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment. POST A COMMENT 113 Comments View All Comments Eden-K121D - Monday, March 27, 2017 - link I'm confused. Can someone explain how this would work and what benefits would occur in real world usage ? Reply Billy Tallis - Monday, March 27, 2017 - link As with any cache, data that is frequently or recently used can be accessed more quickly from the cache device than from the larger, slower device. Intel's hope is that ordinary desktop usage is mostly confined to a relatively small data set: the OS, a few commonly-used applications, and some documents. When accessing data that fits in the cache, you'll get SSD-like performance. If you launch a program that isn't in the cache, it'll still be hard drive slow (assuming the cache backing device is a hard drive, of course). Sequential accesses don't have a lot of reason to use the cache and are probably excluded by Intel's algorithms to save cache space for random I/O. Reply saratoga4 - Monday, March 27, 2017 - link You can make a large magnetic hard drive faster by adding an external cache. For people who can't afford a large enough SSD, this might be a good choice. SSDs are getting cheap though, so this feels like a product that needed to ship a few years earlier to have a real chance. Reply Gothmoth - Monday, March 27, 2017 - link it feels like a product searching for a reason to exist. if i need fast performance i buy a SDD that delivers 2 GB/s and not a cache device that delivers 1200 mb/s. Reply BurntMyBacon - Monday, March 27, 2017 - link @Gothmoth Keep in mind that consumer NVMe SSDs that boast throughput of 2GB/s or more generally do not reach their peak at low queue depth. Optane is supposed to be able to drive 1200MB/s read throughput at low queue depth (not sure why they listed QD4), so there is potential for some performance improvement here. Most consumer workloads never get out of low queue depth territory, so this could have some small real world benefit. Write throughput, however, is critically low. More importantly, these Optane drive are gear more towards lowering latency than transferring large files. Where HDDs access the data on the order of 10s of mS and SSDs access data on the order of 1mS (give or take), Optane should be able to access data on the order of 1s - 10s of uS. Where Optane will be useful is high numbers of small file accesses (DLLs, library files, etc.). That all said, I'd just as soon leave all the extra complications, compatibility issues, and inconsistencies on the table and get that 2 GB/s sdd that you mentioned until Intel figures out how to make these more compatible and easier to use without requiring a "golden setup". I don't want to buy a new W10, Kaby Lake, 200 series based system just to use one of these. My current W7/W10/Ubuntu, Skylake, 100 series system should work just fine for a good while yet. Reply Sarah Terra - Monday, March 27, 2017 - link Anyone remember intel turbo cache? This looks to be nearly the same thing, kind of a let down. Reply BrokenCrayons - Monday, March 27, 2017 - link I recall it being released with the 965 chipset and offering little to no benefit to the end user. In fact, I think HP and a few other OEMs didn't bother supporting it. Turbo Memory's disappointing performance is one of the reasons why I think Optane is better used as a higher endurance replacement for NAND flash SSDs than as a cache for now progressively less common conventional hard drives. Reply Byte - Monday, March 27, 2017 - link Maybe it will find a way into Intels SSDs and replace the SLC cache with the Optane with is much bigger and higher performance. Reply beginner99 - Tuesday, March 28, 2017 - link That would actually be pretty reasonable product compared to this. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, March 28, 2017 - link SLC is MUCH better than hypetane. Double the endurance, 1/100 the latency. It will we a big step back to replace SLC cache with xpoint. What the industry should really do is go back to SLC in 3D form. Because it doesn't look like xpoint has a density advantage either, as it is already 3D and it takes 28 chips for the measly 448GB. Samsung 960 pro has 2 TB in 4 chips. Sure that's MLC, which is twice as dense as SLC. Meaning that with 3D SLC you could have a terabyte in 4 chips. Now, if you get short of 0.5 TB of xpoint with 28 chips, and you get 1 TB of much faster, durable and overall better SLC with 4 chips, that means it would take like 60 chips to get a TB with xpoint. Making potential 3D SLC "ONLY" 15 TIMES better in terms of density, while still offering superior performance and endurance. Which begs the question, why the hell is intel pushing this dreck??? My guess, knowing the bloated obese lazy spoiled brat they are, they put a shameful amount of money into RDing it, and how they are hyping the crap out of it in order to get some returns. They most likely realized its inferiority way back, which prompted them to go for the hype campaign, failing to realize despite (or because of) their brand name, that would do more harm than good the moment it fails to materialize. Which it did - I mean look at how desperate they are at trying to find a market for this thing. Time to add Hypetane to "handheld SOC" in the "intel's grandiose failures" category. The downsides of being a bloated monopolist - you are too full of yourself and too slow to react to a changing market to offer adequate solutions.

They become the second 3DXP products from Intel following solid-state drives for servers announced earlier this month. Intel claims the new cards will create more responsive PCs, improving performance across a wide range of tasks. When the cards were announced at CES, one analyst claimed they lack “a clear benefit to the average PC purchaser” and are “likely to appeal only to enthusiasts with an unlimited budget.” Intel lists the products at $44 for a 16 GByte card and $77 for a 32 GByte version. They use an NVMe 1.1 interface to deliver a typical sequential read latency of six microseconds and 16 microseconds for writes. Intel lists endurance for the cards as 100 GByte writes/day. More than 130 motherboards are already available that will accept the M.2 cards. Before June OEMs and motherboard makers will start selling products with the cards. Although Intel said the cards will boost performance of a wide range of common tasks, it also suggested they are mainly suited to enthusiast users buying PCs that cost $6,000 or more. The cards work exclusively with Intel’s seventh-generation Core i7 processors and use Intel software to make a hard disk and the M.2 card appear as a single storage volume to an otherwise unmodified Windows 10 PC. The cards debut as Intel’s rival, Advanced Micro Devices, rolls out its Ryzen 7 x86 processors announced in late February. The new CPUs aim to deliver enthusiast-level PC performance at significantly lower prices. The Optane cards will give price-insensitive users an alternative to the AMD chips if they want the highest performance available. Whether more high-end users vote to save money or increase performance will be one of the key questions for the PC market in 2017. Intel says Optane delivers modest gains on many benchmarks but an overall sense of better responsiveness. Click to enlarge.

As you say endurance is usually the term used to describe the number of write/erase cycles to failure, or the write/erase lifetime. The reciprocal of GByte Writes/day is days per/GByte write, a WRITE time. In this particular case reducing Bytes to bits and days to seconds provides a write time of 0.108microsecs/bit (I think!) or much less if you write in parallel. A little more clarity please Intel or somebody on this definition of endurance in this new world of Optane(tm) where the reciprocal of write time is apparently endurance.

This technology will require a rethinking of the current computer in its current design. I cannot help feeling that hdd is the next floppy disk, and that even the current SSD will soon play second fiddle to this new class of storage/processing hardware (that's what it will be).  Many of us forgot that even HDDs were not common in "PCs" at the beginning. The current SSD is still marketed as a hybrid next to hdd and now we are already watching the next step in the evolution which will be even more of a sonic boom in the industry. Interesting times indeed. Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: Retention?

It was presented at an embargoed briefing attended by iTWire. It does not appear to be yet another incremental “advance” in 3D vertical NAND technology, rather a major advance for RAM and storage since NAND memory was invented in 1984. NAND, also called flash, is non-volatile storage technology that does not require power to retain data. Over time companies like Intel, Toshiba, Samsung and others have crammed more and more capacity into the chip by stacking NAND layers – called 3D NAND. But NAND is comparatively slow (100,000 times slower) at reading and writing compared to DRAM (volatile dynamic random access memory). Intel’s new 3D XPoint is a system that closes the gap between the two, being only 100x slower than DRAM. The Intel Optane system includes the 3D XPoint memory, new Intel memory and storage controllers, Intel Interconnect IP, and Intel software so it cannot be easily retrofitted to a PC or server. It will work with the 7th generation Intel Core and current Xeon server CPUs. It initially manifests itself as the Intel Optane 375GB SSD PC4800X and as Intel Optane 16 and 32GB M.2 and later DIMM Memory modules.  For example, using the Optane SSD as RAM (it has sufficiently low latency and high read/write capacity) is claimed to reduce the amount of RAM needed by 75% and increase speed and capacity by a factor of eight. But more importantly, it is claimed to add to traditional RAM, enabling huge databases to be stored and manipulated in memory. Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X – overview Initially, in a 375GB capacity AIC (add-in-card with PCIe 3.0 x 4, or NVMe slots), the capacity will quickly ramp up to 750GB in Q2 and 1.5TB in 2H, 2017. It will also become available in a U.2 format. An Intel spokesman said, “Delivering an industry-leading combination of low latency, ultra-endurance, high QoS, and high throughput, the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X Series is the most responsive data centre SSD. Built with the revolutionary new 3D XPoint memory media, the SSD DC P4800X is the first product to combine the attributes of memory and storage.” “This innovative solution is optimised to break through storage bottlenecks by providing a new data tier. It accelerates applications for fast caching and storage, increases scale per server, and reduces transaction costs for latency sensitive workloads. In addition, data centres can now also deploy bigger and more affordable datasets to gain new insights from large memory pools,” he added. It is claimed to be five to eight times faster at low queue depths (the normal state), 60 times better at 99% QoS, higher endurance, and 40 times more responsive under workload than a similar Intel SSD. Major storage makers including Dell/EMC, Lenovo, HPE, Nutanix and others will have Optane data centre solutions. Intel says the main use cases will be for fast storage, OS paging, and cache (reducing DRAM) and extending the memory pool where it could lead to increased transaction capacity from the same hardware and up to a 91% lower transaction cost. Data centres are claimed to see major benefits. Intel does not see it replacing slower SSD and HDD use cases.   Intel Optane memory Initially, it will come in 16GB and 32GB modules in the PCIe Gen 3.0x2, M.2 2880 format, and later DIMM format. This technology can be used by 7th generation Core processors or later. In a desktop sense, it will allow important files and frequently used applications to be executed from memory rather than off the hard disk. There are more than 130 Intel Optane ready 7th generation motherboards from ASUS, ASRock, etc., and most major systems manufacturers will have Optane-based systems.        HOW TOP MANAGERS MOTIVATE, ENERGISE EMPLOYEES Download an in-depth guide to managing a healthy, motivated and energetic workforce without breaking the bank.

Two pints a day keep heart problems at bay More like this Intel Data Center Storage Happy Motherboards day: Here's some (Optane) memory No benchmarks available from 2D launch of 3D XPoint memory Optane 2280 with M.2 connector 27 Mar 2017 at 16:00, Chris Mellor Hot on the heels of the Optane DC P4800X data centre SSD announcement, Intel makes a move on PC motherboard memory. Optane uses co-developed Intel and Micron 3D XPoint memory, said to be not as fast as DRAM, but faster than NAND, while having NAND's non-volatility and pricing between the two. The M.2-connected Optane 2280 comes in 16GB and 32GB guises and is for Intel's seventh-generation Core i7 processors (Kaby Lake). It is a single-sided device using 3D Xpoint media and has a PCIe Gen 3 x 2 interface; two lanes, not four. These two products were first revealed at the January CES show. It is used as a cache, via Intel's Rapid Storage Technology. Chipzilla says: "Files needed for important tasks are immediately recognised and accelerated. Over time, frequently used files and applications are monitored and accelerated as well." This will, Intel claims, "enhance the PC Experience". Intel says Optane Memory will boost PC app launch and file load events – without saying by how much – and is pushing the product to gamers who have a need for speed. However, no benchmark results have been released relating to boot, application launch or run times. That means we don't know how much faster an Optane-on-the-motherboard-equipped PC will be than a similar PC using M.2-connected flash memory. Obviously the Optane motherboard will be faster than a PC using disk drives with no Optane or flash caching but, duh, yeah, so what? Our understanding is that product reviews will come out on April 24 so anyone pre-ordering kit is buying on hope and not any sort of performance reality. Intel says there are more than 130 motherboards available that support Optane Memory, including ASRock, ASUS, EVGA, Gigabyte and MSI. In the second quarter we should see systems supporting Optane Memory from Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and others. Optane memory pre-orders start today with shipping commencing April 24. We haven't seen any pricing information yet so we neither know the bangs for bucks number or indeed the bangs number on its own. Hold fire for now. ® Tips and corrections 12 Comments More from The Register Intel touts bug bounties to hardware hackers Website and Intel Security (McAfee) products excluded from 'Wild West' payouts scheme 2 Comments Intel reveals Optane will need a 7th-gen core and a PC-centric launch You're going to need a whole lot of Intel Inside to make this work 16 Comments Regular or premium?

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT VIDEO Growing a career in tech at Intel Ireland by Connor McKenna 1 day ago100 Shares Once upon a time, Intel made half of the Pentium processors in the world. Now, the chip giant makes half of the world’s supply of 14-nanometre processors. What is it like working at a company so instrumentally involved in our connected future? Intel began operations at its plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare, in 1989. Now, more than 4,500 people work at the campus, designing and manufacturing many of the chips driving the connected world. The Leixlip campus is home to research teams, designers and engineers, with a team that is playing a major part in the growth of the internet of things and other emerging technologies. That’s all well and good on paper, but a job is about more than what you do – it’s about where you do it. We spoke to Intel’s internal communications specialist Aisling Flaherty, process engineer Bernadette Doherty and manufacturing technician Stephen Donohoe, and asked them what it’s like to work at the Leixlip plant. Intel is currently hiring for a number of open positions.

Andrew Cunningham - Mar 27, 2017 4:00 pm UTC reader comments 128 Share this story Intel's Optane Memory is a 16GB or 32GB drive that can serve as a fast cache for an HDD or SSD. Intel "Intel Optane Memory ready" motherboards are available already. You won't be able to add these drives to older systems. Intel Optane and 3D XPoint memory are designed to blur the line between memory and storage. These new consumer drives are really only about storage, though. Intel Further ReadingIntel’s first Optane SSD: 375GB that you can also use as RAM Intel is positioning its new Optane technology as the next big advancement in computer storage after SSDs, and today it's announcing the first consumer product based on the technology. The "Intel Optane Memory" drives are 16GB and 32GB M.2 sticks that can be paired with a larger SSD or HDD to speed up total system performance. Intel's Rapid Storage Technology allows your PC to see the two drives as one storage volume, and the software automatically caches important data to the faster drive. The Optane Memory drives will be available to order on April 24th. A 16GB drive costs $44 while a 32GB drive costs $77. To use the drives, your PC will need to be "Intel Optane memory ready," which at a bare minimum requires a 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPU, a new 200-series chipset, and a compatible B-M keyed M.2 2280 slot with either two or four PCI Express data lanes. The full requirements are laid out on this page, and your motherboard manufacturer's site should also be able to tell you more. If the Rapid Storage Technology caching setup sounds familiar to you, it's because Intel pushed it a few years ago as a way to ease the transition from large, cheap, and slow hard drives to small, expensive, and fast SSDs. As Optane matures, we may get to the point where it's possible to buy a drive that's large enough to use as your system's primary storage without paying more than you did for your computer (the 375GB server version of Optane currently costs a whopping $1,520), but for now the Optane Memory drives deliver some of the benefits of the technology without requiring too much extra cash. Further ReadingIntel and Micron unveil 3D XPoint, a brand new memory technology The server version of Optane, the 375GB Optane SSD DV P4800X, has a bunch of different potential applications, including the ability to be used as extra RAM; it isn't as fast as standard memory, but it takes up a lot less space and it's significantly cheaper. You could do that on these consumer Optane Memory drives in a roundabout way by using them for your computer's swap fie, but for now Intel is pushing them primarily as cache. We've written about Optane and its 3D XPoint memory a few times at this point, but the main thing you need to know is that Intel says it's faster than current SSDs and denser (albeit still slower) than DRAM. It's also designed to maintain better performance under load. Optane is intended to be much more durable than today's NAND flash SSDs, since write operations don't physically wear down the memory. Eventually, Intel will also sell Optane DIMMs designed to dramatically boost memory capacity in exchange for some speed; in time, the dividing line between fast-but-volatile DRAM and slower-but-non-volatile forms of storage like HDDs and SSDs could be eliminated entirely. Listing image by Intel Promoted Comments shelbystripes Ars Scholae Palatinae jump to post I think the problem here is, the HDD-SSD speed gap was enormous enough to justify SSD-as-cache (which worked as Intel's RST and Apple's Fusion drive); it made it easy to have the speed of SSDs when SSDs were still too expensive for primary storage. The performance delta there was huge, and you could actually notice the difference between hitting something cached to SSD vs stored on HDD. Here though, Intel is suggesting using Optane as a cache for larger SSDs. I just don't see the Optane-SSD gap being that large. I doubt it'll have a noticeable performance difference on consumer devices, anyway. Given how far SSD prices have fallen, if I'm building a system and I'm buying an SSD, I'd think it would be more worth it to put extra money into a larger/faster SSD than a cache module (and one that will eat an M.2 slot, no less). Until we see benchmarks, I'll be highly skeptical of this. Consumers are probably still better off investing extra dollars in getting the fastest SSD they can. If $70 means someone can get a 500GB 960 Evo instead of a cheaper 500GB SSD, that's probably a better performance investment than spending the $70 on this Optane cache. 1630 posts | registered 6/13/2013 Andrew Cunningham Andrew has a B.A. in Classics from Kenyon College and has over five years of experience in IT.

Do you want one for your Z270 motherboard? Probably. Read on and find out why. By: Jon Coulter | Editorials in Storage | Posted: 1 day, 3 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Intel Optane Memory Series   A New Storage Media     Intel Optane memory accelerates your system, delivering amazing speed and responsiveness without compromising system storage capacity. Together, Intel Optane memory and a 7th Gen Intel Core processor give you a snappy computer experience with short boot times, fast application launches, extraordinary gaming, and responsive browsing. Combine a large storage device with Intel Optane memory for a responsive computer that keeps up with your most demanding applications.   What Is Intel Optane Memory?     Intel calls their 3D XPoint technology "Optane." Optane consists of 3D XPoint memory, Intel memory and storage controllers, Intel interconnect IP, and Intel software. 3D XPoint memory is a joint venture between Intel and Micron (IMFT). The actual IP outside of the memory itself is separate proprietary technology. On a cellular level, 3D XPoint is 1000x faster and 1000x more enduring than NAND flash memory. In the real-world, actual performance is limited by bus performance.     "Optane Memory" is what Intel calls their Optane powered caching SSDs. The Optane Memory Module itself is a PCIe Gen3x2 single-sided 2280 SSD. It comes in two capacities, 16GB and 32GB. The 16GB model is set to retail for $44, the 32GB model $77. Optane Memory is designed to operate in conjunction with Intel Z270 motherboards, 7th Gen Intel Core i7 "Kaby Lake" processors and Intel's Rapid Storage Technology.     Top Purchase Drivers for Desktops     Desktop users rate the top three factors for purchasing as:   Performance Data security Storage capacity   Intel envisions most users pairing Optane Memory with high-capacity mechanical hard drives to deliver an intelligent solution that massively boosts system responsiveness and keeps high capacity storage costs to a minimum.     Pairing Optane Memory with a mechanical HDD gives you the best of both worlds. Extremely high capacity at a low cost per terabyte and unmatched performance. Intelligent System Acceleration: Intel Optane memory is a smart and adaptable system accelerator that adjusts to your computing tasks, making everything you do faster, smoother, easier. Intelligent software automatically learns your computing behaviors to accelerate frequent tasks and customize your computer experience.     With the increased speed and responsiveness of Intel Optane memory in a 7th Gen Intel Core-based system, you can power on your computer up to twice as fast and improve overall system performance up to 28% faster with storage performance up to 14x faster. Applications like Microsoft Outlook will launch up to 6x faster, the Chrome browser launches up to 5x faster, games launch up to 18% faster, and levels load up to 58% faster.     If you want even better overall system performance, you can pair Optane Memory with a high-capacity SATA SSD and eliminate the SATA interface read bottleneck.   Earlier this month, TweakTown was invited to get some hands-on with Optane Memory at Intel's site in Folsom California, and we can tell you without reservation that Optane Memory is a game changer. As long as what you are doing is accelerated by Optane Memory, it will be much more responsive than anything NAND-flash based SSDs have to offer.   Why is it so responsive?   Breakthrough Responsiveness: Optimize your computer responsiveness from system boot to application launch. A computer with a 7th Gen Intel Core processor and Intel Optane memory delivers amazing speed and responsiveness so you can wake your computer instantly, search and find files faster, and save large files in a flash.     The main reason Optane Memory is a game changer is its unparalleled low queue depth random read performance. As shown above, almost all read transactions occur at QD1 or QD2. Random read operations will typically be 70% of the overall transactions executed when you use your computer, and as such, it is by far the most important performance metric. Sequential performance matters, but overall it is insignificant compared to low queue random read performance in an OS environment because in an OS environment virtually all data is random.     Random read performance at low queue depths is where conventional flash-based SSDs are at their weakest and where performance matters most. Optane Memory delivers 5-8x the random performance of flash-based SSDs at queue depths of 1-4. In fact, as the above graph illustrates, Optane Memory is essentially delivering full performance at QD3. This is why we are calling Optane Memory a game changer.     Reliability: Created by Intel, one of the industry's most trusted technology innovators, this new class of non-volatile memory is backed by over 30 years of memory expertise and global leadership in technology innovation and processor manufacturing.   The Intel Optane Memory module will be available for pre-order today, and available through component retailers on April 24th.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Senate takes the wheel on Russia probe By Cory Bennett, Martin Matishak and Eric Geller 03/27/17 10:00 AM EDT INTEL LAWMAKERS TRY TO PICK UP THE PIECES — Members of the House Intelligence Committee are trying to move past the partisan warfare that has consumed their inquiry into Russia’s alleged election-year cyberattacks. But it’s clear that more time is needed before the divide is closed. “I think [Chairman Devin Nunes] has to make a decision, whether to act as a surrogate of the White House, as he did during the campaign and the transition, or to lead an independent and credible investigation,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee’s top Democrat, on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “I hope he chooses the latter.” The California Democrat said panel members are “all quite in the dark” about the evidence behind Nunes claims that members of the Trump transition team seem to have had their communications incidentally picked up during legal surveillance operations, and later had their identities revealed in intelligence reports. "I am totally mystified by what Mr. Nunes has said," said. Sen. Mark Warner, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s ranking member, who called it “fairly mystifying, if not outrageous” for Nunes to make his claim and then brief President Donald Trump before the rest of the committee. Story Continued Below All this means a gulf remains as the panel wrangles with bringing in former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and other Trump advisers, including Roger Stone and Carter Page, in to testify. Rep. Trey Gowdy, an Intelligence panel member, said he hasn’t been briefed on the evidence Nunes has, but thinks his trip to the White House was about something else. "The chairman of House Intel briefed the commander in chief on something that has nothing to do with the Russia investigation," he said. "So if the commander in chief cannot be briefed by the chairperson of the House Intel Committee on a matter that has nothing to do with the FBI investigation, then I don't know what they can talk about.” IN THE MEANTIME, LOOK TO THE SENATE — The rancor afflicting the House’s inquiry into Moscow’s election tampering has left lawmakers involved in the Senate’s investigation realizing they might be the only ones who can deliver findings free of outside political influence, Martin reports. “Trust me, I feel the — everybody on the committee feels — the responsibility to continue to try to do this right,” said Warner. While the upper chamber’s probe hasn’t been without controversy — in fact, Warner almost staged a walk-out with his fellow Democrats — senators believe they can retain a level of bipartisanship that will keep it free of the acrimony seen in the House. “I’m not concerned about their process, I’m concerned about mine,” Committee Chairman Richard Burr told reporters last week, touting his panel’s formula for conducting the investigation. Burr said he and Warner had “constructed” the plan “between the two of us, and there seems to be a great deal of trust in it.” Despite calls from some top House Democrats to take the investigation away from Nunes, Intelligence panel senators declined to say if the lower chamber can eventually churn out a credible product at the end of their inquiry. “They’re certainly going to have some rehab work to do,” according to Sen. Ron Wyden. HAPPY MONDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

Mike Rounds is targeting the upcoming Defense authorization bill as the most likely vehicle for legislation would authorize a $10 million scholarship program for college students pursuing cybersecurity degrees. Rounds, the South Dakota Republican who chairs the recently-created Senate Armed Services Committee cybersecurity subpanel, introduced the bill in March with Sen. Tim Kaine. “We’re trying to get not just a regular four-year degrees but two-year degrees in cybersecurity so that … we can get young, talented individuals who grew up with this to be involved and to recognize this as an opportunity to participate at the federal level in cybersecurity protection programs,” Rounds told Cory at a recent Q&A with POLITICO Pro subscribers. The senator mentioned that one of his home state schools, Dakota State University, has contracts with the NSA, making it a valuable vehicle for funnelling more young adults into government cybersecurity work. “These kids coming in from the central part of the United States don’t do a lot of travel, and it’s a lot easier to get a security clearance if you’re not traveling overseas on a regular basis,” Rounds said. “Second of all, if they’re there and if they can be brought in as security experts and be in a place where they want to live, then the chances of maintaining them in a position at the federal level is probably pretty good.” Cory talked further with Rounds after the Q&A about cyber provisions in the next Defense authorization bill. Check out the interview highlights here and here. ENERGY EXECS, TRUMP OFFICIALS TALK CYBER — Senior Trump administration officials including Secretary of Energy Rick Perry met last week with executives from electric power companies to discuss digital threat information sharing and how to protect the grid from cyberattacks. The CEOs, all members of the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, wanted to “make sure that there was an effective passing of the torch” between the Obama and Trump administrations, Scott Aaronson, the council’s secretary, told MC in an interview. “We wanted to bring the leadership of the coordinating council in to continue to impress upon this new administration that, if you want to talk to ‘the electric sector,’ here are the people to talk to,” said Aaronson, the executive director of security and business continuity at the Edison Electric Institute. Energy company CEOs expressed support for the Trump administration’s forthcoming executive order, which is expected to call out the need for a special focus on the electric sector. “We are some of the nation’s most critical infrastructure, and we support President Trump and a cyber executive order pointing out that our sector is particularly critical to the life, health and safety of Americans,” Aaronson said. “We welcome the opportunity to partner with the government to both assess preparedness of the sector and the government and to work together to improve security.” The CEOs, he added, appreciated Perry’s comments about securing critical infrastructure and public-private partnerships. In addition to Perry, Trump administration officials at the meetings included John Daly, the acting deputy homeland security adviser at the White House; Bob Kolasky, the acting deputy under secretary for the Department of Homeland Security’s National Protection and Programs Directorate; Cheryl LaFleur, the acting chairwoman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and Joseph McClelland, the director of FERC’s Office of Energy Infrastructure Security. The ESCC members had previously met with Obama officials and Trump transition team members in November, and last Wednesday’s meetings “were a continuation of that,” said Aaronson. ENCRYPTION AT PLAY IN LONDON KILLINGS — The man who killed four people during a terror attack in London last week used WhatsApp to send an encrypted message before launching his rampage, British Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Sunday. In interviews with Sky News and the BBC, Rudd joined a long-running crusade against unbreakable encryption also championed by her counterparts in France and Germany. “We need to make sure that organizations like WhatsApp — and there are plenty of others like that — don’t provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other,” she said. A December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., prompted a similar outcry against locked communications in the U.S., with FBI Director James Comey leading the charge. Rudd, who will meet with tech executives this week, said she hoped to convince critics of so-called encryption “backdoors” that they were necessary. “These people have families, have children as well,” said Rudd. “They should be on our side, and I’m going to try to win that argument.” But critics pounced on her comments as the latest example of government surveillance overreach. “These terrorists want to destroy our freedoms and undermine our democratic society,” said Brian Paddick, the domestic security spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, Britain’s leading opposition party. “By implementing draconian laws that limit our civil liberties, we would playing into their hands.” THE ABCs OF MILITARY CYBER OPS — The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service is out with a new primer on military cyberspace operations. The two-page explainer delves into the role of U.S. Cyber Command and Cyber Mission Force, the 133 teams that are organized into three categories designed to meet the Defense Department’s cyber missions. The primer also highlights the roles of other DoD components, like the NSA, as well as the duties of the Homeland Security Department, the other major federal player in the digital domain. LAWMAKER LEAKED INFO DURING HEARING? — A Republican congressman reportedly divulged classified information about the intelligence community’s Russian hacking assessment during last week’s open House Intelligence Committee hearing. As he questioned FBI Director James Comey at the hearing, Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, criticized the January report for making a dubious claim. “Indicating that historically Russians have supported Republicans — and I know that language is there — to me puts somewhat of a cloud over the entire report,” King told Comey. But that judgment does not appear in the unclassified version of the report, meaning it could only have appeared in the highly sensitive version briefed to members of Congress. “Democrats told me that there was, at this point, a minor commotion on the dais,” The New Yorker reported. Two Democratic sources told The New Yorker that the judgment about Russia’s party preference prompted “a significant fight” at a recent classified briefing for lawmakers on the report’s contents. One House Intelligence Committee Democrat told magazine, “I was really taken aback that it came up in the hearing.” King, who confirmed that Republicans pushed back during the closed briefing, said he considered the judgment to be evidence the report was biased. REMEMBER US? — A spate of cyberattacks on Polish banks reveals the growing sophistication of North Korea’s hacker army, digital security experts told The New York Times in a story published over the weekend. Cyber defenders who analyzed the malicious code in the Poland hacks — most of which were unsuccessful — discovered indicators that North Korea was planning similar strikes on the World Bank and large American financial institutions. U.S. targets included Bank of America and the Bank of New York Mellon. The target list embedded in the malware shows “how North Korea, a country that is cut off from much of the global economy, is increasingly trying to use its cyberattack abilities to bring in cash — and making progressively bolder attempts to do so,” the Times reported. Symantec researchers also used forensic evidence to link the Polish bank hacks to the intrusions into Sony Pictures and the Bangladesh Bank, the latter of which resulted in the theft of $81 million. Justice Department prosecutors are investigating North Korea’s role in the Bangladesh hack. NICE LEAKS YOU’VE GOT THERE — A senior Russian government spokesperson suggested late last week that the Kremlin might begin leaking unfavorable information about the United States to counter a tide of Russia-related leaks. “If the practice of leaking information that concerns not just the United States but also Russia … continues, there will come a day when the media will publish leaks about the things that Washington asked us to keep secret, for example, things that happened during President Obama’s terms in office,” said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova in a briefing. “Believe me, this could be very interesting information.” Foreign policy experts interpreted Zakharova’s comments as an attempt to deter more of the leaks that have rocked Trump’s early months in office. The remarks came the same weekend that Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted anti-immigration and anti-European Union French politician Marine LePen, a leading candidate in the upcoming French election. LePen’s main rival, Emmanuel Macron, has accused the Kremlin of trying to hack his campaign and of fueling internet rumors about him being gay. TWEET OF THE DAY — I’ll take “How to End Up in a Former Soviet Gulag” for $500, Alex. RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY — Trump adviser Roger Stone again denied “contacts or collusions” with Russian operatives … House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes canceled an open hearing with Obama appointee witnesses … Republican lawmakers told agency heads that leaks are jeopardizing the reauthorization of key surveillance powers … The treasury secretary touted cyber as a key risk to financial firms. QUICK BYTES — “The U.S. government has not figured out how to deter the Russians from meddling in democratic processes, and stopping their interference in elections, both here and in Europe, is a pressing problem, the top civilian leader of the National Security Agency said.” The Washington Post. — Behind the scenes on Nunes’ controversial remarks to the press. The Washington Post. — Democrats are increasingly calling Russia’s alleged election interference an act of war. The Hill. — The Electronic Privacy Information Center submitted Freedom of Information Act requests related to witnesses scheduled to testify at this week’s canceled House Intelligence hearing. — The plans of the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace. Nextgov. — An Illinois Department of Employment Security vender was hacked, and 1.4 million job seekers are affected. Associated Press. — Chrome vs. Symantec, round whatever. CyberScoop. — Google reminded folk how its government-backed hacker warning works. Recode. — The dawn of U.S. spying on enemy militaries and political communications. Motherboard. — “Air Force ROTC cadets visit DISA, receive mission overview.” — Troy Hunt on the world’s MOST PROLIFIC HACKER. That’s all for today.

SMCI, -1.58% a global leader in compute, storage and networking technologies including green computing, announces a new Rack Scale Design (RSD) solution that empowers cloud service providers, telecoms, and Fortune 500 companies to build their own agile, efficient, software-defined data centers. Supermicro RSD is a total solution comprised of Supermicro server/storage/networking hardware and an optimized rack level management software that represents a superset of the open source RSD software framework from Intel® and industry standard Redfish RESTful APIs developed by DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force). Supermicro RSD solves the hardware management and resource utilization challenges of data centers, large or small, often with tens of thousands of servers distributed in hundreds of racks using traditional 1-to-1 server management tool IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface). Designed with the whole rack as the new management unit in mind, Supermicro RSD leverages open Redfish APIs to support composable infrastructure and enable interoperability among potential RSD offerings from different vendors. With industry standard Redfish APIs, Supermicro RSD can be further integrated into data center automation software such as Ansible, Puppet or private cloud software such as OpenStack or VMware. Supermicro RSD rack level management software is based on the Intel® RSD framework, which provides the scale and efficiency for cloud operators to perform operations such as pooling and composability, in addition to the necessary telemetry and maintenance functions of the pod (a collection of racks) to manage allocated resources in a large scale data center environment. Users can provision, manage and power-on the composed node as if it were one physical node. When the task is complete, the user simply deletes the composed node to return the resource to the pools for other workloads. A unique advantage Supermicro RSD solution offers is that it does not require purpose-built new hardware. In fact, the Supermicro RSD solution runs on all existing X10 (Broadwell) generation as well as new X11 generation server, storage and networking hardware. Furthermore, Supermicro MicroBlade offers a future-proof, disaggregated hardware that allows customers to independently refresh compute module (CPU + memory) hardware while keeping the remaining server investment intact resulting in substantial savings and flexibility.   "Supermicro RSD makes it easy for companies of any size to build cloud infrastructure that until now are limited to leading large public and private cloud providers," said Charles Liang, President and CEO of Supermicro. "The Supermicro RSD solution enables more customers to build large scale modern data centers leveraging Supermicro's best-of-breed server, storage and networking product portfolio." "The launch of Supermicro's platform, incorporating Intel® Rack Scale Design, brings open, industry standards-based, hyperscale-inspired capabilities such as resource discovery, composability and telemetry to cloud, communications and enterprise data centers," said Charlie Wuischpard, General Manager of Intel's Scalable Data Center Solutions Group. "Supermicro's solution, based on Intel® RSD, enables flexible, economical solutions for data centers, supported by Intel architecture and technologies." Supermicro RSD software includes the following components: Pod Manager (PodM):  A pod is a collection of physical racks. Pod Manager sits at the top of the logical software hierarchy and uses Redfish API to communicate with the racks that make up the pod. It manages and aggregates the hardware resources within multiple racks in the Pod by polling respective PSMEs and RMMs Rack Management Module (RMM):  RMM manages power and thermal resources within a rack by polling rack hardware and reports this information to PodM through Redfish API Pooled System Management Engine (PSME): PSME acts as the drawer or chassis manager. PSME communicates with each BMC controller in the drawer/chassis and reports aggregated information such as telemetry and asset information through Redfish API to PodM  Web UI is a browser based graphical user interface that simplifies the management of RSD A minimum Supermicro RSD hardware configuration includes the following components: A 1U management appliance that bundles all RSD related software or a software only distribution Two Supermicro 1G management switches for connecting the baseboard management controllers (BMC) One Supermicro data switch Supermicro's broad X10 and X11 server portfolio. Popular server choices include but are not limited to TwinPro, BigTwin, FatTwin, MicroBlade, SuperBlade and GPU servers Popular Storage Choices include: 2U Ultra with 24 NVMe drives as hot storage, 2U SSG with 24 SAS drives as warm storage 45Bay, 60 bay or 90 bay JBODs as cold storage.  For more information on Supermicro's complete range of rack scale design solutions, please visit https://www.supermicro.com/solutions/SRSD.cfm.

Acer’s S 13 makes the case for the inexpensive ultrabook worth having Posted Mar 23, 2017 by Stefan Etienne (@stefanetienne) 0 SHARES Next Story Samsung is aiming to widen access to contactless payments Acer has made a lot of ultrabooks, but the only one worth mentioning is the current S 13. Priced aggressively even for the “high-end” model, as configured, it sports a slim profile, backlit keys and a Core i7 processor. Acer is taking the perks of owning a pricier machine and making them more accessible, creating an ultrabook that’s a good value without a ton of compromises. Video At a Glance Intel Core i7-6500U, dual-core 2.50GHz (turbo 3.1GHz) 13.3″ full HD (1080p) IPS matte touchscreen Intel HD Graphics 520 with shared memory 8GB LPDDR3 RAM 512GB SSD Dimensions: 12.87 ” (w), 8.98″ (d), 0.57″ (h) 3-cell battery with 13 hours of usage Weighs three pounds Is Using A Cheap Ultrabook Worth The Sacrifice? Looking at the Acer S 13 from an aesthetics point-of-view, the lack of eye candy can be attributed to price and less so lack of ingenuity from Acer. It feels better to hold than to look at it, to be quite honest. This holds true from just about every angle. You often trade specs for design quality, or vice versa in the case of the new MacBooks. Fortunately, Acer hasn’t built a car without doors: the S 13 does a solid by remaining slim and sporting specs that are hard to dismiss as entry-level. The brain of this ultrabook is the Core i7-6500U, still a reliable and usable processor despite being a year old — but I’ll point out this is the same generation of Intel processors in the current Touchbar MacBook Pros. For everyday usage this means productivity apps like Office or editing apps like Photoshop, Lightroom and the like run without a hitch. In one case, I did find that batch editing took its toll and made the rest of the Windows environment feel less fluid, but that’s to be expected You aren’t going to be able to run an entertainment company from a dual-core processor from last year, but you can (mostly) do everything else. DSC_0023 DSC_0002 DSC_0036 DSC_0011 DSC_0030 DSC_0016 DSC_0040 DSC_0052  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Regarding aesthetics, if you do some research (or look closely in-person) you find out the lid, keyboard and palm rest are made from aluminum, with a lithography imprint that creates its textured feel and appearance. Even the underside is made of a magnesium-aluminum alloy. Still, Acer deciding not to go with an all-plastic build for the “cheap feel” is one of the highlights of this ultrabook. It certainly does look better in black though, an option available with the same internals. Let’s talk inputs and outputs: the keyboard and touchpad are the weakest points about the S 13, but they aren’t deal breakers. The keys have enough travel for you to get comfortable with understanding your keystrokes. The touchpad, while accurate, is on the small side and oddly offset to the left. Not sure why, but I’ll find out. Port selection includes the essentials: an SD card slot, two USB 3.0 ports, a USB-C, proprietary charging port, audio jack and HDMI-out. You’ve got enough ports to shoot photos on the run without dongles, an advantage that you’ll have over your friends with their Touchbar MacBook Pros. As for the speakers: get headphones; you won’t be impressing anyone with the stereo audio package. Meanwhile the battery will net you a solid five hours of heavy usage with numbers close to seven if you avoid using Bluetooth, high brightness and more than one app at the same time. Bottom Line So what’s in store if you buy an Acer S 13? Well, you will get a fair trade for your thousand dollars — a good mix of ample processing power, port selection and physical integrity. The Acer S 13 really is in the Goldilocks zone in Windows ultrabook territory. It performs well and can be someone’s daily driver. While it’s not an interesting pick like the Surface Book, Blade Stealth or Dell XPS 13, they all require a higher budget. Your call.

All VerticalsThe Boardroom Back to Home Former Intel CIO to lead Lenovo data centre business Increase / Decrease text size Byomakesh Biswal   - Senior Reporter 27th March 2017 Add to favorites The Chinese PC-maker is planning to increase its market share of its data centre business. Chinese PC-maker Lenovo has hired former Intel CIO Kim Stevenson to head its newly formed data centre business units. The newly formed business units will help Lenovo enter five market segments which include data centre infrastructure, software-defined data centers, ‘hyperscale’ systems, data center services, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence applications. These new units will each be led by a general manager who will develop offerings and go-to-market strategies and will take the responsibility of the entire business from end-to-end. Kim Stevenson Kim Stevenson will be the senior vice president and general manger of the new Data Center Infrastructure (DCI) business segment. Stevenson will lead Lenovo’s core data centre products and solutions portfolio. The company plans to leverage her several years of experience at Intel. She has worked for eight years at Intel’s Client, Internet of Things and System Architecture (CISA) Group and also served as the company’s CIO for four years. Prior to Intel, Stevenson worked as EDS Worldwide Communications, Media and Entertainment (CM&E) Industry Practice vice president. Apart from Stevenson, Lenovo has also promoted its own executives to new positions in the Data Centre Group’s senior leadership team. The appointments include: Paul Ju as the vice president and general manager of Hyperscale; Madhu Matta as vice president and general manager of high-performance computing and artificial intelligence applications; Radhika Krishnan, executive director and general manager of software-defined data centre; and data centre services will be led by the present vice president and general manager Laura Latrell. Lenovo Data Center Group president Kirk Skaugen said: “Kim is a widely respected and highly accomplished technology leader, and we’re honored to have her join our team. “Her decision demonstrates our ability to attract the industry’s best talent in our drive to build an innovative and fiercely competitive data center company. “In addition, our new segment-driven structure and global sales and marketing organization will enable us to be even more dynamic and responsive in helping our customers navigate today’s volatile technology and business landscape.” With this move, Lenovo is expecting to revive revenue. The company saw its share prices drop 67% in 2016, while the revenues from the Data Center Group fell 20% when compared to 2015.

Go to Search More news New Supermicro RSD brings open management for on-demand cloud scale data centers Press Releases March 27, 12:00 UTC+3 Supermicro RSD empowers data center operators with agility, maximum utilization and future-proof infrastructure Share 1 pages in this article SAN JOSE, California, March 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI), a global leader in compute, storage and networking technologies including green computing, announces a new Rack Scale Design (RSD) solution that empowers cloud service providers, telecoms, and Fortune 500 companies to build their own agile, efficient, software-defined data centers. Supermicro RSD is a total solution comprised of Supermicro server/storage/networking hardware and an optimized rack level management software that represents a superset of the open source RSD software framework from Intel® and industry standard Redfish RESTful APIs developed by DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force). Supermicro RSD solves the hardware management and resource utilization challenges of data centers, large or small, often with tens of thousands of servers distributed in hundreds of racks using traditional 1-to-1 server management tool IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface). Designed with the whole rack as the new management unit in mind, Supermicro RSD leverages open Redfish APIs to support composable infrastructure and enable interoperability among potential RSD offerings from different vendors. With industry standard Redfish APIs, Supermicro RSD can be further integrated into data center automation software such as Ansible, Puppet or private cloud software such as OpenStack or VMware. Supermicro RSD rack level management software is based on the Intel® RSD framework, which provides the scale and efficiency for cloud operators to perform operations such as pooling and composability, in addition to the necessary telemetry and maintenance functions of the pod (a collection of racks) to manage allocated resources in a large scale data center environment. Users can provision, manage and power-on the composed node as if it were one physical node. When the task is complete, the user simply deletes the composed node to return the resource to the pools for other workloads. A unique advantage Supermicro RSD solution offers is that it does not require purpose-built new hardware. In fact, the Supermicro RSD solution runs on all existing X10 (Broadwell) generation as well as new X11 generation server, storage and networking hardware. Furthermore, Supermicro MicroBlade offers a future-proof, disaggregated hardware that allows customers to independently refresh compute module (CPU + memory) hardware while keeping the remaining server investment intact resulting in substantial savings and flexibility.   "Supermicro RSD makes it easy for companies of any size to build cloud infrastructure that until now are limited to leading large public and private cloud providers," said Charles Liang, President and CEO of Supermicro. "The Supermicro RSD solution enables more customers to build large scale modern data centers leveraging Supermicro's best-of-breed server, storage and networking product portfolio." "The launch of Supermicro's platform, incorporating Intel® Rack Scale Design, brings open, industry standards-based, hyperscale-inspired capabilities such as resource discovery, composability and telemetry to cloud, communications and enterprise data centers," said Charlie Wuischpard, General Manager of Intel's Scalable Data Center Solutions Group. "Supermicro's solution, based on Intel® RSD, enables flexible, economical solutions for data centers, supported by Intel architecture and technologies." Supermicro RSD software includes the following components: Pod Manager (PodM):  A pod is a collection of physical racks. Pod Manager sits at the top of the logical software hierarchy and uses Redfish API to communicate with the racks that make up the pod. It manages and aggregates the hardware resources within multiple racks in the Pod by polling respective PSMEs and RMMs Rack Management Module (RMM):  RMM manages power and thermal resources within a rack by polling rack hardware and reports this information to PodM through Redfish API Pooled System Management Engine (PSME): PSME acts as the drawer or chassis manager. PSME communicates with each BMC controller in the drawer/chassis and reports aggregated information such as telemetry and asset information through Redfish API to PodM  Web UI is a browser based graphical user interface that simplifies the management of RSD A minimum Supermicro RSD hardware configuration includes the following components: A 1U management appliance that bundles all RSD related software or a software only distribution Two Supermicro 1G management switches for connecting the baseboard management controllers (BMC) One Supermicro data switch Supermicro's broad X10 and X11 server portfolio. Popular server choices include but are not limited to TwinPro, BigTwin, FatTwin, MicroBlade, SuperBlade and GPU servers Popular Storage Choices include: 2U Ultra with 24 NVMe drives as hot storage, 2U SSG with 24 SAS drives as warm storage 45Bay, 60 bay or 90 bay JBODs as cold storage.  For more information on Supermicro's complete range of rack scale design solutions, please visit https://www.supermicro.com/solutions/SRSD.cfm.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File) YERUSHALAYIM - The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating two Israelis whom it believes violated insider trading rules in the recent takeover of Mobileye by Intel. The SEC has filed an indictment against the two for acting on information that Intel was set to complete the deal before an official announcement was made, enabling them to profit unfairly from insider knowledge. The two are accused of using contacts they had in Mobileye, via their association with Hebrew University, where much of the research and development for the road safety system was conducted, and which still has strong ties to the company. They bought shares in Mobileye the day before the announcement, when share prices jumped 28 percent, in response to the offer made by Intel for Mobileye shares that were about $20 over their stock market price. One of the two is a professor at Hebrew University, and the other is an independent contractor who works with the school. A Manhattan judge ordered the assets of the two in the United States frozen pending a decision. Neither had any comment on the matter. Neither MobilEye nor Intel are principals in the case, and neither had any comment on the matter either, Globes reported.   Filed under: Crime, SEC Print Email Gmail Related SEC Charges Chinese Investor With Insider Trading in Comcast-DreamWorks Animation Deal Mobileye Shares Tumble in Row with Tesla New Challenge for Struggling Dollar: ‘Mobileye Effect’ $15B Mobileye Deal a Windfall for the State and for Taxpayers Minister: Mobileye to Be Required on All New Cars More in Israel Nazareth Arab Transferred Money From Israel to IS VP Pence Revives Talk of U.S. Moving Embassy to Yerushalayim Israeli Courts to Charge for Class Action Suits Dermer: “No Daylight” Israel Builds Despite Security Council Resolution OP-ED Time for Kurdish Independence?

Alyson Griffin, vice president of global marketing at Intel Corp., spoke with eMarketer’s Maria Minsker about why social content is crucial not only for driving clicks, but also for positioning the technology company as a go-to source in emerging fields like artificial intelligence and virtual reality. eMarketer: How does Intel leverage social media to reach its B2B customers? Alyson Griffin: We want to meet our audiences where they are, with the right content. Whether they are in a leaned-in mindset and actively looking for content, or they’re in a more leaned-back mindset, we want to make valuable content easily accessible and discoverable to our audiences. We also want to meet them with the right content wherever they sit within the buying decision committee, whether they are a technology decision-maker, senior business decision-maker or line-of-business influencer. Finally, we want to meet them where they are in their buying journey, with content they will find valuable at [that stage]. eMarketer: How is paid social media advertising integrated with organic marketing tactics at Intel? Griffin: We rarely run [traditional display] ads on social media, because we find people just don’t engage with them in the social feed. We consider paid social posts to be a method to reach the right audience with the right content. Whether it’s paid or organic, it has to be good content that’s built specifically for the platform, or people will tune out. Organic [social] marketing still serves a purpose for us, but it has changed. We look at it as a way to test what people are engaging with, and help us determine where we should be investing with paid social. “Companies can’t be complacent because [social] platforms are constantly changing, and the way people use them is constantly changing.” eMarketer: What social networks are you most focused on? Griffin: We use a variety of channels including LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. With social, companies can’t be complacent because the platforms are constantly changing, and the way people use them is constantly changing. We’re always evaluating and testing. We look at our audiences and determine where they spend their time and how they use the networks. We build our strategies [around] that. eMarketer: What are your goals for social media marketing? Griffin: All of our social media activity ladders up to business objectives. From a business standpoint, we want people to open their minds about what Intel is, beyond just thinking of us as a chipmaker. We understand that business is now moving at an incredible pace, and our customers are thinking about how things like cloud, 5G, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and autonomous vehicles will disrupt and transform industries. That’s why we need to have conversations on social that give our customers confidence that we have what they need to stay ahead of the next wave. We also know our customers have business challenges they need to solve today that may not be as buzzworthy as something like autonomous vehicles, but are critical to their business. We need to make sure we’re having those conversations as well. “We need to provide something of value in the [social] feed, even if someone doesn’t click through to our owned properties.” eMarketer: How do you measure success? Griffin: To determine whether we’re moving the needle, we look at a mix of attitudinal and behavioral metrics. eMarketer: As a distribution channel for content, how do you harness social networks to reach your audience? What type of content works best? Griffin: Social media is an important channel for content distribution. Through our analysis of conversion attribution data on our owned properties, we know that social is an important part of the mix and can be a strong traffic driver. With that said, we understand people often don’t want to leave the social feed. We need to provide something of value in the feed, even if someone doesn’t click through to our owned properties. If it’s valuable and interesting, they will consume it in the feed and share it with their own networks. That’s a win. The types of content that perform best vary a lot by social platform, but video has been a winner for us across multiple platforms.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 IMac: Rumors, Features, Release, Price And Everything You Need To Know Posted: Mar 27 2017, 1:22am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Apple     Apple is expected to release a new iMac in 2017. The last time Apple updated the iMac was in 2015. Apple is expected to release a new iMac in 2017 as early as the WWDC 2017 in June. There is not really evidence that this is going to happen, but the anticipation grows. If you are a developer and want to have a chance to witness the unveil of the 2017 iMac live during the WWDC 2017 keynote, you need to register for WWDC tickets today at 10am PDT. Don't Miss: Enter the I4U News Nintendo Switch Giveaway! Apple has been under fire for neglecting the desktop for a while now. Microsoft used Apple's moment of weakness in a perfect way. The Surface Studio makes the iMac look like ancient technology. Microsoft in a way is helping Apple iMac fans to get a new iMac sooner than later. The new 2017 iMac needs to be innovative in design and functionality to match Microsoft's stunning device. 2017 iMac Features We can take some pointers from the new MacBook Pro that Apple release end of 2016. Apple might introduce the Touch Bar in the 2017 iMac. Apple has patented the integration of the OLED touch screen on standalone keyboards. LG already said in 2015 that Apple is coming out with an iMac featuring an Retina 8K display. This of course did not happen. One thing that Apple is fond of is though resolution. An iMac Retina 8K is technically possible. The 8K resolution would also allow Apple to give the iMac a bigger screen option. How does a 34" iMac with 8K Display, Core i7 sound? The new iMac will adopt USB-C like the MacBook Pro. This change requires to get new adapters for your peripherals and has already caused a ruckus at the launch of the 2016 MacBook Pro.  The are some rumors floating around that Apple would adopt the new AMD CPU Ryzon, replacing Intel. This is not very likely, but possible as Apple uses AMD GPUs in the iMac. Intel started to ship the new 7th Generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core i7 (i7-7700) Processors. The new iMac could adopt the new top of the line Intel Desktop CPUs. 3D is exploding in a big way on Windows 10 this spring. Virtual Reality is driving 3D creation, but Apple has so far no solution for this new big trend. The next iMac ideally would have powerful graphics to drive a virtual reality headset. Right now creative companies have to get a Windows Gaming PC to use an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Apple is rumored to work on an augmented reality solution. That is though likely only for the iPhone. 2017 iMac Release Date At this point it is just guessing. April is a possibility for Apple's first event in 2017. Another option is the WWDC 2017, kicking off on June 5. The WWDC kicks off with a keynote that usually brings new Apple hardware. The new iMac requires a media event. WWDC 2017 is the perfect stage for a new iMac reveal. Apple just unveiled a bunch of new products including a new iPad and iPhone SE on March 21. The iPhone Plus Red went on sale on March 24. 2017 iMac Price The Microsoft Surface Studio is $800 more expensive in the top configuration than any iMac currently available. The new iMac prices could match Microsoft's prices for the top configuration. The lower end iMac models will likely be priced the same or drop slightly. The 2015 iMac starts at $1,099. The most expensive iMac configurable on apple.com has a price of $3,999. iMac deals are available on amazon.com. Should I Wait to Buy a new iMac? We recommend to hold off with the purchase of a new iMac until at least WWDC 2017. If Apple is not releasing the 2017 iMac in June, the release will be in fall. Apple will not launch the new iMac during the summer. Registration for the WWDC 2017 tickets opens Monday, March 27 at 10:00 a.m. PDT. The opportunity to buy tickets to WWDC17 will be offered by random selection. To register, you must be a member of the Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program. What is the iMac? In Apple's words: "The idea behind iMac has never wavered: to craft the ultimate desktop experience. The best display, paired with high-performance processors, graphics, and storage — all within an incredibly thin, seamless enclosure. And that commitment continues with the all-new 21.5‑inch iMac with Retina 4K display. Like the revolutionary 27‑inch 5K model, it delivers such spectacular image quality that everything else around you seems to disappear. Adding up to the most immersive iMac experience yet — and another big, beautiful step forward." The iMac is the perfect desktop machine, but it is time for new power, new design, and bigger and better screen. Read the latest Apple News.

Thanks to the brightest minds in Silicon Valley, however, they're rapidly becoming science fact. Google is nearing the final stages of testing for its autonomous car programme, Tesla drivers can enjoy an 'Autopilot' feature for hassle-free motorway driving, and Pittsburgh residents can hail an Uber that drives itself. But how do driverless cars work? Are they safe? When can we expect to try one out for ourselves? We answer all these questions, and more, below. Latest news 28/03/2017: Uber's San Francisco-based driverless car trials are back online following a short pause after one of its vehicles crashed in Arizona last week. “We are resuming our development operations in San Francisco this morning,” an Uber spokeswoman told TechCrunch yesterday morning. However, its Arizona and Pittsburgh-based trials will remain grounded until the company can investigate properly what went wrong when another car allegedly ploughed into the automated vehicle, knocking it over. Although Uber's cars can be driven without a driver, they all have manual controls built in too, so a human can take over when required. It would seem there was not enough time for the driver to take over and avoid the accident in Arizona, although it's still under investigation. TechCrunch explained that the cars used in the taxi firm's Californian trials are newer and therefore safer to drive. It's thought the trials in Pittsburgh and Arizona will resume ometime in the future, but Uber hasn't said when it's likely to happen yet. 27/03/2017: One of Uber's driverless vehicles has crashed during testing in the US, the company has confirmed. Pictures and a video of the incident were distributed on Twitter via @FrescoNews, where the source explained the accident happened in Tempe, Arizona, and no one was injured during the crash. "BREAKING: Self-driving Uber vehicle on it’s side after a collision in Tempe, AZ. Photos by @fresconews user Mark Beach," the news site said, followed by: "#UPDATE: No injuries yet reported in an accident involving a self-driving #uber, captured by @fresconews user Mark Beach in Tempe, AZ." Another source, local newspaper ABC15, said a normal passenger-operated car didn't stop for the automated vehicle and hit it. Uber's self-driving SUV fell on its side, witnesses said, and the driver of the manned car was given a talking to by police. There was a human behind the wheel and although initial reports said there was someone in the back of the autonomous car, Uber later said this wasn't the case. “We are continuing to look into this incident and can confirm we had no backseat passengers in the vehicle," Uber confirmed to TechCrunch in a statement. Uber has since paused its driverless cars trial programme in Arizona, but the company hasn't said how long for or whether schemes in other parts of the US have ground to a halt too. This is the second incident an Uber self-driving car has been involved in. The previous crash happened in California last December, when one of its vehicles failed to stop at a red light. 15/03/2017:  Intel has announced a $15.3 billion (£12.5 billion) proposal to acquire Jerusalem-based technology firm Mobileye, developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. The two companies have been collaborating alongside BMW since last year on a project aiming to produce driverless cars by 2021. Mobileye makes software and camera sensors for driverless cars, selling to companies such as General Motors, Nissan, and Hyundai. Intel said the acquisition expands its strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that strengthen the company’s computing and connectivity capabilities.  According to Intel, the driverless technology market could be worth up to $70 billion by 2030, and the acquisition of Mobileye gives it a major boost in the autonomous driving race. “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” said Mobileye CEO, President and Co-Founder, Ziv Aviram. He explained that by merging the infrastructure and resources of the two companies, their combined knowledge in areas like virtual driving, simulators, and hardware can be enhanced. “Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry,” Aviram added. The acquisition is not only a step-up for Intel, but it’s also groundbreaking for the Israeli tech industry. The deal marks the largest-ever purchase of high-tech Israeli technology, significantly surpassing the previous record-holding deal of $4.7 billion paid by Lucent Technologies for Chromatis Networks in 2000. 14/03/2017: California's Department of Motor Vehicles has revealed it is looking at allowing driverless car manufacturers to test their vehicles without a human driver in the front seat. "Since the adoption of the current testing regulations, the capabilities of autonomous technology has proceeded to the point where manufacturers have developed systems that re capable of operating without the presence of a driver inside the vehicle," the proposal explained. "The department is amending Article 3.7 to include the testing of vehicles that do not require the presence of a driver inside the vehicle and ensure the testing of such vehicles is conducted on California public roads in a safe manner." Companies wanting to trial their cars without a driver inside must apply for a new type of licence -  Manufacturer's Testing Permit -Driverless Vehicles. The governmental organisation said it has changed its view towards autonomous vehicles to promote the development of autonomous technology that will lead to safer driving practices, it explained. "These rules expand our existing autonomous vehicle testing programme to include testing vehicles where no driver is present," said Jean Shiomoto, director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles. "This is the next step in eventually allowing driverless autonomous vehicles on California roadways." The department has invited the public to out forward their arguments for and against allowing such vehicles to be tested on the road, minus a driver. Written comments can be submitted until 24 April. 03/03/2017: After being driven out of San Francisco for failing to secure a testing permit, Uber has announced it will now cooperate with California regulators as it seeks to restart its driverless car trials in the state. California's Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed to Reuters that it had held discussions with Uber to assist the application process for a self-driving permit, something that Uber originally claimed was unnecessary. Uber launched its self-driving pilot programme in San Francisco last December without state permission, arguing that because its cars were not fully autonomous and required "active physical control or monitoring", they did not meet state requirements for the $150 permit. The state DMV, however, disagreed, arguing that not only did Uber fail to seek the correct permits, but also failed to properly mark their fleet as test vehicles. It also pointed to the number of other companies operating self-driving cars in the state, including Google, Tesla and Ford, who had all correctly secured testing permits. As a result, the DMV revoked the registrations of 16 Uber vehicles, only one week into the trial, with the threat of further legal action if they continued to test. Uber has since relocated those test vehicles to Arizona, where the company has received a warm welcome from Republican state governor Doug Ducey, but has reapplied for permission to test vehicles in California. An Uber spokesperson said in a statement to IT Pro: "These cars are legally registered and are being driven manually. We are taking steps to complete our application to apply for a DMV testing permit. As we said in December, Uber remains 100% committed to California." It comes just says after the firm's CEO, Travis Kalanick, said he needed to "grow up" and seek leadership advice. 24/02/2017: Alphabet's Waymo — Google's self-driving car project — has sued Uber, accusing it of stealing 14,000 files to copy its sensing tech. Waymo said Uber and the autonomous trucking firm Otto, which Uber bought last year, had stolen plans for Waymo's Lidar, a laser based sensing technology. The complaint filed in California said: "Uber's Lidar technology is actually Waymo's Lidar technology." Lidar bounces light off objects to "see" where they are — it's not a new technology, but Waymo's version is reportedly a tenth of the price of existing systems, according to Reuters. "Hundreds of Waymo engineers have spent thousands of hours, and our company has invested millions of dollars to design a highly specialised and unique Lidar system," the company said in a post on Medium. "Waymo engineers have driven down the cost of Lidar dramatically even as we’ve improved the quality and reliability of its performance. The configuration and specifications of our Lidar sensors are unique to Waymo. Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company." Waymo said building the technology has taken seven years, while Uber's Otto appears to have done the same over nine months. The accusations centre on Anthony Levandowski, the founder of self-driving truck firm Otto, which hit the roads last year by shipping a lorry-load of Budweiser beer. In August, Uber bought the company. Before founding Otto, Levandowski worked on Google's self-driving project, now dubbed Waymo. It alleges that he downloaded 14,000 files before he resigned in January 2016 — including Lidar designs. "To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Mr. Levandowski searched for and installed specialised software onto his company-issued laptop," the Waymo blog post alleges. "Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation. Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr. Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints." Waymo said it spotted the knockoff design via an email slip-up. "Recently, we received an unexpected email," the company said. "One of our suppliers specialising in Lidar components sent us an attachment (apparently inadvertently) of machine drawings of what was purported to be Uber’s Lidar circuit board  —  except its design bore a striking resemblance to Waymo’s unique Lidar design." Uber said it took the allegations "seriously" and would "review this matter carefully". Waymo is seeking unspecified damages, but asked for Uber to be banned from using the Lidar information. "Competition in the self-driving space is a good thing; it pushes everyone to develop better, safer and more affordable technology," Waymo said in the blog post. "But we believe that competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions." It's not the first legal battle in the self-driving arena: in January, Tesla sued a former director of its Autopilot automation project for poaching its staff. 22/02/2017: Just over two months to the day after being kicked out of San Francisco, Uber has begun trials of its self-driving fleet in Arizona, this time with the permission of the state's authorities.  Self-driving Ubers are hitting the road in the Grand Canyon State. pic.twitter.com/tOgiw4GD1d — Uber (@Uber) February 21, 2017 Arizona Republican governor Doug Ducey is expected to be 'Rider Zero' on the latest trial for the autonomous ride-hailing service, which is available to residents of Tempe starting today Uber's previous test of 16 self-driving cars in California in December was met with opposition from the Department of Motor Vehicles, which claimed the company failed to apply for the correct test permits. Uber always maintained that because a human was always behind the wheel, the cars did not fit the criteria for the $150 permit. It appears, however, that Arizona has taken an entirely different approach to the testing of autonomous vehicles. In August 2015, Ducey signed an executive order in support of the development of self-driving technology, urging authorities to "undertake any necessary steps to support the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles" on roads within Arizona. AZ Gov @dougducey taking a ride in @Uber_AZ's new self driving car. Pretty slick looking machine! pic.twitter.com/1zFoDNYUKV — Ty Brennan (@TyFox10) February 21, 2017 Customers in Tempe are now able to hail a self-driving Volvo XC90 SUV on the Uber service, which will be overseen by two Uber engineers in the front seats, in case a situation arises that requires human intervention. This signifies a much needed win for Uber given a series of bad press reports over the past few months. Aside from the controversy in California, the technology is far from perfect and has been caught running red lights, as well as narrowly avoiding a collision in San Francisco. The company itself has come under fire this week, with claims of rampant sexism from a former Uber engineer. Uber has said it plans to expand testing to other cities in Arizona within the next few weeks. 17/02/2017: Google patents car that 'prevents harm' in accidents Google has patented a technology that could prevent injuries in the event of an accident. The company has filed a patent with the US patent office for "adjusting a shear pin to minimize an impact force felt by an object in a collision with a vehicle". This means its self-driving cars' computers could analyse the amount of force needed to prevent injury or damage to the person, animal or object it's about the crash into. “Computing devices within a vehicle may determine that an impact with an object cannot be avoided by way of braking, steering, and/or accelerating the vehicle,” the patent explained. “When this is the case, the computing devices may work to adjust the amount of force necessary to break one or more shear pins which are holding a panel of the vehicle in place. The force of impact on the object which the vehicle collides may be reduced, thereby limiting the severity of injuries and/or damage to the object.” The computer device inside an autonomous car would receive data that it is about to collide with an object and the shear pin, which determines what will happen to a vehicle when it is subjected to pressure, would move into a position that would cause it to break, meaning the car's panels would slide back and absorb the impact. “The characteristics of the object with which impact is imminent may be used to determine to adjust the amount of shear force necessary to break the one or more shear pins, in an effort to minimize the impact force felt by the object,” the patent said. “The size of an object may be used to estimate its mass. This in turn may be used to determine the appropriate amount of shear force for the shear pins.” Google's automated car company, Waymo, hasn't revealed whether the technology will be integrated into its cars or if it will license the technology to other automated car makers. 16/02/2017: Microsoft India has just announced a partnership deal with India's Tata Motors, collaborating on technologies designed to make driving a more personalised experience. The new partnership will focus around AI, IoT and machine learning technologies, and will provide Tata vehicles with advanced telematics, remote monitoring and sophisticated navigation technologies. The first vehicle produced as part of the new agreement will be shown off at the Geneva International Motor Show on 7 March. The company wants to create "a highly personalised, smart and safer driving experience across the digital life of a vehicle owner", according to Tata Motors managing director, Guenter Butschek. "In the first phase, the advanced offerings will incorporate technologies such as cloud computing, analytics, geo-spatial and mapping and increased human-machine interface, creating a new benchmark in the industry for connected vehicles," he said. "Using the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, we will provide the vehicle owners here as well as across the world a safe, productive and fun-driving experience," said Microsoft India's president, Anant Maheshwari, adding that Microsoft expects 90% of cars to be completely connected within three years. 13/02/2017: Ford is to invest $1 billion dollars into an AI startup over the next five years, comprised of ex-Google and Uber engineers who have worked on autonomous car projects. Argo AI will be led by CEO Bryan Salesky, formerly of Google, and Uber's Peter Rander as company COO, both of whom were leaders of their companies' self-driving car teams. The organisation, based at Ford's Pittsburgh headquarters, is expected to have more than 200 members by the end of the year. This represents the latest push by a car manufacturer into autonomous technology, which has become a highly competitive market over the past few years. Audi, Nissan, Tesla, and even companies traditionally not associated with vehicles, such as graphics processing firm Nvidia, are working on their own technology. "The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," said Ford CEO Mark Fields. "We believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term, and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future." The deal will see Ford focus on its development of vehicle hardware, including the exterior and interior design of autonomous cars, and the integration of new systems. Argo AI will latch onto Ford's current software development teams and help the company scale up its production. If all goes to plan, Ford intends to have a fully autonomous, level 4-capable vehicle for the commercial market by 2021. This, according to the Society of Automated Engineers (SAE), is one rank behind "fully autonomous", in which the AI is able to fully control every aspect of the driving and does not rely on the input of a human driver. "We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move," said Salesky, Argo AI's CEO. "We believe this partnership will enable self-driving cars to be commercialised and deployed at scale to extend affordable mobility to all." Although Argo AI will initially focus on supporting the production of Ford vehicles, the company has stated that future plans could include the licensing out of its technology to other firms wishing to move into the autonomous sector.

The Department for Transport is set to unveil plans for the two-in-one policy as it attempts to reduce the legal hurdles preventing self-driving cars from hitting the road in the UK. Who would ultimately be responsible for the cause of a driverless accident has been the cause of significant debate for legal bodies across the world. The latest plans will introduce policies that cover drivers while they are at the wheel, and then allows responsibility to be handed over to AI while in driverless mode. Claims made against accidents involving AI will be covered by the insurance company who will recuperate losses from the party responsible, which may include the car manufacturer. The government hopes this will make it easier for victims of crashes involving driverless vehicles to access compensation. "Automated vehicles have the potential to transform our roads in the future and make them even safer and easier to use, as well as promising new mobility for those who cannot drive," said transport secretary Chris Grayling, in a statement to the Telegraph. "But we must ensure the public is protected in the event of an incident and this week we are introducing the framework to allow insurance for these new technologies." Accidents involving driverless cars have raised questions as to who exactly is to blame for a crash. In June last year a driver was killed when his Tesla Model S collided with a tractor trailer after failing to break. But the government is keen to encourage the growth of the driverless car industry in the UK, an industry analysts predict will be worth almost $42 billion globally by 2025. Ian Crowder, head of public relations at AA, argued that although improving policies will make insurance claims more streamlined, there is no way to predict how other human drivers will respond to an increase in driverless vehicles.  "In the longer term the number of claims should dramatically fall," said Crowder. "However there are concerns relating to the behaviour of drivers of human-driven cars mixing with autonomous vehicles, which could lead to an increase in collisions." "For example, frustration at autonomous vehicles sticking to the speed limit; human drivers attempting to fit into smaller spaces between autonomous vehicles etc... which could lead to an increased number of collisions so that could lead in turn, to an increase in premiums overall," added Crowder. Japanese car manufacturer Nissan is expected to go ahead with its plans to test driverless cars on the streets of London later this month, following successful preliminary tests in Milton Keynes last year. 01/02/2017: A deal with automaker Mercedes-Benz will see its range of vehicles join Uber's ever-expanding fleet of self-driving cars. The partnership will see Germany's Daimler join forces with the popular ride-hailing service to introduce and operate its own self-driving cars on Uber's network. "Auto manufacturers like Daimler are crucial to our strategy because Uber has no experience making cars," said Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick. "This became very clear to me after I visited an auto manufacturing plant and saw how much effort goes into designing, testing and building cars." "That's why instead of building them ourselves, we want to partner with the best auto manufacturers in the world," he added. "We can combine Uber's global ridesharing network with the world-class vehicles of companies like Daimler, so that Uber riders can have a great experience getting around their cities." Uber has so far declined to offer the financial details of the new deal, however Daimler represents the first company to take advantage of Uber's new policy allowing third-party manufacturers to add their own self-driving cars. As a result of a $300 million deal with automaker Volvo, vehicles have already been piloted in Pennsylvania and Arizona using self-driving kits developed by Uber. However unlike previous deals, Uber will not own or manage the new fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, or be responsible for the research and development of the AI led software. Instead, Uber has simply added the Daimler manufactured cars to its self-driving vehicle range. 20/01/2017: Tesla semi-autonomous cars won't be recalled in US Tesla semiautonomous cars won't be recalled in the US, despite the technology inside one of its cars resulting in the death of a customer. Joshua Brown was killed when the Tesla he was driving collided with a lorry in May 2016. However, Tesla had claimed this wasn't because of its Autopilot technology failing, but rather user error, because although the autonomous system can be used as an assistance to the driver, drivers should never take their hands off the wheel. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which conducted an investigation into the crash, said data from the car's onboard tracking system revealed Brown had not made any attempt to brake, steer or do anything else to avoid the collision. He would have seen he was going to hit the lorry for seven seconds, which was enough for him to take action and override the Autopilot system, but he decided not to. "These systems require continual and full attention of the driver," Bryan Thomas from the NHSTA said. "It's not enough to put [information] in the owner's manual and hope drivers are going to read that. "Manufacturers must anticipate how drivers would use the functionality, and that some don't read the manual." The NHTSA said it would not take any action against Tesla, and found no faults with the vehicle, but would be monitoring the situation carefully to ensure it does not pose a risk to drivers. 04/01/2017: Oxford driverless car firm releases camera mapping Oxford self-driving car company Oxbotica has announced that the localisation and mapping software used in its prototype vehicles is now ready for general release. Comprising one part of the company's Selenium OS for autonomous cars, the firm has used its Dub4 software tool in the GATEway pods operating in Greenwich and in the company's own prototype vehicles, which were demonstrated in Milton Keynes last year. Oxbotica is competing in the same space as Google and Uber, but what sets it apart from other projects is that rather than the expensive laser and GPS systems seen in other cars, Oxbotica's mapping system can rely purely on vehicle-mounted cameras. "The software uses a single stereo camera mounted onto the car to determine its precise position and orientation in the world," the company explained in a statement. "With this localisation information, the software is then able to create and navigate using vision-based maps in highly unstructured environments without any reliance on GPS or expensive laser-based techniques." By negating the need for costly LIDAR systems, Dub4 has the potential to make self-driving technology much cheaper to produce, while Oxbotica claims it doesn't require specialised equipment to run; it can be installed and operated on off-the-shelf commodity PC hardware. "We're excited to be working on deployment of our class-leading Dub4 software solution, as part of our mission to achieve Level 4 autonomy by 2020," said Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith. "What we've done with Dub4 has never been done before and it represents a seismic shift for the self-driving vehicle industry, enabling a move away from GPS and 3D laser-based approaches. We're paving the way for more affordable and accurate solutions in the industry." How do self-driving cars work? Self-driving cars use a battery of sensors to detect their surroundings, including radar, lasers and camera arrays. The vehicle's onboard computer then uses specialised software to react to this input in real-time, adjusting the car's steering and acceleration to suit the situation. While some vehicles, such as the Google prototypes which have popularised the idea, are totally autonomous, other cars only automate certain aspects of driving. Tesla's Autopilot feature, for example, features adaptive cruise control, which maintains a safe speed and distance from other vehicles when driving on the motorway. It also features basic automated steering to ensure you don't accidentally drift into the wrong lane, and although it can perform basic steering maneuvers automatically, it is not intended to replace a human driver altogether. Are self-driving cars safe? There is still much debate over whether or not fully autonomous cars should be made widely available. Some say that their safety record is impeccable, while others argue that automobiles are simply too dangerous to be operated by an algorithm. This debate has been reignited by a number of high-profile Tesla crashes, one of which has been blamed on an Autopilot malfunction. The incidents have raised questions over whether or not self-driving technology is ready for implementation. On the other hand, Google has emphasised how safe its fleet of self-driving cars are. As part of the testing programme for its autonomous vehicles, the company has posted regular safety logs detailing any crashes the vehicles are involved in, with the vast majority being caused by human drivers in other cars. Experts remain divided, however, and if self-driving cars are ever likely to be widely commercially available, they will doubtless be heavily regulated, monitored and tested. When will self-driving cars hit the road? In many cases, they already have. Some high-end luxury vehicles already feature 'assisted driving' elements that are close to fully autonomous driving, with Tesla being the obvious example. Elsewhere, testing of various driverless car projects is underway in the US, with California, Texas, Seattle and more all hosting autonomous vehicle test runs. The UK government has also given the green light for similar trials in Britain, so UK commuters may soon be sharing the roads with autonomous shuttles. As for when driverless cars will become commercially available, however, that is yet to be seen. As the technology is young and comparatively untested, it is likely that substantial tests will have to be conducted in partnership with government and regulatory bodies before the vehicles are available for public purchase. There is also a question as to whether or not the average driver will be able to purchase one at all. Even if fully autonomous cars are allowed to be sold, the price of each vehicle is likely to be prohibitively expensive due to the large amount of sophisticated technology that goes into them. As such, it's likely to be at least a few years before autonomous cars are approved for general road use, and most likely another few years after that before they become a commonplace sight. Are driverless cars legal? As no fully autonomous cars have yet made it to the mass-production phase, no legislation currently exists to govern their public use. However, transport authorities both in the UK and in the US are currently in the process of drawing up new laws or amending old ones to account for driverless vehicles. In the UK, for example, companies need no permits or authorisation to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. "Real-world testing of automated technologies is possible in the UK today," the government's Pathway to Driverless Cars report reads, "providing a test driver is present and takes responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle; and that the vehicle can be used compatibly with road traffic law." The UK also plans to amend the Highway Code to allow vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems to change lanes on the motorway and be parked via remote control. Changes to car insurance would extend it to cover product liabilities for automated vehicles. Insurers would pay out to victims, then reclaim the money from the manufacturers. The US has also granted testing permits for driverless cars in four states, as well as publishing a 15-point safety checklist for manufacturers of autonomous vehicles in order to better regulate the emerging industry. Published by the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency, the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy also marks the agency's move to the SAE scale, which measures a vehicle's level of autonomy. The scale runs from zero, where the driver has total control of the vehicles, all the way to five - a totally autonomous car requiring no human input. Vehicles that measure two or three on the SAE scale - such as the Tesla and other semi-autonomous vehicles - are already road-legal both here and in the US, as the human driver is considered to be in control for the majority of the time. While many countries have committed to fostering a supportive environment for the development of autonomous cars, concrete legislation governing their use is still likely to be some years away, as the technology itself has not yet been fully finished. Who manufactures self-driving cars? The most well-known companies exploring self-driving cars are Google and Tesla, but there are very few companies connected to the automotive industry that aren't exploring the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber, for example, is currently testing its own fleet of autonomous taxis in Pittsburgh. Apple has also long been rumoured to be exploring the self-driving car field in some form, and has been linked to multiple different auto manufacturers, including McLaren. In addition to tech companies, however, regular car makers are also getting in on the act. Audi, Ford, BWM, Honda, Daimler, Volvo and more have all been dabbling in some form of autonomous driving project. Luxury passenger vehicles have also been experimenting with using the tech in industrial vehicles such as heavy goods lorries.

Toggle navigation Spoilers Exclusives Report Cards Watch TV Online Photo Galleries Quantico Mondays 10:00 PM Follow Quantico News Quantico Reviews Quantico Watch Online Quantico Episode Guide Quantico Quotes Quantico Pictures Quantico Videos Quantico Round Tables × Follow Quantico Quantico Season 2 Episode 15 Review: MOCKINGBIRD Allison Nichols at March 27, 2017 11:00 pm. Comments I don't know about you, but I think Owen would be the better team leader. On Quantico Season 2 Episode 15, there's still some team drama that gets worked out, but, for the most part, it's all entertaining drama. There aren't any petty high schoolers this time around, thankfully.  Let's start with the good: Owen and Clay's leadership battle. Clay is in a leadership role, but he recruited most of his team's Farm trainer. Who did Clay think the team was going to report to?  This provides some tension between Owen and Clay. It's fun to watch, mainly because Owen treats Clay as a recruit. I mean Owen's not wrong to do it; Clay needs training. Everyone going to Owen made sense. He was brought in to whip them into shape, and he did just that. Clay, on the other hand, has been almost like a figurehead. He briefs the team, but that's about it. There are some great character moments between Owen and Clay because of this tension. We get to see the two of them open up to each other and discuss the op in a way we won't get to see with Alex and Shelby, for instance. Owen and Clay look at the mission from different viewpoints, and it's fascinating.  While Clay blamed Owen, I think Owen was right; Clay needs to act like a leader to be treated like one. He doesn't do anything other than brief the team and wait for them to give him intel. Clay has never stepped up. Clay still has to prove he's worth the title of "boss." Owen helps the team with their missions. He reassured Harry and Alex that their cover wasn't completely blown, and he helped give them the confidence to get the intel. Owen: They're agents. They are used to getting their criminal. Waiting is not their thing, but you and I know waiting. For politicians like you, it's all the long game. And I've waited a long time to be operational. Clay: So what do I tell them? Owen: You lie. Tell them they've won. They saved the day. Permalink: You lie. Tell them they've won. They saved the day. What has Clay done? He's been rude to his team. The Shelby issue makes sense. She slept with his brother and father. They had their tiff, and they've moved past it. If we could stop with the shipper moments that would be great, though. Clay's distrust of Nimah came out of nowhere. Maybe it got lost in all the drama from Quantico Season 2 Episode 14, but Clay's wariness of Nimah came on really strong during this mission.  It felt like Nimah needed a reason to be a BAMF during the mission, so Clay all of a sudden had to distrust her and seclude her from the rest of the team. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for Nimah kicking ass, but Clay's attitude towards her cheapened the whole thing for me. Also, Nimah, girl, do you not have anyone else's phone number? When Clay ducked her call, Nimah should have called literally anyone else on the team. If she has Clay's number, then she has to have Owen's, right?  It's a small thing, but it did not make any sense why Nimah would give up on calling her team after Clay didn't answer her once. Nimah knew what the stakes were and that the mission was going on, so she should have kept calling. She could have been calling people while driving to the town. (Calling over bluetooth, obviously. Safety first.) You know what else didn't make any sense? The lack of discretion of the team.  Ryan getting spotted by Sasha was eye roll worthy. Journalists aren't stupid. If they are out investigating a chemical explosion that never happened, because I'm sure someone would have figured it out eventually, they are going to start taking photos and looking into everyone that was on site that day. Don't have your face easily accessible, especially if you are a CIA operative. I kind of feel like Ryan is awful at being CIA. What do you think?  Okay, a show of hands, who else teared up at Alex's speech to Harry about opening up?  Alex: You joke your way around everything because you're afraid to make a connection, maybe because the closest connection you ever made died right in front of you, and I get that. After my father died, I separated from the world, hid inside myself, buried myself so deep there was no where else to go. And then I met Ryan and Shelby and Nimah and Raina and Simon, and they had all been through so much themselves, but they could still smile. And they wanted to get to know me! Just like I want to get to know you. Harry: Mhmm, and all those connections, how did they work out for you? Huh? Simon Asher, he good? Raina Amin, is she around here somewhere? I'm still waiting for that save the date card for you and Alabama. Alex: Ryan and I might not be together, but we're very, very connected. I think about him. I worry about him all the time. I'm his friend, just like I'm your friend, Harry. Look there's space for you here, but you have to choose it. You can walk out that door and end up where you always end up - separate and alone. Or you can stay here and let us in. I'm not going anywhere, and I will not leave you. Permalink: Ryan and I might not be together, but we're very, very connected. I think about him. I worry... It's no secret that I adore Harry and Alex, and this hour is a perfect example as to why they are so great to watch.  Whether it is going undercover together or just being there for each other, Harry and Alex are a great team. She will always be in his corner. Alex sharing Harry's faults was a much better glimpse into who Harry is than all of the Sebastian, Elliot, and MI6 family storylines. Those dragged down the story unnecessarily, while Alex's insight was an asset.  Her words helped Harry take a shot and ask to be on the team. It wasn't a storyline that dragged on for half a season, but it wasn't a rushed scene either. It was perfect. Are you glad that Harry is officially on the team now? What did you think of the episode?

Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, is offering a new memory chip package it says will improve desktop performance in a way that consumers will be willing to pay for.PHOTO: REUTERS PublishedMar 28, 2017, 11:00 am SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/48SF Copy SAN FRANCISCO (BLOOMBERG) - Intel Corp is going back to its roots as a memory chipmaker in a bid to get consumers excited about high-end desktop computers. The world's largest chipmaker, whose processors power eight out of 10 PCs sold worldwide - and provide the bulk of Intel's revenue - is offering a new memory chip package it says will improve desktop performance in a way that consumers will notice and be willing to pay for. Every day, a typical consumer powers their PC on and off twice and uses 11 different programs, launching each one seven times. A machine equipped with Intel's Optane memory package will perform those routine tasks much quicker than computers currently in use, Intel said. The new memory module is 14 times faster at loading a program from a standard hard drive. According to research provided by Intel, more than 70 per cent of desktops still use spinning magnetic hard disks. "It's basically all about responsiveness," said Gregory Bryant, an Intel vice-president. "People are spending too much time waiting." For Intel, which was founded in the 1960s as a maker of memory chips, the push back into that business is part of chief executive officer Brian Krzanich's attempt to diversify the company's revenue sources beyond processors for servers and PCs. While previous attempts to return to the market it exited in the 1990s have not been successful, this time Intel is bringing a new type of chip not offered by other manufacturers that it hopes will give it a sustainable edge. Optane packages are based on Intel's 3D Xpoint memory. They will function as a giant fast cache, storing files frequently used by the processor and allowing much quicker load times. The new offering does not replace computer storage or main memory. The memory chip only works with Intel processors. That may help the company rebuff an attempt by Advanced Micro Devices to claw back some of the market with a new range of processors it says rival Intel's best. It is also aimed at one of the few areas of the PC market - which has been declining since it peaked in 2011 - that has remained strong: High-end gaming PCs will grow about 12 per cent this year, according to a prediction provided by Intel. That growth will be driven by gamers' willingness to fork out for the highest performing hardware. Optane is available in two modules, a 16 gigabyte version for US$44 (S$61) and 32 gigabyte package for US$77.

Bill O’Reilly spoke with House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes tonight and got his reaction to calls from top Democrats asking he step down from his position or recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, is calling on Nunes to recuse himself amid the continuing criticisms of being on White House grounds a day before his disclosure about “incidental collection” last week. Nunes declined to “disparage anyone,” but told O’Reilly, “I’m sure that the Democrats do want me to quit, because they know that I’m quite effective at getting to the bottom of things.” Earlier today, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Speaker Paul Ryan to remove Nunes as intel chair, while tonight––before Nunes’s segment with O’Reilly aired––Nancy Pelosi called on Ryan to demand that Nunes recuse himself: The time is long overdue for @SpeakerRyan to call on @DevinNunes to recuse himself at the very least. https://t.co/KtEO8mslts pic.twitter.com/4nh0P8DMLj — Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) March 27, 2017 Watch above, via Fox News.

 House Intel Committee implodes amid Trump-Russia investigation: Democrats call on Devin Nunes to recuse himself Mark Abadi and Bryan Logan Mar. 27, 2017, 8:01 PM 31,883 facebook linkedin twitter email print The House Intelligence Committee's chairman, Devin Nunes, right, with the committee's ranking member, Adam Schiff. Mark Wilson/Getty Images The House Intelligence Committee's ranking Democrat on Monday called on the committee's Republican chairman to recuse himself from the committee's investigation into President Donald Trump's connections with Russia. The statement by Rep. Adam Schiff followed news reports that Rep. Devin Nunes, the committee's chairman, had visited the White House grounds with a source who showed him secret intelligence reports the day before he briefed Trump that Trump and his advisers may have had their communications picked up "incidentally" as part of intelligence-community surveillance of foreign targets. "After much consideration, and in light of the chairman's admission that he met with his source of information at the White House, I believe that the chairman should recuse himself from any further involvement in the Russia investigation, as well as any involvement in oversight of matters pertaining to any incidental collection of the Trump transition, as he was also a key member of the transition team," Schiff said in a statement. Schiff said he worried the public was losing faith in Nunes' ability to conduct an unbiased investigation. "I believe the public cannot have the necessary confidence that matters involving the president's campaign or transition team can be objectively investigated or overseen by the chairman," Schiff said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi echoed Schiff's sentiments and those of other Democrats who had increasingly been urging Nunes to step aside. "The chair of the House Intelligence has a serious responsibility to the Congress and to the country," she said. "Chairman Nunes' discredited behavior has tarnished that office." House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi with other House Democrats at a news conference in the US Capitol on Friday in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images "Speaker Ryan must insist that Chairman Nunes at least recuse himself from the Trump-Russia investigation immediately," Pelosi said. "That leadership is long overdue." Nunes defended his White House visit by saying he wanted "to have proximity to a secure location" where he could view information provided by a source. The Trump administration was not aware of his visit, he said. Democrats have seized on Nunes' announcement, accusing the Republican of attempting to give political cover for Trump, who claimed in a series of shocking, unsubstantiated tweets in early March that President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower during last year's presidential campaign. Last week, Schiff said Nunes' actions had thrown "great doubt" on the committee’s ability to conduct a fair investigation. Numerous lawmakers have called for a select committee to carry out the investigation, and the effort received bipartisan support when Republican Sen. John McCain questioned Nunes' credibility in an interview on Wednesday. Trump appeared to complain about controversy surrounding Nunes on Monday night. In a series of tweets, the president said, "Why isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech money to Bill," referring to Bill and Hillary Clinton. The Washington Post reported in October last year that there was no evidence Clinton was personally involved in the uranium deal, to which Trump had previously referred. Trump called the Russia investigation a "hoax" and has denied his team had any untoward interactions with the Kremlin. The FBI — along with the House and Senate intelligence committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee — are investigating whether Trump or his associates colluded with Russia during the 2016 campaign.

Separately there has been the ongoing discussion about Meson support for libdrm/Mesa with not all developers being turned on by Meson. Now there's this separate Meson effort being led by Eric Anholt for getting the X.Org Server building with it as an alternative to Autotools. Eric commented on his motivation for getting the Meson build system working for the massive xorg-server code-base, "Meson is a delightful new build system (based around Ninja on Linux) that massively speeds up builds, while also being portable to Windows (unlike autotools generally). If you've ever tried to build the X stack on Raspberry Pi, you know that autotools is painfully slow. It's also been the limiting factor for me in debugging my scripts for CI for the X Server -- something we'd really like to be doing as we hack on glamor or do refactors in the core." He's still working on getting the Meson support ready for the X.Org Server. More details can be found via this blog post highlighting his latest VC4 development efforts. 11 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSpicer: If Trump uses Russian salad dressing 'somehow that’s a Russian connection' Schiff: Yates would have testified on Flynn at cancelled hearing Nunes rebuffs calls for recusal MORE (D-Calif.) tweeted on Monday evening, as Nunes was giving an interview to CNN about his visit to the White House grounds to view classified material last week. Nunes then announced to the press — without telling Democrats on his committee — that members of Trump’s transition team were caught up in incidental U.S. surveillance. After that press conference, he went to the White House to brief Trump.  “This is not a recommendation I make lightly, as the chairman and I have worked together well for several years,” Schiff said in a statement. “I take this step with the knowledge of the solemn responsibility we have on the Intelligence committee to provide oversight on all intelligence matters, not just to conduct the investigation.” ADVERTISEMENT Schiff's call for Nunes to recuse himself follows that of Senate Minority Leader Charles SchumerCharles SchumerMcConnell: ObamaCare 'status quo' will stay in place moving forward NRA launches M Supreme Court ad Senate about to enter 'nuclear option' death spiral MORE (D-N.Y.), who on Monday said Speaker Paul RyanPaul RyanMcConnell: ObamaCare 'status quo' will stay in place moving forward The Hill's 12:30 Report House GOP insists: We’re not giving up on ObamaCare repeal MORE (R-Wis.) should replace Nunes in order for the Russia probe to be “credible.” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), who also sits on the House Intelligence Committee, reiterated the call for Nunes to recuse himself, alongside Rep. Eric Swalwell, a fellow California Democrat. Swalwell, the ranking member of a House Intelligence subcommittee, said, “Chairman Nunes should no longer be anywhere near this investigation, let alone leading it.  "For the sake of our duty to independently find the truth, and for the sake of his ability to chair the committee in its other important duties, he should recuse himself from our committee's Russia investigation.” Nunes told CNN on Monday evening that he was sure the West Wing was unaware of his visit to White House grounds to view classified materials.  Some have speculated that the White House was the source of the intelligence viewed by Nunes. He would not give details to CNN Monday evening, but he maintained that he had to view the documents on White House grounds, as they could not be brought to the Capitol complex.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Monday grilled House Intel Committee chairman Devin Nunes over reports he met an intelligence source on White House grounds the day before he informed Donald Trump that he and members of his transition team may have been “incidentally surveilled” by intelligence agencies. Nunes insisted he’d been concerned about the unmasking of U.S. citizens in intelligence reports long before Trump’s “famous tweet” alleging former President Barack Obama “wiretapped” Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential election. Blitzer asked Nunes if he understands why it “might be conspicuous for the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to visit” the White House hours before unilaterally deciding to inform the president of potential intelligence gathered on Trump and members of his team. Nunes argued there was nothing clandestine about meeting a source at the White House, adding, “if I wanted to, I could have snuck onto White House grounds at night when nobody would have seen me.” Blitzer pressed Nunes on “who cleared [him] for admission” at the White House, arguing, “eventually these records, they’re going to come out anyhow.”   “Why not disclose it now if it’s going to be released in the near-future?” Blitzer asked. “You understand how all of this looks and why it’s causing such an uproar?” Nunes argued the potential unmasking of additional names “bothered [him] enough for him to consider it “completely appropriate … to go to the president with this.” At one point, Nunes grew exasperated by the magnitude of Blitzer’s question, complaining, “this is a lot of questions.” “Do you understand why it might have been better to avoid this kind of meeting at the White House,” Blitzer asked again. The CNN host also pressed Nunes about the president’s tweets alleging Obama had wiretapped him prior to the election. “You don’t believe that, do you?” Blitzer asked, adding, “He should not feel vindicated?” Watch the interview below, via CNN: Part 1– Part 2– Report typos and corrections to corrections@rawstory.com About the Author Next on Raw Story > ‘I was roadkill’: April Ryan condemns Sean Spicer’s disrespectful abuse of her for bringing up Russia By commenting, you agree to our terms of service and to abide by our commenting policy.

Ryan also spoke briefly with President Trump after meeting with Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price to discuss their agenda, according to the Speaker’s office. The meeting comes days after GOP leaders agreed to shelve the first major legislative initiative of Trump’s presidency, the American Health Care Act, after it ran into fierce resistance from rank-and-file Republicans. ADVERTISEMENT The measure’s defeat sparked days of recriminations between the White House and Congress and left many wondering how Trump and Ryan would find progress with other large bills such as tax reform. Trump’s top advisers have expressed interest in working with Democrats to approve a must-pass government funding bill and a massive infrastructure spending package down the road. “Absolutely,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday when asked if Trump is serious about working across the aisle, adding that the president has “received a number of calls” since last Friday about collaborating on healthcare. But Ryan’s meetings Monday are a sign that he’s determined not to be sidelined. The Speaker reportedly cast the healthcare bill’s failure as a learning experience that brought him closer to Trump. “In a strange way, this really merged our teams — our team in the House with the president’s team — even more closely,” he told donors, according to The Washington Post. He said the White House now “has a much, much clearer understanding of just the dynamic that we have in the House Republican conference” that poses “challenges” to governing. It was also a chance for Trump and Ryan to clear the air in person after the president used Twitter to plug a Fox News show whose host called on the Speaker to resign. Aides for both said the tweet wasn’t mean to be a slight and said the two spoke by phone for an hour on Saturday.  Tags Paul Ryan   View the discussion thread.

Kinzinger on Nunes at White House Grounds: I’m Having a Hard Time Seeing What the Big Scandal Is by Josh Feldman | 5:11 pm, March 27th, 2017   Please enable Javascript to watch. Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger said on CNN this afternoon that he’s “having a hard time” seeing what the big scandal is about House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes being on White House grounds: From what I understand, the intel committee––the chairman himself goes to a lot of different areas to review different information. This may be where that was located. And I can tell you I know Chairman Nunes well, he has a very good reputation in Congress as being fair. CNN’s John Berman pointed out that there’s still the question of whether “this information, which is seen as favorable to the White House, was provided by the White House.” Kinzinger again defended Nunes as an honest man who will conduct a fair investigation, and he noted later in the interview that going to the White House does not mean Nunes isn’t doing his job.

Will Ambarella's newest product attract attention from potential acquirers? Frank DiPietro (CMFFrankDip) Mar 27, 2017 at 12:43PM Intel Corporation's planned acquisition of Mobileye N.V. has made investors wonder if there are other companies working on products for the self-driving vehicle market that may become targets for acquisition. Intel will have no trouble ponying up a staggering $15.3 billion, or more than 40 times sales, for Mobileye, raising hopes of a lucrative payday for investors in other companies that self-driving players might like to acquire.    So, who might be next? Dougherty & Company's Charles Anderson (via Barron's) believes that Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) may be the next logical candidate to be acquired by a company that wants to participate in the autonomous-driving market. The basis for his theory lies in the company's deep technical knowledge of camera-based system on chips (SoCs) in combination with its developing computer vision technology.  VisLab self-driving car. Ambarella acquired VisLab in 2015. Image source: Ambarella. Ambarella's background Ambarella began investing in computer vision technology when it acquired VisLab in July 2015 for $30 million in cash. Vislab was able to provide a proof of concept by maneuvering a self-driving vehicle from its home country of Italy to China. Ambarella initially used VisLab technology in products that could recognize humans (versus other animals) for security cameras to reduce the number of false alarms sent to security companies. Computer vision technology Ambarella has taken the work that VisLab had done on a fully integrated software stack and built it into its first computer-vision chip called CV-1. The SoC is currently in the fabrication process and sample quantities are expected to be available on a limited basis by summer. The expected initial customer base includes drone manufacturers and internet-connected security camera companies. Auto manufacturers are not planned to be in the initial sampling process. The chip is expected to go into full production in 2018. On Ambarella's most recent quarterly earnings call, CFO George Laplante talked about Ambarella's plan to continue to spend on the development of its computer vision product line as well as the auto original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market.   The company recognizes the importance of this technology development for its future and is committed to increasing its spending on operations by 12% to 14% year over year to make sure the R&D team can focus enough resources to make this technology a success. "The increase in OpEx is directly related to expansion of our development efforts in support of computer vision technology for all markets as well as substantial investment targeted at the auto OEM markets," said Laplante. Note that management has decided to keep this spending increase in their plan knowing revenue will be flat for the year due to a key design loss at GoPro, Inc.  Ambarella is profitable Ambarella has consistently made money for shareholders. The chart below shows its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA); revenue; and increasing supply of cash. The company finished its most recent fiscal year with $405 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The company has no long-term debt. AMBA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Ambarella has a market cap of $1.88 billion, a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34, and sells at a multiple to sales of 6. That is a far cry from the 40-plus multiple to sales that Intel is paying to acquire Mobileye. What would be the risk to a potential acquirer? An acquirer would be taking a chance on Ambarella's ability to roll out yet unproven technology. On the other hand, the company has a sound business model that on its face provides an acquirer with a growing business that has consistently delivered results. Ambarella has been delivering camera-based SoCs for years. If a potential acquirer does make a bid, shareholders have an experienced CEO at the helm who has been involved in company buyouts from both sides of the table. In addition to Ambarella's cash buyout of Vislab, Fermi Wang was on the receiving end of an acquisition offer from Sun Microsystems as the CEO of Afara Websystems. In 2002, Afara accepted an offer and was purchased by Sun. Patient shareholders should be able to sit back and let the story play out. We will have a lot more information about the CV-1 chip once customers begin to evaluate it later this year. Until then, we can expect to be updated quarterly on new design wins and opportunities that Ambarella uncovers with its new computer vision products. Frank DiPietro owns shares of AMBA.

Micron will start shipping its 3D Xpoint memory technology -- branded QuantX --Â later this year, which will go into SSDs offered by storage makers. The company made that announcement during an earnings call on Friday. Intel and Micron co-developed 3D Xpoint. Intel says Optane is significantly faster and could replace conventional SSDs and DRAM in the coming years. But unlike Intel, Micron is not interested in making its own Optane-like storage. The company is licensing its 3D Xpoint technology to other storage makers. Micron's QuantX will also be available the form of DDR-style memory, the company has said. It's not yet known which storage makers will offer SSDs based on QuantX. Micron did not respond to requests for comment. But the SSDs will be targeted at enterprises, much like Intel's first large capacity SSD called Optane DC P4800X SSD, which started shipping last week. The 375GB SSD is priced at $1,520. Internal benchmarks showed the Optane SSD up to eight times faster in random read and write than conventional SSDs. Intel initially hyped the 3D Xpoint technology being 1,000 times faster than conventional NAND flash, but the company later clarified that applies only at the cell level, not to SSD media like Optane. Micron has said QuantX-based SSDs would have capacities up to 1.4TB. Those drives would plug into PCI-Express 3.0/NVMe slots.Â QuantX installations could look different from Intel's Optane. Micron is aligning with emerging throughput technologies like Gen-Z, which could expand QuantX from x86 to ARM servers. The QuantX storage and memory will also have its own controllers and sit close to the CPU for quick data transfers, cutting potential bottlenecks. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Intel Optane Memory has a mission: Make hard drives faster than SSDs Enthusiasts were hoping for more, though. Gordon Mah Ung (PC World (US online)) on 28 March, 2017 03:00 0 - - - - print email IDG Intel’s Optane Memory could be the most revolutionary letdown in storage history. Announced Monday morning, these first consumer Optane-based devices will be available April 24 in two M.2 trims: A 16GB model for $44 and a 32GB Optane Memory device for $77. Both are rated for crazy-fast read speeds of 1.2GBps and writes of 280MBps. If you’re wondering how you can install Windows 10 on one of these, you can’t. The first two Optane Memory devices instead are meant to be used primarily as cache drives for a traditional hard drive, using a technique similar to the Smart Response Technology Intel introduced in 2011. Intel The first two consumer Optane devices will be used as cache drives to speed hard drives. Why this matters: Optane Memory is a far cry from what we expected after Intel and Micron announced 3D XPoint in 2015. The non-volatile memory was hyped as the next fast thing, promising “1,000X” the performance of today’s NAND-based SSDs with far higher density and lower cost than DRAM. 3D XPoint had me wondering just how it would reshape the PC down the road, when a computer could potentially have a simple 4TB of 3D XPoint memory doing it all, rather than 16GB of RAM and a hard drive. Apparently we have to be patient. Why you shouldn’t dismiss Optane Anyone who expected the first Optane drives to re-balance the galaxy is likely to be very disappointed with Intel Optane Memory. These first two Optane drives aren’t intended for enthusiasts, nor anyone with a beefy computer. They’re aimed at the huddled masses who still use traditional, spinning-platter hard drives. There are a lot of them: IDC data cited by Intel shows roughly 80 percent of desktop PCs in the world still use hard drives. (Full disclosure: IDC and PCWorld are separate business units of International Data Group.) They’ll continue to do so, too, because the cost per megabyte is so affordable. Add Optane Memory to a current PC such as my own, and drive performance would be exponentially better, Intel claims. Intel We previewed Optane Memory running in an Intel Kaby Lake NUC Optane Memory hands-on Intel let the media try Optane Memory during a recent briefing at the company’s Folsom, California campus. This was a controlled atmosphere: I was not allowed to take photographs or screenshots, and we were closely supervised by Intel staff. Take these observations with a grain of salt. I booted a NUC PC with a 2.5-inch hard drive to Windows 10, launched the GIMP photo editor, and recorded how long it took to load. I then shut down the NUC and inserted a 32GB Intel Optane Memory drive into the NUC’s M.2 slot. I booted back into Windows and launched GIMP. Then I shut down the NUC and booted back into Windows. Lather, rinse, repeat. With each duplicate task, the launching speed accelerared. The load time for Gimp, for example, dropped from about 14 seconds to 8 seconds, and then to 3 or 4 seconds as the Optane Memory cached the task. While Optane Memory's mission echoes that of Smart Response Technology, it's a far better implementation. Pairing the drive, or setting it up to cache the hard drive, is truly a snap. You simply fire up the Optane Memory utility, tell it to pair, and you’re done. IDG Intel’s new Optane Memory borrows heavily from the 2011-era Smart Response Technology. Anyone who remembers the original Smart Response Technology can tell you it wasn’t so easy to use and was prone to pairing problems. Like SRT, Intel Optane Memory keeps parts of the OS on the drive to speed up performance. This means if you want to pull the hard drive from the system, you’ll have to unpair it first so you don’t jeopardize your data. The current Intel Optane Memory implementation is also limited to a single hard drive. If you run two hard drives, the second one will see no caching improvement. Very much like SRT, Intel Optane Memory increases responsiveness overall. Of course, anything is an improvement over a hard drive. Competing with SSD When the price of a 128GB SATA SSD is roughly $50 to $60 today, you may rightly wonder why Optane Memory would be worth the bother. Intel says most consumers just don’t want to give up the capacity for their photos and videos. PC configurations with a hard drive and an SSD, while standard for higher-end PC users, isn’t popular for the newbies. Think of the times you’ve had friends or family fill up the boot drive with cat pictures, but the secondary drive is nearly empty. Intel Optane Memory would give that mainstream user the same or better performance as an SSD, with the capacity advantage of the 1TB or 2TB drive they’re used to. Intel claims Optane Memory performance is as good or better than an SSD's, offering better latency by magnitudes and the ability to peak at much lower queue depths. (A queue depth is basically how long the time is for the system to access data on the hard drive.) Here’s an Intel slide that shows the traces of several consumer applications in use. You can see all of the action is with a queue depth of one, two, or three at the most. Intel Intel says the overwhelming amount of drive access consumers perform are done at very low queue depths. Intel also said the problem with NAND SSD is in its method of increasing performance. Increasing the number of channels nets performance only at very high queue depths that consumers don’t reach. Intel Using 3DX Point media, Intel’s Optane Memory can hit much higher performance than even SSDs at the low queue depths people actually use the computer at. You probably want the next drive What we all wanted to know, of course, is whether actual Optane SSDs aimed at consumers would come to market. Intel will only say it’s in the works. If Intel repeats its previous pattern of offering consumer drives based on its server products, some hints may lie in the launch of the DC P4800X—see the roadmap for Optane SSDs in the lower righthand corner. Intel Intel has announced a server Optane drive and plans for a consumer one. We’d guess this slide gives an indication of just what Intel’s plans are for consumers, too. One limitation to Optane Memory could be a deal-breaker for many: Intel said Optane Memory will be tied only to Kaby Lake CPUs, and not just the associated 200-series chipsets. That means, for example, if you have a Z270 motherboard with a Skylake Core i7-6700K in it, it won’t work. Intel said it wanted to limit the validation work it had to do. We’d also guess that by limiting it to Kaby Lake, Intel gets to eliminate supporting Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Optane Memory's first step When something is hyped up as “1,000X” of anything, people have expectations. The speed booster announced today falls short of the full-on SSD killer performance enthusiasts were hoping for. All Intel says, though, is wait and see: Storage VP Rob Cooke described this first roll out of Optane as an “exciting moment in time” that would become the new normal.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images Updated 2:45 p.m. ET President Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner is going to talk to the Senate Intelligence Committee about his meetings with Russian officials, Senate sources tell NPR. Politics Trump's Agenda May Be Doomed Unless He Learns That 'Little' Stuff Matters Politics Week Of High Expectations Stumbles To New Lows For Team Trump The committee is looking into Russia's attempt to meddle in last year's presidential election, as well as possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. Kushner's appearance before the committee was first reported by The New York Times. The newspaper reported that Kushner met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December at Trump Tower and also with Sergey Gorkov, the head of a Russian bank that is under U.S. sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea. It is unclear when Kushner will appear before the committee or whether the meeting will be open. A senior White House official tells NPR's Tamara Keith that Kushner volunteered to speak to the panel and notes that he was the official primary point of contact with foreign governments and officials. Politics What Failure On Obamacare Repeal Means For Tax Reform White House press secretary Sean Spicer addressed this at Monday's press briefing and contended there was nothing to see here. "Given the role that he played" as a point of contact with foreign governments for the Trump team, Spicer said, "he met with countless individuals. That was part of his job." He added, "You're acting as though there's something nefarious about doing what he was actually tasked to do." Spicer said that it's not every day a person in a senior position volunteers to talk to the Senate Intelligence Committee and that "based on the media frenzy that existed around this, he volunteered to make sure that he said, 'Hey, we made some contacts, I'd be glad to explain them. Let me know if you'd like to talk.' Plain and simple." The committee is scheduled to hold its first open hearing in its Russia investigation on Thursday with expert witnesses on Russia and cybersecurity. The revelation about the committee's interest in Kushner comes as the White House was preparing to announce that he'll be in charge of a new White House Office of American Innovation, which the Washington Post reports will be a sort of "SWAT Team of strategic consultants ... staffed by former business executives and ... designed to infuse fresh thinking into Washington." This is by no means the first time a presidential administration has attempted to rework the Washington bureaucracy. In recent history, similar efforts were undertaken at least as far back as the Reagan administration, often resulting in thick reports that, more often than not, were quietly shelved.

In recent history, similar efforts were undertaken at least as far back as the Reagan administration, often resulting in thick reports that, more often than not, were quietly shelved.

(YouTube screen grab)    House Intel Chairman Visited Secure Facility On White House Grounds Before Announcement Chuck Ross Reporter 11:48 AM 03/27/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5556166 The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee visited the White House grounds to view highly sensitive information last week, on the night before he announced that he had received bombshell information about Obama administration surveillance of then-President-elect Donald Trump. Devin Nunes, a California Republican, acknowledged to CNN that he visited a secure facility on White House grounds last Tuesday to view the sensitive information. He said he did not enter the White House itself but instead visited another building on the White House complex. The next morning, Nunes made a surprise announcement that he obtained new evidence showing that the Obama administration had captured the communications of Trump advisers — and possibly Trump himself — while conducting surveillance of foreign nationals. (RELATED: House Intel Chair: Trump’s Personal Communications May Have Been Captured In Surveillance Sweep) President Trump said later in the day that he felt “somewhat vindicated” by Nunes’ announcement. Earlier this month, he asserted on Twitter that the Obama administration conducted surveillance of Trump Tower prior to the inauguration. The source of Nunes’ information became a major focal point last week. Nunes refused to identify his source, but he suggested that it was a whistle-blower or someone within the intelligence community. He also dodged when asked if the source was in the White House. If so, Nunes’ claims would be far less explosive than they originally appeared. White House press secretary Sean Spicer last week dismissed the idea that Nunes got the information from the White House. In his announcement, Nunes said that the Obama administration collected “incidental” intelligence on Trump advisers. That meant that the surveillance was targeted at foreign nationals who made references to Trump advisers during phone or email communications. And though Nunes said that the information appeared to have been captured legally, he expressed concern that Trump advisers had been improperly unmasked by the Obama intelligence community. He also said that the names of Trump advisers had been dispersed through the administration. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee blasted Nunes last week. They said he did not share the new information with the committee prior to publicly announcing it. They also took issue with his decision to brief the White House on the information before sharing it with the committee.

Nunes’ office issued a statement in response to CNN’s report. “Chairman Nunes met with his source at the White House grounds in order to have proximity to a secure location where he could view the information provided by the source,” a Nunes spokesman said. “The Chairman is extremely concerned by the possible improper unmasking of names of U.S. citizens, and he began looking into this issue even before President Trump tweeted his assertion that [Trump Tower] had been wiretapped.” Follow Chuck on Twitter Tags: Devin Nunes, Donald Trump Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

By Jessica Schulberg 6.1k 720 WASHINGTON ― House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) met a source on White House grounds last week, one day before he alleged that President Donald Trump and his team were subjected to surveillance during the final months of the Obama administration. Nunes met the source on White House grounds in order to view sensitive information in a “secure location,” Jack Langer, Nunes’ communications director, said Monday in a statement, CNN first reported. There are sensitive compartmented information facilities ― known as SCIFs ― on Capitol Hill. But using a congressional facility would have required the source to illegally transport the documents, Langer told The Huffington Post.  “The information comprised executive branch documents that have not been provided to Congress. Because of classification rules, the source could not simply put the documents in a backpack and walk them over to the House Intelligence Committee space,” he wrote in an email. “The White House grounds was the best location to safeguard the proper chain of custody and classification of these documents, so the Chairman could view them in a legal way.”  Only individuals with specific approval can enter White House grounds. Langer’s explanation of why Nunes met his source on White House grounds is “disingenuous and misleading, at a minimum,” Bradley Moss, a lawyer specializing in national security law, told HuffPost.  “There are countless intelligence officials who are authorized to transport classified materials between facilities using secure lock bags,” Moss said. “It would be reasonable to expect that someone who has unsupervised access to surveillance orders located on a classified network would also have been designated as an authorized courier.” In an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Monday evening, Nunes insisted there was nothing “clandestine” about his visit. He also denied coordinating with White House officials and said he is “quite sure people in the West Wing had no idea I was there.”  He declined, however, to say who in the executive branch cleared his visit. Nunes also wouldn’t say which Trump associates were named in the intelligence documents he reviewed on the White House grounds but said they had “nothing to do with Russia.”  The revelation about Nunes’ White House visit adds to speculation that he coordinated with Trump’s team before making allegations about the previous administration’s information-gathering.  Mark Wilson via Getty Images House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) speaks to reporters after a meeting at the White House on March 22. Nunes said he has seen reports from the U.S. intelligence agencies that show communication from members of President Donald Trump's transition team and the president himself were incidentally collected. The day after meeting with his source, Nunes told reporters that he had viewed several dozen reports showing that members of Trump’s team ― and possibly the president himself ― were the subjects of “incidental” collection during routine surveillance targeting suspected foreign spies. He said the surveillance was legal but that he was concerned that the names of Trump surrogates were “unmasked” in internal intelligence reports. After briefing reporters, Nunes went to the White House to share his revelations with Trump, whose team is being investigated by the FBI for possible ties to Russian government officials who allegedly interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.  Asked several times last week to confirm that he did not receive his information from the White House, Nunes avoided answering directly.  “You can ask me every single name that exists on the planet and I’m still not going to tell you who our sources are,” he said Friday.  After Nunes’ White House visit was made public on Monday, he told the Daily Beast that his source was an “intelligence official,” not a member of the National Security Council. Democrats viewed Nunes’ disclosures as a political stunt aimed at rehabilitating Trump’s credibility after the FBI director and a bipartisan smattering of lawmakers ― including Nunes himself ― disavowed the president’s claim that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Monday called on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to remove Nunes from his position as head of the House Intelligence Committee. “Chairman Nunes is falling down on the job and seems to be more interested in protecting the president than in seeking the truth,” Schumer said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described Nunes last week as being “deeply compromised” and accused him either being “duped” by the White House or acting as a “willing stooge.” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the intelligence committee, repeated previous calls for an independent commission to investigate ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow.   Nunes, who was a member of Trump’s transition team, did not notify Schiff or other committee members before his announcement last week. He denies that he is unfit to lead the committee’s investigation into Russian election interference because he says the reports he viewed do not mention Russia ― but he has not shared those reports with other members of the committee. Nunes and Schiff asked the heads of the National Security Agency, the FBI and the CIA earlier this month for information about Americans who have been named in internal intelligence reports after being swept up in surveillance efforts. Nunes told reporters he expects to receive a response early this week. The chairman has backed down from his most explosive claim ― that Trump was personally subjected to incidental intelligence collection ― saying he won’t know for sure until he hears back from intelligence and law enforcement officials.  Mollie Reilly contributed to this report.

(TIF) Stock Be a Diamond in the Rough? Tiffany, the renowned jewelry name, surged after strong earnings last week By Charles Payne, Editor, Smart Investing  |  Mar 24, 2017, 12:30 pm EDT     Popular Posts: Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Still Not a Buy, Mobileye NV (MBLY) or Not Recent Posts: Trade of the Day: Sierra Wireless, Inc. (USA) (NASDAQ:SWIR) Could Tiffany & Co. (TIF) Stock Be a Diamond in the Rough? Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Still Not a Buy, Mobileye NV (MBLY) or Not View All Posts Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF), a designer and retailer of fine jewelry, was off to the races last Friday after reporting fourth-quarter results that beat the Street, with strong guidance with “meaningful growth” acting as the icing on the cake. The rally was great for those who already own a position in the stock, but I have some concerns at current levels. Source: Shutterstock Let’s look at the numbers first. Adjusted earnings of $1.45 a share were down a penny from last year but bested expectations of $1.38 a share. Revenue grew 1.6% to $1.23 billion, which was also better than estimates of $1.22 billion. TIF stock same-store sales were unchanged while analysts had been looking for a decline of more than 1%. TIF Stock Shows Strength For fiscal 2017, management forecasted a mid-single-digit increase on the bottom line. The Street had anticipated guidance of $3.85 a share, which implies 2.7% growth. The solid fourth-quarter results were driven by strong sales in the Asia-Pacific region, which gained 9% thanks to the opening of new stores. New, cheaper and higher-margin products also boosted results. At the same time, though, the company experienced domestic weakness due to sluggish tourism spending and continued struggles in brick-and-mortar retail. In fact, sales at Tiffany’s flagship store in New York City declined 7% in the quarter. They were down 11% in the full year and 14% during the holiday season. Some of this was due to slower tourism, but it also has to do with the fact that the store is located next to Trump Tower, which has undergone increased security measures. TIF stock climbed as much as 4.5% following Friday’s release to hit a new 19-month high, and I believe the strength was thanks in part to low expectations and better sales outside the United States. But as I mentioned, I still have concerns here. Click to Enlarge First, the flagship store has been a perennial disappointment — the company stopped breaking out its numbers not long ago, which underscores the issue — and I would love to see a major renovation that would make it more modern and an overall better shopping experience. It’s also time for new designers — and on that note, it’s worth mentioning that the lower dollar is great news for the company. I’ve certainly had success buying TIF stock after sell-offs in the past, and the majority of the disappointments I’ve had have been the result of buying too soon and thinking the worst was already over. But I wouldn’t be a buyer here. Technically, the stock is at a two-year double top, which is bearish. So while I wouldn’t chase Tiffany at the moment, I do see ways the company can justify higher valuations in the future as long as management makes some changes and becomes more consistent in its execution.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Not just because her signature domestic achievement is safe, for now. But also because it shows that President Donald Trump might need to work with the longtime Democratic leader if he wants to notch any legislative wins this year. On the menu: Government funding runs out April 28, the debt ceiling needs to be raised in the fall, tax reform, infrastructure and trade. Seal the deal: “Ironically, the president who ran as the great deal-maker couldn’t even make a deal with the people on his own team. It’s our leader who continues to unify us,” Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, a close Pelosi ally, told POLITICO. “Republicans should take a lesson from that.” We’ve seen this movie before: Republicans have turned to Pelosi for years to deliver Democratic votes on must-pass legislation. But with Trump in the White House and the GOP in control of Congress, dismantling Obamacare was supposed to be the first example that Pelosi’s help was no longer needed, much less wanted. Instead, House Republicans’ collapse pointed to the opposite. The leader of the seemingly powerless House minority might actually have some juice and Pelosi, a master vote counter, knows how to use it. My story, new this morning: http://politi.co/2nXvZoF White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus signaled Sunday that the administration is open to working with moderate Democrats in the future. But don’t expect Democrats to offer up their votes easily. “Democrats are newly optimistic about picking up seats in 2018, hoping to ride a backlash against Mr. Trump,” J-Mart reports in the New York Times. “Seeing an opportunity, they say they will not throw Mr. Trump a political life preserver at what they sense could be the first turns of a downward spiral.” FINGER-POINTING IN FULL FORCE — Republican infighting was on public display this weekend as GOP leaders seem to be living a real life version of the “this is fine” meme. Trump turned his ire toward the House Freedom Caucus. Moderate Rep. Charlie Dent confirmed on TV a New York Times Magazine anecdote that Trump accused him of “destroying” the Republican party. Rep. Ted Poe left the HFC (more on that later) and rank-and-file Republicans sparred on Twitter. You can call me on my cell phone: Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke twice over the weekend and GOP aides insist their relationship is still strong, Kyle and Bres report. This came after Trump urged his Twitter followers Saturday to watch Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro — who opened her show with a bit calling on Ryan to step down. In a conversation between the two yesterday, Trump made clear that his tweet had nothing to do with the speaker, AshLee Strong, Ryan's spokeswoman, told Huddle. Ryan, while wounded by the health care bill’s collapse, still has broad support within the caucus and is not going to lose the speakership, Bres and Rachael report. --The White House blame game goes far beyond the Obamacare repeal. Alex Isenstadt: http://politi.co/2nY4o6W THE SECRET FREEDOM CAUCUS PACT — The Freedom Caucus alone did not sink the repeal bill. There were several moderate members against the plan and other rank-and-file lawmakers who didn’t like the bill but were less vocal about it. But a majority of HFC members did make a secret pact earlier this month that helped sow the seeds of the bill’s rapid collapse. About 75 percent of the group’s members agreed not to commit “his vote before consulting with the entire group — not even if Trump himself called to ask for an on-the-spot commitment.” That blockade proved to be very effective. One particularly tense moment? A Thursday night meeting between the HFC and GOP leaders: Speaker Ryan tried to go around the room to ask each individual member where they stood. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows jumped in and quickly shut that down, saying he spoke for the group. "They weren't going to get any commitments in the room,” said one attendee. "They just weren't. It wasn't productive anymore." Rachael, Josh Dawsey and Jen Haberkorn take you behind-the-scenes: http://politi.co/2nXpgeo MONDAY, BACK SO SOON? Welcome to March 27 and thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. FRIDAY’S MOST CLICKED: President Trump’s demand for a Friday vote on the Obamacare repeal, reported by Rachael, Kyle and Josh Dawsey, was the winner. BYE Y’ALL — Texas Rep. Ted Poe resigned from the Freedom Caucus Sunday, his sudden departure stemming from the group’s opposition the the GOP Obamacare repeal. “Saying no is easy, leading is hard, but that is what we were elected to do,” Poe wrote in a statement. Rachael with the story: http://politi.co/2nXNpC2 WHAT’S NEXT FOR THE FREEDOM CAUCUS? President Trump was supposed to be GOP leaders’ antidote for their Freedom Caucus woes. But their repeal face-plant proves not only will the group of right-wing rabble rousers continue to vex Speaker Ryan, they aren’t afraid to stymie the new Republican president either. "This is a defining moment for our nation but it's also a defining moment for the Freedom Caucus," Meadows told reporters last week. Kyle with more: http://politi.co/2nXNLbH -- Meadows is taking heat from GOP leaders for stonewalling the repeal, but he’s received a hero’s welcome back home. Adam Cancryn reports from North Carolina: http://politi.co/2nXhSzr COMING ATTRACTIONS: MANAFORT IN THE HOT SEAT — Paul Manafort, Trump’s controversial former campaign chairman, has agreed to be interviewed by the House and Senate Intel Committees as part of their ongoing probe into Russian tampering with the election. Manafort’s ties to Russia have long been criticized but he’s come under more scrutiny recently after an AP report that he worked to advance Vladimir Putin’s agenda a decade ago. ** A message from USP: How do you ensure drug quality in a global economy?

TRUMP’S TAX RETURNS IN THE SPOTLIGHT — The House Ways and Means Committee will hold its first post-Obamacare repeal markup Tuesday. No, not on tax reform. They’ll be voting on a Democratic proposal that seeks to publicize Trump’s tax returns. Why would GOP committee leaders bring up a plan they’re on record against? Basically, if Ways and Means acts on the bill — and that could mean passing it, or reporting it out unfavorably or with no recommendation — then only W&M Chairman Kevin Brady or someone he picks can bring the measure up on the floor. In short: The markup allows Republicans to block Democrats from calling up the tax return bill.

We see it as a national duty to ensure that also the citizens of Israel should enjoy the fruit of the industry’s success.” Members of IATI, including CEO Karin Mayer Rubinstein and VC members of the board, presented Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon with a report on the issue last week. At the end of the meeting the parties agreed that in coming weeks Kahlon and IATI would meet with institutional investors to advance the report’s recommendations. The absence of Israeli institutional investors in the Israeli tech scene was highlighted most recently in the Mobileye sale to Intel Corp. for $15 billion, where the lion’s share of the deal money is expected to go to the foreign institutional investors and funds that were invested in the company. There are no Israeli institutional investors listed among the major shareholders, meaning that Israeli pensioners will be largely excluded from the bonanza. Amnon Shashua, co-founder and chairman of Mobileye arrives to a Mobileye and Intel Workers Conference in Jerusalem, March 14, 2017. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90) “The only clear-cut losers from this massive Mobileye deal are Israeli institutional investors, and the Israeli citizens they serve,” said Steven Schoenfeld, chief investment officer of BlueStar indexes, at the time of the deal in an interview with The Times of Israel. BlueStar is a financial firm that has developed indices and exchange traded funds (ETFs) with a focus on the Israeli capital markets. The 2017 IATI report presented to the finance minister highlights the fact that there is a “very low ratio of investments” in the Israeli VC industry by Israeli investors, compared to the much higher ratio of US investors in American VC funds and European investors in European VC funds. “We are troubled by this finding as we see it a long term instability factor for the Israeli tech industry in general and particularly for the early stage startups,” the report said. And whereas the Israeli venture capital industry has played a “substantial” role in the growth and success of the Israeli technology sector, the local VCs are “over-reliant” on international investment capital, with “close to zero domestic investment.” This model is not sustainable, the report said, and Israeli institutional funds “earn almost nothing from the Israeli start-up industry success.” The average percentage of holdings in VC funds among institutional investors stands at 0.22% (0.18% are Israeli VC funds), as of December 2016. Karin Mayer Rubinstein (Courtesy) Israeli VC funds are central to the success of the Israeli innovation and technology sector, with some 4,600 tech startups in Israel funded by VCs over the past 15 years. There have been some 400 successful exits made by Israeli VC-funded startups over the same period, and there were some 2,700 active Israeli VC-backed startup companies in Israel, as of 2015, the report said. VC backed-startups have been six times more successful than privately backed companies, the report said. Even so, investments by Israeli VC firms in Israeli companies are not growing in pace with the growth of the market. On average, these Israeli VCs invest some $600 million per year in Israeli tech companies, which is just some 12%-16% of total investments made in Israeli technology – a figure that has remained somewhat static over the years, even as deal flow has increased. The remaining funding comes from foreign investors. The main reasons for the lack of participation are based on taxation considerations, the report said, where the Israeli tax regime provides incentives to venture capital firms to minimize the proportion of Israeli investors in the funds. In addition, limitations on management fees discourage local funds from investing in Israeli VCs. For example, the general partners of VCs pay no VAT on management fees from foreign investors while they pay the standard VAT fee for services provided to Israeli investors. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon at the weekly cabinet meeting in the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem on July 31, 2016. (Ohad Zwigenberg/Pool/Flash90) IATI suggests regulatory changes to narrow this gap. These include reducing or removing regulations that discourage Israeli VCs from seeking local investor funding and also discourage local investors from investing in Israeli VCs; setting regulations to allocate a preset percentage of the institutional funds to be invested in Israeli high tech; and providing tax incentives that will encourage more investment. The report also recommends institutions prepare quarterly reports on their investments in Israeli high tech and VC funds and says their investment managers should receive training on alternative investments, including spending a year working with US institutional investors. “These proposed changes will increase the amount of investments of institutional investors in Israeli high tech and will encourage the setting up of additional Israeli VC funds, as an alternative to the foreign VC funds,” the report said. “This will strengthen the high-tech industry which is one of the economy’s main growth engines.” The Israel Securities Authority (ISA) has led a committee for the promotion of investments in public companies that operate in the high-tech field, the recommendations of which were enacted later in a law passed by the Knesset in December 2015. A 2014 report commissioned by the ISA to promote investment in publicly traded tech companies showed that Israeli institutional investors shy away from investing in technology shares because such shares are perceived as being more risky, investors often lack the expertise to understand the technologies involved, and tech companies are relatively small and don’t offer the liquidity these investors require.

But the 32C/64T goodness coming later this year from AMD with Naples is going to be huge for the prosumer/workstation/datacenter markets.     Now we have a tease of what looks like Intel's next-gen Xeon, based on a 32C/64T design, thanks to benchmarks spotted in Geekbench. The new Skylake-EP platform is teased, with the 32C/64T processor running at 2.3GHz, with 46MB of L3 cache, AVX-512 instruction set support, UPI, and the next-gen Stoem Lake OmniPath architecture - making the new Xeon a tasty mix of CPU architecture goodness.     Until now, Intel has only mentioned a 28C/56T processor coming in the Xeon line - but it looks like Intel is responding to AMD's threat of Naples coming in 32C/64T with its own Xeon CPU with 32C/64T of performance. The datacenter/server market is huge, so it only makes sense for chipzilla to get involved in the multi-threaded fight.

Gowdy Defends Nunes' Wacky White House Excursion By John Amato Share Share on facebook Share Share on twitter Share Share on reddit Share Share on sharethis 3/26/17 9:25am 2 days ago by John Amato up Click here for reuse options! Rep. Trey Gowdy told CBS' Face the Nation host John Dickerson that he hadn't seen any of the intelligence Rep. Devin Nunes says he has, but defended the House Intel Committee chairman's highly unusual actions because Trump is the president. Republicans, including Trey Gowdy, went nuts when former president Bill Clinton had an impromptu meeting on an airline runway with then-AG Loretta Lynch, blaming that meeting for shielding Hillary Clinton from being prosecuted for something, when there was no evidence of that at all. Dickerson asked, "Has he shown you any of what caused him to suggest that Obama officials are doing surveillance, captured some Trump campaign associates and then unmasked them in the process of investigating?" Gowdy replied, "He has not shown it to me...I am vaguely familiar with it, no more, no less familiar with it than Adam Schiff is." Rep. Gowdy has no information, though presumably, as the ranking Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff does. The only thing Gowdy has is Nunes' word about why he had to break protocol, and dashed away without even alerting his fellow Republicans on the Intelligence Committee to brief Trump on intel he didn't possess in hand. Gowdy continued with his sophomoric defense, saying, "I will just tell you this. My understanding is Chairman Nunes briefed the Commander-in-Chief on matters unrelated to the Russian investigation, so if that is big deal in Washington, then we have sunk to a new low." Say, what? How does questioning Chairman Nunes' bizarre actions last week mean we've "sunk to a new low?" Gowdy knows from lows. After seven separate committees were formed by Republicans to investigate Benghazi, coming up with nothing, Rep. Gowdy chaired another committee to investigate the same thing. The House Intelligence committee is in the middle of a highly sensitive investigation and Rep. Nunes, uncharacteristically runs to the media and then to Trump, after mysteriously ditching his staff and disappearing the night before and that's not surprising to Rep. Gowdy? Dickerson replied, "I guess Congressman Schiff would say, but the president is the one that is a part of this investigation being done by the committee, so the chairman shouldn't be talking to him." ↓ Story continues below ↓ That is correct. Rep. Nunes acted like a Trump surrogate and not an independent representative chairing an impartial investigation. Gowdy repeated what he said about Nunes not discussing Russia with the president and then said, "So if the Commander-in-Chief cannot be briefed by the chairperson of the House Intel Committee on a matter that has nothing to do with the FBI investigation, then I don't know what they can talk about, John." We have no verification of that at all and Chairman Nunes went to the media in the middle of a very bad week for the Trump administration to try and justify Trump's wacko claims that President Obama wiretapped him. Just like a Trump transition teammate would do. Gowdy then shot down the idea of an independent prosecutor even though Chairman Nunes has destroyed his reputation by mixing all the different aspects of what is being investigated and said, "Independent commission, thank goodness we have one. It's called the FBI. The FBI has counterintelligence jurisdiction and they have criminal jurisdiction." "And what we learned on Monday, and it's about the only thing we learned on Monday, was that the FBI is investigating both." Rep.

Right now, AMD Ryzen rumors are circling about how their processor would only get better with time as BIOS drivers and Windows 10 Scheduler Service updates are released. According to some other rumors, Ryzen would not have new driver support for Windows 7/8.1 and this comes as a disappointing news for people who were not planning to upgrade from Windows 7. Advertisement However, the biggest AMD Ryzen rumor is that Apple has decided to go for an AMD Ryzen APU for their MacBook Pro 2017. This might be possible with Raven Ridge, an AMD APU with Zen core architecture. Raven Ridge is all set to sail through the seas that have been dominated by Intel APU's.  Some Apple rumors suggest that the Cupertino company has decided to use AMD Ryzen because of its superior single thread and multi-thread performance at a lower power draw. The CPU's also run Linux base better than Intel i7. The lower TDP might have led Apple to opt for AMD Ryzen, which ensures maximum productivity at the lower expense of battery cost. AMD Ryzen as of now as been proved to be very effective processors for heavy processing tasks like graphics and editing. Therefore Apple, whose MacBook is a productivity-oriented laptop, would benefit greatly from the AMD Ryzen and Radeon Vega combination in Raven Ridge APUs. AMD Ryzen and Radeon Vega would allow MacBook users to do punchy graphical tasks. As such, AMD Ryzen rumors to be very versatile over a number of Zen architectures. The Raven Ridge would be having DDR4 capable memory, up to 4 Zen CPU cores, Vega architecture GPU, and a 14-nm process node.

And for the first time in three years, toy-maker Lego is no longer the company with the best reputation among U.K. consumers. One company that made big strides was Volkswagen, which saw its reputation score rise from 55.3 in 2016 to 68.3 in 2017. That wasn’t enough, however, to move the automaker back into the 150 companies on the list developed by the Reputation Institute. In the institute’s earlier listing of the companies with the best reputations globally, Volkswagen eked in at number 100 with a score of 64.73. According to the Reputation Institute, there are seven key rational dimensions of reputation: products and services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship, leadership and performance. The Reputation Institute collected about 40,000 ratings from U.K. respondents who are either “somewhat” or “very” familiar with the companies they rated and who have completed at least 75% of the rating survey. The 10 companies and their reputation scores are: Dyson: 86.8 Aston Martin: 85.4 Lego: 85.0 Michelin: 84.0 Sony Corp. (NYSE: SNE): 83.7 Waitrose: 83.5 Intel Corp. (NYSE: INTC): 83.5 PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) Samsung: 83.0 Rolls-Royce Aerospace: 82.3 In the global survey, Rolex finished at the top, followed by Lego and Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS). Sony, Intel and Rolls-Royce also finished in the top 10 globally. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google finished in 11th place and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) ranked 74th, a rather long way behind smartphone competitor Samsung, irrespective of Samsung’s fiasco with its Galaxy Note 7 device.

The case, TC Heartland v. Kraft Heinz, might not appear to be tied to tech at first glance, but is being closely watched by Silicon Valley. Heartland, a beverage flavor company, is appealing a decision over a patent infringement suit it brought against Kraft. Kraft filed the case in Delaware, but Heartland wants it moved to Indiana, its home base. That request, though, was denied by a lower court. Heartland is now challenging that decision. Heartland's problems with the decision parallel a similar issue faced in the tech industry: patent suit plaintiffs frequently seek to move patent cases to a rural district in East Texas, that in recent years has been favorable to such lawsuits. ADVERTISEMENT Defendants in these cases often contend that the ability of the plaintiff to pick the venue disadvantages them. In 2014, one judge in the small Texas town, Marshall, handled about a quarter of all patent infringement cases. 72 percent of all patent holder wins came from this district. Companies dubbed "patent trolls," or entities that hold patents, but usually don't manufacture anything, have filed a slew of lawsuits in the district. That's enraged some tech companies who keep find themselves on the losing side of those suits. Dell, Oracle, Intel and Adobe have all filed amicus briefs in support of Heartland's argument against plaintiff court shopping. Companies on the other side, including Ericsson, who have benefited from the status quo, filed amicus briefs supporting Kraft. During the arguments presented at the Supreme Court today, a lawyer representing Kraft argued that problems stemming from patent cases in East Texas shouldn't affect the case as it pertained to his client. "In other words, it's an inconvenient forum compared to where I am located. They tend to be complaints about how the cases are managed, how discovery takes place, how motions practice is handled, and so on," Kraft's lawyer said. "They are problems that should be dealt with on their own terms..." But several justices questioned that argument. They noted a 1957 Supreme Court decision that said "any civil action for patent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides." Reside being interpreted to mean where it the company was incorporated. A decision is expected by the end of June.

HOUSE VOTE TOMORROW ON BROADBAND PRIVACY: The House will vote Tuesday on eliminating Obama-era Federal Communications Commission privacy regulations on internet service providers.

That measure passed the Senate on Friday in a 50-48 party-line vote. If it passes the House and is signed by President Trump, as is widely expected, the resolution would nullify privacy rules that make it harder for internet providers to sell consumer data. The FCC rules would have required broadband providers to get permission from their customers before using or sharing their data for advertising purposes. The rule covers data including the apps consumers use, the websites they visit and their location.

If the bill is signed into law, as is widely expected, the Fight for the Future campaign will put up billboards in Washington, D.C., and select districts that list the lawmakers who voted for the measure. A draft of the billboard shows a list of the 50 Republicans who voted for the bill on Thursday in the Senate, along with the text, "They betrayed you." Read more here. UK MINISTER ATTACKS TECH OVER ENCRYPTION: British Home Secretary Amber Rudd called encrypted apps "completely unacceptable" on a BBC Sunday talk show in the wake of last week's Westminster attack -- one of multiple officials to call for encryption backdoors. "We need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into encrypted systems like WhatsApp," Rudd said on "The Andrew Marr Show." Police investigating last week's slaying of four people on the Westminster Bridge in London believe Khalid Masood acted alone in the attack, driving a car into pedestrians and stabbing a police officer to death. Officers shot him dead on the scene. Newspapers have reported that Masood, who grew up in Kent, England, used the chatting app "WhatsApp," which is encrypted in a way so that police cannot retrieve messages without his password.

The social media company on Monday announced that it is rolling out three new products to help users more easily find information about their representatives, connect them with those lawmakers and remind the public about local elections. "Building a civically-engaged community means building new tools to help people engage in a thoughtful and informed way," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said of the new tools in a post. "The starting point is knowing who represents you and how you can make your voice heard on the decisions that affect your life." One of the tools, called "Town Hall," will direct users to their representative's Facebook profiles and allow constituents to call, message or email them directly from the app. Read more here. KUSHNER TO LEAD BUSINESS ADVISORY GROUP: The Washington Post reported that President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will head up a group of business leaders that will advise the administration on how to reform government operations.

"We should have excellence in government," Kushner told the Post. "The government should be run like a great American company.

In the case of the Dell Inspiron 7000, you get a beefy gaming computer that can take whatever game designers throw at it. Unfortunately, its physical design is rife with trade-offs. Indeed, you get a pretty great machine when you spend that $2000 on Dell's budget gaming laptop, but you're never gonna forget it's cheap. And $2000 is pretty cheap for a 15-inch gaming laptop with a 7th-generation Intel i5 processor, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti video card, and a 256GB SSD. (The base $1900 model gives you a slightly slower GTX 1050 video card and a traditional 1TB hard drive.) And for those unfamiliar with specs let me be totally clear: this thing flies. I easily squeaked out a little more than 30 frames per second when I played Rise of the Tomb Raider on High settings. On WebXPRT, a popular synthetic benchmark that tests for browser-based activities like spreadsheets, photo editing, and web page loading, the Inspiron 7000 scored a 412, nearly identical to the score notched by the zippy new 33cm Macbook Pro. And it's much faster than the gaming-focused Razer Stealth Blade. The Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming laptop is a device meant to fly despite its price. Nerds will note that it won't give you 60 frames per second on a graphically intensive game like Battlefield 1 or Rise of the Tomb Raider, but 30fps is more than enough for normal mortals. The cheap machine also gives you a really nice full keyboard with keys backlit by red LEDs. Though the red isn't just reserved for the keys. The vents are covered in a fine red mesh, and the top and sides of the laptop are covered in a pleasant soft touch red. "That's gross," a co-worker opined. "I love it," I responded, clutching the giant laptop to my chest. While most budget laptops are thirteen inches or smaller, the Dell Inspiron 7000 is a 15-inch machine. And it's bulky in more than one way, weighing a solid 2.65kg and measuring an inch thick when closed. It's hefty because to keep the price cheap, Dell is using effective — but space consuming — measures to handle the heat put out by the discrete graphics card and processor. (If you want thin, you'll need to spend a lot more money for something like the 2017 Razer Blade, which starts at $2800, or the MSI GT62VR, which starts at around $2300. To manage heat cheaply and efficiently, Dell uses a set of fans which roar to life when playing games. Running a game as simple as Civilisation VI immediately kicked them into high gear and forced me to turn up the volume of the TV I was watching in the background while I played. But the fans definitely kept the laptop cool, too. A few rounds of Overwatch can make some laptops so hot you don't want to touch them, but I had zero issues keeping the Inspiron 7000 on my lap. To get this laptop to such a cheap price Dell also had to skimp on physical build quality and aesthetics. The 15-inch 1080p display is...not good. It just has awful viewing angles. Stoop forward or lean back and you instant get a completely different visual experience. Which is deeply frustrating. Just like the sharp corners of the chassis that dig into your forearms when you type. Ouch. In the end, the roaring fans and a bad screen are constant reminders that you saved a lot of cash to get this laptop. And you did! There are very few laptops in the $1900-$2000 price range that are as efficient and fast as this one. But when you're saving money, you can't get everything you want. If all you care about is playing some games on a PC, then get the Dell Inspiron 7000 Gaming. If you want something beautifully engineered, then keep saving your money. README It's a $2000 laptop that lets you play the newest games on high settings. The display leaves a lot to be desired, but a full-sized HDMI port means you can always plug it into a nice display. A full-size keyboard is welcome for gamers who rely on a number pad. Sharp corners near the palm rests will bite into your forearms. This thing is f**king huge. And its whirling fans are crazy loud.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Keith Olbermann on Monday railed into the drip, drip, drip of Donald Trump’s ties to Russia, noting the question is “not blowing over,” and instead boils down to one word: “Treason.” “The Russia story continues to grow grimmer and bigger and deadlier,” Olbermann said in his latest installment of “The Resistance.” “The word ‘treason’ has been invoked now by the most unlikely of sources,” he continued, noting even former George Bush ethics lawyer Richard Painter has used that term to describe the Trump-Russia connection. Olbermann added the White House “seems to be setting up [former Gen. Mike] Flynn as its scapegoat,” and that House Intel Committee chairman Devin Nunes, who served on the Trump transition team, seems to be a “spasm of panic.” “Not since Kenn Starr have we seen someone who is in effect the prosecutor panic,” Olbermann said, joked that Nunes is acting like “a guy who’s about to flee the country.” He then chastised the House Intel Chairman for going to Trump with information “like a prosecutor handing over evidence to a defendant” in an effort to validate the president’s “amazingly stupid tweet” about Barack Obama. “This is not blowing over, this has not stopped expanding,” Olbermann said, arguing the question is now whether the person we elected president is “loyal to the United States of America or loyal to the Russian Federation.” Watch the video below, via GQ: NEW VIDEO: As we can infer Flynn (and/or others) may seek a deal, and Nunes panics, feel free to call it TREASON pic.twitter.com/hIecEOP5uG — Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) March 28, 2017 Report typos and corrections to corrections@rawstory.com About the Author Next on Raw Story > ‘His word-salad today involves ACTUAL salad’: The internet loses it over Spicer’s Russia outburst By commenting, you agree to our terms of service and to abide by our commenting policy.

Semiconductors -- the microscopically small electrical circuits inside computers -- are going to keep changing the world in ways that can't yet even be imagined, said Thomas Caulfield, GlobalFoundries senior vice president and general manager of Fab 8. "How many people have heard of the internet of things? It's about putting smart technology in about every device you can imagine," Caulfield said Monday evening at Skidmore College. "The only thing that limits this is my imagination, to think of things that can be done." Caulfield delivered the 33rd annual F. William Harder Lecture in Business Administration in the college's Gannett Auditorium. He highlighted the work being done at the GlobalFoundries plant in Malta, one of just a handful of places in the world where the most powerful computer chips are being built. The lecture series brings business leaders to campus to discuss the challenges of changing business environments. With 7-nanometer circuits now being put on chips at Fab 8, Caulfield said the industry again is confronting whether there are limits to Moore's law -- the principle first stated by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 that the number of circuits that can be fitted onto a computer chip can be doubled every two years. "The semiconductor industry is at  crossroads," Caulfield said. "Moore's Law is being challenged by complexity. And that's being done 12 miles away from here." gallery_items: SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE PIN EMAIL 1 of 11 - Skidmore College President Philip Glotzbach speaks before introducing guest speaker Thomas Caulfield.

Fab 8, where more than $12 billion has been invested, produced its first commercial chips in 2012. It has about 3,000 employees in Malta, making chips that go into products built by such major computer and electronics companies as AMD, Samsung and Apple. There is the likelihood of more job growth in the future. "Clearly the technologies we will be adding down the road will lead to job growth," Caulfield said. At 7-nanometers -- a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter -- Caulfield said 10 million circuits can be fitted onto a surface the width of a human hair. There are billions of circuits on a modern computer chip. As the chip-making process has become more complex and costly, he said the number of chip makers has shrunk since the year 2000 from about 15 to just four large companiesr: Intel, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor and GlobalFoundries. GlobalFoundries shortly after its 2009 founding bought Chartered Semiconductor in Singapore and then in 2012 bought IBM's two chip-making plants, building the scale to manufacture efficiently, Caulfield said. He said GlobalFoundries spends $1 billion per year on research and development, and that diversity and a world-wide research network are important parts of achieving new technologies. GlobalFoundries has researchers in India working on problems while their counterparts in the United States are sleeping, he noted. "This happens every 10 years or so in the industry. We think we've outlived Moore's Law, but we always find ways to innovate beyond it," Caulfield told an audience of students, facultyand local business leaders. "When you hire talent, you're hiring it for critical thinking and problem-solving." Diversity is essential to the process, he said. About 140 different cultures are represented within Fab 8's workforce. "You need cultural diversity, you need gender diversity, you need experiential diversity," Caulfield said. "It's about perspective, bringing a variety of perspectives to a problem. A variety of perspectives challenges conformity in decision-making." During a question-and-answer period after the lecture, Caulfield acknowledged that GlobalFoundries and the semiconductor industry generally need to do a better job of recruiting and integrating women into scientific and engineering roles. Women hold only about 17 percent of those jobs in the industry, a statistic Caulfield said is reflected at Fab 8. The lecture was co-sponsored by the Saratoga County Prosperity Partnership, one of Saratoga County's business development organizations.

Requested lifting the policy that limits the number of air strike casualties, after U.S. drones killed over 85 in Syria and as many as 200 in Mosul. The Telegraph reported that on Tuesday, a "suspected US air strike on a school being used as a shelter by families displaced from the Isil-held Syrian city of Raqqa killed at least 33 people on Tuesday, in the latest high civilian casualty raid by the coalition." "On Thursday [March 16], a U.S. Reaper drone struck a gathering in a rebel-held village in Aleppo province, killing as many as 49 people. Monitoring groups say most of the dead were civilians who had gathered at a mosque to pray, while the Pentagon claims the gathering was a meeting of al-Qaeda members," Democracy Now reported on Monday. It's also been reported that "the number of civilian casualties in U.S. airstrikes has been escalating since Donald Trump took office two months ago." And in Mosul: "The American-led military coalition in Iraq said Friday that it was investigating reports that scores of civilians — perhaps as many as 200, according to local residents — had been killed in recent American airstrikes in Mosul, the northern Iraqi city where Iraq’s security forces have been waging a monthslong offensive," reported The New York Times. 3.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) questions witnesses as chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) looks on during a hearing concerning Russian meddling in the 2016 United States election, on Capitol Hill, March 20, 2017 in Washington. Drew Angerer/Getty Images After weeks of ever-so-gradually gathering momentum, just as things were starting to get interesting, the House investigation into President Trump’s ties to Russia has reached an existential crisis of its own. The revelation that the Republican head of the Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, went to the White House grounds to view what he said were classified documents not available to members of Congress, cast new doubt on the independence of investigation under Nunes’ leadership. The old doubt was that Nunes was literally a member of the Trump transition team to the White House, where he was part of a 15-person executive committee that included current Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Trump’s children. If that wasn't bad enough, Nunes’ latest visit to the White House really put the air quotes in the “independent” investigation into Trump’s Russia dealings. After weeks of tip-toeing around the issue, on Monday, the ranking Democratic member on the investigation, Rep. Adam Schiff, had had enough and called for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation: After much consideration, and in light of the Chairman's admission that he met with his source of information at the White House, I believe that the Chairman should recuse himself from any further involvement in the Russia investigation, as well as any involvement in oversight of matters pertaining to any incidental collection of the Trump transition, as he was also a key member of the transition team… I believe the public cannot have the necessary confidence that matters involving the President's campaign or transition team can be objectively investigated or overseen by the Chairman… As to the merits of the Chairman's underlying claim, none of the committee members—Democrats or Republicans—has seen the relevant documents, now almost a week later. Whether the documents support the argument that names were improperly unmasked or distributed, it is impossible to judge, but one thing is very clear: There was no legitimate justification for bringing that information to the White House instead of the committee. That it was also obtained at the White House makes this departure all the more concerning. In the interests of a fair and impartial investigation whose results will be respected by the public, the Chairman's recusal is more than warranted. Elliot Hannon is a writer in New York City.

Brian MacCraith says employers want creative leaders, not first-class honours nerds about 20 hours ago Carl O'Brien DCU president Brian MacCraith: “In this post-Brexit, Trumpian world, the most important thing we can do for this nation is talent development.” Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons         Whenever he asks employers about the must-have skills they want in today’s graduates, Dublin City University president Brian MacCraith gets much the same answer. “The head of one of the country’s biggest consultancy firms said to me, ‘It’s as simple as this: the first-class honours nerd is no good for us. It takes us 18 months to get any value from that person – and by then it’s probably too late.’ Employers tell us they want graduates who can solve problems, lead teams, innovate, build relationships and strengthen their organisations”. Creative thinkers and problem-solvers have been buzzwords in education and employment circles for a while now, but MacCraith says newer traits are also in demand. Emotional intelligence is coming up more and more, he says. Digital literacy is also high on the agenda. Still, he says if there is one attribute that looks set to grow in importance over the coming years, it boils down to this: adaptability. “The ability to assess the world around you. To adjust to change. We know the job for life is long gone. The ability to change, and to apply thinking skills to new paradigms, is critically important.” Blurring pace The pace of change is so blurry in some sectors that students start a course, only to find the landscape has fundamentally changed by the time they graduate. This poses real challenges for higher education. To ensure Ireland remains competitive, our education system must react quickly, MacCraith says. For DCU,this means integrating these key skills into the 2,500 modules that underpin the college’s degree programmes. MacCraith says all incoming students are now provided with an e-portfolio that acts as a digital archive of personal development framed around these key attributes.The concept, he says, is a “living degree”, which adapts to the changing environment. ADVERTISEMENT For the university, it means anticipating change coming down the tracks. One plans involves much earlier engagement with employers to see where skills trends are heading, rather than responding when it’s too late to fill gaps in the economy. Another involves crowdsourcing ideas from alumni to inform the future direction of the university. It has built a online platform (DCU Fuse) to help capture these ideas, which will feed into its upcoming strategic plan. DCU Fuse is due to be launched shortly. “Our education system needs to demonstrate, and be allowed to demonstrate, the same adaptability that is expected of our graduates,” MacCraith says. Servicing economy To some, such a relentless focus on meeting the changing needs of big business is a slippery slope. Universities, so the argument goes, are increasingly servicing the needs of the economy rather than focusing on their role as independent centres of critical scholarship. Against this backdrop, some critics say the very meaning of education is mutating from its original focus on human development to being a producer of human capital for the market economy. MacCraith has heard the argument and rejects it on the basis that employers are not calling the shots over any of its courses. He cites a new DCU data analytics degree course, an area in high demand across the globe. The degree was cowritten with key companies in the sector, among them Accenture, IBM and Intel. The course includes “industry pods”, in which industry partners will deliver domain-specific modules from their expertise area. The prospect will doubtless horrify some academics who worry that higher education is increasingly utilitarian in nature. MacCraith, however, is unapologetic. “When you got extremes, of course it is wrong – but that’s not what’s happening. There’s no single company asking what to put into our degree. We ask companies for advice on issues of relevance . . . We’re not changing the fundamentals of the degrees or the analytical mindsets or the understanding of the disciplines. But in terms of focus areas, we’re making sure our graduates are prepared to move straight in. That, to me, is hugely sensible.” Greater contributions So, if employers benefit so much, should they contribute more to higher education? MacCraith endorses the recommendations of last year’s Cassells report into the future of higher education funding, which calls for a greater contribution from employers as well as the State and students. This report envisaged that business would contribute about €150 million extra to the sector through an increase in a payroll levy known as the National Training Fund. Employers have signalled a willingness to contribute more, but only if they are satisfied that any extra funding goes towards meeting their skills needs. Politically, however, the most sensitive issue is whether students – and their families – should be asked to contribute more. MacCraith believes they should, along with the State and employers, if Ireland is serious about building a higher education system to compete with the world’s best. An Australian-style income-contingent loan scheme for students may be the best way of delivering this, he says. Colleges currently receive about €7,000 per student through a combination of student charges, the State contribution and other sources. A €2,000 increase, MacCraith says, it would go a long way to tackling the “funding crisis” facing higher education. If this was split between student and the State, it would work out at €1,000 extra per student, on top of the existing €3,000 registration charge. “It won’t solve everything,he acknowledges, “but we will need proper investment if we are to run universities which can compete at a reasonably equal level internationally.” ADVERTISEMENT Any funding model, he says, must address equity of access. The existing “free fees” system has not narrowed the social divide to any significant degree. An income-contingent loan system, he says, will ensure that higher education is accessible to all, with scope for an enhanced maintenance support system for less well-off students. “A model like this would be free at the point of entry, which is very attractive for families with kids going to college at the same time. Any solution, though, will have to be strong on the issue of support for students from really challenged socioeconomic backgrounds. More debt One of the main arguments against an income-contingent loan system is heaping yet more debt on the shoulders of young people. Another is that debt-averse students from poorer areas will stay well away from higher education. But MacCraith says the facts don’t back up these arguments. “Look at Australia. It didn’t happen. Those arguments don’t stack up. It’s an unusual loan – you only start paying it back when your salary crosses a sensible threshold. “So, if your education doesn’t provide you with a job, you don’t pay at all. For that, and other reasons, that argument about being loan-averse or debt-averse doesn’t stack up. The evidence doesn’t support it.” Most political observers say there is little chance of a minority Government delivering anything as contentious as student loans. MacCraith, however, says broad agreement could be reached on a “sensible” loans system. “It will need a political consensus, particularly across the two main political parties. There are constructive conversations taking place. “This is about it’s about a bravery of decision-making and recognising the pre-eminent importance of talent development for the future of the nation . . . in this post-Brexit, Trumpian world, the most important thing we can do for this nation is talent development.” Panel: Education expansion: Ireland’s fastest growing university It started in 1980 with just 200 students on the grounds of what was the Albert Agricultural College. Today DCU, the country’s fastest-growing university, has grown to accommodate some 17,000 students. Half of that expansion has come in the past five years alone. It now has four campuses within a 1km radius: the original Glasnevin campus, along with its innovation campus close by on the Old Finglas Road, the All Hallows campus , and its new education campus at Drumcondra. The latter incorporates St Patrick’s College, along with the Mater Dei Institute of Education and the Church of Ireland College of Education. There’s talk of an electric bus service linking the campuses together, while the Metro North (assuming it ever gets built) is scheduled to run across the university’s expanded footprint. DCU says further planned developments will see its student population grow beyond 20,000 with the construction of a new student centre, sports facilities, on-campus accommodation and new digital teaching spaces. At a time of a “financial crisis” in higher education and cash-strapped colleges, how on earth can DCU managed to finance this? Simple: through long-term loans from investment funds and the European Investment Bank. Changes everything As well as changing the college’s physical presence, expansion is also changing the profile of students. “We’re Ireland’s university of enterprise, with a strong focus on engaging with enterprise in all forms and developing enterprising and innovative mindsets in our students,” says DCU president Brian MacCraith. “Now, we have the first first faculty of education in a university, north or south. It creates a virtuous circle. We’re educating 21st-century educators in a research-intensive environment, with the full continuum of education taking place in one location.” A longer-term plan, he says, is to expose students to a much broader learning experience by incorporating elements of the arts or humanities into technology, science or other disciplines. ADVERTISEMENT “We want to contribute to students’ awareness of cultural capital and introduce a broader learning experience. It means we can now introduce philosophy or look at exposure to the arts, as part of a richer experience.”       Topics: Brian Maccraith Albert Agricultural College Church of Ireland College of Education Dublin City University Mater Dei Institute Of Education Accenture IBM Intel Drumcondra Glasnevin Read More Time to get moving on technological universities Brexit could lead to increase in CAO points for Irish students School stress: how teachers are helping children cope with anxiety How I got my A1 in Maths How I got my A1 in English Ask Brian: My son in US wants to study arts in Ireland.

By Bill Press - 03/27/17 06:22 PM EDT 550   © Getty Images After one of the most devastating defeats suffered by any president, Donald TrumpDonald TrumpRussian billionaire denies aiding Putin with Manafort Liberal groups plan protests against Gorsuch Baldwin on Trump: 'I just didn’t want to play him' MORE responded in classic fashion: He made it up. First, he denied he’d ever promised to repeal — ObamaCare. “I never said ‘repeal and replace — ObamaCare,’ ” he told reporters in the Oval Office. “You’ve heard all my speeches. I never said ‘repeal and replace within 64 days.’ ” In fact, according to the Daily Mail, he’s quoted 68 times promising to repeal — ObamaCare, at least four times promising to do so not within 64 days but immediately. Second, he blamed Democrats for the fall of TrumpCare, even though they were not part of the equation at all. Everybody knew that not one House Democrat would vote to repeal —ObamaCare. That’s why Trump didn’t reach out to or schmooze with any one of them. No, this debacle lies strictly at the feet of Speaker Paul RyanPaul RyanMcConnell: ObamaCare 'status quo' will stay in place moving forward The Hill's 12:30 Report House GOP insists: We’re not giving up on ObamaCare repeal MORE (R-Wis.). He crafted a bad plan, tried to force in through in 18 days and then couldn’t even produce enough Republican votes. The big question is: What happens next? And the answer depends on whether Trump learned anything from his complete humiliation. Now, I’m not Robert Costa. I’m the last person Trump would call personally, so I don’t know what lessons, if any, he did learn. But I know what lessons he should have learned. Here they are, Mr. President, three of them: One, don’t trust Paul Ryan. He’s a weak leader. He can’t deliver. Plus, he’s the embodiment of the Washington establishment you ran against. Democrats don’t respect him. But neither do the members of his own Republican conference. On healthcare, he sold you a bill of goods. You were crazy to fall for it once. Don’t let him fool you again. Two, don’t trust the Freedom Caucus. This is the old “Tea Party.” You must understand: They came to Washington to shut government down, not to make it work better.  You can’t count on them to be for anything you want to do because they’re simply against everything. Three, work with Democrats. Seriously, if you really want to get things done, don’t count on Republicans. They don’t know how to govern. And most of them don’t care. So stop smearing Democrats and reach out to them, instead.  They’re not the “party of no.” They’re the “action party.” As a deal-maker, bring back the days, not so long ago, when Democrats and Republicans worked together to solve problems. On many issues — jobs, infrastructure, trade, taxes, criminal justice — there are opportunities to find common ground with Democrats.  Yes, even on healthcare. Democrats know — ObamaCare’s not perfect. They’re ready to work with you to make it better. By lowering the price of prescription drugs, for example. Or by lowering the cost of premiums and adding a Medicare -for-everybody option to help achieve your goal of universal coverage. One last bit of advice, Mr. President: Stop tweeting.  The novelty has worn off. Nobody pays attention anymore. It’s not very presidential. And it makes you look silly.   Press is host of “The Bill Press Show” on Free Speech TV and author of “Buyer’s Remorse: How Obama Let Progressives Down.” The views expressed by this author are their own and are not the views of The Hill.

Janz Tec announced an industrial PC due in the second quarter that provides a choice of Mini-ITX mainboards running Intel’s 6th Generation “Skylake” or 7th Gen (“Kaby Lake”) Core processors. The “Falcon Active” datasheet, however, lists only two Skylake-based full-height Mini-ITX options. The computer is available with Advantech’s AIMB-275G2 or Fujitsu’s slightly more feature-rich D3433-S. Falcon Active with mounting wings and optional hot-swap SATA RAID drives (click image to enlarge) Although Janz Tec does not list any 7th Gen option, due to the similarity between the Skylake and Kaby Lake generations, it’s possible these same boards will at some point become available in slightly different SKUs designed for Kaby Lake. Janz Tec lists no OS support. Both of these Mini-ITX options are primarily Windows devices that also support Linux. Considering Janz Tec’s previous Linux experience — last month they released an emPC-A/RPI3 industrial controller built around the Raspberry Pi 3 — we imagine Linux will be available. Advantech AIMB-275G2 (left) and block diagram (click images to enlarge) The stainless steel housed Falcon Active offers no ruggedization features — the temperature range is 0 to 50°C — but is promoted for its compact, 328 x 201 x 88.8mm dimensions and flexible mounting options. The latter include wall, rack, desktop, and server configurations. Fujitsu D3433-S (left) and detail view (click images to enlarge) The Falcon Active is also touted for its active cooling concept, jointly designed with heatsink specialists, EKL AG. The system includes a beveled CPU cooler with “maximum heat dissipation performance, combined with an intelligent PWM-controlled active cooling controller that optimizes airflow direction.” The system is also fitted with a replaceable “class M6” air filter. Falcon Active with internal SATA The Falcon Active includes dual 2.5-inch storage trays with one or two SATA drives that can be purchased with an optional Hot-Swap Storage Expansion Kit with RAID 1 support. The computer provides either a 12V DC DIN or a 12-24V DC Phoenix power supply depending on whether you choose the Advantech or Fujutsu option, respectively. Aside from the power supplies, the capabilities and exposed ports available with the two Mini-ITX options are very similar. The only other differences we can see include the availability of 4x USB 2.0 ports with the Fujitsu D3433-S vs. 2x on the Advantech AIMB-275G2. Both boards’ 6x USB 3.0 ports are exposed on the Falcon Active. In addition, either option provides triple display support, but the D3433-S gives you DVI-D and dual DisplayPorts while the AIMB-275G2 offers HDMI, DisplayPort, and VGA ports. Regardless of the Mini-ITX options, the Falcon Active supports up to 32GB DDR4 via dual sockets. You get dual GbE ports, an RS232 port, and an HD audio jack in addition to the USB and display ports.   Further information The Falcon Active will be available in the second quarter.

The case, TC Heartland v. Kraft Heinz, might not appear to be tied to tech at first glance, but is being closely watched by Silicon Valley. Heartland, a beverage flavor company, is appealing a decision over a patent infringement suit it brought against Kraft. Kraft filed the case in Delaware, but Heartland wants it moved to Indiana, its home base. That request, though, was denied by a lower court. Heartland is now challenging that decision. Heartland's problems with the decision parallel a similar issue faced in the tech industry: patent suit plaintiffs frequently seek to move patent cases to a rural district in East Texas, that in recent years has been favorable to such lawsuits. ADVERTISEMENT Defendants in these cases often contend that the ability of the plaintiff to pick the venue disadvantages them. In 2014, one judge in the small Texas town, Marshall, handled about a quarter of all patent infringement cases. 72 percent of all patent holder wins came from this district. Companies dubbed "patent trolls," or entities that hold patents, but usually don't manufacture anything, have filed a slew of lawsuits in the district. That's enraged some tech companies who keep find themselves on the losing side of those suits. Dell, Oracle, Intel and Adobe have all filed amicus briefs in support of Heartland's argument against plaintiff court shopping. Companies on the other side, including Ericsson, who have benefited from the status quo, filed amicus briefs supporting Kraft. During the arguments presented at the Supreme Court today, a lawyer representing Kraft argued that problems stemming from patent cases in East Texas shouldn't affect the case as it pertained to his client. "In other words, it's an inconvenient forum compared to where I am located. They tend to be complaints about how the cases are managed, how discovery takes place, how motions practice is handled, and so on," Kraft's lawyer said. "They are problems that should be dealt with on their own terms..." But several justices questioned that argument. They noted a 1957 Supreme Court decision that said "any civil action for patent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides." Reside being interpreted to mean where it the company was incorporated. A decision is expected by the end of June.

HOUSE VOTE TOMORROW ON BROADBAND PRIVACY: The House will vote Tuesday on eliminating Obama-era Federal Communications Commission privacy regulations on internet service providers.

That measure passed the Senate on Friday in a 50-48 party-line vote. If it passes the House and is signed by President Trump, as is widely expected, the resolution would nullify privacy rules that make it harder for internet providers to sell consumer data. The FCC rules would have required broadband providers to get permission from their customers before using or sharing their data for advertising purposes. The rule covers data including the apps consumers use, the websites they visit and their location.

If the bill is signed into law, as is widely expected, the Fight for the Future campaign will put up billboards in Washington, D.C., and select districts that list the lawmakers who voted for the measure. A draft of the billboard shows a list of the 50 Republicans who voted for the bill on Thursday in the Senate, along with the text, "They betrayed you." Read more here. UK MINISTER ATTACKS TECH OVER ENCRYPTION: British Home Secretary Amber Rudd called encrypted apps "completely unacceptable" on a BBC Sunday talk show in the wake of last week's Westminster attack -- one of multiple officials to call for encryption backdoors. "We need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into encrypted systems like WhatsApp," Rudd said on "The Andrew Marr Show." Police investigating last week's slaying of four people on the Westminster Bridge in London believe Khalid Masood acted alone in the attack, driving a car into pedestrians and stabbing a police officer to death. Officers shot him dead on the scene. Newspapers have reported that Masood, who grew up in Kent, England, used the chatting app "WhatsApp," which is encrypted in a way so that police cannot retrieve messages without his password.

The social media company on Monday announced that it is rolling out three new products to help users more easily find information about their representatives, connect them with those lawmakers and remind the public about local elections. "Building a civically-engaged community means building new tools to help people engage in a thoughtful and informed way," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said of the new tools in a post. "The starting point is knowing who represents you and how you can make your voice heard on the decisions that affect your life." One of the tools, called "Town Hall," will direct users to their representative's Facebook profiles and allow constituents to call, message or email them directly from the app. Read more here.

Details News desk 27 March 2017 News Next Article Choice Of MCE Nominee: Frank Okpeyen Is Our Man! ...Evalue-Gwira NPP Rally Behind Constituency Secretary  Typography Font Size Default Reading Mode Share This By Tricia Ama Woode   Ghanaians are anxious to see the day they can transfer money from one mobile network to the other without any serious financial implications and hassle and news of a project to make that a reality was recently received with enthusiasm. However, that enthusiasm may be short-lived as there are indications that the Interoperability for mobile money contract awarded Sibton Switch Systems by the Bank of Ghana is being tempered with and a total cancellation being considered. Should that happen, it will be a clear case of the replay of the Bankswitch issue which ended up in a huge judgement debt to the state.  Insider information available to this paper has it that following the recent brouhaha over the award of a contract for the establishment of a national switch to make mobile money payments and other transfers interoperable, the Bank Of Ghana decided to subject the contract to another review even though it had long been signed and sealed. It is unclear what the Vice President’s office which was petitioned over the matter, might have suggested to the BOG. This paper has learnt that aside the review, the Economic and Organised Crime Organisation (EOCO) has been on this beat and the same issue is also said to have landed in court. Should things play out as envisaged by some analysts, the already impoverished economy will be forced to cough amounts close to half a billion dollars as compensation in judgement debt claims and that will be awful for the country and the government.   It would be recalled that Bankswitch filed before the Permanent Court of Arbitration, in The Hague, the Netherlands for the payment of GH¢853 million in damages for the cancellation of a contract signed with the Government of Ghana in 2007 for the management of a platform for the revenue mobilisation programme of the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA). The contract, according to the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mrs Marietta Brew Appiah-Oppong was signed at a time, the State already had a contract with GCNET and a number of Destination Inspection Companies (DICs) performing the same functions for which Bankswitch was being contracted to perform. The award by the Court, following the arguments by the Attorney General, is a reduction of about GH¢600 million from claims filed by Bankswitch. The Attorney General publicly stated that despite the signing of the contract in 2007, the company had not started operations until 2009, following which the contract was terminated because of the existence of the GCNET platform and DICs with which government still had a contract. In the ongoing drama, a contract for the setting up of a switch for mobile money services interoperability was openly advertised, more than one entities applied and one won, Sibton Switch Systems. Two failed bidders raised concerns after the central bank awarded the contract to Sibton Switch, citing bidding cost differences and procedures as their reasons. Bidders were supposed to use their own funds to construct the switch and operate over a period of time in order to generate revenue to cover their investments. These are all agreed to and the just when the Switch is almost ready, the usual business-political gymnastics begins.  The contract for a third party to interoperate the electronic retail payment system was awarded to Sibton Switch who are offering to execute the works using a self-financing mechanism to raise GHC4.6 billion on their own to build a robust interface intended to ensure efficiency in revenue mobilisation among numerous other benefits. The two other companies that lost out of the bid were Vals Intel and Mericom Services Ltd. The two quoted GHC 14m and GHC 4m respectively while the winning firm, Sibton opted to undertake the project raising GHC 4.6billion for it. Vals Intel, one of the two companies has conceded that it misunderstood portions of the bidding process as a result of which they might have lost the contract. Executive Chairman of the company, Mr Kojo Graham told JOY FM that their misunderstanding of the process resulted in the company stating in their bid documents that they will prepare bill for the BOG to pay after the period they planned to operate the switch. This paper can confirm that chief among the various options being pushed for by the failed bidders is for the BOG to cancel the already signed contract, an action that could have serious legal and financial consequences on government.  For instance, since the contract was awarded last year, Sibton Switch has been working assiduously to put up the switch as per the specifications and guidelines of the BOG. Investigations by this paper reveals that several engineering works and installations, making up the construction of the hardware and software infrastructure are almost ready for the commencement of the contract’s execution this month.  Following the media enquiries over the contract, insider information has it that experts have suggest a number of options including a process to verify whether or not the winning bid did so genuinely and whether it has the technical and financial capabilities to fulfil the contract’s mandate. But that suggestion seems to have been ignored by certain individual officials at the Bank of Ghana who are believed to be manipulated by the losing firms.  Over the last two decades, the recklessness of state officials has resulted in government being compelled to pay judgements debts, incurred under questionable actions. The situation took political undertone with the current NPP administration promising to avoid Judgement debt payments.  In his maiden State of the Nation Address, President Akuffo Addo promised to respect and protect the sanctity of all contracts, including those singed under his predecessor as a way of avoiding frivolous judgement debts. On countless occasions, the Vice President had also assured of a new way of doing things where the private sector and the international private sector regime are facilitated by government to succeed to among other thing, enable them expand, grow and generate opportunities for employment, investments, because in their own words, “the private sector is the engine of growth”.  “Ghana needs money, it needs investment and not losing both.

Not so fast. By Evan Thies, opinion contributor - 03/27/17 04:00 PM EDT 22   © Getty Images Suddenly, it’s nice to be a Democrat again. Trump is as low as it gets in polls. Federal judges have blocked the travel ban (again). The White House’s Russia problems seemingly have no end. And the GOP’s anointed savior, Paul RyanPaul RyanMcConnell: ObamaCare 'status quo' will stay in place moving forward The Hill's 12:30 Report House GOP insists: We’re not giving up on ObamaCare repeal MORE, just did a swan dive into the healthcare pool and discovered there was no water. Ah, yes. Finally, after months of utter despondency, it feels like it’s time to celebrate. ADVERTISEMENT But let’s calm down a bit. I would remind my party that we have been here before, and it has not turned out well. The Republicans may be losing — but that doesn’t mean we’re winning. To win, we have to improve our own image, not just tear down the other guy. In other words, we need to govern.   Let me take you back to late October 2016. The Access Hollywood tape was on every screen in America, Trump was rated as the most disliked presidential candidate of all-time, and The Donald had just thoroughly embarrassed himself in the final presidential debate. A few weeks later, Trump was president. Why? Republicans rallied behind their candidate everywhere while disaffected Democrats stayed home in key areas or even voted for Trump. Even though the Democrats spent all their time and energy during the campaign making sure every last American knew how dangerous and reprehensible Trump was, it wasn’t enough. Republicans voted in lock-step for their party, not their candidate, because the GOP brand is bulletproof: low taxes, small government, strong military. Meanwhile, what did Democrats stand for? Unfortunately, we stood for four more years of a Democratic agenda that, right or wrong, many Americans did not think matched their sense of concern about the direction of the country. But, mainly, we stood against Donald TrumpDonald TrumpRussian billionaire denies aiding Putin with Manafort Liberal groups plan protests against Gorsuch Baldwin on Trump: 'I just didn’t want to play him' MORE. Then we lost. Yet here we are again. “No” is the war cry of the Democrats. Many think “resistance” can rile up our party this time. That’s not completely wrong. There is no doubt that we are more energetic and engaged than we were last year because we have things to fight. These are things that matter. And resist we must. But, as we learned last year, “no” isn’t enough. A recent CBS survey showed that “resisters” to Trump and his agenda make up a solid third of the country. That is the Democratic base, more or less. But while polling shows these Americans and other Democrats are ready to dump Trump, there is a significant segment of Democrats that is still lukewarm to the Democratic Party and its representatives in Congress. In fact, less than half of “resisters” think Democrats are effective in Congress. Many Democrats say that obstructionism worked for the Republicans, and we should follow suit. That’s half true. But we’re missing a step. Republicans obstructed, then offered an easily understandable (however deceptively dishonest) alternative. And, importantly, the alternative — a tax-cutting, government-hating, war-monger — was on message with the Republican brand. That’s how they won. So we should at least be proposing real alternatives to the GOP agenda that make us known as the party of popular ideas and competent governing — and aren’t just the status quo. And even maybe (gasp!) work with Republicans to get them done. Imagine, for instance, that we came back at the GOP with our plan on how to improve ObamaCare, instead of just spiking the ball and high-fiving? We acknowledge changes to the Affordable Healthcare Act are necessary, and it would be a good opportunity to marginalize the real threat: staunch conservatives in Congress. The nomination fight over Neil Gorsuch is another important opportunity to prove we are more prudent than political. Gorsuch is certainly not the candidate Dems would have chosen — and there are real questions about his seemingly ideological support for corporations over people. But he is, overall, center-right and not right-right. In other words, he is the justice a Republican Congress and president chooses. Democrats filibustering Gorsuch’s nomination will do nothing to improve our brand at a critical moment when we need to — and have the opportunity to — look like the adults in Washington. In fact, blocking Gorsuch could hurt us with the people we need to persuade to our side at the polls. Unfortunately, that is not the prevailing opinion among Democrats. Party leaders feel the momentum is with us and we have to keep beating the other side to keep it going. But the next four years of Democratic messaging can’t be about what Trump and the Republicans are or aren’t doing — or how we’re stopping them. They have to be about what we’re getting done.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Dow extends longest slide since 2011 Margreet Dietz Tuesday March 28, 2017 1 Share Play NBR radio on Wall Street's longest losing streak since 2011 continued as investors digested the implications of the Trump administration's decision to withdraw its healthcare reform plan on pledges of a tax overhaul and infrastructure spending. US Treasuries gained, sending yields on the 10-year note six basis points lower to 2.373%, the lowest in a month. Gold, another safe-haven asset, advanced 0.6% to $US1255.40 an ounce. US crude oil prices fell 0.5% to $US47.73 a barrel. "It is less of a panic sell and more of digesting the information and looking beyond the healthcare reform act to the next bit of information, which is going to be tax reform and spending on infrastructure," Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at the Private Client Group at US Bank, told Reuters. At the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 45.74 points, or 0.2%, to 20,550.98. The Standard & Poor's 500 lost 0.1% to 2341.59 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.2% to 5840.37. "With the economy continuing to improve, I would look at any pullback as a buying opportunity at this point in time," Watkins noted. Some analysts say the Trump administration's failure on the healthcare bill suggests they face an even tougher road ahead for tax reform. "The consensus on [the tax reform] is probably likely to be much more difficult to achieve than on health care, which suggests that a lot of the optimism about the reflation and fiscal stimulus trade may well have to be reassessed as well," Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, wrote in a note, Bloomberg reported. The Dow's 1.9% decline over the past eight sessions is a far cry from the 6.7% it lost during its previous slide of that length in 2011 when the U.S. government was embroiled in a debt impasse,  Du Pont, Dow Chemical rise The Dow fell as declines in shares of Chevron and those of Verizon Communications, down 1.6% and 1.3% respectively, outweighed gains in shares of DuPont and those of Intel, up 1.4% and 0.7% respectively. Shares of DuPont posted the largest percentage gain in the Dow in afternoon trading, while Dow Chemical shares rose after the companies received the green light for their mega merger from the European Commission by agreeing to sell assets, notably major parts of DuPont's global pesticide business. The approval is conditional in particular on the divestiture of major parts of DuPont's global pesticide business, including its global R&D organisation, the EC said in a statement. "Pesticides are products that matter-to farmers, consumers and the environment," European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in the statement. "We need effective competition in this sector so companies are pushed to develop products that are ever safer for people and better for the environment."   In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.45 decline from the previous close. France's CAC 40 Index slipped less than 0.1%, while the UK's FTSE 100 Index slid 0.6%, as did Germany's DAX Index. (BusinessDesk) 1 · Got a question about this story?

Reporters in the briefing room today pressed Sean Spicer on how House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes was on White House grounds at the National Security Council Offices before he publicly commented on “incidental surveillance” of Trump transition team members. Spicer was asked whether there was an executive branch leak to Nunes, and he said, “We’re not concerned about that.” He got questions about who signed Nunes in, whether the White House would pursue a leak investigation, with one NBC’s Hallie Jackson asking, “Why is this leak okay but other leaks are not?” Spicer said there’s a difference between a leak and a member of Congress like Nunes being cleared to receive certain information. A bit later CBS’ Major Garrett revisited that and said, “Members of Congress may not need to be cleared in, but to get access to a SCIF, I do believe that requires some cooperation from the executive branch.” The New York Times‘ report includes this statement from a Nunes spokesman explaining why he was on White House grounds: The spokesman for Mr. Nunes, Jack Langer, said the congressman met with his source at the White House because he needed access to a secure facility where people with security clearances can legally view classified information. But such facilities can also be found in the Capitol building, and other locations across Washington. You can watch clips above, via CNN.

Page 1 of 4. 35 Comments For those curious about the impact of GCC compiler optimization levels, a variety of benchmarks were carried out using GCC 6.3 on Intel's Clear Linux platform. We've done it before, but with GCC continuing to advance, here are some fresh compiler benchmarks. New to this round of testing is also more tests looking at the compile time impact as well as the binary size difference. Aside from the test profiles dedicated to measuring the install time of a particular program, a new module in the Phoronix Test Suite allows generating compile time graphs for any of the test profiles. With the Phoronix Test Suite being standardized and fully-automated and already tracking how long it takes to install a given test, it was an easy addition. This additional data can be accessed by setting the INSTALL_TIMES_ARE_A_BENCHMARK=1 environment variable prior to running the Phoronix Test Suite. Similarly, there is also a INSTALL_SIZES_ARE_A_BENCHMARK=1 environment variable too. When that is set, it will report the overall size of the test installation directory. It's important to note that it's not just the binary size generated by GCC, due to the Phoronix Test Suite approach being universal, it's the overall size of the test install directory. But in this testing with only changing out the compiler flags, you can see the change in resulting binary size. Those wishing to extend this PTS module functionality or make other improvements can find this simple module on GitHub. The support will be found in the upcoming Phoronix Test Suite 7.0.1 release. Intel's Clear Linux was used for benchmarking with a Core i7 6800K system. GCC 6.3.0 was tested with the flags of -Os, -Og, -O0, -O0 -march=native, -O1 -march=native, -O2 -march=native, -O3, -O3 -march=native, and -Ofast -march=native. Once GCC 7.1 is officially released, there will be similar tests there. All of these benchmarks were carried out in a fully-automated manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

Afternic.com currently has partnerships with dozens of other popular domain name auction sites, and can thereby consistently generate up to 75 million daily views of auctioned domain names in real-time through its expansive domain name reseller networks, so that these top-level dot-com domain names will sell to investors, speculators, and content developers in a relatively short amount of time. These single-digit length (from 5/five to 6/six letters in domain name length) .coms cover recruiting, resumes, and HR (www.e-Bio.com), armed forces and comic superheroes (www.e-Hero.com), workouts, fitness and personal health care (www.e-Gym.com), interactive digital storytelling (www.e-Tale.com), mental health and self improvement (www.e-Self.com), the Internet Super Highway (www.e-Hwy.com), and CPG and FMCG chips and snackfoods (www.e-Dip.com). A nine letter top-level e- dot-com domain, e-Pinball.com is also being sold, as well as these other seven 5 to 6 letter e- dot-com top-level domains. Domain names that begin with e- ("electronic") are especially valuable these days, due to the advent of affordable consumer electronics, affordable virtual reality 3D, i3D, VR, and AR, and affordable HD (2K) and UHD (4K, or IMAX) iTV Sets, most of which now feature eight-core processors with hundreds of i3D DSPs, or "CUDA" graphics processing cores (also known as "GPUs") from nVidia, Intel and AMD. Many of the domain name vendors recommend putting e- in front of the dot-com domain you seek to get, especially the short ones, if you cannot acquire a three or four letter dot come, which are all valued in the millions at this point in time. Despite many of these domains having a high six-figure or eventually seven-figure net worth, they are currently being offered in the low-five-figure to mid-six-figure pricing range. This ultimately makes them affordable for digital content production businesses, or to top-level dot-com domain investors, for purchase as investments, or for resale to leading industry brand clients. These domains represent less than 10% of the top-level dot-com domains currently in production at the interactive 3D content development agency, and were secured back in the 20th Century, for projects which have been put on the backburner to focus on client work, as well as other higher-profile i3D projects targeted at the currently exploding iTV Set, SmartWatches, Casual Games, i3D websites and interactive eBook market segments. This agency has created i3D content production assets for some of the world's largest consumer electronic manufacturing brands, including: Sony, Samsung, Epson, Tyco, Mitsubishi, Nokia, Teac, ViewSonic, Compaq (now HP), Digital (DEC), Western Digital, CTX, KDS, ADI, KFC, SGI, Sun Microsystems (now Oracle), Electrohome (now Christie Digital), Eizo Nanao, and Micron Electronics. Domain names which denote virtualized (3D or i3D, and VR or AR) user experiences, such as e-Gym.com, e-Hero.com, and e-Tale.com, and iTV user experiences, such as iTVset.com, iTVclock.com, and iTVart.com, are often typed directly into the browser by the end-users, in an attempt to find leading-edge e- (virtual) and iTV content experiences by the end-user. It is important to note that there are currently billions of iTV Sets and consumer electronics devices with built-in i3D processors (GPUs) and consumers continue to switch their electronic highway, virtual reality, and i3D game playing activities from their 5 inch smartphones onto their 55 inch (and oftentimes 65 to 75 inch) iTV sets. Whereas most people have one Smartphone and one Tablet or eBook Reader, they have iTV Sets in every bedroom, the family room, the living room, in their home office, and many even have iTV Sets in their kitchen.

And should that happen, it will be a clear case of the Bankswitch issue which landed the state in a huge judgement debt in 2007. Insider information available to this paper has it that following the recent brouhaha over the award of a contract for the establishment of a national switch to make mobile money payments and other transfers interoperable, the Bank of Ghana decided to subject the contract to another review even though it had long been signed and sealed. It is unclear what the Vice President’s office which was petitioned over the matter, might have suggested to the BOG which by the country’s laws is an independent institution and cannot be subjected to the direction of individuals and groups of people outside the bank’s remit. This paper has learnt that aside the review, the Economic and Organised Crime Organisation (EOCO) has been on this beat and the same issue is also said to have landed in court. Should things play out as envisaged by some analysts, the already impoverished economy will be forced to cough amounts close to half a billion dollars as compensation in judgement debt claims and that will be awful for the country and the government. Perhaps a recap of the Bankswitch episode will be useful here. Bankswitch had filed before the Permanent Court of Arbitration, in The Hague, the Netherlands for the payment of GH¢853 million in damages for the cancellation of a contract signed with the Government of Ghana in 2007 for the management of a platform for the revenue mobilisation programme of the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA). The contract, according to the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mrs Marieta Brew Appiah-Oppong was signed at a time, the State already had a contract with GCNET and a number of Destination Inspection Companies (DICs) performing the same functions for which Bankswitch was being contracted to perform. The award by the Court, following the arguments by the Attorney General, is a reduction of about GH¢600 million from claims filed by Bankswitch. The Attorney General told the Daily Graphic that despite the signing of the contract in 2007, the company had not started operations until 2009, following which the contract was terminated because of the existence of the GCNET platform and DICs with which government still had a contract. In the latest ongoing drama, a contract for the setting up of a switch for mobile money services interoperability was openly advertised, more than one entities applied and one won, Sibton Switch Systems. Two failed bidders raised concerns after the central bank awarded the contract to Sibton Switch, citing bidding cost differences and procedures as their reasons. Bidders were supposed to use their own funds to construct the switch and operate over a period of time in order to generate revenue to cover their investments. These are all agreed to and the JUST WHEN THE Switch is almost ready, the usual business-political gymnastics begins. The contract for a third party to interoperate the electronic retail payment system was awarded to Sibton Switch who are offering to execute the works using a self-financing mechanism to raise GHC4.6 billion on their own to build a robust interface intended to ensure efficiency in revenue mobilisation among numerous other benefits. The two other companies that lost out of the bid were Vals Intel and Mericom Services Ltd. The two quoted GHC 14m and GHC 4m respectively while the winning firm, Sibton opted to undertake the project raising GHC 4.6billion for it. Vals Intel, one of the two companies has conceded that it misunderstood portions of the bidding process as a result of which they might have lost the contract. Executive Chairman of the company, Mr Kojo Graham told JOY FM that their misunderstanding of the process resulted in the company stating in their bid documents that they will prepare bill for the BOG to pay after the period they planned to operate the switch. This paper can confirm that chief among the various options being pushed for by the failed bidders is for the BOG to cancel the already signed contract, an action that could have serious legal and financial consequences on government. For instance, since the contract was awarded last year, Sibton Switch has been working assiduously to put up the switch as per the specifications and guidelines of the BOG. Investigations by this paper reveals that several engineering works and installations, making up the construction of the hardware and software infrastructure are almost ready for the commencement of the contract’s execution this month. Following the media enquiries over the contract, insider information has it that experts have suggest a number of options including a process to verify whether or not the winning bid did so genuinely and whether it has the technical and financial capabilities to fulfil the contract’s mandate. But that suggestion seems to have been ignored by certain individual officials at the Bank of Ghana who are believed to be manipulated by the losing firms. Over the last two decades, the recklessness of state officials has resulted in government being compelled to pay judgements debts, incurred under questionable actions. The situation took political undertone with the current NPP administration promising to avoid Judgement debt payments. In his maiden State of the Nation Address, President Akufo-Addo promised to respect and protect the sanctity of all contracts, including those singed under his predecessor as a way of avoiding frivolous judgement debts. On countless occasions, the Vice President had also assured of a new way of doing things where the private sector and the international private sector regime are facilitated by government to succeed to among other thing, enable them expand, grow and generate opportunities for employment, investments, because in their own words, “the private sector is the engine of growth”. Ghana needs money, it needs investment and not losing both. The contract is clear on what actions to take by the parties to it and the consequences can be dire. We must do everything to resist this temptation of causing an unnecessary judgement debt. Interestingly, this paper can confirm that the Bankswitch Judgement Debt is yet to be paid but frantic efforts are underway to cause a similar debt. One of the things for which former President Mahama was tagged by the opposition was that many of the Judgement Debts were either incurred or paid when he was Vice President and incharge of the Economic Management Team. Today, as faith will have it another Northerner is Vice President and incharge of the Economic Management Team. Questions is will he take a prudent decision favourable to the state in this matter or he will allow himself to be influenced by be failed bidders and groupings such as the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunication whose duty it is to protect private operators in the industry but depending on when it suits its leadership, it decides to be a mouthpiece against a private sector operation involving the telecommunication sector.

By Chris Lange March 27, 2017 9:45 am EDT Print Email Tweet Semiconductor trends are considered to be leading indicators of technology and broader electronics demand. In a wider sense, semiconductor and tech stocks are considered to be leading indicators for the markets in general. A strong rally in the tech sector has pushed many of these companies to new highs, but the Dow and S&P have only recently pulled back from all-time highs. Will this pullback continue? The March 15 short interest data have been compared with the previous report. Short interest increased in most of these selected semiconductor stocks. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) saw its short interest increase to 91.83 million shares. The previous level was 89.46 million. Shares were last seen at $35.04, in a 52-week trading range of $29.50 to $38.45. The number of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) shares short increased to 114.91 million from the previous level of 104.61 million shares. Shares recently traded at $13.33, in a 52-week range of $2.60 to $15.55. Note that like Intel and Micron, AMD is one of the most shorted Nasdaq stocks. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) saw the number of its shares short rise slightly to 15.51 million, compared to the 15.38 million reported in the previous period. Shares were changing hands at $56.56, in a 52-week range of $49.67 to $71.62. Short interest in Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) rose to 13.95 million shares. The previous reading was 13.21 million. Shares were trading at $38.55, in a 52-week range of $19.46 to $39.81. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) saw its short interest decrease slightly to 45.25 million shares from the previous reading of 45.86 million. Shares were trading at $28.32, in a 52-week range of $9.35 to $29.87. And the short interest in Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) increased to 4.98 million shares in the period, from the previous 4.58 million. Shares were last seen at $216.90, in a 52-week range of $139.18 to $227.75.

Photo by REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque. WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s son-in-law has volunteered to answer questions before the Senate Intelligence Committee about arranging meetings with the Russian ambassador and other officials, the White House confirmed Monday. Jared Kushner has agreed to speak to the committee, which is conducting an investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, including whether there are any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin, the White House said. RELATED CONTENT Devin Nunes faces growing pressure to recuse himself from Russia probe How Nunes threw the House's Russia investigation independence into question Spying claim by Intel chair renews fight over Russia probe Old memos show former Trump aide Manafort offered to promote Russian interests, AP reports Kushner is the fourth Trump associate to offer to be interviewed by the congressional committees looking into the murky Russia ties. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, Trump adviser Carter Page and Trump associate Roger Stone last week volunteered to speak to the committee as well. The White House noted that throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and transition Kushner served as the main contact with foreign governments and officials. Trump associates’ meetings with the Russian ambassador during the transition period have come under question, in part because those who met with him were not immediately forthcoming about the meetings. It was not immediately clear when or how the Senate questioning would take place or whether Kushner would be under oath. An official familiar with the Senate investigation said that the details of the interview have not yet been set, and the Trump associates will speak to the committee on the committee’s terms. That these Trump associates volunteered to be interviewed does not prevent the committee from issuing a subpoena for testimony. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the Senate investigation. Lawmakers announced investigations into possible ties between Trump’s campaign and Russian officials and whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election. In a House intelligence hearing March 20, FBI Director James Comey confirmed that the bureau has been conducting a counterintelligence investigation into these matters since late July.

Source: Shutterstock The eye-popping $15.3 billion deal buys the Silicon Valley chipmaker a seat at the high-rollers’ table of the self-driving car market. For sensor maker Mobileye, with adjusted net income of $173.3 million in 2016, Intel is paying a 34.5% premium, that for a company that was only recently listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014. Tel Aviv-based website builder Wix.Com Ltd (NASDAQ:WIX) went public in November 2013, in the then-largest ever IPO for an Israeli company, raising $127 million. The share price has almost tripled since the debut. Caesarstone Ltd (NASDAQ: CSTE), which IPO’d a year earlier, has returned almost 450% to investors. The 2009 book “Start-Up Nation” gave Israel its nickname. Israel-domiciled companies represent the third-largest foreign contingent on Nasdaq, behind Canada and China, And three exchange-traded funds present opportunities to ride the country’s technology sector. Small ETF Finds Large Return The BlueStar TA-BIGITech Israel Technology ETF (NASDAQ:ITEQ) is on a tear in March, up 4.6% so far, and contributing to an almost 14% advance this year. It is an index of approximately 60 Israeli technology companies listed on the Tel Aviv, Nasdaq, NYSE and Singapore exchanges. Mobileye was the largest of the fund’s holdings, at 14.5% weighting, as of March 22. Wix was the ninth-largest, at 3.3%. In between are names such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.(NASDAQ:CHKP), Verint Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:VRNT) and Nice Ltd (ADR) (NASDAQ:NICE). It has an expense ratio of 0.75% and is rebalanced twice a year. Fund assets were just shy of $10 million at the end of last week. The index managers define tech broadly and it shows in the stocks included. These companies are at the forefront of most technologically disruptive industries, including cyber security, Big Data hardware and analytics, autonomous driver assistance and safety, clean energy, biotechnology and medical devices. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas last week included the fund among his picks of those that are smaller-sized, but with larger returns. More Drama With Pharma For those seeking more pharmaceutical industry exposure in their Israel investment, VanEck Vectors Israel ETF (NYSEARCA:ISRA) tracks a cap-weighted index of Israeli and Israeli-linked companies and competes with iShares MSCI Israel Capped Investable Market Index Fund (NYSEARCA:EIS). ISRA assets totaled $40 million as of March 17, while EIS held $114 million. ISRA has returned 7.7% over the past year while EIS has delivered almost 12%. Expense ratios are 0.59% and 0.62%, respectively. BlueStar’s Steven Schoenfeld said recently that pharma holdings have led to the fund underperforming other Israel ETFs, describing it as “pharma drama.” The fund’s underlying index puts drug companies Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR)(NYSE:TEVA) and Perrigo Company plc Ordinary Shares (NYSE:PRGO) among its top 10 holdings, and includes Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE:TARO) and RedHill Biopharma Ltd – ADR (NASDAQ:RDHL), among its nearly 140 constituents. So as a growing chorus of investment managers are beginning to believe that Israel tech stocks are not only under-owned, but also underappreciated, a trio of ETFs can provide entry into an economy that is more about clicks than bricks. As of this writing, Robert Lakin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Sharp invites visitors to #TeamUpWithSharp News provided by Sharp Imaging and Information Company of America Mar 27, 2017, 11:00 ET Share this article MONTVALE, N.J., March 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Sharp Imaging and Information Company of America (SIICA), a division of Sharp Electronics Corporation (SEC), is proud to participate in the 2017 Digital Signage Expo (DSE) in Las Vegas, March 29-30, 2017. At booth #1207, Sharp will showcase its newly released professional AV models and highlight a number of new models that will be launching in the coming months to the theme #teamupwithsharp. "With more than 20 new models launching in 2017, teaming up with Sharp is an easy decision," said Gary Bailer, Director of Product Management, Information Display Products, Sharp Imaging and Information Company of America. "Now is the time to take advantage of our new technology and solutions that will be critical in a rapidly changing digital signage environment." Starting lineup: mounting versatility and open platform Sharp's lineup includes the new, slim, narrow-bezel-width PN-R professional displays, which can be installed face up, face down, tilted forward or backward, and which won "Best of Show" when previewed at InfoComm 2016. The displays were the first to offer the new Intel® Mini Open Pluggable Specification (Mini OPS) technology, supporting HDBaseT™, wireless and computing modules. Additionally, a preview of the 70 and 60-inch Class PN-R series will be available. These are the largest in the series and will be launching beginning the spring of 2017. Sharp will also show the new PN-Y series, which has many of the same features as the PN-R models, but is featured at a more economical price point. Everyone loves an expansion team Sharp has recently expanded its award-winning AQUOS BOARD® interactive display line with two additional models - the 80" Class (80" diagonal) PN-C805B and 70" Class (69.5" diagonal) PN-C705B. These are the first in the series to boast direct bonding technology, along with Sharp Pen-on-Paper™ technology, which makes the touchscreen feel and respond virtually as naturally as a pen writing on paper. Sharp will also demonstrate its new 40" Class (39.5" diagonal) PN-L401C AQUOS BOARD interactive display that incorporates capacitive touch technology. The PN-L401C is the first in Sharp's smaller-format interactive line, and is ideal for both interactive signage and collaborative environments. It is also the first AQUOS BOARD display model to incorporate Intel Mini OPS technology, and can be configured in either landscape, portrait or face-up orientation. Big league size for minor league budgets Sharp's newly launched 90" Class (90 1/64" diagonal) PN-LE901 commercial LCD display combines full-HD image quality and a stylish, thin profile with a built-in tuner for the ultimate viewing experience. Business owners can easily manage the functionality of the PN-LE901 commercial LCD display due to its many user-friendly features. This includes a powerful RS-232C command set, which permits flexible remote control capabilities from connected devices. Impressive video wall to show all the action Also at DSE 2017, Sharp will display a preview of the world's largest 70" Class ultra-thin-bezel video wall monitor, scheduled for launch this fall. When displayed in a 1x3 array, it yields a 119" diagonal show of brilliance without inducing the dreaded bezel crosshair. Visitors to booth #1207 will also see first-hand the benefits of the Strategic Alliance Resource (STAR) program, an exclusive program for third-party products and services that complement Sharp's professional AV products. Additionally, visitors can find information on the Sharp Pro AV Reseller Program, which helps Sharp professional display dealers, integrators and consultants increase their sales opportunities by allowing them to purchase from any Sharp authorized dealer.

James’ project, “Can Ants Help Save the Bees?,” explored whether ants could serve as model organisms for screening chemical effects on the complex social behaviors of honey bees. William’s project, “Evaluating Autism Connectivity Models,” compared the activity in regions of the brain to better understand social cognition in autism. Chesapeake Science Point senior David Kravets earned second place in the fair for his project, “Engineering a Novel Material.” The project improved the stability and efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells by using a novel organic dye composition. More than 300 projects in 17 categories presented by young science stars from across the county in grades 6 through 12 were entered in the fair. Students won awards and prizes worth thousands of dollars from organizations such as Educational Systems Federal Credit Union, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Armed Forces Communications Association, Anne Arundel Community College, Defense Spectrum Organization, Fisher Scientific Education Faculty, Harris Corporation, Intel, International Council on Systems Engineering, Rockwell Collins, the US Air Force and US Navy/US Marine Corps Office of Naval Research, and Pearson Education. The Anne Arundel County Regional Science and Engineering Fair is dedicated to promoting science education, and recognizing and rewarding student achievement in science.  In addition to the grand award winners, approximately 100 county middle and high school students earned first-place awards at the fair ranging from special awards from community organizations to category awards based on guidelines from Intel ISEF.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Patent venue case hits Supreme Court By Li Zhou 03/27/17 10:00 AM EDT With help from Nancy Scola THIS MORNING: PATENT VENUE CASE HITS SUPREME COURT — Tech companies are closely watching a patent venue case, TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC, which the U.S. Supreme Court is slated to hear oral arguments on today. A decision in this case could determine whether the location of where patent suits can be brought would be further restricted, to prevent patent trolls from taking advantage of historically plaintiff-friendly regions, The Wall Street Journal reports. Why does this matter to tech? If patent cases need to be restricted to the district where a company is based, for example, plaintiffs suing for infringement could have a much tougher time winning those suits. As the law stands, plaintiffs can bring these suits in places — like the Eastern District of Texas — that may be more likely to hand them a victory. This district specifically has seen “as much as 44 percent” of all new patent infringement cases in the U.S., the WSJ notes. By making it tougher for plaintiffs to win their cases, tech could save both money in legal fees and payouts for potential settlements that could result from such suits. Story Continued Below — Intel, Dell, Adobe and Oracle are among those filing amicus briefs in the case, backing TC Heartland, which has asked for a patent infringement suit from Kraft Foods to be heard in its home district of Indiana rather than a different federal venue. Ericsson Inc., and a collection of pharmaceutical firms are supporting Kraft Foods, arguing that stricter guidelines on patent lawsuit venues could be detrimental to innovation. —Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a proponent of patent reform legislation, shared his support for placing limitations on the venues of patent suits, in a Wired op-ed. “The current patent venue regime … enables plaintiffs to target forums with plaintiff-friendly rules, where discovery begins early, judgment before trial is rare and stays are frequently denied,” he writes on Sunday. “These traits drive up litigation costs, incentivizing defendants to settle even frivolous claims rather than pursue them to trial. … In the unfortunate event the court upholds the current system, I stand ready to move legislation that will help bring sanity back to patent litigation.” We’re tracking. TODAY: GOV'T, TECH TALK ONLINE EXTREMISM — A two-day session kicks off this afternoon at George Washington University focused on "the role of the internet in both facilitating and countering violent extremism." It's a dilemma the Obama administration tried tackling in its final years, with limited success. Trump administration officials from the FBI, DOJ, DHS and the State Department will be on hand to chat about everything from terrorists' use of encryption to counter-programming against violent messaging. On the tech industry side, Facebook will be represented, as will be Jigsaw, the think tank spun out of Google. (Google proper was set to have a rep on one of the panels, but that’s no longer the case because of scheduling reasons, says the company.) We're tracking. The line-up's here. Worth noting: there's no mention of "ISIS" or "radical Islam" on the conference docket, despite the Trump administration's reported preference for narrowing down the field to those threats. GOOD MONDAY MORNING and welcome to Morning Tech, where we are anxiously awaiting the finale of Big Little Lies. Send your tech, telecom and transition tips to lzhou@politico.com and @liszhou. As always, catch the rest of the team’s contact info after Quick Downloads. KUSHNER EXPECTED TO HEAD ‘INNOVATION’ OFFICE — “President Trump plans to unveil a new White House office on Monday with sweeping authority to overhaul the federal bureaucracy and fulfill key campaign promises — such as reforming care for veterans and fighting opioid addiction — by harvesting ideas from the business world and, potentially, privatizing some government functions,” The Washington Post reports. “The White House Office of American Innovation, to be led by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, will operate as its own nimble power center within the West Wing and will report directly to Trump.” HOUSE CRA VOTE HAPPENING TUESDAY — The House is scheduled to vote on the broadband privacy CRA to roll back the FCC’s broadband privacy rules on Tuesday, following the Senate’s passage of the resolution last week. If the House approves the CRA, it will head to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature. Once in effect, the resolution would rescind the FCC’s rules, which require internet service providers to obtain user consent for sharing their sensitive information. It would also prevent the FCC from issuing similar rules moving forward. — Also on tap: The Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on closing the technical skills gap on Wednesday. … The House Energy Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee continues its scrutiny of self-driving cars during a hearing this Tuesday. … And the House telecom subcommittee is taking a look at nationwide next-generation 911 in a hearing on Wednesday. EU’S VESTAGER HEADS TO U.S. THIS WEEK — Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s commissioner for competition, is scheduled to be stateside this week, although she’s said that she’s unclear about the exact number of American antitrust officials she’ll meet with, Bloomberg reports. “Vestager told reporters last week she’s still in the dark about how many officials at the U.S. Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission she’d see during her short U.S. trip. … Her visit comes months after she disregarded calls from the then-President Barack Obama’s U.S. Treasury to avoid slapping Apple for its tax arrangements.” She is scheduled to speak on Friday at the American Bar Association’s antitrust law spring meeting. SILICON VALLEY MUST-READS — — Uber presses pause on self-driving vehicles: Following an accident in Tempe, Arizona, during which one of Uber’s self-driving cars rolled onto its side, the ride-sharing company has suspended its autonomous vehicle testing, The Wall Street Journal reports. Uber is halting its trials in San Francisco, Tempe and Pittsburgh while it investigates what contributed to the accident last week. No passengers were in the backseat when the Uber accident took place, and no one was reported as seriously injured. Recode also has a look at how the company’s self-driving car division is embroiled in a “mini civil war.” — Amazon sales tax update: The online retailer is scheduled to start collecting sales tax from every state that has one beginning April 1, CNBC reports. Hawaii, Idaho, Maine and New Mexico are the last four states Amazon has established this arrangement with. Shoppers living in places like Oregon and New Hampshire, which don’t have a sales tax, will not have to pay one on the site. — Inside Jack Ma’s global strategy for Alibaba: Fortune examines how the founder of the tech giant is positioning himself and his company as a globally accessible e-commerce and trade platform. “In his travels, Ma promotes the lowering of trade barriers, touts his own brand of philanthropy and supports causes such as primary-school education. His version of globalization is carefully calibrated and expansive enough to be consistent with the goals of his own President Xi Jinping, as well as with Trump’s America-first positioning.” ENCRYPTION DEBATE PICKS UP POST-LONDON ATTACK — Per our colleagues at POLITICO Europe’s Sunday Crunch: “The role of tech companies in terror prevention following the attack on Westminster dominated the Sunday papers and morning shows [in Britain]. Home Secretary Amber Rudd stole the headlines with a series of bruising attacks on WhatsApp and its “completely unacceptable” refusal to allow governments access to its encrypted messages. Tough talk. But what is she going to do? Very little in the short term. Rudd is set to host a meeting of tech company execs on Thursday, but the talks will focus on finding ways to get terrorist material off the web not on encrypted messaging. “There’s nothing concrete on that yet,” a Home Office source told POLITICO. “We’re just having a conversation.” — Rudd may also want to brush up on her tech understanding if the reaction on Twitter is anything to go by. She was ridiculed for telling BBC’s Andrew Marr she wanted to consult with people “who understand the necessary hashtags.” Telling journalist Sophy Ridge that end-to-end encryption was a good thing for cybersecurity but that she also wanted the government to be able to bypass this when they have a warrant also appeared to misunderstand the “end-to-end” bit. TRANSITIONS — Andrew Noyes has started as the senior director for comms for Hampton Creek, "a startup that's on a mission to bring delicious, healthier and more affordable food to everyone, everywhere." Noyes was previously at Brigade, Uber and Facebook, per Playbook. … Andrew Shult starts today with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise heading up the Whip's digital operation. Previously, he served as digital director for the House Oversight Committee under Chairmen Darrell Issa and Jason Chaffetz.

That is, Chinese internet powerhouse Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTCMKTS:TCTZF) has selected Nvidia as the provider of its core hardware needed to make Tencent’s artificial intelligence ambitions a reality. Source: Shutterstock It was odd, simply because that’s not what Nvidia does. A more conventional computer processor and chipset name like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) or Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) would make more sense serving as the backbone for a new AI system. Thing is, this isn’t the first time owners of NVDA stock have heard of the company’s hardware being selected as the centerpiece of an artificial intelligence system. Just two weeks ago, Nvidia was tapped by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to power the next generation of its AI offering. What gives? As it turns out, traditional computer processors like Intel’s Core and Pentium CPUs or AMD’s Ryzen aren’t necessarily best-suited for the ultra-high-speed processing needs the rise of AI has created. Investors — and not just NVDA stock holders — would be wise to note the nuance, as AI is expected to become a $16 billion market by 2022, and grow to $36 billion by 2025. GPU Technology vs. CPU Technology Historically, while the hardware and firmware supporting a computer’s (or laptop’s) display screen was a key part of its performance, a device’s heart and soul was its processor, or CPU. It operates… well, everything at blazing fast speed, with more RAM (memory) helping out. The graphics processing unit, or GPU, wasn’t a dealmaker or a dealbreaker. As computers have become faster and more powerful, though, and performance expectations have swelled, GPUs have become very, very impressive, in many cases fully taking on the display-management role that was otherwise taken on by the CPU. Indeed, a GPU is some4thing of a mini-computer in itself… … and they’re very, very fast. That makes them perfect for high-speed artificial intelligence applications, where the quantity of computations is more important than the depth or complexity of those computations.

The PHLX Semiconductor Sector (NASDAQ:SOX) started March at 985 and has already flown above the 1,000 level thanks to product launches from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and a solid quarterly earnings report from Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). Source: AMD Only Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands out as the underperformer in this market. The takeover of Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) for $15 billion will add risks for shareholders, as integrating such a big company will be fraught with uncertainties. Investors should stick with what they know best: Advanced Micro Devices’ CPU refresh, with the Ryzen 7 and the Ryzen 5 next, holds big promise for AMD stock. And as much as that promise seems priced in … it’s not. Ryzen 5 Targets the Mainstream Market The Ryzen 7 CPU, rebuilt from the bottom up, will compete with some of Intel’s high-end chips, including the i7 processor. AMD is targeting enthusiasts here, so the chip is still at the high end. Still, at least one outlet cut the price of Ryzen to 1700X to $370. As the price falls, AMD should be able to gobble up more share. Ryzen 5 targets a different market than the 7, however. Retailers are apparently releasing the chip weeks ahead of schedule, and at a price range that won’t cramp the ol’ wallet. On April 11, AMD will officially announce four Ryzen 5 chips: the 1400, 1500x, 1600 and 1600X. The chips will range from 4-cores to 6-cores and will cost just $169 to $249. At that price point, Intel’s budget i3 chip and Pentium chips will look laughably expensive. Ryzen 5 offers between 8 and 12 threads, which is up to three times more than that offered on the G-series Pentium processors. The high-end Ryzen 5 chips will compete with Intel’s i5 7600K, since the former costs just $10 more. AMD Stock: Growth, But With Risks Ryzen 7 must win PC enthusiasts now. The more gamers that use AMD chips, the faster that game developers will optimize the software to work efficiently on Ryzen. Meanwhile, Ryzen 5 must win the OEM and PC manufacturing orders. Big companies like Dell, HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) and Lenovo could give shelf space to AMD-based computers and laptops. If that happens, AMD will be chewing market share from Intel on a couple of fronts. Also, Polaris-based graphics cards can help AMD win back some market share from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Huawei Games Games Accessories Nintendo PC Gaming PlayStation Toys More VR Xbox Trending: Nintendo Switch Nokia 3310 iPhone 7 Galaxy S8 LG G6 iPhone 8 Home / News / VR News / Watch a not quite wireless HTC Vive prototype in action Watch a not quite wireless HTC Vive prototype in action by Joe Roberts 27 March 2017 0 shares Read Comments The HTC Vive is widely regarded as the best VR headset available, with its motion tracking system allowing users to walk around within the virtual world. Despite it's restrictive, £600+ price tag, the headset managed to impress last year with its motion tracking abilities and controllers that allow for more immersive interaction within the VR experiences. But one thing that many users aren't so taken with is the bundle of cables that protrude from the headset and connect to the PC that's powering the whole thing. Related: Best VR headset It's a necessary part of the system at this point, but at CES 2017 in January, HTC demonstrated how high-quality wireless VR will soon be arriving, by showing off wireless PC-powered virtual reality. Intel has been leading the way with technology to allow extremely low-latency wireless virtual reality on the Vive, but third-party firms are also set to get in on the action. One such example is TPCast, which will be selling its solution by the middle of 2017, but there's a host of other companies working on bringing untethered VR to the masses. One of which is Quark VR, which has been brought onboard by HTC's partner Valve to solve the wire issue, and has just released this video of its own, almost wireless, Vive prototype being used. The clip shows a working prototype that still uses a wire. But in this example, that wire extends to a standalone power pack that the user can stick in their pocket. It might not be a completely wireless design, but it does mean the user doesn't have to worry about cables running to a PC and potentially tripping them up or pulling on the main rig. The small single-board computer is certainly compact enough to carry around during your virtual adventures, and communicates with your main PC to keep the whole thing running as it should. A big advantage of this method is the technology will work with existing Vive hardware, so there's no need for consumers to shell out for a whole new headset just to rid themselves of the cable tether. Of course, at this point, Quark VR is simply showing off the progress it's made with this prototype, and there's nothing to say the company won't figure out an even more convenient solution before a consumer product arrives. Either way, wireless VR isn't all that far off, and we're excited to see any developments such as this which will help make virtual reality even more immersive than it already is.

March has been a particularly fecund time for new Android Wear watch announcements, though unlike previous years, the brands behind these devices are almost all from the fashion and luxury spheres of business. Tag Heuer, Montblanc, Hugo Boss, Tommy Hilfiger, Diesel, Emporio Armani, Michael Kors, and Movado are just some of the well known names announcing Wear 2.0 smartwatches. This wave of new products is symptomatic of a broader trend in the tech industry: one where a high degree of component and software integration has made it almost trivial to launch a new tech product, whether or not you're actually a tech company. Though a number of the newly unveiled watches haven't been fully detailed and specced out yet, we already know the commonalities between them. They run the same Android Wear 2.0, embellished with a custom watchface or two. Inside, most are relying on Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 2100 chip — excepting Tag Heuer's partnership with Intel on the Connected Modular 45 — which integrates all the necessary wireless radios for a smartwatch. And they all have roughly the same battery size and physical dimensions. I like to imagine there's a debonair Google operative out there, visiting all the fashion brands and giving them the exact same pitch: take our software, nothing for you to do, take Qualcomm's chip, no extra labor required, and use these reliable suppliers of memory chips and batteries. All you have to do is put a strap on it and it's a smartwatch! Fossil Q Venture. This standardization of software and hardware parts has made it possible for companies unfamiliar with the complexities of producing an integrated smart device to launch one anyway. It's the smartwatch equivalent of a company like Adidas taking a standard quartz movement and building a three-striped watch around it. On the one hand, it feeds a consumer desire to have favorite brands covering everything we own, but on the other, it doesn't really lead to any better watches or technology. The crux of the problem with these internally identical Android Wear watches is that tech consumers demand substantive differences between cheap and expensive gadgets. How does Montblanc justify charging three times as much as LG for a watch that is functionally the same as LG's? When Tag Heuer or any other famed watchmaker puts four-figure prices on its mechanical watches, there's an implied promise that they'll have an unmatched quality of workmanship and precision. But when those same companies outsource the brains to Google and the brawn to Qualcomm, what's left for them to differentiate themselves with? The new @Movado Connect. Iconic design. Powered by #AndroidWear. #Baselworld2017 pic.twitter.com/61aLczsoUc— Android Wear (@AndroidWear) March 24, 2017 In fashion, the price premiums are usually justified by higher quality materials, sharper looks, and brand cachet. So there's still a chance that watches like the Movado Connect (above) will attract people more concerned with aesthetics than functionality — provided this shift toward fashion sensibilities is real and not just wishful thinking. And yet, isn't the whole point of smartwatches the fact that they're more functional? Android Wear requires a sacrifice of some convenience — primarily to do with the added bulk and weight of the watch — for the benefit of smart functions like notifications, contactless payments, and music controls. Even with the supposed next-gen power efficiency of Qualcomm's new chip, an Android Wear watch will require regular, probably daily, recharging, whereas automatic timepieces can just tick along happily so long as they're regularly used. The promise from brands like Movado and Montblanc is that you can have the smartwatch functions with an extra layer of exquisite design and exclusive materials. But will that really be enough? Can an Android Wear watch justify a luxury price when the most unique thing about it is its wrist strap?

Lexmark International By Steve Brachmann March 27, 2017 1 Print Article On Tuesday, March 21st, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc. The case surrounding the sale and resale of printer ink cartridges will require the Supreme Court to decide whether U.S. law surrounding patent exhaustion allows post-sale restrictions and if sales of a patented article outside of the U.S. exhausts the U.S. patent rights in that article. Arguing on behalf of petitioner Impression Products was Andrew Pincus who led off by noting that the first sale doctrine, in which an initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item, was a principle that goes all the way back to the 15th century. Common law refusal to enforce restraints on alienation of chattels, a principle which comes from Elizabethan-era jurist Lord Edward Coke, cloud the title a consumer has on a purchased good and hurt downstream secondary markets. One of the questions raised in this case is whether post-sale restrictions on the sale of a patented item are enforceable under patent law instead of contract law. Although not codified into the terms of the 1952 Patent Act, Pincus argued that court precedent over the past 150 years reinforced the idea that such restrictions weren’t enforceable under patent law. In addition, the Court’s only deviation from this viewpoint, extending from the 1912 decision in Henry v. A.B. Dick Co., was overturned by the Court five years later. More recent cases, like the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s (Fed. Cir.) 1992 decision in Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc., have led some to believe that rules on limiting the patent exhaustion doctrine to be “displaced” according to Pincus, who cited amici briefs from Intel Corp. and the Association of Medical Device Reprocessors discussing this issues. Pincus argued that the Federal Circuit’s decision to affirm Lexmark’s infringement claims erred in two respects. Although the Federal Circuit assumed that the without-authority clause of 35 U.S.C. Section 271(a) was an indication that Congress gave patentees a veto over the scope of patent exhaustion, Supreme Court cases prior to 1952 didn’t support this viewpoint. Instead, Pincus argued that 35 U.S.C. Section 282(b)(1) allowed absence of liability of infringement as a defense against patent infringement claims “in obvious incorporation of the preexisting exhaustion doctrine.” Additionally, Pincus argued that Fed. Cir. confused the separate concepts of a patentee’s ability to set the conditions of a first sale and the ability to set post-sale restrictions. “We think it’s quite clear that just as a patentee can decide for itself who it will sell to, it can impose as a condition of licensing, manufacturing and sales by others those same restrictions… But in either case, whether the sale by the patentee or the sale by the licensee, post-sale restrictions are invalid as long as it’s an authorized sale.” The case before the Supreme Court also raises the question of international patent exhaustion, a point which wasn’t raised in any briefs filed in the case to the surprise of Justice Samuel Alito. “In recent years, we’ve been — we have said very — that a statute does not apply outside the United States unless it says that it applies outside the United States,” Alito said. “I don’t see why that shouldn’t be the same for a common-law rule like the rule here.” This issue gets to one of the two questions presented by the petitioner in asking the Supreme Court to determine whether its 2016 decision in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., which held that common law doctrine barring restraints on alienation makes no geographical distinctions, was applicable to patent law as it was in that case to copyright law. In arguing that the rule from Kirtsaeng should apply to this case, Pincus noted that the case included the same enunciation of a nongeographic rule and that the adverse effects of applying a nongeographic rule to sales outside of the U.S. could affect the global supply chain for patented articles. Pincus used examples of phones or cars assembled in foreign jurisdictions like China or Canada with parts coming from other foreign jurisdictions which could pose patent infringement after importation into the U.S. “The consequence there would that — would be that if the final phone is sold into the United States, all of the sellers, resellers, and users of that phone would be subject to patent infringement liability if the U.S. rights were not expressly licensed — U.S. rights for sale not expressly licensed for just one patent in that huge conglomeration of patents that were embodied in that object.” – Pincus Pincus was questioned by Justice Stephen Breyer on points raised by the other side in the case, namely that the first sale of an item isn’t covered by a U.S. patent in an international sale and so the patent holder may not have earned the full monetary compensation for that product if it is resold in the U.S. Pincus responded to that by citing the global supply chain context in which licensing firms know that they’re not getting value which is country-specific but rather “the average of the value in all the places where the patent is going to be used.” For end-use products, Pincus argued that there were nonpatent constraints which could ameliorate a patent owner’s claims and that Kirtsaeng supported the idea that price discrimination may not necessarily be protected by current U.S. patent law. Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned Pincus over the potential negative effects which could be created by the rule supported by the petitioner in this case. As for safety concerns caused by the importation of drugs or medical devices, Pincus argued that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has broad regulatory authority to deal with those issues. As for the disruption of settled expectations, Pincus cites case law from Alice in a way that will likely rankle readers of this blog: “If you look it the Alice case, for example, that obviously had tremendous implications for both the patentees and for people who had entered into license agreements and were paying money for patents that turned out to be invalid. But that was just a consequence of this Court getting the law right.” – Pincus Appearing next in oral arguments was deputy U.S. solicitor general Malcolm L. Stewart supporting reversal in part and vacatur in part. In response to a question from Justice Anthony Kennedy on why the exhaustion doctrine hasn’t been codified into law, Stewart noted that exhaustion principles have arisen in past Supreme Court cases from 35 U.S.C. Section 154(a)(1), the provision of U.S. patent law giving patent owners the right to exclude others from making, selling or importing articles covered by a patent. Stewart cited the Supreme Court’s 1913 decision in Bauer & Cie. v. O’Donnell, stating that it provided the “proper interpretation” of the right to vend, which “does not encompass the right to set resale prices.” Although Stewart acknowledged it was true that U.S. patent law did not contain a provision on the scope of exhaustion as is seen in the Copyright Act, he added that Section 154(a)(1) confers the rights of exclusivity which have supported patent exhaustion principles without requiring codification of exhaustion in patent law. Stewart also opined that Fed. Cir. erred in applying the 1938 Supreme Court decision in General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co., a case which dealt “not with simply a restriction on the use that purchasers could make after an article had been lawfully sold” but rather “with the conditions on which its patentee’s licensee could sell the article in the first place.” If the licensee sells a patented article in a way that’s not authorized, no lawful sale has taken place and patent rights have not been exhausted, but if a lawful sale occurs than a patent owner can find recourse through contract or commercial law, not patent law as the patent right has been exhausted. If the seller of an ink cartridge wants to negotiate a deal in which a customer agrees to a single use of a patented cartridge, ownership of a patent covering the cartridge does not afford the patent owner any greater right to enforce restrictions than the seller of unpatented private property would have under contract law, according to Stewart. As to the international exhaustion question, Stewart noted that the federal government believes that a U.S. patent owner should have rights to royalties in the U.S. market but needs to make that point explicit in a licensing contract: “We’re not advocating a rule under which simply by manufacturing and selling overseas, the patentee could impose continuing downstream restrictions on the use of the good once it has been legally imported and sold into the United States… If Lexmark had said, we’ll sell you these cartridges in Canada and you are authorized to import them into the United States and sell them in the United States, but they are still for one use only and you need to put labeling on the package warning your consumers ‘one use only,’ in our view, that restriction would be no good because there would be authorized importation into the United States, authorized sale in the United States. And at that point, the Court’s domestic exhaustion cases would kick in.” – Stewart Following Stewart was Constantine Trela, arguing on behalf of respondent Lexmark International. Trela agreed with the government in a limited sense in that the Federal Circuit properly looked to the statute to find origins and limits on the exhaustion doctrine. However, Trela noted that questions remained as to what constituted an authorized sale which exhausts rights to a patented article: “When a patentee sells a product without saying anything about it, normally the — the normal understanding is, well, you’re selling everything you have. But there’s no — there’s no decision of this Court that says that a patentee necessarily has to sell everything he has.” – Trela Trela argued that the Supreme Court has held in the past that patent owners have the ability to license patent rights, such as by field of use as was held in General Talking Pictures, or geographically as was held in 1872’s Mitchell v. Hawley. “But when — when patent rights are conveyed with a product, we’re told, the parties lose that freedom… They have to sell all or nothing,” Trela said. He went on to cite updated IP licensing guidelines jointly released in January by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Department of Justice which stated that limitations to intellectual property licenses may serve procompetitive ends by allowing the licensor to efficiently and effectively exploit property. This, Trela said, squared with an amici brief from a group of 44 law, economics and business professors which noted that a semiconductor chip may have variable value based on the product supply chain in which it is used. Contract law does not provide an adequate remedy for the downstream limitations which are the right of patent owners, Trela argued in response to questioning from Chief Justice John Roberts. Following with the microchip example, Trela argued that an inability to enforce downstream limitations on a patent license causes a patent owner to lose out on profits from chips marketed to the video camera market which are later resold to the computer market. Trela also raised issue with the way that the Supreme Court had interpreted Lord Coke in Kirtsaeng, noting that “the common law changed a lot after Lord Coke.” Although 17th century common law may have been suitable for determining geographic restrictions on patented articles, precedents in Mitchell and General Talking Pictures hold that patent licensees could not convey the right to use patented articles in a way which was authorized by the patent owner: “That’s why I say you have to ask, an authorized sale of what? It’s — it’s the physical product along with the particular rights that may — that the patentee has agreed to release with respect to that particular article.” – Trela As to concerns over the effects of patent rights on downstream markets if not exhausted after the first sale, Trela argued that those concerns weren’t practical. The costs of patent litigation and an unwillingness to sue their own consumers would keep most corporations from asserting patents against end-users, even if those consumers suspected they were buying cheap knockoffs. As to the question over international exhaustion, Trela cited the amici brief filed by the federal government which rejects the point from Impression Products’ petition for writ that the Supreme Court’s Kirtsaeng rule on exhaustion after international sale applies to this case: “It said that U.S. patentee is entitled to one premium for forfeiting his exclusive right under U.S. law to prevent the sale of his patented article in the United States. And that’s really been the premise of the exhaustion doctrine.” – Trela Because a U.S. patent couldn’t be enforced overseas, sales outside of the United States don’t lift legal restraints that limit what the buyer can do with a purchased article. A sale of a patented article in Germany exhausts the rights to any German patents covering the article, but that German sale doesn’t exhaust U.S. rights, according to Trela. This clashes with Impression’s proposed rule that a first authorized sale exhausts U.S. patent rights regardless of which market the article is sold into. Further, concerns over downstream consumer markets and unwitting patent infringement by end-users weren’t applicable in this case which involved parties who were aware that there were single-use limitations on the ink cartridges sold by Lexmark. Arguments that any ruling which didn’t align with Kirtsaeng would create different rules for copyright and patent were misguided, Trela reasoned, as patent law already varies widely between foreign jurisdictions while copyright is virtually identical across the world under the Berne Convention. “I think that this is a particular area to move cautiously because what you’re talking about here are, you know, international trade matters where the Impression rule would essentially put the United States — basically, the United States would be saying unilaterally, blanket international exhaustion is great. Let’s do it. Do we care if other countries reciprocate? Apparently, we don’t because we’re just willing to do it because we’re good guys. That’s not the way international trade issues like that should be decided.” – Trela Domestically, allowing conditional sales and conditional licenses to be enforceable under patent law fosters innovation beyond the first sale, Trela argued. He cited an amici brief filed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) which stated that pharmaceutical firms relied on no patent exhaustion caused by foreign sales in order to promote further innovation in drug development. Trela also argued against the U.S. government’s point that U.S. patent rights must be explicit in a contract, stating that there’s no reason that a German automaker which holds U.S. patents must negotiate U.S. rights for a sale of cars to an entity in Slovakia; U.S. patent rights shouldn’t factor into negotiations between foreign partners. “And that approach would also make the enforceability of U.S. patent rights dependent on — really, on the whims of foreign governments and on the details of foreign law,” Trela added. Compulsory licensing rules in India, for example, could undermine the rights of a U.S. patent owner to assert a patent domestically. The rule would help sophisticated U.S. companies who have larger legal teams and would work the rule into contracts in a much better way than smaller companies could. Although patent rights are conveyed by contract, infringement should cause a remedy under patent law and not contract law, according to Trela. Contract remedies don’t allow for injunctive relief available under patent law. Because Lexmark’s only contact with Impression is limited to this lawsuit, Lexmark cannot claim privity and the company doesn’t want to recoup its monetary losses by suing individual customers. Pincus had reserved some of his time and responded after Trela’s comments, reiterating concerns over downstream market activity if patent rights weren’t exhausted after an authorized sale. As to the differences between patent and copyright law, Pincus argued that it was very sensible for copyright and patent rights to be exhausted at the same time when an authorized sale occurred overseas. Further, it could encourage further activity identified in Intel’s amici brief involving patent assertion entities bringing what that tech firm called “unwarranted suits against customers.” The Author Steve Brachmann is a writer located in Buffalo, New York.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 27, 2017 at 8:14AM $1,000 might not seem like a lot of money to get started with investing. But over time, plenty of stocks have turned that seemingly paltry amount into over $100,000. Let's examine two well-known tech stocks that did just that for patient investors -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). NVIDIA Chipmaker NVIDIA went public in 1999 at $12 per share. $1,000 would have been enough to buy 83 shares. The stock subsequently split four times, boosting your position to 996 shares -- which would be worth over $105,000 today. Moreover, that stake would be paying out $558 in dividends per year. NVIDIA's 1080 Ti GPU. Image source: NVIDIA. But to get to that point, you would have needed a lot of patience. NVIDIA surged from a split-adjusted price of $1.58 on its first trading day to around $23 in early 2002, but plunged to under $3 later that year in the aftermath of the dot-com crash. NVIDIA wouldn't recover to the low $20s until late 2006 -- after which it rose to the mid-$30s before the 2008-2009 crash knocked it back to the single digits. Yet the past five years have been smooth sailing for NVIDIA. The stock rallied over 625% on growing demand for its gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, and ARM-based CPUs for connected cars -- which enabled it to post double-digit sales growth over the past five quarters. These core businesses are expected to remain strong, but the stock's rising valuation, tougher competition in the GPU and connected car markets, and the expiration of a graphics cross-licensing deal with Intel are expected to cause NVIDIA's sales growth to slow to just 16% this year, compared to 38% growth last year. Qualcomm Qualcomm, the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world, went public in 1991 at $16 per share. You could have bought 62 shares with $1,000. After the four subsequent splits, you would own 1,984 shares, which would be worth over $113,000 today. That stake would also be paying out $4,206 in annual dividends. Image source: Qualcomm. But in 1998, Qualcomm spun off Leap Wireless, which gave existing shareholders one Leap share for every four Qualcomm shares held. This would have given you 31 shares of Leap, which were worth about $540 on its first trading day. AT&T bought Leap for $15 per share in 2013, which would have valued your stake at $465. Like NVIDIA, Qualcomm stock surged during the dot-com bubble. But unlike NVIDIA, Qualcomm still hasn't rebounded to its split-adjusted bubble high of $88 yet. Qualcomm experienced nearly uninterrupted growth from 2010 to 2014 as sales of its ARM-based mobile chips rose, demand for its baseband modems climbed with new 3G/4G technologies, and smartphone makers paid it royalties and licensing fees to access its massive portfolio of wireless patents. However, Qualcomm's business has been squeezed over the past two years by cheaper chipmakers like MediaTek, major smartphone makers producing their own first-party chipsets, and a growing number of OEMs and regulators demanding lower licensing fees. Despite all those challenges, analysts still believe that Qualcomm's revenue and earnings will respectively rise 1% and 5% this year on robust sales of its flagship Snapdragon chipsets and its growth into adjacent markets. But what if I can't get IPO shares? Most brokerages reserve IPO shares for higher net worth clients, so you probably won't get shares of a hot public offering with just $1,000 in your account. But if you had simply bought NVIDIA or Qualcomm when they first hit the market, you would still have multibagger returns today -- NVIDIA has rallied over 6,350% since its first trading day, and Qualcomm has surged nearly 10,000%. The key to getting those massive returns is simple patience and resisting the urge to sell everything during steep market downturns. It always pays to remember Warren Buffett's timeless advice: "When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever."   Leo Sun owns shares of AT and T and Qualcomm.

By Thomas McArdle, opinion contributor - 03/27/17 07:00 AM EDT 2   © Getty Images A fear for many in the GOP's “Never Trump” movement during the presidential campaign was that a President Trump would be more interested in making grand deals with Democrats than in upholding conservative principles. Within days of the election, if not hours, it seemed crystal clear it was no RINO (Republican in name only) who would be sitting in the Oval Office. As noted by no less than Ronald Reagan's Education secretary, William Bennett, Trump's Cabinet nominations were more conservative than the Gipper's. Naming Neil Gorsuch to the late Antonin Scalia's Supreme Court seat seemed to be absolute confirmation: apart from some populistic protectionism that was really more anti-multilateralist than anti-free trade, the Trump presidency was on track to becoming the most conservative of the modern era. ADVERTISEMENT Right after Friday's failure of a repeal-and-replace bill conservatives disparaged as ObamaCare Lite, however, the spectre of that other Donald was glimpsed. The president now believes he can “make a deal with the Democrats and have one unified deal.” He hastened to add that “they will come to us; we won’t have to come to them” because it will happen “after ObamaCare explodes” over the coming months. It certainly sounds like Trump will have Senate Minority Leader Chuck SchumerCharles SchumerMcConnell: ObamaCare 'status quo' will stay in place moving forward NRA launches M Supreme Court ad Senate about to enter 'nuclear option' death spiral MORE and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi eating out of his hand.   White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told Fox News Sunday that if House Republicans won't give Trump what he wants on health care, “then we need to work with moderate Democrats.” Priebus added: “I think it's more or less a warning shot that we're willing to talk to anyone; we always have been.” Now more than ever, he argued, “it's time for both parties to come together and get to real reforms in this country” on health care, taxes, infrastructure spending and other issues." Of course, neither Democrat leader will ever help dismantle the signature enactment of their party's last president; it will be rank-and-file members seeking to save their political skins in the 2018 elections who will reach out to the other side of the aisle. Even so, won't the input of Democrat congressmen and senators necessarily mean an ObamaCare replacement containing more liberal elements – an ObamaCare Ultra Lite, as it were? Is that what the President means when he says, “the Democrats will come to us and say, look, let's get together and get a great healthcare bill or plan that's really great for the people of our country. And I think that's going to happen”? Or when he says, “both parties can get together and do real healthcare. That's the best thing”? Actually, the odds are against it. In spite of his longtime reputation as self-serving cynic, it has been fascinating to see Donald TrumpDonald TrumpRussian billionaire denies aiding Putin with Manafort Liberal groups plan protests against Gorsuch Baldwin on Trump: 'I just didn’t want to play him' MORE as president exhibit a loyalty to conservatism and conservative Republican members of Congress rivaling and perhaps exceeding that of Reagan. When asked on Friday after the ObamaCare vote was cancelled if he felt “betrayed by the House Freedom Caucus,” Trump replied, “No, I'm not betrayed. They're friends of mine.” Only “some of the Democrats,” on the other hand, are “good people,” according to Trump, and he is unwilling to “reach out to the Democrats now,” rather than later when ObamaCare becomes so poisonous that their congressional seats are directly threatened. The real lesson of Friday's body blow is one that has been taught yet unlearned again and again over many years: Congress's liberal-to-moderate Republicans continually threaten the party's agenda, and reining them in is a long-overdue imperative. Skillfully using carrots and sticks, Democrats seldom tolerate defections on major pieces of legislation, and it doesn't matter how much the most moderate members of their caucus squawk about it; it's time for Republicans to start whipping their own renegades into line with a similar force and focus. Instead of the Freedom Caucus being blamed as the spoiler of Friday's pre-empted vote, it should be recognized as the conservative conscience of the GOP, emmisaries of the Tea Party movement that was the original populist revolt against President Obama, a movement Trump built on in his unlikely voyage to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (and, arguably, without which he could not have gotten there). Their free-market approach to repeal-and-replace should have been the starting point in designing a replacement to ObamaCare. There has been much talk of which party “owns” the healthcare system and thus takes the blame from the public for its dysfunctions. How absurd it will be if repeal-and-replace ends up retaining all too many of ObamaCare's defects, failing to unleash the benefits of the free market for health care consumers, gets opposed by Freedom Caucus members as a consequence, yet all Republicans get blamed when what gets enacted, “real healthcare,” disappoints the American people. Worse still, when such a manifestation of “TrumpCare,” sure to be wrongly labeled as a free-market system, is declared a failure, the inevitable next move will be a drive toward full single-payer, Euro-style socialism. This is the dire hazard of practicing the art of the deal with Democrats. Thomas McArdle (Macardghail) was a White House speechwriter for President George W. Bush.

Never mind not being able to use it outside, the cables that connect your headset to mostly stationary computers also keep you from walking too far away. They also present a safety hazard. That is why some companies, notably chip makers like Intel and Qualcomm, are developing standalone headsets. Valve, however, is going by a different route and its newest partner, Quark VR, is now showing off that path. September last year, Valve and Quark VR announced a partnership that would give the HTC Vive some amount of freedom, though still confined indoors. Quark was initially scheduled to demonstrate a prototype in Fall, but that season has come and gone with nary a wireless Vive in sight. Better late than never, as they say, but the 44-second video is hardly satisfying as a demo. As Valve mostly likes to do things in the open, Quark’s approach wasn’t exactly kept a secret, though details are. Instead of having a new or modified Vive headset that would wireless communicate with a PC, Quark used a single-board computer (SBC) that connected to the HTC Vive via cables and then connected wireless with a PC. The Quark transmitter could then be tucked away inside pocket, powered by a portable battery. While this setup doesn’t technically make the Vive itself wireless, is has two very significant advantages. The first is that it solves the problem of the limitations of placing Wi-Fi hardware inside the headset itself, which would, in turn, possibly limit the bandwidth of the connection. Having a dedicated and more powerful Wi-Fi device acting as a middle man could improve performance and minimize lag. Second, and just as important, it requires no hardware changes for the Vive. This means that any HTC Vive already in the market, perhaps any future SteamVR-compatible headset even, could take advantage of this wireless transmitter out of the box while still keeping wired options open. It’s a win-win situation, that is if Quark VR can actually show how well this idea performs in practice.

Share this story United States President Barack Obama reacts as Joey Hudy of Phoenix, Arizona, launches a marshmallow from his Extreme Marshmallow Cannon in the State Dining Room of the White House during the second White House Science Fair in Washington. He and Obama primed the homemade contraption and then blasted its sugary ammo across the room, much to the dismay of the Secret Service. "Ohhh," Obama yelled, before retrieving the marshmallow and Hudy's business card, "just in case." It made for a memorial moment, an Obama administration's favourite, and put Hudy, then 14, into the national spotlight. He became a celebrity Maker, a jet-setting inventor of 3-D body scanners and solar-powered computers, a promoter of STEM programs and the youngest ever corporate intern at Intel. In 2015, he returned to the White House as Michelle Obama's State of the Union guest to promote his personal motto: "Don't be bored. Make something." Brilliant.org once named him one of the "10 Smartest Kids in the World." This year, at age 20, Hudy's mind betrayed him. He had graduated from Arizona State University and moved to Hong Kong, his parents told TV station Fox 10, when he began experiencing paranoia and psychosis. He believed the Chinese government was following him and that his apartment was bugged. "It was something I never dreamed of hearing," Hudy's mother, Julie Hudy, told Fox 10. In January, he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital overseas and diagnosed with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a disease of the mind that affects how a person thinks, feels and behaves. Symptoms usually manifest anywhere from age 16 to 30, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, and can cause those affected to hear and see things that aren't real. Doctors still aren't sure what causes schizophrenia, so treatment focuses on eliminating symptoms with antipsychotic medications and psychosocial therapy. But treating schizophrenia, or any mental illness, can be financially crippling. To help offset the expenses, Hudy's older sister, Elizabeth Hudy, created a GoFundMe account on her parents' behalf. "Anyone who knows my mother and father knows that they are some of the most generous and caring people you will ever meet," Elizabeth Hudy wrote on the fundraising site. "They fill the lives of others with so much love and support and they deserve the same, especially in such a difficult time." While their son got help at an Ohio treatment center in February, Julie and Victor Hudy lived in a nearby hotel, Elizabeth Hudy wrote. His condition deteriorated and last week, Joey Hudy's doctors recommended he be transferred to a long term care facility in Tennessee. "You may not be aware of the significant cost of mental health care in the United States for such a diagnosis, and neither was I," she wrote. Ten days at the Ohio facility cost $19 500. A month in Tennessee will cost more than $25 000. "Joey will likely have to stay for a minimum of three months," Elizabeth wrote. "After this time we still don't know how long it will take for the medications to be effective or what will be the next steps." As of Thursday morning, the family had raised $18 400 of its $50 000 goal and the GoFundMe had been widely circulated on social media among those in the Maker Faire community of tech and science enthusiasts and former Obama White House staffers. Among those who had donated was Paulette Aniskoff, a deputy assistant to the president and director of the Office of Public Engagement in the Obama White House. The family said that any excess funds will go toward helping other families burdened by the cost of mental health care.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Microsoft’s Surface Phone Will Fold In Half Suggests Speculation Around Latest Patent By Ramish Zafar Mar 25, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Microsoft’s Surface Phone won’t launch later this year. The device makes sparse appearances on the rumor mill. Right now, Microsoft’s rumored to take a quite serious approach for the device. The Surface Phone won’t be your standard run of the mill flagship device. It’ll integrate Microsoft’s entire Windows ecosystem, and serve as an effective bridge between the Surface Pro, Surface Book and smartphones. Today, we’ve got some more information that might relate to the device. Take a look below for more details. Microsoft’s Latest Foldable Phone Patent Revives Speculation For The Surface Phone So far, little details are available for the Surface Phone. Latest information for the device suggests that Microsoft will wait until Windows’ transition to ARM becomes smoother. As manufacturing processes and designs improve, low power devices are becoming more capable to use ARM’s solutions rather than Intel’s mobility lineup. A good example is Apple’s iPad Pro lineup and the A9X processors. ARM’s recent DynamIQ launches further solidify this fact. Related Over 10 Million People Now Help Microsoft Make Windows 10 Bug-Free, for Free Advertisement Still, the internet loves to speculate. Microsoft’s latest patent once again relates to a folding smartphone. Redmond’s approach to the device will be strictly enterprise focused. Microsoft wants its users to do more with less, a feat that’s achievable with the excellently designed Surface Pro lineup. Today’s patent shows a folding smartphone. Strictly speaking, such a device isn’t very ergonomic if you ask us. If these images are to scale, then using such a device will be headache. It looks more like a notebook to us. Rumors that Microsoft wants to use the Surface Phone to complete Windows’ transition to ARM do lend more credibility to today’s speculation. A permanent, dedicated keyboard that’s easily accessible by folding does make sense here. But since the Surface Phone isn’t expected until next year, keep directions to your nearest salt mine intact as well. Related Microsoft Sued (Again) for $5 Million Over Alleged Data Loss and Damaged Hardware The Surface Phone is also rumored to record 3D content. 3D is maintaining its strong hype this year, particularly as 10nm processors will include greater support for VR. We really hope that some more information for the Microsoft Surface Phone surfaces. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ take up all the space these days and frankly, we’re bored. Are you? Thoughts? Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned. We’ll keep you updated on the latest.

Zesty Zapus covers Ubuntu desktop, server and cloud editions, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Gnome, MATE, Studio and Xubuntu flavours. It’s not a huge feature boost, but the release is using the Linux 4.10 kernel, useful if your iron runs Intel Kaby Lake or AMD Ryzen silicon. If configuring the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) is on your hate-list, there’s good news: the release includes support for driverless printing. Either Apple AirPrint or IPP Everywhere printers can be installed without printer-specific drivers – and if it Works As Expected® discovery should happen automatically when the printer is connected to the USB or the LAN. HP printer/scanner users are warned not to run it in driverless mode, because it won’t scan. Such devices can, however, be installed using the HPLIP driver.

And it will be fuelled by the next era of mobile technology. The headlines leading to the Mobile World Congress this month have centred on the next big consumer mobile launches, but as consumer mobility matures, commercial mobility has yet to hit its full disruptive potential. And this isn’t just about the odd day working from home. Mobility is going to put into question our whole notion of “work”. Share this story With PwC predicting that the global gig economy will be worth $63 billion by 2020, what will a “job” really mean to children born today as they leave education? A globally connected network of freelancers could be selling their services online in a fluid digital marketplace prompted by the proliferation of mobile devices and apps. And getting to work will be revolutionised. Boston Consulting Group predicts that the rise of autonomous vehicles, and associated car-sharing, will reduce the cost of car travel by 20-40 percent, and cut average journey times by 40 percent in 10-20 years’ time. Suddenly, cramped commutes become unviable and unnecessary. And as the car completes its evolution into a connected computer on wheels, it becomes a productive work environment in itself. Read also: Mobile technology to spur financial firms Petrol or electricity may power the mechanics of our car, but mobility is powering its evolution. It’s why we’re seeing collaborations between car makers and telco equipment firms, such as the recent deal between BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz and Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm to develop the 5G infrastructure needed for self-driving cars. But “work” as a single location that we commute to each day may be an obsolete concept long before our cars drive themselves. We’re already moving towards the notion of a “blended life” whereby folks increasingly see work as “a thing you do” and not just a “place you go”. At the same time, co-working spaces have recently exploded in popularity in cities across the globe. These attractive, collaborative environments are hotbeds of innovation. They’re a physical embodiment of today’s dynamic employment market. But co-working isn’t just for start-ups. Corporates are also getting in on the act, with companies such as KPMG opening their own doors to create centres of collaboration. The office of the future probably won’t be an office at all. Expensive city-centre floor space, with its doors locked to outside influence and innovation, will begin to look like a thing of the past, and “out of office” will become the norm, not the exception. But like the gig economy and self-driving cars, co-working space doesn’t function without intelligent mobile technology. As the global workforce goes increasingly mobile, people need to take their offices with them wherever they go. Employees are in search of a PC equivalent to a Swiss army knife that can transform based on the task at hand. As such, we’re delivering devices that bring traditional PC-based productivity to a more mobile experience, in a way that IT can securely manage and service. For instance, at Mobile World Congress this week we launched the HP Pro x2, a versatile tablet and notebook “detachable” device featuring multiple modes for commercial use. We also announced a range of new accessories for the HP Elite x3, the first true 3-in-1 device for mobile workers. These new technologies are designed with versatility in mind to help mobile professionals be productive and remain connected, in the office or on the go. It’s perhaps no wonder that 3 out of 4 of CIOs say mobility will have a bigger impact on their business than the advent of the internet. Mobility will reinvent work, and at HP we’re reinventing mobility. David Rozzio is the managing director of HP Africa.

Ex-CIA Director: Mike Flynn and Turkish officials discussed removal of Erdogan foe from U.S. Mar, 27 2017 Author: newsroom The cleric has been accused by Turkey of orchestrating last summer’s failed military coup Related Former Trump aide Flynn says lobbying may have helped Turkey Judicial Watch sues CIA, DOJ & Treasury for records related… Trump son-in-law Kushner to face Russia investigation panel Retired Army Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, while serving as an adviser to the Trump campaign, met with top Turkish government ministers and discussed removing a Muslim cleric from the U.S. and taking him to Turkey, according to former Central Intelligence Agency Director James Woolsey, who attended, and others who were briefed on the meeting. The discussion late last summer involved ideas about how to get Fethullah Gulen, a cleric whom Turkey has accused of orchestrating last summer’s failed military coup, to Turkey without going through the U.S. extradition legal process, according to Mr. Woolsey and those who were briefed. Mr. Woolsey told The Wall Street Journal he arrived at the meeting in New York on Sept. 19 in the middle of the discussion and found the topic startling and the actions being discussed possibly illegal. The Turkish ministers were interested in open-ended thinking on the subject, and the ideas were raised hypothetically, said the people who were briefed. The ministers in attendance included the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the country’s foreign minister, foreign-lobbying disclosure documents show. Mr. Woolsey said the idea was “a covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away.” The discussion, he said, didn’t include actual tactics for removing Mr. Gulen from his U.S. home. If specific plans had been discussed, Mr. Woolsey said, he would have spoken up and questioned their legality. It isn’t known who raised the idea or what Mr. Flynn concluded about it. Price Floyd, a spokesman for Mr. Flynn, who was advising the Trump campaign on national security at the time of the meeting, disputed the account, saying “at no time did Gen. Flynn discuss any illegal actions, nonjudicial physical removal or any other such activities.” Mr. Flynn served as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser for 24 days and resigned after he misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about his contact with a Russian diplomat. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into whether Trump campaign officials collaborated with the Russian government to influence the presidential election. On March 2, weeks after Mr. Flynn’s departure from the Trump administration, the Flynn Intel Group, his consulting firm, filed with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the government of Turkey. Mr. Trump was unaware Mr. Flynn had been consulting on behalf of the Turkish government when he named him national security adviser, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said this month. In its filing, Mr. Flynn’s firm said its work from August to November “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” The filing said his firm’s fee, $530,000, wasn’t paid by the government but by Inovo BV, a Dutch firm owned by a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin. U.S.-Turkish relations deteriorated in the final year of the Obama administration over disagreements about extraditing Mr. Gulen and U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish forces battling Islamic State. The Turkish government has been demanding Mr. Gulen’s extradition to face charges that he was the architect of an unsuccessful military coup last summer to overthrow Mr. Erdogan. Mr. Gulen, who since 1999 has lived in the Pocono Mountains north of Philadelphia and has a green card giving him permission to live in the U.S., denies involvement. Mr. Erdogan has been trying for years to undermine Mr. Gulen, a onetime ally whom Turkey has now branded as a terrorist leader. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Tuesday he had given the White House and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions new evidence linking Mr. Gulen to the coup. Mr. Woolsey said he attended the Sept. 19 meeting at the urging of the Flynn Intel Group’s chairman and president, Bijan Kian. Mr. Woolsey said he had agreed to be on the group’s advisory board and was offered a consulting fee for his work, but turned it down because of what he heard at the meeting. He held no stake in the firm. “It seemed to be naive,” Mr. Woolsey said about the discussion. “I didn’t put a lot of credibility in it. This is a country of legal process and a Constitution, and you don’t send out folks to haul somebody overseas.” The meeting, held at the Essex House hotel in Manhattan, included Mr. Cavusoglu and Berat Albayrak, Mr. Erdogan’s son-in-law and the country’s energy minister, according to the disclosure documents. Also present were Messrs. Alptekin and Mr. Kian. Mr. Woolsey said he didn’t say anything during the discussion, but later cautioned some attendees that trying to remove Mr. Gulen was a bad idea that might violate U.S. law. Mr. Woolsey said he also informed the U.S. government by notifying Vice President Joe Biden through a mutual friend. The mutual friend confirmed to the Journal he told Mr. Biden about the meeting. Mr. Biden’s spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter, other than to say Mr. Biden felt the Gulen matter should be handled through the courts. Mr. Flynn’s spokesman, Mr. Floyd, said that at the meeting “Gen. Flynn did discuss the Flynn Intel Group’s work for Inovo that included gathering information that could lead to a legal case against Mr. Gulen.” Messrs. Kian and Alptekin didn’t respond to calls and emails seeking comment, nor did a spokesman for Mr. Albayrak. Mr. Cavusoglu’s spokesman referred the Journal to the Turkish Embassy in Washington. In a written statement, the Turkish Embassy acknowledged that Turkish officials met with Mr. Flynn but declined to discuss the conversation. Referencing the Flynn Intel Group’s client, Inovo, the embassy said: “We are not in a position to comment on any engagement between a U.S. consultancy firm and a private company owned by a Turkish businessman.” The disclosure Mr. Flynn’s firm filed with the U.S. government this month said the meeting was “for the purpose of understanding better the political climate in Turkey at the time.” Inovo hired Mr. Flynn on behalf of an Israeli company seeking to export natural gas to Turkey, the filing said, and Mr. Alptekin wanted information on the U.S.-Turkey political climate to advise the gas company about its Turkish investments. Mr. Woolsey, who served as CIA director under President Bill Clinton, offered in September to advise the Trump campaign and opposed Hillary Clinton for president. He briefly served as a senior adviser to the transition team.

Training Certification Events Webinars Community Participate Q&A Forums Blogs Resources Newsletter Distributions Publications Infographics Photos Videos Jobs Eric Brown March 23, 2017 Latest Linux Maker Boards Gamble on Diversity beaglebone-blue.png The BeagleBone Blue is a robotics-focused collaboration with the University of California San Diego Robotics Lab, which is using the board for robotics education. Used with permission BeagleBone As usual, last week’s Embedded World show in Nuremberg, Germany was primarily focused on commercial embedded single board computers (SBCs), computer-on-modules, and rugged industrial systems for the OEM market. Yet, we also saw a growing number of community-backed maker boards, which, like most of the commercial boards, run Linux. The new crop shows the growing diversity of hacker SBCs, which range from completely open source models to proprietary prototyping boards that nevertheless offer low prices and community services such as forums and open source Linux distributions. The latest hacker SBCs include: BeagleBone Blue -- A robotics-focused spin of the BeagleBone Black Chameleon96 -- The first FPGA-enabled and first ARMv7 96Boards entry NanoPi Neo2 -- A headless, $15 boardlet that is the smallest quad-core ARMv8 SBC yet Up Core -- One of the smallest and most ARM-like x86-based hacker boards to date In recent years, we’ve seen amazing price reductions and performance improvements on community-backed boards, as well as rampant imitation. The prime source of reflection is the Raspberry Pi, which recently spawned a wireless enabled, $10 Raspberry Pi Zero W.  Cumulatively, the Raspberry Pi models are now said to be the third best-selling computer in history, beating out the Commodore 64 with 12.5 million units sold. Because Raspberry Pi Trading has an exclusive deal with Broadcom on the boards’ BCM2836 and BCM2837 SoCs, there are no absolute clones of the RPi. However, the dimensions, the 40-pin expansion header, and in many cases the port layout and selection are imitated in dozens of SBCs. None of the four boards covered here offer full RPi expansion compatibility, and they bravely head off in new directions. We’re seeing similar diversity in the latest COM/carrier board combinations. Nvidia’s third-generation, Linux-driven Jetson TX2 module launched earlier this month with a proprietary COM design, but with an open carrier board schematic, thereby enabling third-party participation. Connect Tech responded with three carriers for the TX2, which features a high-end new Tegra Parker SoC designed for graphics and AI. These include a basic $99 Sprocket, a Spaceley board designed to work with Pixhawk drone autopilots, and a Cogswell carrier aimed at Gigabit Ethernet vision camera (GigE Vision) applications. Auvidea is also working on a carrier, and Connect Tech’s original three TX1-compatible carriers work on the TX2 as well as the TX1. The new SBCs detailed below offer even more choices. Staking out new territory without RPi add-on compatibility is a risky choice, but so is introducing yet another me-too board that may struggle to differentiate. The following four Linux-friendly boards show some interesting new directions for hacker SBCs beyond DIY media players and home automation prototyping. BeagleBone Blue Over the past two years, BeagleBoard.org has worked with a variety of partners to produce certified pseudo-clones of the popular TI Sitara AM335x based BeagleBone Black. These include Seeed’s Grove compatible BeagleBone Green and BeagleBone Green Wireless and its own BeagleBone Black Wireless, which includes a SiP packaged core computer built by Octavo Systems. The new BeagleBone Blue is a robotics-focused collaboration with the University of California San Diego Robotics Lab, which is using the board for robotics education. Like the BB Black Wireless, the $80 BeagleBone Blue has built-in wireless and an Octavo SiP package that pre-integrates the 1GHz, Cortex-A9 Sitara AM3358, 512MB RAM, and 4GB eMMC flash. The board also adds a battery connector, IMU, barometer, and motor control features like servos, encoder inputs, and motor outputs. While robotics has always been a strength of the BB Black, the BB Blue gives you most of the basic tools without requiring additional cape add-ons. Chameleon96 Linaro’s open source 96Boards spec was adopted by some of the first 64-bit ARMv8 SBCs, including Arrow’s Qualcomm-backed DragonBoard 410C. Now Arrow has announced the first ARMv7 96Boards entry -- and the first FPGA-enabled 96Boards SBC -- with the Chameleon96. The SBC runs Debian Linux on a Cyclone V SE SoC from Intel PSG (Programmable Solutions Group), the new post-acquisition name for Intel’s Altera FPGA unit. The Cyclone V combines dual 800MHz Cortex-A9 cores with a modest FPGA subsystem with 110K LE performance. Among other duties, the FPGA handles the video subsystem, which decodes and encodes 60fps 1080p streams via HDMI and MIPI-CSI interfaces, respectively. By applying FPGA to video, the board enables development of “custom IPU/GPU/VPU solutions,” says Arrow. The Chameleon96, which like other 96Boards CE SBCs expresses most of its interfaces via 40-pin low- and 60-pin high-speed expansion connectors, is also notable for its integration of SecureRF’s quantum resistant cryptography technology. SecureRF’s Ironwood Key Agreement Protocol and Walnut DSA Digital Signature Algorithm are designed for securing reduced footprint, low-energy IoT devices. NanoPi Neo2 The NanoPi Neo2 is the third iteration of the minimalist 40x40mm NanoPi Neo designs from FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM), following the NanoPi Neo and wireless-ready NanoPi Neo Air. The Ubuntu Core and Armbian Linux supported Neo2 advances to an ARMv8 quad-core, Cortex-A53 Allwinner H5, making it the world’s smallest 64-bit ARM hacker board. At $15, it’s also one of the most affordable. The IoT-oriented NanoPi Neo2 is headless, without a real-world display port, so it’s not for your casual weekend hacker. The board offers 512MB of RAM, but storage is dependent on the microSD slot. Coastline ports include Gigabit Ethernet, USB 2.0 host, and micro-USB OTG. Onboard interfaces include an expansion interface that is said to be compatible with the first 24 pins of the Raspberry Pi. UP Core Unlike the above three boards, the UP Core is not a fully open source design, but Aaeon is otherwise striving to serve hobbyist makers as well as small-run commercial vendors. For example, the company has opened up the spec for its 100-pin expansion connector so third party developers can create their own boards that extend the SBC’s capabilities. At 66x56.5mm, this community-backed board is smaller than the similarly quad-core Intel “Cherry Trail” Atom driven UP board. That’s only slightly petite by ARM standards, but the it’s one of the smallest x86 based hacker SBCs around. It will soon launch on Kickstarter for a price starting at $69. Once again, this is nothing special for ARM boards, but it’s cheap compared to most community-backed x86 SBCs. The UP Core replaces the GbE port with WiFi and Bluetooth, but is otherwise a scaled back version of the original UP board. The SBC supports up to 4GB DDR3L RAM and up to 64GB eMMC, and coastline ports include HDMI and USB 3.0 ports. Additional interfaces include MIPI-CSI, USB 2.0, I2S, and eDP. Aaeon’s parent company Asus has received even more attention for its quasi-open, maker-oriented Tinker Board. Launched in Europe in January, the $68 SBC runs Debian or Kodi on a quad-core Cortex-A17 Rockchip RK3288. The board features 2GB RAM, GbE, 4K video, and yes, that tried and true RPi-compatible 40-pin connector. Connect with the Linux community at Open Source Summit North America on September 11-13.

Paul Gilbert with the original computer that he built for Traf-O-Data, the company that Bill Gates and Paul Allen started before they founded Microsoft. (Photo Courtesy George Sammit) Microsoft is one of the most successful and influential companies in the world, but did you know that Bill Gates and Paul Allen launched an earlier venture as high school students in Seattle? It was called Traf-O-Data, a startup in the 1970s that developed a computer system to count traffic.  If it hadn’t been for our Traf-O-Data venture … you could argue that Microsoft might not have happened. Their partner in Traf-O-Data was Paul Gilbert, who was a University of Washington electrical engineering student when Gates and Allen were using UW computer labs at night, to hone their programming skills and develop their new business. Gilbert, now 65, recalls seeing Gates and Allen walking down a University of Washington hallway. They asked him, “Can you build us a microcomputer?” After thinking about it, he agreed to join them, and he became a partner in the business. “I got access to the Intel information, and we bought the chip and built it from the ground up,” he recalled, speaking with GeekWire recently after Allen gave him a special shout-out from stage during an event at the UW’s newly christened Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. Paul Allen speaks at the University of Washington on March 9, 2017. (GeekWire photo) Wrote Paul Allen in a LinkedIn post, “While Bill Gates and I handled the software side of (Traf-O-Data), the machine itself was built on campus by a UW student named Paul Gilbert, a partner Bill Gates and I recruited into our high school business venture. Paul did an amazing job turning the first 8-bit microprocessor in Seattle into a real computer.” Allen went on to explain why Traf-O-Data was such an important venture: Objectively speaking, Traf-O-Data was a failure as a company. Right as our business started to pick up, states began to provide their own traffic-counting services to local governments for free. As quickly as it started, our business model evaporated. But while Traf-O-Data was technically a business failure, the understanding of microprocessors we absorbed was crucial to our future success. And the emulator I wrote to program it gave us a huge head start over anyone else writing code at the time. If it hadn’t been for our Traf-O-Data venture, and if it hadn’t been for all that time spent on UW computers, you could argue that Microsoft might not have happened. As their first partner, Gilbert got lots of experience working with Allen and Gates in their early years. As he recalled, “Bill was just hyperactive, his foot was always shaking and he had short patience. Very, very limited patience. And Paul was so laid-back. … Paul would say, ‘Oh, it’s OK.’ We’ll get over it.’ He’d always be the companion. And I’d say, ‘At least I haven’t been kicked off the job.’ ” RELATED: A conversation with Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen: ‘It really is a golden age of what’s possible’ So did Gilbert ever think that Gates and Allen would go on to become some of the most successful technology entrepreneurs in the world? “No, in fact that whole concept of having a big clunky PC in your house that just used up room, I thought that was totally dumb,” he said. “I did not have any foresight into what was really going on. I just kinda fought it in my mind, and said, ‘Nah, this is not going to work.’ ” Gilbert went on to become a software engineer at Boeing, and today lives in Palm Bay, Fla. He got a chance to speak with Paul Allen and other tech luminaries at the recent UW event, and he was still beaming with enthusiasm after the presentation. “It’s impossible, I can’t really be standing here in this group,” he said. “I think it’s still sinking in.” ALSO READ: Years before giving UW millions, teenage Paul Allen was booted from school’s computer lab Todd Bishop is GeekWire's co-founder and editor, a longtime technology journalist who covers subjects including cloud tech, e-commerce, virtual reality, devices, apps and tech giants such as Amazon.com, Apple, Microsoft and Google.

Deep learning, the most widely used type of AI, is already enhancing cloud services by Tencent’s American and Chinese competitors, cloud giants like Google, Microsoft, Baidu, and Alibaba. The company has been ramping up investment in AI in a big way; Ma Huateng, its founder and chairman, views AI innovation as a matter of life and death for the business. In the data center, Nvidia’s Tesla GPUs, based on the chipmaker’s Pascal architecture, are currently state-of-the-art hardware for deep learning. Cloud giants pack as many as eight of these high-power units onto a server motherboard along with Intel CPUs, using them to teach computers to do things like predicting search results, identifying objects in photos, and serving targeted ads. See also: This Data Center is Designed for Machine Learning The amount of resources cloud giants have been investing in AI are driving a surge in demand for hardware like Nvidia’s. “We’ve been working with a lot of the hyper-scales – really all of the hyper-scales – in the large data centers,” Rob Ober, Tesla chief platform architect at Nvidia, told Data Center Knowledge in an interview earlier this month. These companies are also using GPUs to provide AI-enhanced cloud services to their enterprise customers, and some of them let customers rent “bare-metal” GPUs the same way they rent virtual machines in the cloud to run their own deep learning workloads. “Tencent Cloud GPU offerings with Nvidia’s deep learning platform will help companies in China rapidly integrate AI capabilities into their products and services,” Tencent Cloud VP Sam Xie said in a statement. Tencent’s deployment of Tesla P100 and P40 GPUs and Nvidia’s deep learning software is focused primarily on such enterprise cloud services. The Chinese company has been offering cloud services running on earlier-generation Tesla M40 GPUs since December. It expects to integrate cloud servers with up to eight GPUs each by mid-year.

In the case of the Dell Inspiron 7000, you get a beefy gaming computer that can take whatever game designers throw at it. Unfortunately, its physical design is rife with trade-offs. Indeed, you get a pretty great machine when you spend that $2000 on Dell's budget gaming laptop, but you're never gonna forget it's cheap. And $2000 is pretty cheap for a 15-inch gaming laptop with a 7th-generation Intel i5 processor, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti video card, and a 256GB SSD. (The base $1900 model gives you a slightly slower GTX 1050 video card and a traditional 1TB hard drive.) And for those unfamiliar with specs let me be totally clear: This thing flies. I easily squeaked out a little more than 30 frames per second when I played Rise of the Tomb Raider on High settings. On WebXPRT, a popular synthetic benchmark that tests for browser-based activities like spreadsheets, photo editing, and web page loading, the Inspiron 7000 scored a 412, which is nearly identical to the score notched by the zippy new 33cm Macbook Pro. And it's much faster than the gaming-focused Razer Stealth Blade. The Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming laptop is a device meant to fly despite its price. Nerds will note that it won't give you 60 frames per second on a graphically intensive game like Battlefield 1 or Rise of the Tomb Raider, but 30fps is more than enough for normal mortals. The cheap machine also gives you a really nice full keyboard with keys backlit by red LEDs. Though the red isn't just reserved for the keys. The vents are covered in a fine red mesh, and the top and sides of the laptop are covered in a pleasant soft touch red. "That's gross," a co-worker opined. "I love it," I responded, clutching the giant laptop to my chest. While most budget laptops are thirteen inches or smaller, the Dell Inspiron 7000 is a 15-inch machine. And it's bulky in more than one way, weighing a solid 2.65kg and measuring an inch thick when closed. It's hefty because to keep the price cheap, Dell is using effective — but space consuming — measures to handle the heat put out by the discrete graphics card and processor. (If you want thin, you'll need to spend a lot more money for something like the 2017 Razer Blade, which starts at $2800, or the MSI GT62VR, which starts at around $2300. To manage heat cheaply and efficiently, Dell uses a set of fans which roar to life when playing games. Running a game as simple as Civilisation VI immediately kicked them into high gear and forced me to turn up the volume of the TV I was watching in the background while I played. But the fans definitely kept the laptop cool, too. A few rounds of Overwatch can make some laptops so hot you don't want to touch them, but I had zero issues keeping the Inspiron 7000 on my lap. To get this laptop to such a cheap price Dell also had to skimp on physical build quality and aesthetics. The 15-inch 1080p display is...not good. It just has awful viewing angles. Stoop forward or lean back and you instant get a completely different visual experience. Which is deeply frustrating. Just like the sharp corners of the chassis that dig into your forearms when you type. Ouch. In the end, the roaring fans and a bad screen are constant reminders that you saved a lot of cash to get this laptop. And you did! There are very few laptops in the $1900-$2000 price range that are as efficient and fast as this one. But when you're saving money, you can't get everything you want. If all you care about is playing some games on a PC, then get the Dell Inspiron 7000 Gaming. If you want something beautifully engineered, then keep saving your money. README It's a $2000 laptop that lets you play the newest games on high settings. The display leaves a lot to be desired, but a full-sized HDMI port means you can always plug it into a nice display. A full-size keyboard is welcome for gamers who rely on a number pad. Sharp corners near the palm rests will bite into your forearms. This thing is f**king huge. And its whirling fans are crazy loud. Comments zell71 @zell71 Mar 27, 2017, 1:41pm totally agree with the review. i bought one of these - i sent it back just because the screen is appalling. the machine flies, but its a bulky piece of equipment. if it wasn't for the screen i would have kept it but i couldn't live with the screen. i spent an extra $600 and got an XPS 15 2017 (dell had a discount on the XPS range) and i couldn't be happier. Reply 0 soldant @soldant Mar 27, 2017, 3:12pm My Asus ROG laptop comes with a 1070 and only cost about $500 more - so I don't know how anybody could recommend this thing with a 1050. If you're going to buy a gaming laptop you're probably going to suffer portability issues, there's simply no way around it - so you might as well get something with a powerful GPU for extra cash, as opposed to a compromise like this. At $2k there are probably better options... hell I'd even be tempted to look at an Alienware 13 - similar sort of base specs (except smaller), plus you could use their external GPU solution if you're going to dock it. Reply 0 That_Dan_Guy @that_dan_person Mar 27, 2017, 3:36pm I've been eyeing off that laptop a few weeks ago. But after seeing one in store that screen is just a deal breaker. Last edited March 27, 2017 4:07 pm Reply 0 Tanner Guest Mar 27, 2017, 4:17pm $2000 is a complete ripoff for this, try almost anything from MSI and you'll find superior or equal specs for $1500 or less. I7 vs i5, 1Tb + 256Gb, and a 1050 ti, same size, much better screen, rgb keyboard, same thickness, same weight, brushed aluminum black instead of that god awful red, newegg has it right now for $1430. Who in their right mind would buy an overpriced turd like this inspiron? Reply 0 anon @anon Mar 27, 2017, 4:48pm Wow! So much hate. I'm not a gamer but rather a video editor and need the quad i7 processing power that this model offers. And to be honest I couldn't be happier for the price which was around $1600 on sale. Granted it's the 1050 model, but again it's the price and processor that interests me more. And I'm sure it'll play WoT just fine when I free up some time. Reply 0 pawel04 @pawel04 Mar 27, 2017, 6:41pm "And it's much faster than the gaming-focused Razer Stealth Blade." Not bashing the entire article but this is bit of an unfair comparison. Of course the Inspirion 7000 will be quicker as the Blade only comes with integrated graphics, however what makes the Razer Stealth 'gaming-focused' is its ability to couple a desktop card with its base specs in which case any card over a 1050ti will be faster.. *Note: I realise that the Stealth along with the core is much more expensive, im only challenging the above claim. Reply 0 Arsay Guest Mar 28, 2017, 12:45am I've had an Inspiron 7000 for about a month and I absolutely love it! I was worried about the screen after reading numerous reviews and while it does look washed out sometimes I honestly feel like the criticisms are overblown. I bought mine for 1200 and that was with an i7 and 1050ti and I am more than happy with its performance. I am a gamer and it does everything I could ask of it. But I suppose If you're a hardcore gamer with 2500 dollars lying around you should probably look elsewhere. Reply 0 nizmo_man @nizmo_man Mar 28, 2017, 1:52pm $1,200 is a fair bit cheaper than $2,000 eh? Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

The Wall Street bank, which has already banked a cool $1 billion profit with its early stage investment in Israeli car tech company Mobileye, lost out on nearly doubling that gain when it sold off its stake in the company to comply with the Volcker Rule, sources said. Goldman Sachs will get to earn a little of that “lost” profit back now that it has been hired by Mobileye to act as an adviser on its $15 billion sale to Intel, The Post has learned. The hiring was made in recent days, sources said. Previously, Mobileye was working only with investment bank Raymond James. Goldman made most of its $1 billion profit soon after it helped take Mobileye public in 2014 at $25 a share — then the largest US initial public offering of an Israeli company. A the time of the IPO, Goldman owned roughly 17.5 percent of the company, whose computer chips and cameras alert cars to brake to avoid hitting other cars and pedestrians, thanks to an early $130 million investment in the company — and a followup 2013 investment. The first investment came in 2007, just as Mobileye’s technology was getting into cars and when it needed the cash to survive. But the firm had to sell its shares, owned through Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, its private-equity fund, to comply with 2013’s Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from making speculative bets with its own money. Partly as a result of the Volcker Rule, Goldman, around 2015, sold all its Mobileye shares, netting a roughly $1 billion profit, two sources said. If it didn’t have to sell the stake, Mobileye’s fast-rising stock price would have handed Goldman another nearly $1 billion profit when it agreed to be bought this month by Intel, sources said. “They were the only institution that funded them in the financial crisis,” a source said. At the time, Mobileye had a reported $600 million valuation. It is now worth $13.5 billion. Mobileye shares at the end of 2015 traded at $35.98 a share. Intel is paying $63.54 per share for the company. Mobileye is coveted because of the role it is likely to play not only in today’s cars — as it helps drivers to avoid accidents — but in driverless cars. The company has retained Goldman for the Intel sale even though it has already signed a deal because it wants to reward the bank for its help over the years, a source said. Goldman declined to comment.

Trump-Russia collusion is being investigated by FBI, Comey confirms https://t.co/pKvStJDuNV — The Guardian (@guardian) March 20, 2017 “Other than allowing routine governmental functions, there must be a total and complete shutdown of any agenda item being pushed by the Trump Administration. Congress cannot continue regular order and must stop voting on any Trump-backed agenda item until the FBI completes its Trump-Russia collusion investigation,” Lieu wrote in a press release. "President" @realDonaldTrump: You truly are an evil man. Your job is to help Americans. Not intentionally try to destroy their lives. https://t.co/2M94E1g39b — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 25, 2017 In the scathing report, Lieu appears to suggest that President Trump may have committed treason and cited a report which claimed that several U.S. officials believe the FBI has information about coordinated effort between members of Trump’s team and suspected Russian operatives to release hacked information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton, the Independent wrote. President Donald Trump denied that his campaign had allied with Russia to interfere with last November’s elections, ahead of the first public hearing in Congress on alleged Kremlin interference in those elections. Trump tweets ahead of Intel hearing: Russia collusion is "FAKE NEWS" https://t.co/ZZwLe0Ewdu pic.twitter.com/nJlaiARnER — The Hill (@thehill) March 21, 2017 In his personal Twitter account, Trump said that James Clapper, who was national director of intelligence in the government of former President Barack Obama, and “others” have said there is no evidence that he “conspired with Russia.” James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 For the FBI, counterintelligence investigations are one of the most complicated and time-consuming cases, and the case could possibly go on for years. In January, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered a covert job to undermine Hillary Clinton’s opportunities and help Trump. The House Intelligence Committee is charged with investigating the alleged interference by the Russian government in the November elections, an investigation in which Trump requested to also include alleged practices of illegal listening against him. In the report, Lieu states that “the bombshell revelation that U.S. officials have information that suggests Trump associates may have colluded with the Russians means we must pause the entire Trump agenda. We may have an illegitimate President of the United States currently occupying the White House.” As a report from Common Dreams pointed out, Lieu is not alone in his call to halt the president’s agenda. Noted filmmaker and activist Michael Moore urged the Democratic Party to declare a national emergency after the FBI said it was investigating Donald Trump’s team and he posted the following message on his Instagram account. “The Democratic Party needs to declare a National Emergency. For the first time in our history, the President of the United States and his staff are under investigation for espionage. This announcement, by the head of the Trump-friendly FBI, is a shock to our democracy.” the left-wing author wrote. “The Democratic leadership in the House and Senate needs to bring a halt to all business being done in the name of this potential felony suspect, Donald J. Trump. No bill he supports, no Supreme Court nominee he has named, can be decided while he is under a criminal investigation.” Furthermore, a petition hosted by MoveOn.org says that Congress must pause all Trump-related legislation and appointments and it asked the below question. “How can Congress, in good conscience, agree to further Trump’s agenda amid such serious allegations regarding possible illegal collusion with Russia? The answer is simple: It can’t.” FBI director James Comey noted that the agency is investigating the origin of any link between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any kind of coordination between the campaign and the meddling of Russia. U.S. officials said that so far they have found no evidence of the above. However, there are ex-officials and a few others who remain in office claiming to have discovered evidence that there were people associated with Trump who had repeated contact with Russian officials, including people linked to Russian intelligence.

It is a Z270 motherboard with, you guessed it, a bit of a chrome design, maybe I should call it Titanium looks? ;) Pun aside, that is a great looking board though. Gigabyte is proud to announce the addition of the Z270X-DESIGNARE to GIGABYTE’s 200 Series Family. The DESIGNARE motherboard, as the name implies, is geared towards the creative minds of content creators. This series of motherboards was first introduced in the Intel 100 Series Chipset to promote Nvidia Quadro graphics cards. By placing it through tried and tested benchmarks with real world environment settings, the DESIGNARE Motherboard is optimized for content creators of all levels. With the 200 series GIGABYTE has done it again and this time with a distinctive silver alloy PCB design and unique markings along the front and rear of the board. Just like its predecessor, the 200 series DESIGNARE Motherboard is fully validated and optimized for Nvidia Quadro graphics cards and high-performance graphics to ensure designers have nothing holding them back. Supports 7th/ 6th Generation Intel® Core™ Processors Dual Channel Non-ECC Unbuffered DDR4, 4 DIMMs Front USB 3.1 Gen 2 Header Fast USB 3.1 Gen 2 with USB Type-C™ and Type-A 3-Way Graphics Support with Dual Armor and Ultra Durable™ Design Dual NVMe PCIe SSDs in RAID 0 Support NVMe PCIe Gen3 x4 U.2 Connector Ultra-Fast M.2 with PCIe Gen3 x4 & SATA interface Intel® Optane™ Memory Ready ALC1220 120dB SNR HD Audio with Smart Headphone Amp Intel® GbE LAN with cFosSpeed Internet Accelerator Software USB DAC-UP 2 with Adjustable Voltage RGB FUSION LED Light Show Design Swappable Overlay for Accent LED Smart Fan 5 features Multiple Temperature Sensors and Hybrid Fan Headers Silver Alloy Coated PCB Design Lightning-Fast Intel® Thunderbolt™ 3 AIC Support GIGABYTE UEFI DualBIOS™ APP Center Including EasyTune™ and Cloud Station™ Utilities “Content creators need a high-performance platform that can keep up with the inventive minds as they craft their masterpieces.” – Henry Kao, Vice President of GIGABYTE’s Motherboard Business Unit.

If these were really any more qualified than the next board, I would assume they would have an auxiliary molex/sata/6- or 8-pin to ensure adequate power delivery over PCIe. In fact, considering all the fancy detailing, I'm pretty sure a designer wouldn't care diddly-squat what a computer looks like on the inside.

These would be intended for the CPUs like we mentioned earlier today, the 16-core / 32-threaded parts. Much like the X99 platform from Intel. Now first off a massive disclaimer, I cannot confirm that these diagrams are real hence this might be speculation. Then again, the detail in the diagrams is pretty deep, much more then you'd expect from a bit of a hobby job. The motherboard diagrams appears to be coming from ASUS, you can tell as there is an AURA ASIC on-board and that would be the AURA LED controller of course, proprietary to ASUS. Now this is an interesting fact, as we all assumed that the 16-core part might be a server processes series. However a server motherboard with RGB AURA connectivity, naah this is an enthusiast class consumer motherboard alright. The processor socket is designated as AM44, sounds a bit weird bit it definitely is bigger. Next to that you can spot eight DIMM slots.   AMD X399/X390 Then there are two more diagrams showing the X399 chipset for dual-CPU motherboards and X390 for single-CPU motherboard. The first diagram might be the workstation/server platform for Naples CPUs as it has ECC memory support. X390 corresponds to earlier rumors about Ryzen HEDT, which is meant for 16-core 32-thread Ryzen processors. So if you look at the info and those diagrams are a real thing then X390 chipset would support up to 44 PCI-Express lanes. That would be even more than Intel’s flagship Core i7 6950X on X99 platform (40 lanes). Interesting to see is that the dual-socket board is listing the processors as RZ4700, and the single socket version as RZ 2700.     Now there is no frickin way we can confirm the validity of these block diagrams, but they certainly are very interesting.

Now there is something new for PC enthusiast gamers and this time before Intel. Waiting for X99 successor to compare to this chipset and decide my new mobo and CPU for a MGPU setup. Can this X390 chipset provide X16/X16 for SLI or CFX? If there is no Quad channel memory support in the single CPU mobo chipset... No good.

You are pro. I would never buy a cpu @~999 EUR and a mobo at @~299 price range with only dual channel support for the single cpu system. (X390) Intel is much better at this. They've won. Only they have to improve their prices. I cant believe AMD forces you buying dual cpu chipset(X399) with double the cost on both cpu and mobo 2000+plus EUR altogether to have quad channel support. I will not build my true gaming rig with AMD this time. I am gonna keep my cheap "red" athlon for surfing only. RIP red team, you will not have HEDT users like that except fanatics and fanboys who will choose the "red" pill, others like me will choose the "blue" pill.

Unless Intel won't come up with something sensible, but I doubt they can make such a big step quickly.Anyway if x390/399 will come this year then Intel just got attacked on every front.

Top News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Wednesday March 29, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us World Africa Middle East Europe Americas US Election 2016 Ex-CIA chief: Flynn's firm discussed removing cleric from US CHAD DAY, AP  Monday, March 27, 2017, 3:59 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ 中文 WASHINGTON -- Former CIA Director James Woolsey has accused the Trump administration's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, of participating in a discussion with Turkish officials about possibly subverting the U.S. extradition process to remove a Turkish cleric from the United States. The Wall Street Journal first reported Woolsey's comments and posted a video interview with him late Friday . A Flynn spokesman said Friday that Woolsey's claims are "false" and that "no such discussion occurred." In the Journal interview, Woolsey says he walked into the middle of a discussion between Turkish officials and members of Flynn's firm, Flynn Intel Group, late in the evening of Sept. 19 at Essex House hotel in New York City. Woolsey said the discussion generally involved removing cleric Fethullah Gulen from the U.S. without going through the lengthy extradition process, though he said it stopped short of outlining a specific plan to sweep the cleric out of the country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought Gulen's extradition from the U.S. after accusing the cleric of directing a failed coup last summer. The U.S. government has rebuffed that request, and Gulen, who has a green card and lives in Pennsylvania, has denied involvement. Woolsey described the discussion as "brainstorming, but it was brainstorming about a very serious matter that would pretty clearly be a violation of law." Though, Woolsey noted that the discussion "did not rise to the level of being a specific plan to undertake a felonious act." Flynn spokesman Price Floyd told The Associated Press that Flynn Intel Group's work never involved discussing removing Gulen from the United States by any means other than the extradition process. He confirmed that Woolsey attended the meeting but denied that it involved subverting the legal process. "The claim made by Mr. Woolsey that General Flynn or anyone else in attendance discussed physical removal of Mr. Gulen from the United States during a meeting with Turkish officials in New York is false," Floyd said. "No such discussion occurred, nor did Mr. Woolsey ever inform General Flynn that he had any concerns whatsoever regarding the meeting, either before he chose to attend and afterward." The meeting was part of lobbying work Flynn's firm was conducting on behalf of a company, Inovo BV, which is owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. Earlier this month, Flynn and his firm registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents for the work for Alptekin, saying that it could have benefited the Turkish government. Flynn's firm was paid $530,000 over the course of the contract, which ran from August through November while Flynn was a top Trump campaign adviser. Alptekin has told the AP that Flynn's firm registered as a foreign agent under pressure from the Justice Department. 1|2|Next Page>> PREVIOUS ARTICLE Snipers target jihadists using human shields NEXT ARTICLE Ellison says Democrats must fight Republicans at all levels Facebook Twitter Google+ Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 Titanic' actor Bill Paxton has died: family representatives 2 Philippines protests 'Madam Secretary' portrayal of leader 3 Accountants in Oscar mistake off the show 4 New highs for US stocks; Dow win streak longest since 1987 5 Historic drama 'Underground' reflects on state of the union 6 Russia gives new 'Beauty and the Beast' film a 16+ rating 7 Japan and Russia hold talks on security, territorial dispute 8 Iconic rock arch from 'Game of Thrones' falls into Malta sea 9 US to sell 'more and better' weapons to Taiwan: report 10 U.S. reaffirms its one-China policy ahead of Tillerson's China visit Subscribe  |   Advertise  |   RSS Feed  |   About Us  |   Career  |   Contact Us Sitemap  |   Top Stories  |   Taiwan  |   China  |   Business  |   Asia  |   World  |   Sports  |   Life  |   Arts & Leisure  |   Health  |   Editorial  |   Commentary Travel  |   Movies  |   TV Listings  |   Classifieds  |   Bookstore  |   Getting Around  |   Weather  |   Guide Post  |   Student Post  |   Terms of Use  |   Sitemap   Copyright © 1999 – 2017 The China Post.

Two pints a day keep heart problems at bay More like this Ubuntu Software Ubuntu 17.04 inches closer to production Zapus jumping in April 26 Mar 2017 at 23:59, Richard Chirgwin Ubuntu's final beta for version 17.04 has landed. Zesty Zapus covers Ubuntu desktop, server and cloud editions, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Gnome, MATE, Studio and Xubuntu flavours. It's not a huge feature boost, but the release is using the Linux 4.10 kernel, useful if your iron runs Intel Kaby Lake or AMD Ryzen silicon. If configuring the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) is on your hate-list, there's good news: the release includes support for driverless printing. Either Apple AirPrint or IPP Everywhere printers can be installed without printer-specific drivers – and if it Works As Expected® discovery should happen automatically when the printer is connected to the USB or the LAN. HP printer/scanner users are warned not to run it in driverless mode, because it won't scan. Such devices can, however, be installed using the HPLIP driver. Other changes in the desktop version include LibreOffice, updated to version 5.3; most GNOME apps updated to version 3.24; and a Week view on the calendar. For sysadmins, the Ubuntu Server now uses qemu 2.8, the libvirt virtualisation library is version 2.5, and for white-box networking nerds, there's version 16.11.1 of the data plane development kit. The team is confident that there aren't any “showstopper CD build or installer bugs”, so they don't expect much to change between now and official release date on April 13. ® Tips and corrections 21 Comments More from The Register Wintel part deux?

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Finds Life After Smartphones Kyle Woodley U.S.News & World ReportMarch 27, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share What is BlackBerry Ltd (ticker: BBRY)? This was an easy question around the turn of the decade when BlackBerry was a leader in smartphone operating system market share. This was an easy question even when the Apple ( AAPL) iPhone started to eat that share, but BlackBerry still stood out as the businessman's smartphone. Heck, this was even easy to answer for the past few years as BBRY clearly was a falling star, seeming destined to evaporate from the smartphone market altogether. And that happened. BlackBerry has virtually disappeared from the smartphone arena, with market share low enough to be considered "zero percent," but BlackBerry itself hasn't disappeared, and BBRY stock hasn't plunged to zero. Instead, the Canadian tech company is taking investors on a nauseating ride of corporate rediscovery. That journey reaches its next crossroads on Friday before the bell, when it reports its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. [See: 7 ETFs That Allow You to Invest in Space.] The headline numbers: Wall Street is expecting very little from BlackBerry, at least on the top line. Revenues are expected to plunge 37.8 percent year-over-year to $288.45 million. From a profit perspective, analysts see BlackBerry posting a breakeven quarter -- though that would be up from a 3-cent-per-share loss in the fourth quarter a year ago. To get an idea of just how far BBRY has fallen from grace, consider that five years ago -- for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2012 -- BlackBerry, then called Research in Motion, reported adjusted earnings of 80 cents per share on revenues of $4.2 billion. (And that itself was a 19 percent drop in sales.) The many faces of BBRY. This quarter's estimates illustrate one of many shifts in BlackBerry's identity and how the business is run. BlackBerry has stopped producing phones, and instead licenses out its brand to companies like China's TCL Corp. As a result, it only records revenues from the licensing agreement, which aren't as robust as the unit sales it used to post. On the flip side, because BlackBerry isn't physically building the phones, its costs are lower, so it squeezes out more income from every dollar of revenue. This isn't a short-term problem for BlackBerry, either. Not only does Wall Street predict a 37 percent drop in revenues, but analysts also think the fiscal year ahead will see another 28 percent drop in sales. Revenue growth of any kind could be absent until 2019. There are areas of promise, but not much concrete. For instance, BlackBerry is using its QNX operating system to infiltrate the car of tomorrow, powering systems in Audi, General Motors Co. ( GM) and Ford Motor Co. ( F) vehicles. As of the most recent data, QNX was in nearly 60 million vehicles worldwide. However, infotainment systems are a low-revenue market, capping the potential there. While BlackBerry is also aggressively pushing QNX into the self-driving car market, it also faces well-heeled competition there, including Intel Corp. ( INTC), which recently bought Mobileye ( MBLY) and is partnered with BMW on autonomous vehicle development. [See: 8 Tips for Investing in Your 30s.] BlackBerry also offers security solutions, but cybersecurity is another competitive and fragmented market. IBM CFO Martin Schroeter said last year, "On average today, organizations use 80 security products from 40 different vendors." You also need only look at Fortinet ( FTNT) and Palo Alto Networks ( PANW) over the past couple of years to see the inherent difficulties the industry is facing. The bright side. For all the negativity, there are a few glimmers of hope. For one, CEO and turnaround maestro John Chen raised the company's profit outlook for the current fiscal year after third-quarter earnings, expecting to achieve non-GAAP profitability. Most notably, "This is the third consecutive quarter we have increased our EPS outlook, reflecting the traction we are achieving in our shift to a software business model." And if BlackBerry can survive the hemorrhaging in revenues and put a cap on its cash burn, it suddenly finds itself in a much more navigable situation. Macquarie's Gus Papageorgiou laid out a picture of the promised land in a September 2016 note: "By 2019 BlackBerry will have effectively shed any legacy of its previous business model. Any revenue from hardware will be from licensing deals which we expect to be small but highly profitable, and the service revenue stream will likely be completely exhausted. What will likely remain is a high margin software business that should generate good profits." It's just a matter of waiting. But the longer BlackBerry persists, expect investors to be more and more aggressive about driving shares higher after quarterly beats. More earnings in focus Carnival Corp. (CCL). Cruise line operators have been an unsung winner following the 2016 presidential elections, though CCL is the laggard of the bunch, up 22 percent compared to 31 percent for Royal Caribbean Cruises ( RCL) and 36 percent for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings ( NCLH). Analysts are getting increasingly bullish on the company as it nears its Tuesday report, including three earnings revisions higher in the past month. Considering estimates are still lukewarm at 3.5 percent sales growth to $3.78 billion, and a 10 percent dip in earnings to 35 cents per share, it's possible CCL could have a significant beat on deck. Lululemon Athletica (LULU). Lululemon shares have spent most of 2017 cooling off since their December 2016 post-earnings pop, sparked by a 32 percent year-over-year improvement in profits. This time around the earnings carousel, Wall Street will be expecting 19 percent profit growth to $1.01 per share on an 11.3 percent spike in the top line to $783.7 million.

Should you consider it? Let's see.

The AMD X370 chipset provides a decent amount of IO expansion over the basics provided by the CPU. Most notably, the X370 chipset offers two USB 3.1 ports, which is a first for a platform chipset. The CPU will provide extra USB and storage, and the chipset compliments it. The X370 chipset is also one of only two that provides multi-GPU capabilities such as SLI or CrossFireX for your Ryzen CPU.     GIGABYTE's subsidiary, Aorus, is positioned to readily target the high-end gaming segment with premium features and aesthetics. Aorus's first motherboards appeared for the Intel Z270 chipset launch, and they addressed many of GIGABYTE's shortcomings in areas such as the UEFI, fan control, and overall aesthetics. I will add that if you love RGB LEDs, then this motherboard is for you, it is loaded to the brim with RGB LEDs and headers. Don't worry you can disable them if you don't want them. Without further delay, let's take a look at the AX370-Gaming 5.     Specifications     The AX370-Gaming 5 features dual NICs, M.2 and U.2, eight SATA6Gb/s ports, support for SLI/CrossFireX, and offers an interesting high-end audio setup I will cover later in the review.     Pricing   The AX370-Gaming 5 costs around $194.99.

Nunes admitted Monday that he was on White House grounds the day before announcing he had seen intelligence suggesting incidental surveillance of members of President Trump’s transition team. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement Monday that Nunes’s actions had “tarnished” his committee chairmanship. ADVERTISEMENT “Speaker [Paul] Ryan [R-Wis.] must insist that Chairman Nunes at least recuse himself from the Trump-Russia investigation immediately,” she said. "That leadership is long overdue.” Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Nunes has damaged the panel’s ability to fairly conduct a probe of Russia’s election meddling last year. “Chairman Nunes should no longer be anywhere near this investigation, let alone leading it,” he said in a statement. “For the sake of our duty to independently find the truth, and for the sake of his ability to chair the committee in its other important duties, he should recuse himself from our committee’s Russia investigation.” Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) went a step further Monday, suggesting Nunes should immediately relinquish his committee chairmanship. “If Chairman Nunes understood the Constitution and our separation of powers, he would resign his Intel Chairmanship immediately,” he tweeted alongside the hashtag #RussiaGate. Nunes said Monday he would not recuse himself from his committee’s probe of Russia’s intrusions in the 2016 presidential race despite a growing number of Democratic lawmakers calling on him to do just that.  “Everything is politics here,” he said when asked about calls for his recusal from the investigation, according to a Voice of America journalist. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSpicer: If Trump uses Russian salad dressing 'somehow that’s a Russian connection' Schiff: Yates would have testified on Flynn at cancelled hearing Nunes rebuffs calls for recusal MORE (Calif.), called for Nunes to recuse himself. Earlier in the day, Senate Minority Leader Charles SchumerCharles SchumerMcConnell: ObamaCare 'status quo' will stay in place moving forward NRA launches M Supreme Court ad Senate about to enter 'nuclear option' death spiral MORE (D-N.Y.) said Speaker Paul RyanPaul RyanMcConnell: ObamaCare 'status quo' will stay in place moving forward The Hill's 12:30 Report House GOP insists: We’re not giving up on ObamaCare repeal MORE (R-Wis.) should replace Nunes in order for the Russia probe to be “credible.” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), who also sits on the House Intelligence Committee, reiterated the call for Nunes to recuse himself Monday afternoon. Nunes confirmed he was on White House grounds last week to “confirm what I already knew” about members of Trump’s transition team getting caught up in surveillance operations. The California lawmaker briefed Trump on his findings the following day, stunning fellow committee members who were unaware of what he found or that he would speak with the president. Democrats have since questioned whether Nunes can remain independent while his committee probes Russia’s potential interference in the 2016 contest before Election Day.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-California) announced that the intelligence community “incidentally” intercepted information on President Donald Trump’s transition team. Nunes is leading the House panel’s investigation into whether there was Russian interference in the 2016 election, and by extension, any possible collusion with the Trump team during that time. On Monday, Nunes told CNN that he had gone to the White House grounds to meet with an unnamed source and review reports. However, Nunes says he was not in the White House itself. House intel chair admits he doesn’t know ‘for sure’ if Trump team was surveilled https://t.co/dfpVEyGRin— RT America (@RT_America) March 24, 2017 Jack Langer, a spokesman for Nunes, says he went onto the grounds because he needed a secure location where he could access the reports, which are only distributed within the executive branch. "Chairman Nunes met with his source at the White House grounds in order to have proximity to a secure location where he could view the information provided by the source," Langer said Monday, according to the Associated Press.  Nunes told Bloomberg on Monday that he went to the White House because he didn’t “have networked access to these kinds of reports in Congress.” Upon finding the documents, Nunes said he copied their identifying numbers so he could formally request them for the rest of his committee to view. Nunes says other members of his committee would be able to read the documents as soon as this week. He has not named his source and did not indicate that it was from the White House itself. READ MORE: House Intel chair orders Russia-Trump election hearings closed to public “We don’t talk about sources at this committee. We want more people to come forward,” Nunes said, according to the Wall Street Journal.  At a press briefing Monday, reporters asked White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer if Nunes’ source could have come from the White House itself. Spicer said he did not know anything about the meeting beyond what Nunes has said publically. “I'm not going to get into who he met with or why he met with them. I think that's something that he had made very clear, and I'll let him answer it,” Spicer said. Democrats have criticized Nunes, who served on Trump's transition team's executive committee, for his connection to the White House during the investigation. On Monday, several Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, called for Nunes to step down as the head of the House Intelligence Committee.  .@SenSchumer: "If @SpeakerRyan wants the House to have a credible investigation he needs to replace Chairman Nunes." pic.twitter.com/UL4ihema83— CSPAN (@cspan) March 27, 2017 "Chairman Nunes is falling down on the job and seems to be more interested in protecting the president than in seeking the truth. You cannot have the person in charge of an impartial investigation be partial to one side. It's an inherent contradiction," Schumer said, according to The Hill. Schumer called for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) to replace Nunes on the committee in order to have “a credible investigation.” Congressman Adam Schiff (D-California), a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, also released a statement Monday calling for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation. “I believe that the Chairman should recuse himself from any further involvement in the Russia investigation, as well as any involvement in oversight of matters pertaining to any incidental collection of the Trump transition, as he was also a key member of the transition team," Schiff said. "This is not a recommendation I make lightly, as the Chairman and I have worked together well for several years," he continued.

Sen. Bill NelsonBill NelsonSenators offer tax bill aimed at helping small businesses Path to 60 narrows for Trump pick The Hill’s Whip List: Where Dems stand on Trump’s Supreme Court nominee MORE (D-Fla.) on Monday announced he would vote against ending debate on Gorsuch’s nomination. Nelson, one of several Democrats to announce their opposition on Monday, was a significant blow to Gorsuch because he represents a state won by President Trump and faces reelection in 2018. He’s also one of three Democrats remaining in the Senate who voted to end debate on Justice Samuel Alito’s nomination in 2006. ADVERTISEMENT “I will vote no on the motion to invoke cloture and, if that succeeds, I will vote no on his confirmation,” Nelson said Monday. Gorsuch’s prospects for ending a filibuster got a boost later on Monday when Sen. Joe ManchinJoe ManchinCentrist Democrat calls for up-or-down vote for Gorsuch GOP senator on going nuclear: 'I really hope that it doesn't come to that' No. 2 Senate Democrat opposes Trump's Supreme Court pick MORE (D-W.Va.) told a reporter for NBC that he would vote to end debate on the nomination. Manchin said he had not yet decided whether he will back Gorsuch’s nomination. Still, Nelson’s decision suggests Democrats are seeing better political prospects in opposing Trump and Gorsuch than in backing him and risking the ire of the left. In a similar sign, Sen. Patrick LeahyPatrick LeahyGOP senator on going nuclear: 'I really hope that it doesn't come to that' Path to 60 narrows for Trump pick Overnight Regulation: Trump repeals 'blacklisting' rule MORE (D-Vt.), a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, appeared to walk back comments that hinted he might oppose a filibuster against Gorsuch. After telling a Vermont news outlet that he was “not inclined to filibuster,” Leahy tweeted that Gorsuch would be filibustered unless he “provides REAL answers to written Qs & senators have ample time for review & debate.” Democrats are under enormous pressure from liberal groups to oppose Gorsuch after Republicans last year blocked Merrick Garland, President Obama’s nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Republicans need to find eight Democrats to vote to end debate to break a filibuster against Gorsuch. Doing so would prevent them from having to use the nuclear option — voting to change the Senate’s rules to prohibit a filibuster against the Supreme Court nominee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellMitch McConnellMcConnell: ObamaCare 'status quo' will stay in place moving forward Senate about to enter 'nuclear option' death spiral GOP senator on going nuclear: 'I really hope that it doesn't come to that' MORE (R-Ky.) has signaled his willingness to take this step if Democrats block Gorsuch, who emerged relatively unscathed from last week’s confirmation hearings and is seen by Republicans as well-qualified for the court. A path remains for the GOP to get to 60. All 52 Republican senators will back ending debate on Gorsuch. And a number of Democrats have not said how they will vote. They include senators who are up for reelections in states won by Trump. And while Trump’s victory over Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonEllison pens Jezebel op-ed honoring role of women in labor fight Baldwin on Trump: 'I just didn’t want to play him' Sanders to headline progressive 'People's Summit' MORE in Florida was close, he dominated the Democrat in North Dakota, Indiana, Montana and Missouri as well as West Virginia.

Path to 60 narrows for Trump pick MORE (Mont.) and Joe DonnellyJoe DonnellyNRA launches M Supreme Court ad With GOP’s healthcare bill on ice, Dems go on offense Path to 60 narrows for Trump pick MORE (Ind.). Four of the five have kept a tight lip on whether they’ll back Gorsuch. The two other Democrats who backed Alito are Sen.

Cantwell’s spokesman told the Seattle Times that she’s undecided and will meet with Gorsuch this week. Republicans pounced on Nelson’s decision, pledging that the Supreme Court will be fodder for the 2018 Senate battle.  “Senator Bill Nelson proved to Floridians today that he no longer shares their values and instead is more politically aligned with the liberal elite of Washington,” said Katie Martin, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. But Nelson is not the only Democrat up for reelection in 2018 who opposes  Gorsuch.  Sens. Sherrod BrownSherrod BrownPath to 60 narrows for Trump pick Overnight Finance: Trump stock slump | GOP looks to tax bill for lifeline | Trump repeals 'blacklisting rule' | Dem wants ethics probe into Treasury secretary Dems question potential Kushner real estate deal with Chinese firm MORE (Ohio), Bob CaseyBob CaseyPath to 60 narrows for Trump pick Senators call for pay equity for US women's hockey team Under pressure, Dems hold back Gorsuch support MORE Jr. (Pa.) and Tammy BaldwinTammy BaldwinPath to 60 narrows for Trump pick Overnight Finance: Senators spar over Wall Street at SEC pick's hearing | New CBO score for ObamaCare bill | Agency signs off on Trump DC hotel lease The Hill’s Whip List: Where Dems stand on Trump’s Supreme Court nominee MORE (Wis.) have also all come out against Trump’s nominee, a signal they believe they are better off siding with their party’s base. Another Democratic vote to watch is Sen. Michael BennetMichael BennetPath to 60 narrows for Trump pick Trump’s budget jeopardizes America’s public lands heritage Under pressure, Dems hold back Gorsuch support MORE, who represents Gorsuch’s home state of Colorado. He’s facing sustained pressure to back Gorsuch, whom he helped introduce at the committee last week. If Republicans flip Bennet and the five most vulnerable red-state 2018 Senate Democrats, they’d just need two more to confirm Gorsuch.   Other targets include Leahy and Sens. Jeanne Shaheen Jeanne ShaheenPath to 60 narrows for Trump pick Overnight Finance: Trump stock slump | GOP looks to tax bill for lifeline | Trump repeals 'blacklisting rule' | Dem wants ethics probe into Treasury secretary Overnight Finance: Senators spar over Wall Street at SEC pick's hearing | New CBO score for ObamaCare bill | Agency signs off on Trump DC hotel lease MORE (D-N.H.) and Angus KingAngus KingPath to 60 narrows for Trump pick Week ahead: House Intel chair under fire over Trump surveillance claims Under pressure, Dems hold back Gorsuch support MORE (I-Maine).   King, who is up for reelection, hasn’t announced a decision on Gorsuch’s nomination and immediately distanced himself from a filibuster. Shaheen isn’t up for reelection but is from a politically purple state. A spokeswoman told The Hill on Monday that she is undecided and is “currently reviewing hearing transcripts.” Gorsuch’s nomination is expected to come to the Senate floor next week, after Democrats on the Judiciary Committee delayed an initial vote on his nomination until Monday. Under the committee’s rules, any one senator can request that a nomination be held over the first time it appears on the agenda. Republicans want to clear Gorsuch’s nomination before they leave for two weeks and have warned they could delay the Easter recess to confirm him.  And McConnell again threatened to go nuclear on Monday. “This much is clear: If our Democratic colleagues choose to hold up this nominee, then they’re acknowledging that they’ll go to any length to block any Supreme Court nominee of a Republican president,” he said.

US Treasuries gained, sending yields on the 10-year note six basis points lower to 2.35 percent. Gold, another safe-haven asset, also advanced. “It is less of a panic sell and more of digesting the information and looking beyond the healthcare reform act to the next bit of information, which is going to be tax reform and spending on infrastructure,” Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at the Private Client Group at US Bank, told Reuters. In 1.50pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.3 percent. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.1 percent. In 1.36pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent. “With the economy continuing to improve, I would look at any pullback as a buying opportunity at this point in time,” Watkins noted. The Dow fell as declines in shares of Chevron and those of Verizon Communications, down 1.6 percent and 1.3 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of DuPont and those of Intel, up 1.4 percent and 0.7 percent respectively. Some analysts say the Trump administration’s failure on the health-care bill suggests they face an even tougher road ahead for tax reform. “The consensus on [the tax reform] is probably likely to be much more difficult to achieve than on health care, which suggests that a lot of the optimism about the reflation and fiscal stimulus trade may well have to be reassessed as well,” Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, wrote in a note, Bloomberg reported. Shares of DuPont posted the largest percentage gain in the Dow in afternoon trading, while Dow Chemical shares rose after the companies received the green light for their mega merger from the European Commission by agreeing to sell assets, notably major parts of DuPont’s global pesticide business. The approval is conditional in particular on the divestiture of major parts of DuPont’s global pesticide business, including its global R&D organisation, the Commission said in a statement. “Pesticides are products that matter—to farmers, consumers and the environment,” European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in the statement. “We need effective competition in this sector so companies are pushed to develop products that are ever safer for people and better for the environment.” Dow shares traded 1.3 percent higher as 1.39pm in New York. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.4 percent decline from the previous close. France’s CAC 40 Index slipped less than 0.1 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index slid 0.6 percent, as did Germany’s DAX Index.

By Hannah Smothers Mar 27, 2017 Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below In the traditional, American order of things, this is how a marriage happens: You meet someone, you date, you get engaged, you get married. But of course this isn't how it works for everyone. According to a 2009 statistic from ABC News, about 60 percent of all marriages worldwide are arranged — or the couple is set up by family to marry each other and often don't meet long before their wedding day. A recent Ask Reddit thread posed the question to people who are actually in arranged marriages themselves: What's it really like to be married to someone you didn't know for years, or even months, before committing for life? 1. "I'm so grateful to my father for finding this man for me." "I'm American born, but balanced that line between Indian and American. For American boys, I was too Indian. For Indian boys, I was too American. Never officially dated and studied a lot. Went through countless meetings with boys from Indian matrimonial sites and never clicked with anyone. As I reached my 30s, the pressure started to mount. "I had pretty much given up on finding someone. My father sent me a random profile and said he wanted me to look at it. I was not at all interested. I pretended to be my dad and sent an email to his dad. His dad (who ended up being him) responded to my dad (me) that we should talk. "I [sent] an email to the guy and [waited] to hear back. A month goes by and I get an email on the first of the new year, in 2010. It's him. He wanted to start the year off with me. We talk on email for a bit. Then, the phone. Visited in February. Married in March. We have a 6-year-old son, and he and my husband are my world. So, quasi arranged. I'm so grateful to my father for finding this man for me." —extremely_apathetic Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 2. "Whatever I feel for him is what love is to me." "Met my husband on the 9th, agreed to marry him on the 15th, and were wed on the 20th. Literally said about two words to each other, and that was with five members of his family present. Been together 13 plus years. It had its ups and downs, like I imagine any marriage would — arranged or not. We are very good together. He tries to makes me happy in any way he can.

I haven't had any experience with any other relationships so whatever I feel for him is what love is to me!" —Kittiesandunicorns 3. "Nothing is 100 percent perfect, we argue from time to time like any other couple." "[I] first met my wife-to-be in Chandigarh, India. My grandfather and her father were both in the army and had been posted there, so our respective families had a get-together. This was right after I had graduated college, [and] she was still in high school. I don't remember much, we both said 'hi' to each other but that's about it. Around this time our families started the 'process,' for lack of a better term. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below "I moved to the United States [for graduate school], and upon graduation I accepted a job at Intel. I [visited] India often. My wife-to-be was [in college] at Delhi University. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below "I moved to a better-paying [job]. At this time, [our families] broached the idea of us getting married. I barely [remembered] my wife-to-be, having only met her that one time several years ago. We met in India and started 'dating.' After a year, we got married. We knew each other relatively well at this point. Soon afterward, she joined me in the States. I [worked] for the next few years until we had our first child. "We've been married for close to 20 years. Both of us are very happy in our marriage. Obviously nothing is 100 percent perfect, we argue from time to time like any other couple. But she's been a supportive, wonderful companion for all of those years and I like to think I've been the same." —city-of-stars 4. " She brings joy and fun to my life to the extent that I get depressed if I don't see her face in the morning." "I am 27 my wife is 26. We are both doctors and we had an arranged marriage. "I may be biased but I think, at least for me, this has worked out better. I had many social issues and a really low self-worth. I got matched to a really lively girl. I panicked when it started and I nearly ended the engagement because I thought we were so different, how could this ever work? What I was not expecting was how much I would fall in love with her. "She awakened my sleeping lively side. She brings joy and fun to my life to the extent that I get depressed if I don't see her face in the morning. I love her totally. If I had been left to my own devices, I would never have thought myself good enough for her. Now our life is looking up — I just got a residency and I tend to think that is due to the luck brought to me by her." —Drdontlittle 5. "I am happy with the man I married but I am not happy with the way it happened." "My marriage was sorta against my wishes. I just wanted to finish college first. In my community, girls get married between 18-21 and guys between 24-30. I was already 22 and my parents were freaking out. I agreed to engagement but not the wedding until I [finished my] fifth year of dental college (I was in second year). Advertisement - Continue Reading Below "I [came] home for Christmas vacation and my parents [didn't] let me go back. I threatened to tell my now-husband and his family that I was being forced to marry. I never went back to college. I texted with SO for few months. The first time I saw him was at the engagement. Technically it was nikah, which meant we were married legally and religiously, but is treated as engagement. The wedding reception happened a year later after which we lived as husband and wife. "I am happy with the man I married but I am not happy with the way it happened. We are 1.5 years into our marriage now. At first everything was silently a compromise for me, but now I love him and can't imagine being married to anyone else." —NinjaPyjama Follow Hannah on Twitter.

But enrollment in UIC's computer science department has grown twice as fast as in Urbana-Champaign over the past five years. The latter is twice as big at 1,686 students. But there's no denying the boom at UIC. "We're bursting at the seams," says UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis. "We're fighting over closet space." U of I's board of trustees just gave final approval to build a $34 million building on Taylor Street for 50,000 square feet of ​ new labs and office space for the College of Engineering. It's the first new academic building on the main campus since 1991. The university has even bigger plans for computer science, which became the largest major in the College of Engineering this year and is the fastest-growing program on campus. Peter Nelson, the college's dean, wants to build a 168,000-square-foot home for computer science by 2021. Preliminary drawings are done, and he is working donors and alumni to raise $15 million for a building with an expected $68 million price tag. If he can get the new buildings, Nelson says UIC's engineering enrollment could grow to 6,500 from about 4,500 today. In 2005, the program had just 2,600; the first class of engineering graduates from UIC in 1968 totaled 75. "The demand is there," Nelson says. It's remarkable that UIC is talking about building anything, given the financial condition of the state, which has $13 billion in overdue bills and hasn't passed a complete budget in nearly two years. But the irresistible force that is demand for computer science talent is greater than the immovable object that is political gridlock. Nationally, undergraduate computer science enrollment more than tripled between 2006 and 2015, estimates the Computer Research Association. UIC's enrollment nearly quadrupled, rising by 292 percent, compared with a 20 percent gain in the school's overall student population. University of Chicago's computer science enrollment grew 643 percent, and Northwestern University grew 453 percent, though they have far fewer students than UIC. "We're at the right place at the right time," Amiridis says. The tech industry is exploding in Chicago as it is in other cities. And UIC is just across Interstate 290 from a fast-growing neighborhood that's home to Google and dozens of tech companies. Although Willis Tower looms over UIC's home on the West Side, the school is overshadowed by the flagship U of I campus in Urbana-Champaign, as well as Northwestern and U of C. "Whenever you say 'engineering,' everyone thinks Champaign," says Nancy Sullivan, CEO of Illinois Ventures, the U of I venture fund, who previously worked at Northwestern. "They do some great stuff at UIC. But they don't have the history and the legacy (of the flagship)." U of I in Urbana-Champaign is fifth-best among the computer science programs ranked by U.S. News & World Report. Northwestern and U of C tied for 34th on the U.S. News list; UIC is tied with University of Notre Dame at 60th. Nelson has to hustle for students. In 2013, the school launched a guaranteed paid internship program for incoming freshmen. Two-thirds of the internships are on-campus, but corporate employers include Google, Here, Nokia, ComEd, Amazon, Argonne, Microsoft, BMW, ITW, Intel, HP, PayPal and Zebra. "It's a big selling point," he says. Rohit Pasam, a UIC alum with a master's in bioengineering, has frequently tapped his alma mater for talent as he builds a security-software startup. "We have two top engineers from UIC on our team," says Pasam, co-founder and CEO of Xaptum. "We got amazing interns from UIC, who now work for top companies. They were hidden gems." Cybersecurity, as well as data mining and data visualization, are among UIC's strengths, along with its location. Philip Yu, who joined UIC in 2008 from IBM's Watson Research Lab, is a top expert in data mining. "Because of our location, we're able to hire better people than you'd expect, based on our ranking," Nelson says. "Our kids also want to study in an urban environment." Like most university administrators, he has a love-hate relationship with rankings but recognizes the reality that they matter to students, faculty and alumni. Nelson wants to one day become a Top 25 program, which is way beyond a stretch goal, given the glacial pace at which rankings change. The 54-year-old doesn't lack for ambition. A specialist in artificial intelligence who did his graduate work at Northwestern, Nelson joined UIC in 1988 and became head of computer science in 2001. He was named dean of engineering a decade ago. "He is a top-drawer guy," says Dennis Roberson, a computer science professor and former vice provost at Illinois Tech, which ranks 101st on the U.S. News list. "He also is absolutely driven to win." Nelson is quick to point out that UIC has an older, more diverse and less affluent student body than many of its peers. You won't find it near the top of anyone's list of party schools. (The Urbana-Champaign campus ranks No. 3; it was No. 1 in 2015.) Fifty-six percent of students are eligible for Pell grants, or need-based federal scholarships. At the Urbana campus, it's 22 percent. As tuition rates soar, that puts more pressure on students, but it also makes UIC more appealing. Transfers to UIC have doubled since 2009. "Our job is to provide students access to excellence," he says. "To maintain that access, we have to grow."... To see the full article, subscribe or log in.

Military Military: The Intel A loss in Afghanistan: But did Sangin 'fall' or was it strategic retreat? Afghan Taliban signal growing strength with capture of key town Taliban fighters capture the strategic district of Sangin in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, after security forces pulled out, leaving the district center to the insurgents. Samantha Vadas reports. Taliban fighters capture the strategic district of Sangin in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, after security forces pulled out, leaving the district center to the insurgents. Samantha Vadas reports. Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter The Afghanistan district that cost dozens of San Diego Marines their lives is now in Taliban hands again. But was it “strategic retreat” or a heavy blow to the NATO effort there? The opium-rich Sangin region of southern Afghanistan was overrun by Taliban troops late last week. The Taliban is celebrating it as a victory in the now 16-year-old war. But NATO and U.S. officials say they had planned for months to move a headquarters post a few miles away after Sangin’s civic center was badly deteriorated after many battles. And, they say, anything of value was destroyed before Afghan soldiers left. U.S. aircraft were used to transfer Afghan personnel to the new location. “There is nothing left in the old district center except dirt and rubble,” U.S. officials said. Some observers are calling that spin. An analysis in The Long War Journal called that description of events “not credible.” The group Terror Monitor said the Taliban released an infographic listing of an inventory of goods it captured as the “spoils of war.” There’s no question that the anti-Taliban campaign known as Operation Resolute Support has seen mixed results. Security in Afghanistan has been deteriorating since U.S. force levels dropped from a high of 100,000 in 2011 to the current size of roughly 9,000, according to the Institute for the Study of War. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day Russia is also attempting to exert its influence. “Russia will continue to establish itself as the dominant broker of peace in Afghanistan in order to gain leverage over the U.S. and NATO,” the same institute concluded in an update on Afghanistan last week. Sangin is hallowed ground for some Camp Pendleton Marine veterans, after they bled to wrest it from the Taliban starting in 2010. Marines from the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment took over there in 2010 as the American surge revved up in that country. Some 50 U.S. Marines were mortally wounded in Sangin in part due to aggressive use of roadside bombs by the Taliban. Half died with Camp Pendleton’s “Darkhorse” 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, the first Marine unit to serve a full seven-month tour in Sangin during the surge. More than 200 of the battalion were seriously injured, in what was thought to be the worst casualty rate to that time for a unit its size during the Afghan war. The British also paid a heavy price in the years just before. As some lamented in the British press recently, Sangin accounted for a third of that nation’s dead in Afghanistan at the time. Others in the West, including academics, expressed dismay and raised the question of whether this war will ever conclude.

Sara Sorcher Christian Science MonitorMarch 27, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Securing elections from hackers. The spread of connected devices. Nation-state attacks. The lack of cybersecurity talent.  These were some of the pressing cybersecurity challenges that keep Passcode’s group of security and privacy experts up at night. Passcode’s Influencers Poll regularly surveys 160 high-profile experts from across government, industry, and the advocacy community. For one last poll before Passcode shuts down, we asked an open-ended question: What’s the most urgent cybersecurity or privacy challenge right now, and what’s one way to fix it? What do you think? VOTE in the public version of the poll.  Several Influencers were concerned about the impending explosive growth in the sheer number of devices connected to the internet. “Whether one calls them embedded systems, or the 'Internet of Things,' the combination of these little computers, poor security design, and upcoming high-speed wireless networks are a perfect storm of sorts that holds the potential to make all of our current cybersecurity concerns worse, more persistent, and of much larger scale,” says Bob Stratton, a serial security entrepreneur, investor, and consultant. In order to combat this, Mr. Stratton says, “we as consumers, investors, and regulators all have to make clear our insistence upon products (of all kinds) that have at least some basic modicum of system integrity and resistance to compromise built in at the time of manufacture. Not every connected light bulb has to have the same security features as a desktop computer, but it is reasonable to expect that ours will only obey commands from the proper controllers and at a bare minimum, that these little devices do not provide a foothold for an attacker trying to gain access to the rest of our home and business networks.” To that end, the No. 1 challenge for Dan Kaminsky, cofounder and chief scientist at White Ops security firm, is making secure development of products “faster, better, and most importantly, cheaper.” “Astonishing things can be built on a solid foundation. They can also be built on quicksand, but they won't last very long,” he says. “We need to escape the false dichotomy between quickly developed crud and monoliths of perfection. It needs to be relatively easy and straightforward to build and operate secure systems. A lot of that is going to involve actually studying what developers want and need, and giving them tools that maintain and retain security as a first class feature.” Dan Geer, chief information security officer for In-Q-Tel, a not-for-profit investment firm that works to invest in technology that supports the missions of the intelligence community, took a big picture approach in his answer: The most urgent issue, he says, is people’s overall dependence on technology. “The more people use something, the more it is depended upon. Because the wellspring of risk is dependence, risk is therefore proportional to adoption. We call that on which we most depend critical infrastructures. Because dependence is transitive, so is risk,” Mr. Geer says. “That you may not yourself depend on something directly does not mean that you do not depend on it indirectly. Interdependence within society is today absolutely centered on the Internet beyond all other dependencies excepting climate, and the Internet has a time constant five orders of magnitude smaller. The complexity of our problem is therefore unacknowledged correlated risk and the unacknowledged correlated risk of cyberspace is why cyberspace is capable of black swan behavior.” To address this, Mr. Geer says there’s no single bullet. “Bring a revolver,” he quips, advocating for “disconnected operation for critical infrastructures, stress testing for entities too connected to fail, public seizure of abandoned codebases, mandatory cyber-event sharing above some threshold of seriousness” and to “geocode the internet, just as cellphones are.” Other experts pointed to broader privacy challenges as consumers put more and more personal information online. Jenny Durkan, global chair of the Cyber Law and Privacy Group at Quinn Emanuel law firm, points to “gross and unnecessary overcollection of personal information” as her major concern – especially because it’s not adequately protected by the companies that collect it, and consumers have “no realistic way” to control how their personal data spreads online. Read More To solve this problem, Ms. Durkan says, “consumers should be given a easy and clear way to opt out of data collection and still utilize new technology, and should have the right to limit, review and remove data collected about them for commercial purposes. Innovators need to build and bake better security into technology from the outset. We must end the ‘innovate, then secure’ mindset.” Several Influencers said the biggest challenges were not necessarily the cyberthreats themselves – but people’s reaction to them. “The most urgent challenge to both cybersecurity and privacy right now is the threat of overreaction that stems from incidents that occur,” says Christian Dawson, executive director and cofounder of the Internet Infrastructure Coalition.  To prevent this, Mr. Dawson adds, “a focus on technical education is essential, to aid legislators and regulators in a sound understanding of tech issues. If they comprehend the tech environment prior to a threat, they will be less likely to over-react legislatively during one.” Similarly, Jeffrey Carr, president and chief executive officer of Taia Global, Inc., worries about “the likelihood that we will go to war over incorrect attribution of a serious cyberattack." “When the leadership of both House and Senate Intelligence Committees misrepresent the facts of electoral databases being hacked, and when national policy decisions are frequently driven by privately provided intelligence data that is often unverified and unreliable, and when the private sector and the media can announce nation state attribution of a cyberattack, right or wrong without fear of blowback, then a window of opportunity exists for a malicious third party to cause two nations to escalate to a kinetic conflict when the presumed attacking state is innocent," Mr. Carr continues. Unfortunately, Carr says there’s “no way to address it because the cyberthreat intelligence industry has no incentive to change and the US government doesn't acknowledge it as a problem."  A few Influencers agreed that before any of these challenges can be tackled, the pipeline of people itself needs securing. "There are a reported one million or more job openings currently in the cybersecurity field, and some industries are just beginning to grow their efforts in this space," says Jeff Massimilla, chief product cybersecurity officer for General Motors. "This gap will likely increase, making it even more difficult for companies to find qualified individuals to fill these roles.” Mr. Massimilla suggests developing more robust university curricula and programs, specialized academic support and focused efforts on job placement after graduation for students interested in the cybersecurity field.  Günter Ollmann, chief security officer at Vectra Networks, also said the shortage of appropriately trained and experienced cybersecurity staff is the biggest challenge, and offered two different ways to solve it. “There are two primary methods for incrementally addressing the shortage of experienced cybersecurity staff. Firstly, the increased deployment of machine learning and AI-based technologies that reduce the technical load on expert staff. And secondly, concerted efforts to encourage more women to join the information security field, coupled with better pay and support mechanisms for women already commencing their cybersecurity careers.”  What do you think? VOTE in the public version of the poll. To view the full list of Influencers, check out the masthead here.  COMMENTS  Mike Papay, Northrop Grumman Challenge: “Cybersecurity of the things in our life we rely on: IoT, critical infrastructure, vehicles, etc.” Solution: “Ensure a market-based economy exists that values the security as well as the capability of the systems we buy.”   Nick Selby, Secure Ideas Challenge: “There is still an almost total lack of training for non-federal prosecutors on cyber crime. This means almost no cybercrime cases are brought outside the federal system.” Solution: “The DOJ and federal government must provide funding for training of District, County, and State's Attorneys on how to bring cybercrime cases. This is the only way to balance the load placed on federal authorities, and the only way to make a dent on logarithmic growth in cyber criminal activity.” John Pescatore, SANS Institute Challenge: “Increasing use of strong authentication – moving away from reusable passwords.” Solution: “Require strong authentication for online tax filing.” Christian Dawson, Internet Infrastructure Coalition Challenge: The most urgent challenge to both cybersecurity and privacy right now is the threat of overreaction that stems from incidents that occur.” Solution: “A focus on technical education is essential, to aid legislators and regulators in a sound understanding of tech issues. If they comprehend the tech environment prior to a threat, they will be less likely to over-react legislatively during one.” Daniel Castro, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation Challenge: “There is a market failure around cybersecurity. Consumers cannot easily compare the security features of two products. This is an information asymmetry problem that government can help fix.” Solution: “Most companies publish a privacy policy, which helps create a transparent and accountable mechanism for regulators to ensure companies are adhering to their stated policies. However, no such system exists for security practices, which has resulted in vague standards, regulation by buzzword, and information asymmetry in markets. By publishing security policies, companies would be motivated to describe the types of security measures they have in place rather than just make claims of "we take security seriously.” This is a concrete step that policymakers can take to improve security practices in the private sector.” Marc Rotenberg, Electronic Privacy Information Center Challenge: “Growing threats to personal privacy and the increase in identity theft, data breach, and financial fraud.” Solution: “The United States needs to establish a Data Protection Agency, like every other democratic government. There is a real risk of a cyber security policy that protects US businesses and US government agencies but leaves the personal data of Americans at risk.” Chris Finan, Manifold Security Challenge: “Vulnerabilities in the nation's operational technology. Many critical infrastructure industrial control systems remain at risk because some operators have not prioritized security. Americans could absolutely die as a result of an attack against one of these vulnerable systems.” Solution: “Congress must enact legislation to ensure the operators of the most critical systems prioritize security. The public will eventually get legislation to that end that protects communities, it's only a question of whether it happens before or after a major incident.” Abigail Slater, Internet Association Challenge: “Keeping our nation's networks, including those of our key institutions, safe from malicious attacks. Trust is a must, and fostering trust online is a team sport. So the challenge will be restoring trust through teamwork.” Solution: “Strong encryption is a tried and tested tool and is needed now more than ever. This is why the Internet Association supports policies that enable strong encryption online.” Mårten Mickos, HackerOne Challenge: “Citizens worrying that cybersecurity issues in society are in much worse shape than what any official spokesperson is ready to publicly acknowledge.” Solution: “More transparency (in public sector and by companies) about cybersecurity threats, incidents and solutions.” Cris Thomas a.k.a. Space Rogue, Tenable Security Challenge: “The popular answer to this question will be 0-day, APT, IOT or international norms in cyberspace or any one of a dozen other trendy topics. But the most urgent cybersecurity challenge right now is the same as it has been for the last twenty years. Know thyself. The first thing an attacker does after they have gain access to a target network is map it out and find where the valuable information lies. In a short amount of time the attacker knows more about a network than the administrators of that network. We need to focus on the basic of network security, now your network and what is on it, that includes mobile, virtual, cloud and containers. Patch critical systems with critical vulnerabilities first. Most attackers don't waste 0-days if they don't have to, no, they search for the 100-day or even the 1000-day vulnerability that someone didn't patch. Make sure that your network is properly setup and configured, that the firewall rules are not set to any/any. Misconfiguration or underutilization of security tools is a continuous problem. Keep a tight control on user credentials, only allow the minimum access an employee needs to perform their job and restrict that access when it is no longer needed, especially when an employee leaves your organization. The failure to follow even the most basic cyber security principles such as these is the most urgent cybersecurity challenge right now.” Solution: “The answer is not user education. Yes, used awareness training does help reduce security incidents but it won't prevent them and blaming a user for accidently clicking on a link is not the answer. Addressing the failure of most organizations to follow even the most basic cyber security principles is a multi-pronged problem. Executives are still not taking cyber security seriously enough and are not devoting enough resources to the teams attempting to correct the problems. In some cases the security teams themselves do not understand the severity of the threat or feel they need the latest blinky light solution to save them when all they really need to do is the boring mundane work of inventorying their networks, patch their systems, check their configurations and keep an eye on their access credentials.” Ely Kahn, Sqrrl Challenge: “I think the most urgent cybersecurity challenge is the need for all organizations to fully understand the cyber risks they face, how those risks affect their mission, and what are the most cost effective ways to mitigate those risks.” Solution: “Adoption of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a great start.” Charles Brooks, Sutherland Global Services Challenge: “Google Evangelist (and a founder of the Internet) Vint Cerf has stated that there is no such thing as privacy on the Internet.I agree, especially in regard to our future.In our evolving digital world, anything and everything is likely to be connected. The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices (Cisco predicts 50 billion devices by 2020) implies that privacy is becoming quite a conundrum. I would posture that IoT is our biggest privacy challenge because inencompasses every vertial, financial, health, commercial,energy, communications, and security.” Solution: “A way to help ensure privacy in IoT is standardize security with manufactures, encrypt, authenticate, firewall, and practice strong cyber hygiene.” Sascha Meinrath, X-Lab  Challenge: “Educating key decision-makers about technological realities.” Solution: “For the past ten years, I've been a vocal advocate of the need for technological expertise to be in the room and at the table whenever legislative and legal deliberations are taking place. In much the same way that we understand the need for lawyers to be involved in key decision-making, it is as important that technological savvy be equally represented in these processes.” Tom Cross, Drawbridge Networks Challenge: “The most urgent cybersecurity challenge right now is the need for more skilled security professional. Every organization that I work with is struggling to find and retain skilled people, and this challenge is slowing down their efforts to protect themselves." Solution: “One way to address the skills shortage is to think about how to do more with less, both in terms of helping CISOs properly prioritize the tasks that they have, and developing security tools that have lower administrative overhead and amplify the efforts small numbers of people.” Joel de la Garza, Box Challenge: “User education and awareness.” Solution: “Nationwide awareness campaigns. Similar to public safety campaigns around seat belt use or littering.” Scott Montgomery, Intel Security Challenge: “Trained labor is in the midst of a nasty math problem. The number of devices, the amount of data, the vectors of delivery, the variety of threats increase at a dramatic pace. The number of trained practitioners remains relatively static, as do budgets. There are still (I checked) only 24 hours in the day. Something has to give, and it's results. Time between breach and detection is higher than four years ago even with 'better' technology and more experience.”  Solution: “The overall amount of labor to achieve a solid security and privacy posture MUST be reduced. Industry needs to make more reliable, easier to use products that integrate well with competitors and other ecosystem vendors. Practitioners need to embrace automation and information sharing. Regulatory bodies should be agreeing on a smaller number of more useful standards. Organizations must begin data valuation efforts in order to stop treating all data equally and apply their meager resources where it matters most.” Nicole Eagan, Darktrace Challenge: “Cybersecurity has become an arms race – we have entered a new era of rapidly-evolving threats characterized by speed, sophistication, and automation. It’s no longer just about compromised websites or stolen data. Today’s threats are far more insidious, aiming to garner media attention and undermine the very integrity of our data, and the institutions who host it. Early glimpses of these ‘trust attacks’ have been seen from DNC to Yahoo. We’re even starting to see the beginnings of a new generation of cyber warfare, where attackers use machine intelligence to subtly infiltrate organizations and learn how to blend in. Legacy defenses rely too heavily on perimeter protection and rules and signatures. Yet, these approaches are no longer sufficient to combat evolving attacks, as companies struggle to stay abreast of the ‘unknown unknown’ threats and the ever present risk of insider threat. Quite simply, companies have a huge visibility problem – they cannot see what is happening beneath the surfaces of their own networks. Complete network visibility while securing networks from the inside out will be of paramount importance in the battle against advanced threat-actors.” Solution: “Self-learning technologies using genuine machine learning will be critical to solving this problem. New ‘immune system’ technologies are capable of learning a ‘pattern of life’ for every user and device to establish a comprehensive understanding of the network as a whole. From this baseline, it can detect emerging anomalies in real-time, and even take precise action to automatically respond and neutralize the threat. It’s a brave new world, and companies need to arm themselves with a self-defending network to stay one step ahead of even the stealthiest threat-actors.” Stewart Baker, Steptoe & Johnson Challenge: “Nation-state hacking of banks.” Solution: “Aggressive international sanctions on countries and groups identified as having hacked banks.” Steve Weber, School of Information, University of California - Berkeley  Challenge: “In one word: complacency. The internet has become a very dangerous place for businesses, governments, and people -- but most of us aren't scared enough to do much different.”  Solution: “First, ban the word 'hacker' from the cybersecurity lexicon. Don't let criminals, spies, liars, and terrorists cover themselves with a label that makes them sound creative, innovative, and clever.”  Terrell McSweeny, Federal Trade Commission  Challenge: “As an FTC Commissioner, my focus is on consumer data privacy and security. At the moment, the most urgent privacy challenge facing consumers is Congressional action to eliminate broadband privacy -- a huge setback for consumer control over their sensitive data. Maintaining the FCC's current rules would make ISP practices more consistent with consumers' expectations of confidentiality. The majority's haste to lay waste to privacy protections doesn't bode well for the development of a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to consumer privacy. It also likely means we won't see comprehensive data security legislation to address one of the most urgent cybersecurity challenges: the billions of insecure IoT devices that are rapidly becoming integral parts of our daily lives.”  Matthew Eggers, US Chamber of Commerce  Challenge: “An urgent challenge is crafting a new US cybersecurity strategy that features business input.” Solution: "America’s approach to cyber is at an inflection point. Industry is typically the first to take a cyber punch on the chin, and public policy should be adjusted accordingly. Policymakers need to engage the business community before, during, and after the strategy is written. We need to highlight international norms and deterrence. Our national deterrence deficit lies in our struggle to stymie attacks by criminal groups and foreign powers that fall into the malicious middle of the attack spectrum. This middling sweep of aggressions is bookended on the one hand by relatively minor attacks that companies are capable of blunting on their own and acts of war on the other, which could require government involvement.” David Brumley, CyLab Challenge: “Internet of Things device security.” Solution: “Automating security checks. We need to move beyond manual approaches.”   Adam Segal, Council on Foreign Relations Challenge: “Lack of meaningful deterrence.” Jonathan Zittrain, Harvard Challenge: “It's profoundly difficult to figure out who owns cybersecurity -- who should be responsible for ensuring it systemically. It's tempting to think that this should fall to governments, but there are many downsides to the likely centralization that would come with increased direct government roles in securing our private networks and that which connects to them.” Solution: “There are intriguing models for resilience through continued decentralization, with puzzles to be solved on interoperability and consistency, especially as many users are understandably not prepared to be personally and continually involved in actively securing their devices and data.” Kevin Bankston, Open Technology Institute Challenge: “The threat of governments restricting the deployment of encryption.” Solution: “Leverage the fact that tech moves faster than policy and speed up the development, deployment and adoption of more strong encryption tools--not only to make us all more secure but to make attempts at anti-crypto regulation even more futile than they already are.” Eric Burger, Georgetown Center for Secure Communications Challenge: “The combined cybersecurity/privacy challenge is the market speaks loudly: there is no cost to public companies in any meaningful financial metric post-breach. As such, rational enterprises will only invest just enough to cover the most basic cyber security issues, as there is no meaningful penalty for getting breached. One has to assume that the not insignificant investment by large enterprises in cyber security is one reason they are relatively immune to any post-breach impacts. However, it is clear that asking enterprises to increase investment in cyber security would be an irrational exercise.” Solution: “Go beyond breach notification laws and move to restitution laws. Today the consumer suffers the economic effects of a breach. If those effects were shifted to the enterprise, the enterprise would have incentive to protect themselves better.” Mark Weatherford, Chertoff Group Challenge: “Developing international norms for cybersecurity behavior.” Josh Corman, Atlantic Council Challenge: “Healthcare is sick. Connected hospitals are prone, they are prey, and predators have finally taken notice. They are target-rich; resource-poor. The bulk of hospitals lack a single qualified security pro on staff, are porous and unsegmented, and run WindowsXP and older unsupported systems. Given how familiar and exposed they are, even unskilled adversaries could do significant damage. They claim they lack resources (true). But/and: If you can't afford to protect it, then you can't afford to connect it.” Solution: “Well, we can't treat the patient without a solid diagnosis. The Information Sharing CISA Law of 2015 required a 1 year HHS CyberSecurity Task Force. We are nearly done with our report back to Congress (late April) and we outline some short-medium-long-term ways to get us on a path to wellness. None of these are going to be easy. I hope this catalyzes corrective actions.” Influencers who chose to remain anonymous  Challenge: “The Internet of Everything - nearly everything connected globally, humans and things. This hyperconnectivity is and will always be the largest threat. Networks create collaboration and many positive advantages, but these massive new networks are incredibly vulnerable in so many ways it is impossible to deal with them. The only reason there haven't been more massive attacks or outages to this point is that bad actors are smart enough to keep their uncivil actions fairly small, so these interconnected networks keep running and stay alive to be exploited. From the weaponization of the social narrative we have seen in recent national elections globally to identity theft, to DDOS attacks at places like Dyn (October 2016), flashes of danger flare up occasionally. What if all of the attacks that have been stopped early on had been allowed to emerge full-bloom?”  Solution: “There is no way to address the fact that billions of people and (soon) trillions of networked things in an always-evolving and constantly growing network have vulnerabilities.”  -  Challenge: “The danger of foreign powers manipulating the data and systems of the United States and its allies.”  Solution: “Imposing stronger punitive measures on those that hack into US systems.” - Challenge: “End-to-end encryption by default”  Solution: “Build, support, and embrace zero-knowledge cloud services.”  - Challenge: “Individual freedom in the age of expanding government intrusion into personal devices.”  Solution: “Devices have become so ubiquitous that people may not know the consequences of their data being copied and stored by the government for decades to come. Zero storage of data by government entities of any person who is not under indictment would be a good start.”  - Challenge: “Cyberattacks both criminal and foreign governmental.”  Solution: “Spend far less time developing offensive capabilities in the NSA, CIA, and Cyber Command and far more effort and resources on developing a comprehensive national cyber defense capability.” - Challenge:  “Governments understanding that honest people need security.” Solution: “Government isn't monolithic. Most parts do, except for law enforcement, and even there it's only some of them. They need to look at how to do their jobs without changing tech.” - Challenge: “Securing elections in EU countries and here at home.”  - Challenge: “Lack of focused data protection in the public/private partnership. Too much time spent on walks not protecting data and access.” - Challenge: “The statistical increase in destructive malware based attacks targeted not just at US businesses and institutions of all sizes as anti-American sentiment grows.”  Solution: “Machine learning and AI-based analytics applied at the network.”  - Challenge: “Insecure infrastructure.” Solution: “Attention and funding.” - Challenge: “Bad InfoSec by major companies.”  Solution:  “Criminalize bad infosec.” - Challenge: “Securing critical infrastructure including financial, transportation, and other systems that our way of life depends on.”  Solution: “Employing friendly ‘red teams’ to attack from within like real attackers.” What do you think?

The Nasdaq Composite and the Nasdaq-100 indexes were not always as widely followed as say the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500. However, the technology boom and subsequent of the late 1990s/early 2000s changed that. Today, the Nasdaq Composite is usually mentioned alongside the Dow and S&P 500. Add to that, hundreds of billions around the world are benchmarked to various versions of the Nasdaq-100 index — the most familiar version of which is the QQQ ETF. Among ETFs tracking Nasdaq indices, the QQQ is the gold standard. The fund just celebrated its 18th birthday and is home to more than $45.5 billion in assets under management, making it one the largest ETFs in the U.S. The average market value of QQQ’s holdings is over $236 billion. The combination of fund size, the size of its holdings and average daily volume of about 17.8 million shares ensures this is one of the most liquid ETFs in the U.S. with spreads that are usually just a penny wide. Under the Hood of QQQ Although this PowerShares ETF is a favorite among professional traders, it has some notable advantages for retail traders as well. The 10 Best ETFs on the Planet For example, capital-starved investors that are looking for exposure to triple-digit-price stocks such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) will like the QQQ ETF because it features large weights to those and other high price tag Internet and technology darlings. Second, many of QQQ’s holdings can be considered growth stocks, but with old guard tech names such as Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) residing here, QQQ offers investors some growth with a bit of a value buffer. If nothing else, the mega-cap nature of many fund components ensures investors can get some growth without the volatility of a small-cap fund. This PowerShares trust is actually home to 107 stocks because the Nasdaq allows for other shares classes of some stocks to enter its benchmarks. Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a good example, as both of its share classes are among QQQ’s top 10 holdings. QQQ reflects the Nasdaq’s status as a technology-heavy exchange with an almost 58% weight to that sector, which is about triple what is found in the S&P 500. However, this fund devotes a third of its weight to consumer discretionary and healthcare stocks. The ETF only features six of the 11 sectors found in the S&P 500 and notably excludes financial services names, among others.

Security search for solutions For Passcode’s last Influencers Poll, we asked an open-ended question: What’s the most urgent cybersecurity or privacy challenge right now, and what’s one way to fix it?  Sara Sorcher Staff writer | @SaraSorcher March 27, 2017 —Securing elections from hackers. The spread of connected devices. Nation-state attacks. The lack of cybersecurity talent.  These were some of the pressing cybersecurity challenges that keep Passcode’s group of security and privacy experts up at night. Passcode’s Influencers Poll regularly surveys 160 high-profile experts from across government, industry, and the advocacy community. For one last poll before Passcode shuts down, we asked an open-ended question: What’s the most urgent cybersecurity or privacy challenge right now, and what’s one way to fix it? What do you think? VOTE in the public version of the poll.  Several Influencers were concerned about the impending explosive growth in the sheer number of devices connected to the internet. “Whether one calls them embedded systems, or the 'Internet of Things,' the combination of these little computers, poor security design, and upcoming high-speed wireless networks are a perfect storm of sorts that holds the potential to make all of our current cybersecurity concerns worse, more persistent, and of much larger scale,” says Bob Stratton, a serial security entrepreneur, investor, and consultant. In order to combat this, Mr. Stratton says, “we as consumers, investors, and regulators all have to make clear our insistence upon products (of all kinds) that have at least some basic modicum of system integrity and resistance to compromise built in at the time of manufacture. Not every connected light bulb has to have the same security features as a desktop computer, but it is reasonable to expect that ours will only obey commands from the proper controllers and at a bare minimum, that these little devices do not provide a foothold for an attacker trying to gain access to the rest of our home and business networks.” To that end, the No. 1 challenge for Dan Kaminsky, cofounder and chief scientist at White Ops security firm, is making secure development of products “faster, better, and most importantly, cheaper.” “Astonishing things can be built on a solid foundation. They can also be built on quicksand, but they won't last very long,” he says. “We need to escape the false dichotomy between quickly developed crud and monoliths of perfection. It needs to be relatively easy and straightforward to build and operate secure systems. A lot of that is going to involve actually studying what developers want and need, and giving them tools that maintain and retain security as a first class feature.” Dan Geer, chief information security officer for In-Q-Tel, a not-for-profit investment firm that works to invest in technology that supports the missions of the intelligence community, took a big picture approach in his answer: The most urgent issue, he says, is people’s overall dependence on technology. “The more people use something, the more it is depended upon. Because the wellspring of risk is dependence, risk is therefore proportional to adoption. We call that on which we most depend critical infrastructures. Because dependence is transitive, so is risk,” Mr. Geer says. “That you may not yourself depend on something directly does not mean that you do not depend on it indirectly. Interdependence within society is today absolutely centered on the Internet beyond all other dependencies excepting climate, and the Internet has a time constant five orders of magnitude smaller. The complexity of our problem is therefore unacknowledged correlated risk and the unacknowledged correlated risk of cyberspace is why cyberspace is capable of black swan behavior.” To address this, Mr. Geer says there’s no single bullet. “Bring a revolver,” he quips, advocating for “disconnected operation for critical infrastructures, stress testing for entities too connected to fail, public seizure of abandoned codebases, mandatory cyber-event sharing above some threshold of seriousness” and to “geocode the internet, just as cellphones are.” Other experts pointed to broader privacy challenges as consumers put more and more personal information online. Jenny Durkan, global chair of the Cyber Law and Privacy Group at Quinn Emanuel law firm, points to “gross and unnecessary overcollection of personal information” as her major concern – especially because it’s not adequately protected by the companies that collect it, and consumers have “no realistic way” to control how their personal data spreads online. To solve this problem, Ms. Durkan says, “consumers should be given a easy and clear way to opt out of data collection and still utilize new technology, and should have the right to limit, review and remove data collected about them for commercial purposes. Innovators need to build and bake better security into technology from the outset. We must end the ‘innovate, then secure’ mindset.” Several Influencers said the biggest challenges were not necessarily the cyberthreats themselves – but people’s reaction to them. “The most urgent challenge to both cybersecurity and privacy right now is the threat of overreaction that stems from incidents that occur,” says Christian Dawson, executive director and cofounder of the Internet Infrastructure Coalition.  To prevent this, Mr. Dawson adds, “a focus on technical education is essential, to aid legislators and regulators in a sound understanding of tech issues. If they comprehend the tech environment prior to a threat, they will be less likely to over-react legislatively during one.” Similarly, Jeffrey Carr, president and chief executive officer of Taia Global, Inc., worries about “the likelihood that we will go to war over incorrect attribution of a serious cyberattack." “When the leadership of both House and Senate Intelligence Committees misrepresent the facts of electoral databases being hacked, and when national policy decisions are frequently driven by privately provided intelligence data that is often unverified and unreliable, and when the private sector and the media can announce nation state attribution of a cyberattack, right or wrong without fear of blowback, then a window of opportunity exists for a malicious third party to cause two nations to escalate to a kinetic conflict when the presumed attacking state is innocent," Mr. Carr continues. Unfortunately, Carr says there’s “no way to address it because the cyberthreat intelligence industry has no incentive to change and the US government doesn't acknowledge it as a problem."  A few Influencers agreed that before any of these challenges can be tackled, the pipeline of people itself needs securing. "There are a reported one million or more job openings currently in the cybersecurity field, and some industries are just beginning to grow their efforts in this space," says Jeff Massimilla, chief product cybersecurity officer for General Motors. "This gap will likely increase, making it even more difficult for companies to find qualified individuals to fill these roles.” Mr. Massimilla suggests developing more robust university curricula and programs, specialized academic support and focused efforts on job placement after graduation for students interested in the cybersecurity field.  Günter Ollmann, chief security officer at Vectra Networks, also said the shortage of appropriately trained and experienced cybersecurity staff is the biggest challenge, and offered two different ways to solve it. “There are two primary methods for incrementally addressing the shortage of experienced cybersecurity staff. Firstly, the increased deployment of machine learning and AI-based technologies that reduce the technical load on expert staff. And secondly, concerted efforts to encourage more women to join the information security field, coupled with better pay and support mechanisms for women already commencing their cybersecurity careers.”  What do you think? VOTE in the public version of the poll.  To view the full list of Influencers, check out the masthead here.  Comments  Mike Papay, Northrop Grumman Challenge: “Cybersecurity of the things in our life we rely on: IoT, critical infrastructure, vehicles, etc.” Solution: “Ensure a market-based economy exists that values the security as well as the capability of the systems we buy.”   Nick Selby, Secure Ideas Challenge: “There is still an almost total lack of training for non-federal prosecutors on cyber crime. This means almost no cybercrime cases are brought outside the federal system.” Solution: “The DOJ and federal government must provide funding for training of District, County, and State's Attorneys on how to bring cybercrime cases. This is the only way to balance the load placed on federal authorities, and the only way to make a dent on logarithmic growth in cyber criminal activity.” John Pescatore, SANS Institute Challenge: “Increasing use of strong authentication – moving away from reusable passwords.” Solution: “Require strong authentication for online tax filing.” Christian Dawson, Internet Infrastructure Coalition Challenge: The most urgent challenge to both cybersecurity and privacy right now is the threat of overreaction that stems from incidents that occur.” Solution: “A focus on technical education is essential, to aid legislators and regulators in a sound understanding of tech issues. If they comprehend the tech environment prior to a threat, they will be less likely to over-react legislatively during one.” Daniel Castro, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation Challenge: “There is a market failure around cybersecurity. Consumers cannot easily compare the security features of two products. This is an information asymmetry problem that government can help fix.” Solution: “Most companies publish a privacy policy, which helps create a transparent and accountable mechanism for regulators to ensure companies are adhering to their stated policies. However, no such system exists for security practices, which has resulted in vague standards, regulation by buzzword, and information asymmetry in markets. By publishing security policies, companies would be motivated to describe the types of security measures they have in place rather than just make claims of "we take security seriously.” This is a concrete step that policymakers can take to improve security practices in the private sector.” Marc Rotenberg, Electronic Privacy Information Center Challenge: “Growing threats to personal privacy and the increase in identity theft, data breach, and financial fraud.” Solution: “The United States needs to establish a Data Protection Agency, like every other democratic government. There is a real risk of a cyber security policy that protects US businesses and US government agencies but leaves the personal data of Americans at risk.” Chris Finan, Manifold Security Challenge: “Vulnerabilities in the nation's operational technology. Many critical infrastructure industrial control systems remain at risk because some operators have not prioritized security. Americans could absolutely die as a result of an attack against one of these vulnerable systems.” Solution: “Congress must enact legislation to ensure the operators of the most critical systems prioritize security. The public will eventually get legislation to that end that protects communities, it's only a question of whether it happens before or after a major incident.” Abigail Slater, Internet Association Challenge: “Keeping our nation's networks, including those of our key institutions, safe from malicious attacks. Trust is a must, and fostering trust online is a team sport. So the challenge will be restoring trust through teamwork.” Solution: “Strong encryption is a tried and tested tool and is needed now more than ever. This is why the Internet Association supports policies that enable strong encryption online.” Mårten Mickos, HackerOne Challenge: “Citizens worrying that cybersecurity issues in society are in much worse shape than what any official spokesperson is ready to publicly acknowledge.” Solution: “More transparency (in public sector and by companies) about cybersecurity threats, incidents and solutions.” Cris Thomas a.k.a. Space Rogue, Tenable Security Challenge: “The popular answer to this question will be 0-day, APT, IOT or international norms in cyberspace or any one of a dozen other trendy topics. But the most urgent cybersecurity challenge right now is the same as it has been for the last twenty years. Know thyself. The first thing an attacker does after they have gain access to a target network is map it out and find where the valuable information lies.

Yes, used awareness training does help reduce security incidents but it won't prevent them and blaming a user for accidently clicking on a link is not the answer. Addressing the failure of most organizations to follow even the most basic cyber security principles is a multi-pronged problem. Executives are still not taking cyber security seriously enough and are not devoting enough resources to the teams attempting to correct the problems. In some cases the security teams themselves do not understand the severity of the threat or feel they need the latest blinky light solution to save them when all they really need to do is the boring mundane work of inventorying their networks, patch their systems, check their configurations and keep an eye on their access credentials.” Ely Kahn, Sqrrl Challenge: “I think the most urgent cybersecurity challenge is the need for all organizations to fully understand the cyber risks they face, how those risks affect their mission, and what are the most cost effective ways to mitigate those risks.” Solution: “Adoption of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a great start.” Charles Brooks, Sutherland Global Services Challenge: “Google Evangelist (and a founder of the Internet) Vint Cerf has stated that there is no such thing as privacy on the Internet.I agree, especially in regard to our future.In our evolving digital world, anything and everything is likely to be connected. The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices (Cisco predicts 50 billion devices by 2020) implies that privacy is becoming quite a conundrum. I would posture that IoT is our biggest privacy challenge because inencompasses every vertial, financial, health, commercial,energy, communications, and security.” Solution: “A way to help ensure privacy in IoT is standardize security with manufactures, encrypt, authenticate, firewall, and practice strong cyber hygiene.” Sascha Meinrath, X-Lab  Challenge: “Educating key decision-makers about technological realities.” Solution: “For the past ten years, I've been a vocal advocate of the need for technological expertise to be in the room and at the table whenever legislative and legal deliberations are taking place. In much the same way that we understand the need for lawyers to be involved in key decision-making, it is as important that technological savvy be equally represented in these processes.” Tom Cross, Drawbridge Networks Challenge: “The most urgent cybersecurity challenge right now is the need for more skilled security professional. Every organization that I work with is struggling to find and retain skilled people, and this challenge is slowing down their efforts to protect themselves." Solution: “One way to address the skills shortage is to think about how to do more with less, both in terms of helping CISOs properly prioritize the tasks that they have, and developing security tools that have lower administrative overhead and amplify the efforts small numbers of people.” Joel de la Garza, Box Challenge: “User education and awareness.” Solution: “Nationwide awareness campaigns. Similar to public safety campaigns around seat belt use or littering.” Scott Montgomery, Intel Security Challenge: “Trained labor is in the midst of a nasty math problem. The number of devices, the amount of data, the vectors of delivery, the variety of threats increase at a dramatic pace. The number of trained practitioners remains relatively static, as do budgets. There are still (I checked) only 24 hours in the day. Something has to give, and it's results. Time between breach and detection is higher than four years ago even with 'better' technology and more experience.”  Solution: “The overall amount of labor to achieve a solid security and privacy posture MUST be reduced. Industry needs to make more reliable, easier to use products that integrate well with competitors and other ecosystem vendors. Practitioners need to embrace automation and information sharing. Regulatory bodies should be agreeing on a smaller number of more useful standards. Organizations must begin data valuation efforts in order to stop treating all data equally and apply their meager resources where it matters most.” Nicole Eagan, Darktrace Challenge: “Cybersecurity has become an arms race – we have entered a new era of rapidly-evolving threats characterized by speed, sophistication, and automation. It’s no longer just about compromised websites or stolen data. Today’s threats are far more insidious, aiming to garner media attention and undermine the very integrity of our data, and the institutions who host it. Early glimpses of these ‘trust attacks’ have been seen from DNC to Yahoo. We’re even starting to see the beginnings of a new generation of cyber warfare, where attackers use machine intelligence to subtly infiltrate organizations and learn how to blend in. Legacy defenses rely too heavily on perimeter protection and rules and signatures. Yet, these approaches are no longer sufficient to combat evolving attacks, as companies struggle to stay abreast of the ‘unknown unknown’ threats and the ever present risk of insider threat. Quite simply, companies have a huge visibility problem – they cannot see what is happening beneath the surfaces of their own networks. Complete network visibility while securing networks from the inside out will be of paramount importance in the battle against advanced threat-actors.” Solution: “Self-learning technologies using genuine machine learning will be critical to solving this problem. New ‘immune system’ technologies are capable of learning a ‘pattern of life’ for every user and device to establish a comprehensive understanding of the network as a whole. From this baseline, it can detect emerging anomalies in real-time, and even take precise action to automatically respond and neutralize the threat. It’s a brave new world, and companies need to arm themselves with a self-defending network to stay one step ahead of even the stealthiest threat-actors.” Stewart Baker, Steptoe & Johnson Challenge: “Nation-state hacking of banks.” Solution: “Aggressive international sanctions on countries and groups identified as having hacked banks.” Steve Weber, School of Information, University of California - Berkeley  Challenge: “In one word: complacency. The internet has become a very dangerous place for businesses, governments, and people -- but most of us aren't scared enough to do much different.”  Solution: “First, ban the word 'hacker' from the cybersecurity lexicon. Don't let criminals, spies, liars, and terrorists cover themselves with a label that makes them sound creative, innovative, and clever.”  Terrell McSweeny, Federal Trade Commission  Challenge: “As an FTC Commissioner, my focus is on consumer data privacy and security. At the moment, the most urgent privacy challenge facing consumers is Congressional action to eliminate broadband privacy -- a huge setback for consumer control over their sensitive data. Maintaining the FCC's current rules would make ISP practices more consistent with consumers' expectations of confidentiality. The majority's haste to lay waste to privacy protections doesn't bode well for the development of a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to consumer privacy. It also likely means we won't see comprehensive data security legislation to address one of the most urgent cybersecurity challenges: the billions of insecure IoT devices that are rapidly becoming integral parts of our daily lives.”  Matthew Eggers, US Chamber of Commerce  Challenge: “An urgent challenge is crafting a new US cybersecurity strategy that features business input.” Solution: "America’s approach to cyber is at an inflection point. Industry is typically the first to take a cyber punch on the chin, and public policy should be adjusted accordingly. Policymakers need to engage the business community before, during, and after the strategy is written. We need to highlight international norms and deterrence. Our national deterrence deficit lies in our struggle to stymie attacks by criminal groups and foreign powers that fall into the malicious middle of the attack spectrum. This middling sweep of aggressions is bookended on the one hand by relatively minor attacks that companies are capable of blunting on their own and acts of war on the other, which could require government involvement.” David Brumley, CyLab Challenge: “Internet of Things device security.” Solution: “Automating security checks. We need to move beyond manual approaches.”   Adam Segal, Council on Foreign Relations Challenge: “Lack of meaningful deterrence.” Jonathan Zittrain, Harvard Challenge: “It's profoundly difficult to figure out who owns cybersecurity -- who should be responsible for ensuring it systemically. It's tempting to think that this should fall to governments, but there are many downsides to the likely centralization that would come with increased direct government roles in securing our private networks and that which connects to them.” Solution: “There are intriguing models for resilience through continued decentralization, with puzzles to be solved on interoperability and consistency, especially as many users are understandably not prepared to be personally and continually involved in actively securing their devices and data.” Kevin Bankston, Open Technology Institute Challenge: “The threat of governments restricting the deployment of encryption.” Solution: “Leverage the fact that tech moves faster than policy and speed up the development, deployment and adoption of more strong encryption tools--not only to make us all more secure but to make attempts at anti-crypto regulation even more futile than they already are.” Eric Burger, Georgetown Center for Secure Communications Challenge: “The combined cybersecurity/privacy challenge is the market speaks loudly: there is no cost to public companies in any meaningful financial metric post-breach. As such, rational enterprises will only invest just enough to cover the most basic cyber security issues, as there is no meaningful penalty for getting breached. One has to assume that the not insignificant investment by large enterprises in cyber security is one reason they are relatively immune to any post-breach impacts. However, it is clear that asking enterprises to increase investment in cyber security would be an irrational exercise.” Solution: “Go beyond breach notification laws and move to restitution laws. Today the consumer suffers the economic effects of a breach. If those effects were shifted to the enterprise, the enterprise would have incentive to protect themselves better.” Mark Weatherford, Chertoff Group Challenge: “Developing international norms for cybersecurity behavior.” Josh Corman, Atlantic Council Challenge: “Healthcare is sick. Connected hospitals are prone, they are prey, and predators have finally taken notice. They are target-rich; resource-poor. The bulk of hospitals lack a single qualified security pro on staff, are porous and unsegmented, and run WindowsXP and older unsupported systems. Given how familiar and exposed they are, even unskilled adversaries could do significant damage. They claim they lack resources (true). But/and: If you can't afford to protect it, then you can't afford to connect it.” Solution: “Well, we can't treat the patient without a solid diagnosis. The Information Sharing CISA Law of 2015 required a 1 year HHS CyberSecurity Task Force. We are nearly done with our report back to Congress (late April) and we outline some short-medium-long-term ways to get us on a path to wellness. None of these are going to be easy. I hope this catalyzes corrective actions.” Influencers who chose to remain anonymous  Challenge: “The Internet of Everything - nearly everything connected globally, humans and things. This hyperconnectivity is and will always be the largest threat. Networks create collaboration and many positive advantages, but these massive new networks are incredibly vulnerable in so many ways it is impossible to deal with them. The only reason there haven't been more massive attacks or outages to this point is that bad actors are smart enough to keep their uncivil actions fairly small, so these interconnected networks keep running and stay alive to be exploited. From the weaponization of the social narrative we have seen in recent national elections globally to identity theft, to DDOS attacks at places like Dyn (October 2016), flashes of danger flare up occasionally. What if all of the attacks that have been stopped early on had been allowed to emerge full-bloom?”  Solution: “There is no way to address the fact that billions of people and (soon) trillions of networked things in an always-evolving and constantly growing network have vulnerabilities.”  -  Challenge: “The danger of foreign powers manipulating the data and systems of the United States and its allies.”  Solution: “Imposing stronger punitive measures on those that hack into US systems.” - Challenge: “End-to-end encryption by default”  Solution: “Build, support, and embrace zero-knowledge cloud services.”  - Challenge: “Individual freedom in the age of expanding government intrusion into personal devices.”  Solution: “Devices have become so ubiquitous that people may not know the consequences of their data being copied and stored by the government for decades to come. Zero storage of data by government entities of any person who is not under indictment would be a good start.”  - Challenge: “Cyberattacks both criminal and foreign governmental.”  Solution: “Spend far less time developing offensive capabilities in the NSA, CIA, and Cyber Command and far more effort and resources on developing a comprehensive national cyber defense capability.” - Challenge:  “Governments understanding that honest people need security.” Solution: “Government isn't monolithic. Most parts do, except for law enforcement, and even there it's only some of them. They need to look at how to do their jobs without changing tech.” - Challenge: “Securing elections in EU countries and here at home.”  - Challenge: “Lack of focused data protection in the public/private partnership. Too much time spent on walks not protecting data and access.” - Challenge: “The statistical increase in destructive malware based attacks targeted not just at US businesses and institutions of all sizes as anti-American sentiment grows.”  Solution: “Machine learning and AI-based analytics applied at the network.”  - Challenge: “Insecure infrastructure.” Solution: “Attention and funding.” - Challenge: “Bad InfoSec by major companies.”  Solution:  “Criminalize bad infosec.” - Challenge: “Securing critical infrastructure including financial, transportation, and other systems that our way of life depends on.”  Solution: “Employing friendly ‘red teams’ to attack from within like real attackers.” What do you think?

In response, the top cloud vendors, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft and Google, now offer public cloud instances with graphics processing unit (GPU) support. While these GPU cloud instances have a great deal of potential, it is in an early stage of development. As a result, a few hurdles exist, such as cost and, in many cases, a lot of custom development work. A changing marketplace Traditionally, resource-intensive systems, also known as high-performance computing (HPC), were a niche technology geared toward research, engineering and video development. Typical applications include genomics, computational finance, video rendering and visualization. HPC systems demand oodles of processing power on specially configured servers. Development often takes years and the applications require days or longer to run on high-end, dedicated systems. As a result, these applications were difficult to build, expensive to run and out of the reach of most enterprises. But recently, HPC market dynamics have changed. The systems have moved away from customized CPUs toward commodity gear. Vendors like Nvidia and Intel have positioned their GPUs as a good fit for the HPC market, and top public cloud vendors have relied on them to support their HPC services. HPC on the rise HPC server sales continue to grow. "Servers for cognitive workloads are a fast-growing segment in the server market," said Peter Rutten, research manager at IDC's Enterprise Platforms Group. The research and analysis firm projects that worldwide revenue from servers for cognitive workloads will grow at a 19.8% CAGR from 2016 to 2021, representing a $9 billion opportunity. Also, the customer profile has changed. Historically, HPC systems were deployed in niche markets, but have worked their way into the corporate mainstream. Enterprises deal with large volumes of data that are expected to increase exponentially with the emergence of the internet of things. As firms collect and mine larger mounds of data, they are on the lookout for software to help automate processing. As a result, GPU systems -- including GPU cloud instances -- have become computational engines for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. Providers round out their GPU cloud instances line-up This shift toward GPUs caught the attention of the top public cloud suppliers that have recently moved into space. In the fourth quarter of 2016, AWS and Microsoft Azure both revealed new GPU cloud instances for their public clouds -- the P2 instance type and the N Series, respectively -- and in February, Google also entered the fray with its GPU support, which is currently in beta. While these instance types are well suited for machine learning and other compute-intensive applications, several barriers to adoption exist. First, these services are generally expensive. AWS and Microsoft Azure start their pricing at $0.90 per GPU per hour, while Google GPU cloud instances starts at $0.70 per hour. By comparison, AWS starts its pricing for general-purpose compute instances at $0.0059 per hour. In addition, this market relies on custom development and highly specialized programming tools. Popular frameworks include Apache Spark, Caffe, Apache SystemML, MXNet, TensorFlow and Torch. Most enterprise IT departments lack the skills to write and manage applications built with these frameworks. Organizations need to invest in staff training and certification programs to manage such deployments. HPC, machine learning and other compute-intensive applications continue to gain popularity with enterprises. And while GPU cloud instances can help support these workloads, high prices and a lack of experience may deter many enterprises from deployment in the near term.

Micron earnings come after Thursday's bell. Here's a quick look at Wall Street's expectations and sentiment. By Robert Martin, InvestorPlace Writer  |  Mar 23, 2017, 2:12 pm EDT     Popular Posts: GOOGL Stock Is Falling Into a Funk Ford Stock Falls to Dirt-Cheap High-Yield Status Frontier Communications Corp (FTR): This 20% Yield Will Vanish (FTR) Recent Posts: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Rockets to New All-Time Highs Facebook Inc (FB) Slams Snap Inc (SNAP) With Facebook Stories Why Catalyst Biosciences Inc (CBIO) Stock Tripled on Tuesday View All Posts UPDATE: Micron beats Q2 estimates. EPS: 90 cents per share vs. 69 cents estimated. Revenues: $4.65 billion versus $4.63 billion estimated. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a few hours away from entering the earnings confessional for its fiscal second-quarter earnings. We’ll take a quick look at what Wall Street wants, and where MU stock might head next. Source: Mike Deal via Flickr First, the headline figures: Micron Earnings Expectations Analyst estimates for Micron earnings come in a range of 62 cents to 89 cents per share, but the consensus mark is for 80 cents per share. Wall Street’s experts see revenues coming in at $4.6 billion. That’d be 59% growth year-over-year, and 15% growth sequentially. Credit Suisse is a bit more optimistic on the bottom line, seeing Q2 earnings of 86 cents per share. Its revenue guidance of $4.65 billion is also slightly above the consensus, as well as Micron’s own guidance for $4.53 billion. MU Stock Sentiment Right now, analysts who cover MU stock are targeting a price of $31 per share, or roughly 18% higher from here. Meanwhile, on the high end, one analyst sees a 70% spurt to $45 per share. As a group, there are 23 buy ratings and just four holds, with no sells. Technically speaking, the sky’s the limit for MU stock — kind of. While the stock is off to the races in terms of being well above any of its major moving averages, and not being overbought from a technical perspective, optimists can at least start looking toward the next point of price resistance: The $36.50 area — last hit in late 2014 before the bottom fell out of Micron shares. Also worth pointing out is that Micron is among the last of the big chipmakers to report. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have struggled this year, but even Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), though up solidly year-to-date, has had a couple of major bumps, while Micronstock  has mostly skated through the year. Again, looking even further out, there’s more optimism out of Credit Suisse, specifically on the industry demand side of things: “Our industry supply/demand model points to tight DRAM thru 2017, tight NAND thru at least the calendar third quarter of 2017. Our calendar year 2017 DRAM/NAND year over year (y/y) bit growth of 18%/40% still valid despite the possibility of incremental capacity – our upside case for DRAM/NAND y/y bit growth is 20%/50%. While pricing trends may begin to level off, even against our upside bit growth, we would expect MU margins to expand throughout the year.” Micron’s Q2 earnings report is due out shortly after Thursday’s closing bell. For those looking for a trading solution, Chris Tyler offers up an idea on MU stock. As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

As a result, whether the radio function is integrated into the microcontroller or added as a separate module, its energy consumption is often the dominant factor and can vary considerably between competing devices. “The IoTMark-BLE provides IoT system developers with the means to select optimal microcontroller and wireless solutions for their application by going beyond the limited datasheet specifications that tell only part of the story,” said Brent Wilson, co-chair of the EEMBC IoT-Connect working group and director of applications engineering at Silicon Laboratories. “IoTMark-BLE measures the energy used by the full subsystem including the MCU, the radio, and the protocol stack, while they perform relevant real-world tasks. Each part of the system impacts energy efficiency, so evaluating the whole radio system provides the most realistic evaluation of its battery life.” The IoTMark-BLE is the first of a suite of benchmarks that the EEMBC IoT-Connect Working Group will deliver. Although the IoTMark-BLE targets IoT devices utilizing Bluetooth for communication, the benchmark runs on a flexible, IoT-Connect benchmark framework that EEMBC developed to accommodate additional benchmarks targeting other communication protocols, including Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN, and LPWAN. The Consortium is working to produce a suite of benchmarks that allow comparisons between microcontrollers, radios, and modules as well as between competing communication protocols. The key components of this flexible IoT-Connect framework include 1) an EnergyMonitor to measure energy; 2) a radio manager, to coordinate the communication with the device under test (DUT); and 3) an IO Manager to synchronize activities and to simulate a sensor input on the DUT’s I2C or serial peripheral interface (SPI). “Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a popular technology for many IoT edge-node applications, such as health monitors, home automation devices, and wearable devices. Each application can vary a range of parameters including payload size, frequency of payload transmission, and transmit power. So EEMBC members had to agree on the specific set of tests and measurements to cover a wide cross section of these applications,” said Mark Wallis, co-chair of the EEMBC IoT working group and system architect at STMicroelectronics. “With IoTMark-BLE and the IoT-Connect framework, we’ve made it as easy as possible for developers to select the parameters and functions to ensure equitable comparisons while providing valuable insight beyond datasheet specifications ².” “The IoT-Connect benchmark framework, which supports IoTMark-BLE, has the flexibility to accommodate various communication protocols, and is also sufficiently portable to work with any vendor’s microcontroller and radio-module products. We also designed the framework to work with our other present and future benchmarks, including IoT-Secure and ULPBench,” said Peter Torelli, EEMBC director of technology. ”As always, the EEMBC benchmarks make customers’ AND semiconductor manufacturers’ jobs easier by encouraging the use of industry-standard benchmark results to inform their decisions, rather than having to demystify unsubstantiated claims from competitors.” All interested parties are welcome to join this working group to help define future profiles of this IoT benchmark, ensuring the maximum coverage and relevance for IoT communication protocols and end-user scenarios. Current working group members include Ambiq Micro, Analog Devices, ARM, Cypress Semiconductor, Dialog Semiconductor, Flex, Imagination Technologies, Intel, Microchip, Nordic Semiconductor, NXP, Renesas, Silicon Labs, STMicroelectronics, Synopsys, and Texas Instruments.

Soon after, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer bragged about the news from the briefing room podium, and the White House’s communications office sent out a press release, pointing to the news as proof of a president who’s “delivering on jobs for the American people.” Just on the surface, this entire approach makes Trump appear more like a mayor than a president. It’s a massive country with the world’s largest economy, and individual companies are going to sometimes hire and fire people. Trump seems to think he can claim credit for every piece of positive economic news, which is plainly silly. But in the case of Charter Communications, it’s actually worse, because as the Washington Post noted, these jobs were actually announced in the Obama era, and had nothing to do with Trump. [P]arts of that pledge by Charter chief executive Tom Rutledge had already been made months ago…. [T]here is little evidence to suggest the Trump administration played a major role in securing those commitments. Charter had announced those intended hires as far back as October, and the jobs – which will largely be filled by customer service workers – are “new” only in the sense that they have yet to be filled. Oh. So the jobs Trump is pretending to create were actually announced before the election, when Obama was in office. Trump is trumpeting the hires now, hoping to take credit for jobs he had nothing to do with, while simultaneously hoping the public won’t know the difference. Worse, this keeps happening. We saw this same thing unfold a couple of weeks ago, for example, when Trump sought credit for oil-industry jobs that were announced under Obama. A fact-check piece from the Washington Post noted, “Trump’s bravado on these jobs announcements is becoming a bad joke.” The piece highlighted a series of jobs announcements – from Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Walmart, Intel, Lockheed Martin, Softbank, Sprint, and Alibaba – in which the president sought credit for developments he not only had nothing to do with, but also, in most instances, pointed to Obama-era news. When asked how he thinks his presidency is going, Trump couldn’t be more impressed with himself. He recently gave himself a grade of “A” for his “accomplishments,” pointing specifically to his jobs record: “I brought Ford back from Mexico. Ford was going with a massive plant. I brought Fiat in.” Except, he didn’t. Trump’s accomplishments are Obama-era successes, which the previous president didn’t feel the need to brag about. Maybe, at some point, the Republican will have earned the right to brag about his record, but in the meantime, Trump would probably be better off working than bragging about developments he had nothing to do with.

Watching “1984” in Trump’s America by Jana Monji March 27, 2017   |   Print Page Tweet In 1949, World War II had been over for four years, but a different war was brewing. The government of the Republic of China had fled to Taiwan, leaving behind Mao Tse-dong and his Red Army to form the People's Republic of China. Former war hero, Harry S. Truman was sworn in for his second term as President in January. Arthur Miller's tragedy Death of a Salesman opened on Broadway, examining the American dream while Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific" took on racism beyond black and white. In Europe, East Germany established itself as the Democratic Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb. The Greek Civil War ended with a Communist surrender. Advertisement In England, the formidable Margaret Roberts became a Conservative candidate and George Orwell's dystopian novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, is published. The book has been both a theatrical play and a movie. Two feature films have been made—in 1956 and another in 1984 (as well as several TV movies). The latter came to the US in 1985 and is being playing next week in theaters, on April 4, a crucial date for the protagonist of this tale.  The Movie As Roger Ebert said about the film: "George Orwell made no secret of the fact that his novel 1984 was not really about the future but about the very time he wrote it in, the bleak years after World War II when England shivered in poverty and hunger. In a novel where passion is depicted as a crime, the greatest passion is expressed, not for sex, but for contraband strawberry jam, coffee, and chocolate. What Orwell feared, when he wrote his novel in 1948, was that Hitlerism, Stalinism, centralism, and conformity would catch hold and turn the world into a totalitarian prison camp. It is hard, looking around the globe, to say that he was altogether wrong." When the first movie came out, Orwell was already dead, dying at the beginning of 1950. He was only 46. He would never see the influence of his novels on the world. The first movie was black and white, in more ways than one. Ebert found it simplistic.  Yet of the second movie, Ebert wrote: "What is remarkable about the movie is how completely it satisfied my feelings about the book; the movie looks, feels, and almost tastes and smells like Orwell's bleak and angry vision. John Hurt, with his scrawny body and lined and weary face, makes the perfect Winston Smith; and Richard Burton, looking so old and weary in this film that it is little wonder he died soon after finishing it, is the immensely cynical O'Brien, who feels close to people only while he is torturing them. Suzanna Hamilton is Julia, a fierce little war orphan whose rebellion is basically inspired by her hungers." What Orwell did not foresee was the birth control pill, but in some ways, he predicted Communist China's one child policy that was instituted in 1979. He also foresaw the desperate grayness of lives under communist regimes that had only just begin at the time of his death.  Where We Were in 1984 It is from "1984" we get phrases like Big Brother, Room 101, Thought Police, Thoughtcrime, Unperson, Memory Hole, Doublethink and Newspeak. Big Brother is a symbolic figure head that places every citizen under constant surveillance via telescreens. Citizens are constantly reminded that "Big Brother is watching."  Advertisement Hitler and Stalin had already demonstrated how to Unperson people for various reasons. That tradition wasn't unknown under dictators and military regimes of the past and continued forward. But in the 1980s, reality TV hadn't reached its catty stride with tremendous viewership quite yet. (Remember the sweet innocence of the 1948 "Candid Camera"?)  In the year 1984, Apple Computer had just placed a Macintosh personal computer on sale. The TED conference was founded the same year. Ronald Reagan was president and visited his ancestral home in the Republic of Ireland. Los Angeles was hosting the Summer Olympics that year and by the fall, Reagan won his second term. By this time, the Red Scare of the 1950s was over, but political Star Wars was not. The blue sea of Mao uniforms is echoed in the workers' costumes in Radford's movie. Introduced in 1949, the unflattering tunic suits became popular among European socialists in the 1960s and 1970s. At the time of the book's publication, the Berlin Wall had yet to be constructed. But, in 1989, the wall came tumbling down. The bleak despair of communism was changing from within. Ebert wrote, "Radford's style in the movie is an interesting experiment. Like Chaplin in 'Modern Times,' he uses passages of dialogue that are not meant to be understood—nonsense words and phrases, garbled as they are transmitted over Big Brother's primitive TV, and yet listened to no more or less urgently than the messages that say something. The 1954 film version of Orwell's novel turned it into a cautionary, simplistic science-fiction tale. This version penetrates much more deeply into the novel's heart of darkness." Where We Are Now Looking at Radford's film now, in 2017, the past has come to the future. With smartphones, iPads and computer notebooks, that constantly ask our location, our movements are being monitored. Radford's vision of telescreens and cubicles are a steampunk version of the modern PC monitors in cubicles. The poverty and crushing mind-numbing grayness of socialism is not totally forgotten and communism continues, but reality is now manufactured and promoted by television in democratic nations.  Advertisement From the molded reality moments, we now get our current president, Donald J. Trump. Four weeks into Trump's administration, Trumpian Newspeak gives us "alternative facts" to explain the visual comparison between a crowded National Mall for Obama's 2009 inauguration and the sparse crowd for Trump; all critical attacks on the president will be labeled "fake news" according to deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka and people who anger the president like Judge James Robart, will have their professional credentials questioned in a misuse of "so-called." "So-called" is, according to Merriam-Webster used to describe something that is "commonly named" or "falsely or improperly so named." Robart not only really is a judge, he was appointed by the last Republican president, George W. Bush. Merriam-Webster has been an active participant in this war of words, something that has been noted by Business Insider. Merriam-Webster has given pointed notes and rebuttals to the use and misuse of words as well as opportunities to learn new words like Götterdämmerung ("a collapse [as of a society or regime] marked by catastrophic violence and disorder"), claqueur ("a group hired to applaud at a performance") or snollygoster (a shrewd, unprincipled person"). Defining common words like "betrayal" became part of understanding the Trumpian logic. According to the White House, Sally Yates “has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States.” White House press secretary Sean Spicer called it "clearly a betrayal." A business decision by a department store without any political stance becomes an "attack" upon the president and his daughter, Ivanka. The tendency to describe things in terms of almost feudalistic relationships of loyalty puts each citizen at war with another. Advertisement One broadcast journalist was so flustered he declared of Trump, "What does it mean when he says words?" Because of Trump's rise to the presidency, Orwell's 1984 has become a best-seller again. The Daily Beast writer Michael Weiss feels "No, Trump Is Not Like Orwell's '1984'" but the New Yorker's Adam Gopnik, who never liked Orwell's novel has an apology and puts forth what Orwell got right in "Orwell's '1984' and Trump's America." Trump's America does have something in common with the sea of white faces in Radford's film. Trump was supported by the Ku Klux Klan, something that he didn't, as President-Elect, disavow. Orwell wrote at a time when India and China had been major allies of Great Britain and immigration had already created a Chinatown in London and brought curry to the UK. Yet Radford's vision of a white Ingsoc (English Socialism) makes it easier to imagine how the hordes of East Asia could be threatening, echoing Thatcher's infamous 1979 "swamped" speech about Asia (East and Central) during the very year (1984) that Thatcher was negotiating the return of Hong Kong to a Communist China.  Orwell might have been thinking of Germany, Russia and China when he wrote about Big Brother and the Cult of Personality. He might have been thinking of Adolf Hitler, Tito Mussolini, Lenin, Stalin and Mao. That was before mass media, portable record players, radios and telephones and Reality TV and social media. The movie begins with the quote: Who controls the past Controls the future. Who controls the present Controls the past. While communist regimes have attempted to re-write histories, so have democracies and democratic republics. Now, in real time, we can see history being re-written on social media. Trump attempts to take credit for the first pre-inaugural concert, something that Barack Obama did eight years ago. Intel gives Trump credit for a US factory that it announced under Obama. Trump blames Obama for the seven countries on his travel ban list. The numbers attending the inauguration becomes the numbers witnessing the inauguration by any medium. Trump sounds peevishly like Shakespeare's Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew when he declares it did not rain during his inauguration speech.  Further, Trump declared that "Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election." Trump followed that declaration with a link to "16 Fake News Stories Reporters Have Run Since Trump Won," but that was criticized by the Washington Post. The media doesn't cover terrorism even when it does. In a tweet that was posted, taken down, reposted and then taken down again, Trump wrote that the media, specifically the "failing" New York Times, NBC News, ABC, CBS and CNN (but notably not Breitbart), was the "enemy of the American people." Advertisement In a time of globalization, when the Internet makes the world smaller by allowing people to reach instantly across nations and continents, the citizens of Trumpland wish to put America first as Trump draws battle lines between Democrats and Republicans, Liberals and Conservatives, scientists and the superstitious, industrialists and conservationists, American and un-American. It's a Civil War of words and sometimes fists. Orwell wrote, "Nationalism is not to be confused with patriotism" and "By 'nationalism' I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled 'good' or 'bad.' But secondly—and this is much more important—I mean the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil and recognizing no other duty than that of advancing its interests." Dividing US citizens may have helped Trump conquer the electoral college, but is it really the way to make America great and the world a great place to live? Trumpland USA requires a corruption of American English; it requires a constant enemy. Check Twitter hourly to find out just who has been added to Trumpland USA's list of enemies. In his proposed preface for Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote, "If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear." In these Trumpian times, the best weapons are dictionaries, numbers and science coupled with the notion of saving our world, the Earth, from humanity's darkness: hate.  Next Article: Illuminating Insight: Ann Hornaday on "Talking Pictures" Previous Article: "Hair," "To Sleep with Anger" and More Set to Screen at Ebertfest 2017 Popular Blog Posts Who do you read?

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Huawei Win a custom Xbox Desktop PCs Internet Laptops Monitors PC Components Peripherals More Printers Routers & Networking Software Trending: Nintendo Switch Nokia 3310 iPhone 7 Galaxy S8 LG G6 iPhone 8 Home / News / PC Component News / Computex 2017: What to expect from Asus, Microsoft, AMD and more Computex 2017: What to expect from Asus, Microsoft, AMD and more by Michael Passingham 27 March 2017 0 shares Read Comments Computex 2017 (Taipei) Preview, News and Latest Rumours: Computing Editor Michael Passingham gives the lowdown on what to expect from this year's hardware heaven. Last year, I attended Computex for the first time, and for all its flaws I’m super-excited about returning with a year’s worth of knowledge under my belt. Taking place between May 29 and June 3, the show is spread all over Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, with thousands of exhibitors showing off everything from keyboard switches to... more keyboard switches. I’m only half joking. Computex will prove a strange show for anyone but the most hardcore of industry professionals. Some halls are filled with nothing but gaming PCs and laptops, including over-the-top custom solutions that case manufacturers are keen to show off. Familiar brands come with consumer kit, too. As you’ll see below, I’m expecting announcements from plenty of big-name brands, with Asus in particular looking to make a splash the day before the official opening of the show. At the opposite end of the spectrum there are entire halls – spaces as big as the biggest convention centres you’ll find here in the UK – filled with no-brand gaming headsets, mice and keyboards; they ship without a logo, only to have a familiar brand sticker slapped on them before they hit the market. As well as the key brands mentioned below, I’m hoping to gain an insight into the consumer computing industry, and hopefully leave better able to provide an idea of what to expect from computers and beyond. Computex 2017 Preview: What to expect We’re a couple of months away from Computex 2017, but using last year’s announcements plus some educated guesswork, I can predict a few items you should look out for. Asus ZenFones and ZenBooks Taiwan is the home turf of Asus, and the firm has previously used Computex to launch its biggest products of the year. In 2016, it launched not one but three ZenFones alongside the impressive ZenBook 3 laptop and Transformer Book 3 Pro. Asus tends to run its press conference the day before Computex officially starts, renting out a hotel ballroom to fit in a crowd of several hundred journalists and retail partners. The company always puts on a show, and I’m hoping chairman Jonney Shih (video below) will be return to the stage; his performance last year prompted us to create an homage video. Anybody remember ZenBo? That said, I’d be surprised if Asus launched a ZenBook 4 so soon after the ZenBook 3. It went on sale at the back-end of last year, and announcing another one now would surely hurt sales of existing models. With that said, an improved model with better battery life would be welcome, so perhaps a mid-life refresh will appear. Asus’ ROG gaming brand has been growing, so I think much of the company's focus will be here, and its Strix brand. Oh, and remember Asus Project Avalon from 2016? No, neither did we. Asus announced its modular computing project last year, but we haven't heard much since. I really hope that a year on Asus is able to declare some hardware partners – otherwise I think it will be safe to assume that Avalon was just a (really quite clever) concept. Acer Taiwan is also the home of Acer. Last year, the company didn’t make as big a splash as Asus, choosing to announce its 2016 roster at an event in April, and then quietly adding a few more devices to its lineup just ahead of the event. These included a few a new Switch 10 V tablet, a professional-grade monitor and some business laptops. I'd hope for a little more this year, perhaps with a focus on gaming. AMD Computex is AMD’s bread and butter, and its current lineup of Ryzen CPUs and upcoming Vega GPUs will surely be its centerpieces for the show. Last year, AMD used Computex to reveal the Radeon RX 480, which at the time was a seriously impressive card for a price that nobody was expecting. This year, I’d be surprised if AMD didn’t try to pull off something similar for a second time, showing off a GPU powered by its new Vega architecture. Related: AMD Vega AMD also revealed Zen – which became Ryzen – at last year’s event. I’d expect AMD to have revealed its full Ryzen lineup by the end of May, so don't expect any processor surprises this time around. However, it's likely that AMD will reveal some more details about its Zen-powered laptop chips at Computex 2017. Intel Computex 2016 saw Intel reveal its bonkers Broadwell-E processors – the lineup included a 10-core, 20-thread monstrosity for high-end video editors, among other things. This year, the company will probably focus on the rumoured Skylake-X chips, which will supersede Broadwell-E. ARM ARM launched new designs for its Cortex processors and Mali graphics chips in 2016, influencing the year's most popular smartphone chips. Expect more of the same this year, with a particular focus on mobile gaming and VR. Dell Dell formed part of Microsoft’s set of minor announcements last year, launching a few new Inspiron 2-in-1s, including a 17-inch model that we’ve yet to actually review. Expect a few more minor launches this year, as Dell already showed off its high-end XPS laptops at CES in January. Microsoft By the time Computex 2017 comes around, the Windows 10 Creators Update should be rolling out to users, so will likely feature heavily at the show as Microsoft looks to try to make Windows 10 look fresh again. The theme of the Creators Update is creativity and gaming, so I’d be surprised if Microsoft didn't extol the virtues of VR, touchscreens and streaming. Nvidia Nvidia doesn’t make a big outward-facing song and dance about Computex, although it’s an important event for its hardware partner, like Gigabyte, MSI, Asus and plenty more. These guys will be showing off their latest GTX 1080 Ti graphics cards models, probably built into the most ridiculous PC builds you’ve ever seen. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang always makes an appearance early on Other themes Aside from the big consumer brands, Computex is marketing a few new themes this year. The most interesting are "AI & Robotics" and "Gaming & VR". Arguably, both were major themes last year – but I expect Computex will be highlighting more interesting companies this year. And, of course, there will be plenty of gaming PCs to see. See you in Taipei! Watch: Laptop buying guide What are you hoping to see at Computex 2017?

News World Americas US politics Michael Flynn may have turned on Donald Trump and become FBI informant, says security analyst The retired army general was forced to step down after it emerged he had spoken with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislak Peter Walker @petejohn_walker Monday 27 March 2017 14:37 BST Click to follow The Independent US Michael Flynn may have struck a 'deal', according to Juliette Kayyem AP/Carolyn Kaster Donald Trump's first choice for National Security Adviser may have turned on the US leader to become an FBI informant, a former Department of Homeland Security official has suggested.  Juliette Kayyem said her sources indicate that Michael Flynn has drifted into the shadows because he may “have a deal” with the Bureau. The retired US army lieutenant general stepped down in mid-February after it emerged he lied about his contact with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Read more Congress asks Trump for information on link between Russia and Flynn Ms Kayyem, currently an International Security lecturer at the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, was speaking as part of a six-way CNN conversation on the members of Mr Trump’s inner circle due to testify on Russia links to the House Intelligence Committee. FBI director James Comey, National Security Agency director Michael Rogers and former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort will give evidence, but there has been no mention of Mr Flynn. “It’s not that interesting to me because I don’t think they’ll be under oath,” said Ms Kayyem.“What is interesting, is the one name not mentioned is a name I mention often on this show: Mike Flynn, the former national security adviser. “It is starting to look like, from my sources and from open reporting, that Mike Flynn is the one who may have a deal with the FBI and that’s why we have not heard from him for some time.” General Flynn has not commented on the possibility of a deal.  Ms Kayyem later backtracked slightly and said on Facebook: "To be clear, I did not say on this segment that I have any confirmation that he is actually cooperating or that I have talked to anyone who does. My informed analysis of this case is based on my years of experience in the national security arena." But his spokesman has denied that he discussed the removal of Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen from the US with an extradition process. The exiled cleric faces attempted coup charges in his homeland. Donald Trump says 'the leaks are real, the news is fake' in response to Michael Flynn resignation James Woolsey Jr, a former CIA director, said the General Flynn met with senior representatives of President Recep Erdogan’s government in the run-up to the US election on behalf of his Flynn Intel Group. Mr Woolsey claimed he walked in on Mr Flynn and Turkish officials discussing the removal of Mr Gulen - a former ally and now rival of Turkey's President Recep Tayip Erdogan.  General Flynn's spokesman Price Floyd, however insisted: “No such discussion occurred." When asked by The Independent for comment, Price Floyd said: "No".
