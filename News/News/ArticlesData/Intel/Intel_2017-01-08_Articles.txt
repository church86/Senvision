According to Digital Trends, the company has spent four years in developing its Ryzen microprocessor. The new microprocessor has the same length of time that the company expect to have with its ongoing war with Intel in the PC processor space. The AMD's chief technology officer, Mark Papermaster has confirmed the four-year lifespan of the microprocessor at CES 2017 in Las Vegas. The technology officer said that the Ryzen represents an improvement compared to AMD's previous architecture. Advertisement The previous architecture known as Excavator contains a new Zen chip that offers a full 40 percent improvement. The improvement is more significant compared to Intel's improvement in the current generation of CPUs they have. Intel only focuses on smaller performance increase and better mobile battery life. According to the PC World, the said improvement is one of the important accomplishments for the AMD because it's going to last for four years. Jim Anderson, the senior vice president and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics business, said that the Ryzen chips would already be available from day one.  "We're not going to do a paper launch," he said, referring to a "launch" where customers have to wait weeks or months for the products actually to arrive. "We've done that before. We're not going to mess with it," Anderson said. The next step that the company is planning to do is to put Ryzen in the hands of customers and journalists. AMD has already set the stage for its customers by revealing a dozen of motherboards and 16 performance PCs which are committed to Ryzen. AMD also-also revealed that the Ryzen chips are all overclockable.

Five Of The Best New Phones On Show At CES 2017 We've spent the last week scouring the halls and show floors of the Consumer Electronics Show in gaudy Las Vegas, and we've found something worth writing home about. A few new smartphones big and small, expensive and inexpensive, and a few world firsts, were on display — and will be coming to Australia. Razer's insane three monitor laptop Razer showed off a lot of cool gadgets at CES, but the coolest was definitely its prototype of a gaming laptop with THREE 4K displays. That's right, this beastly laptop has three 17.3-inch displays pushing millions of pixels. It's one of the coolest things we've seen. Dubbed Project Valerie, the laptop is powered by an Intel Kaby Lake processor and Nvidia's 1080 graphics card. We just saw a prototype, but Razer says the final version will have the two side monitors slide out of the main monitor, for easy storage. If this thing does come to market — and that's a big if — prepare for it to be expensive. But price, weight and the fact that it will inevitably be hot enough to cook food doesn't even matter. It's a 12K gaming laptop. Hell yeah. Razer's futuristic Project Ariana Speaking of Razer, the gaming company's conceptual gaming projector promises to deliver VR-like experience without needing a VR headset. When pointed at the screen, Project Ariana's depth-sensing cameras can expand the edges of the TV onto the wall, making your game world more immersive. It can also work with the other lighting products in the room to alter colours across devices, so if a character goes into rage mode, not only does the screen go red, all the lights in your setup go red too. We won't see Project Ariana until at LEAST very late 2017, but if it can hit the market, it could be a cool alternative to VR headsets for gamers that want truly immersive experiences. Unfortunately, my Brooklyn living room isn't big enough for VR, let alone something like this, but I love it anyway. Super Game Boy is back The massive success of the NES Classic Edition proves that all of us ageing millennials are obsessed with classic gaming. And what gets more classic than Nintendo's original Game Boy? The team at Retro-Bit showed off a brand new, souped-up Game Boy that shares the same form-factor as the original, but packs in so much more. It will play original Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance cartridges. It also has a 10-hour battery life and a shatter-resistant display. The best part? This little guy is only $US80 ($109)! We can't wait to get our hands on one and relive playing the original Tetris, Super Mario Land 2 and Link's Awakening. Intel's VR Keynote Was Actually Pretty Cool Press conferences are typically a dull, boring affair filled with speeches. Until Intel took (mostly) everyone into a room at CES 2017 and told them to put on an Oculus Rift headset. I Took A Ride In Nvidia's Self-Driving Car (And Didn't Die) When I was a kid, self-driving cars were the sci-fi future. They were the stuff of Isaac Asimov's Sally and the Johnny Cab from Total Recall. I didn't actually think that they'd ever happen — the concept itself was a long way from reality, a lot more fi than sci. But smarter brains than mine, with the help of some surprisingly old-school tech, have built cars that can drive on everyday roads. B&O Play's M5 Is The Most Beautiful Wireless Speaker I've Ever Seen B&O Play is the Danish audio brand's more accessible, younger, funkier sibling, and it has a new wireless speaker to take on Sonos in your home. Design has always been a hallmark of Play and its much more distinguished older brother, and accordingly the new M5 is an utterly beautiful device — probably the most stylish I've ever seen. Gigabyte Has New Gaming Laptops Using Intel's Latest Chips It's CES, and every laptop manufacturer is taking the opportunity to refresh its product lines with Intel's latest seventh-gen Kaby Lake CPUs and Nvidia's Pascal GPUs — both of them much more efficient than their predecessors. That combo means gaming laptops that can actually game away from a power point, and Gigabyte's new machines are no different. LG's Newest OLED TV Is Another Small But Definite Improvement Amidst a swathe of competing high-end screens on show at CES this year, LG has another iteration on its flagship OLED TV. The 77-inch OLED TV W, which will be the first released into Australia under a new 'Signature' sub-brand, includes a bundled Dolby Atmos soundbar, supports all of a quickly growing list of HDR standards, and measures just 2.57mm thick. Nvidia Has Come A Long Way, From Gaming Graphics To Self-Driving AI Nvidia started out as a graphics card company. Nvidia basically invented the performance GPU. But Nvidia does a lot more than desktop graphics these days. VR, AR, mixed reality, self-driving and autonomous vehicles, deep learning neural networks — all these use technology that started out running the first 3D-accelerated PC games 20 years ago. Sony Has An OLED TV Too Now Step aside, LG. You're not the only player in the game with a perfect-black-level OLED television any more. Sony just announced a new OLED 4K TV at CES, and it ups the ante with a new, more powerful imaging processor and sound that comes from behind the screen rather than below it. This Weird-Ass Bed Will Roll You Over If You're Snoring Beds are beds, right? No. Beds are smart now. The newest in a long line of gadgets that we're not sure necessarily needed to have electronics integrated into them is a bed that can tell exactly how well you're sleeping, and then do a whole bunch of funky shit, including warming your feet, to make your life better. So Samsung Has A Gaming Laptop Now Not content with making every other technology product under the sun, Samsung now has a gaming laptop in its repertoire. It actually sounds pretty good on paper, too, if you want a powerful 15- or 17-inch machine that'll run double duty for workday tasks and casual PC gaming. NVIDIA's GeForce NOW Wouldn't Work For Australia In front of thousands, the pitch sounded good. Bring PC gaming to the hundreds of millions who can't, or haven't experienced it before. It's a sensible, reasonable goal for a publicly listed company like NVIDIA to aim at. And the idea of putting a gaming PC in the cloud has a certain logic to it. Problem is, we've been here before. It didn't work. And even if the streaming technology was sound, it still wouldn't work for Australians. Samsung's New Chromebooks Can Run Android Apps The biggest problem with Chromebooks was that they had no apps. Not really, anyway. Sure, there were a few decent ChromeOS apps, but it made no sense that they couldn't run the zillions of apps that Google's own Android mobile OS enjoyed. That problem is finally sorted. Watch The Faraday Future Reveal From CES Right Here Faraday Future's CES livestream revealed its flagship vehicle at 1pm today, and you can watch it all right here. Last year the start-up revealed an, er, interesting electric Batmobile concept, this year? On stage issues galore. Ouch. Samsung's Tough 2016 Hasn't Slowed Down A Torrent Of New Gadgets Samsung had a tough 2016, both in Australia and around the world. Most of that came from its difficult and ongoing Galaxy Note7 recall, but it's also facing renewed competition within the TV market — from LG's OLEDs and LCDs in particular — and across all different kinds of tech. But Samsung is one of the world's largest gadget brands, and it's gearing up for a big year. These Aussie-Made Wireless Earbuds Are A Cure For Pub Deafness Imagine a pair of completely wireless earbuds that can block out the ambient noise of crowds or busy offices or loud restaurants, but that still let you have a perfectly audible — amplified, in fact — conversation with the person in front of you. Think of a hearing aid, but that connects to your phone via Bluetooth, with dynamically adjustable noise cancellation and boosting. Think of Apple's AirPods, but on steroids. Samsung's Quantum Dot QLED TVs Want To Leave OLED For Dead If you're a big-name TV maker, 'LCD' is a dirty word. OLED is a different technology, but in recent generations LCD panels have been rebranded with modern monikers, from LED to ULED to Samsung's own SUHD. Now, Samsung has a new line of TVs it's calling QLED, with a quantum dot LED-backlit LCD panel that promises huge improvements to picture quality. LG's New Super UHD TVs Use 'Nano Cell' Tech For Better Colour CES is kicking off with its traditional showing of really fancy TVs. Combining all the good top-end stuff we're already used to like Dolby Vision HDR with new 'nano cell' tech that reportedly improves colour quality and viewing angles, LG's three newest Super UHD panels are the most advanced the company has produced — and promise the best ever picture quality from a LCD. TVs that seem to disappear  TVs are always a big draw at CES, and this year was no exception. Mercifully, the curved TV gimmick finally looks like it's on its way out. In the biggest trend to emerge, Sony, LG and Samsung all moved the core components of their flagship TV sets to outside hardware. In the case of Samsung, all of the ports and brains of its new models are housed in an outside box. Sony built the guts for its top TV into a subwoofer that doubles as a TV stand. But for my money, the most impressive TV was the new W7 from LG. This OLED TV is just 2.5mm thick — literally thinner than my finger. Everything that actually powers the TV is jammed into a futuristic-looking Dolby Atmos soundbar. I want it. LG also had a prototype OLED TV that is 40 per cent translucent. I'm not sure if I see the use case quite yet, but anything that brings us closer to Minority Report is good with me. Honda's self-balancing motorcycle Honda showed off its new Riding Assistant technology that keeps your bike balanced when it's moving at speeds less than 5km/h (like when you're pulling out of the garage or stopping at a traffic light). The tech will even work when the rider isn't on board, meaning you never have to worry about your bike falling over on its side ever again. This is still a concept, so we might never the tech in actual bikes, but it sure does look cool. LEGO's new robots LEGO has had robotic kits for years, but the problem is that the builds always involved a lot of work and some mild coding skills. Granted, it's a nice way to learn something new, but sometimes you just want to quickly build a robot buddy. With LEGO Boost, the lazy amongst us can finally build robotic toys. Using a companion app, you just drag and drop different actions to control the robot, rather than having to tediously code in commands. The kit comes with five different projects, including a cat, a robot, a guitar, a bulldozer and a LEGO stacking machine. Intel's Compute Card is so tiny A few years ago at CES, Intel introduced its Compute Stick, its tiny-arse computer that fits into something about the size of a Chromecast. Now Intel has something even tinier — and potentially more useful — its new Compute Card. The size and thickness of a few stacked credit cards, the Compute Card packs in a ton of power into the svelte package. You get a Kaby Lake processor, Wi-Fi, memory and storage. The idea is that you can then insert this card into a dumb monitor or other type of dock, and voila, instant computer system. Intel is hoping it can get a lot of manufacturers on board to support the Compute Card — think everything from kiosks, smart TVs and smart appliances. For TVs especially, this could provide a smart upgrade path for new kinds of apps and processes. Just swap your old Compute Card out with another. It will be a while before this hits the market. Intel's first partnership is with the Foxconn-owned Sharp, for giant displays at shopping centres and hotels. But maybe if we're lucky, one day we'll be able to just carry our computers with us in our wallets. Sony's crazy thin E Ink watch Despite being a pretty blah year for wearables — mostly because no one is buying smartwatches — Sony still showed an amazing concept for an E Ink smartwatch at CES. The concept, which was shown under glass, can change design and colour — meaning you can switch up your fashion statement depending on what you're wearing or your mood. Strikingly, the E Ink display is thinner than a credit card. If this thing ever does come to market, it might be Japanese only — but it's such a cool idea, we can't help but hope the tech makes its way into a proper product eventually.

Credit: Dell More like this Dell’s Latitude 7285 to be world’s first wireless charging 2-in-1 I don’t expect Energous wireless charging in iPhone 8 Cutting the cord: GM tests wireless car chargers for EVs, self-driving cars Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Back in 2014, Intel declared it wanted laptops to be free of wires, and a centerpiece of that plan was wireless charging. But the technology has been slow to mature, and it may be years before it takes off. At CES last week, Dell showed a wireless charging PC called the Latitude 7285, a 2-in-1 with a detachable screen attached to a keyboard base. It's the first wireless charging laptop based on the AirFuel Alliance's emerging wireless PC charging standard. But Dell doesn't have widespread plans to put wireless charging in a host of new devices. That's partly because the technology, with slow charging speeds, is limited to low-power devices and isn't mature enough to replace wired charging. The wireless charging Latitude 7285 has a low-power Intel Kaby Lake chip that draws just 4.5 watts of power. Wireless charging in the Latitude 7285 is an optional feature, and wired charging can be done through a USB-C port. For wireless charging, a specialized keyboard dock can be attached to a wireless charging mat. It's similar to the way smartphones are charged today, except the Latitude 7285 is a much larger device with a 12.3-inch screen. The Latitude 7285 will be available in June with prices starting at about $1,099, and the wireless charging mat and keyboard will cost extra. For Dell, the Latitude 7285 is a pilot device that will give the company an idea of how customers respond to wireless PC charging, and if there's a real need for it. Wireless charging hasn't set the mobile device world on fire. There are questions about whether people need it for laptops. Dell hopes to answer those questions with the Latitude 7285. The usability of wireless charging will depend on charge time and user convenience, said Shannon MacKay, marketing director for Latitude at Dell. The wireless charging will be powerful enough for on-the-go charges and fueling up between meetings, Mackay said. Dell hasn't benchmarked how long it takes to fully charge a battery, but it isn't as fast as wired charging. "It would never work on an Alienware [gaming laptop] today," Mackay said. "You're going to see us play in the low-wattage processor space to get that started." Mackay said mainstream laptops with wireless charging could be a year-and-a-half to two years away. Dell's decision to bring wireless charging to more laptops will mostly depend on usability, charging times, and battery types. The Latitude 7285 can be ordered without a wireless charging keyboard base. It supports up to 512GB of solid-state drive storage. It also has two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 3 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. With the keyboard base, the device can provide up to 15 hours of battery life. It hasn't been smooth sailing for wireless PC charging. Intel had earlier taken the lead on establishing the wireless PC charging ecosystem. But the company scaled back efforts after laying off 12,000 people last year and restructuring operations to focus more on servers, internet of things, automotive tech, and other areas. Intel was also leading an effort by AirFuel Alliance to establish the Resonant standard for wireless PC charging. AirFuel last November reconstituted a PC Task Force to drive adoption of wireless charging in PCs, with partners including Dell, Lenovo, and STMicroelectronics. Intel also took on the job of trying to convince airports, cafes, and other locations to install wireless charging stands for laptops. But the efforts have not yet shown any tangible results.

(AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead AMD stock has turnaround potential, but not much else By Ryan Fuhrmann, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 9, 2017, 10:20 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead 10 Best Stocks for Retirement Investors Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead Recent Posts: Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a “Hold” at Best Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has a Rocky Road Ahead Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is a Zombie, But the Cure Is Coming View All Posts Back in 2011, semiconductor chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NYSE:AMD) generated about $100 million in free cash flow. Since then, it has bled cash. On an earnings basis, AMD stock was also last profitable in 2011. Those are two pretty long dry spells. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Sales also haven’t moved much for the better part of a decade. In addition, Advanced Micro Devices has a fair amount of debt (around $2 billion), and has accumulated $7.3 billion in deficits on the balance sheet. This indicates it hasn’t generated a cumulative positive return for AMD stock owners since it was founded in 1969. The profit outlook for Advanced Micro Devices is pretty grim. Analysts are projecting a loss of 23 cents per share for the company’s full year (AMD reports its fourth quarter on Jan. 17). But 2017 could see a return to profitability, as analysts expect 6 cents in earnings for the year. A recent investor presentation on AMD’s website does tout that the company is a leader in “visual” computing that includes gaming, artificial intelligence and virtual/augmented reality. It is a claim-to-fame that resembles why rival Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is popular among investors right now. I recently covered why Nvidia’s stock has been on fire. NVDA also sells chips that power the gaming and AI space, but also data centers. The greatest hype surrounds its autonomous car initiative, including the Nvidia Drive PX 2 in Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) autos. 10 of the Worst Values on Wall Street The upside for AMD is that it also operates in growing areas of the market. It has sold chips to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) for its Xbox and Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) for its PlayStation, but is well behind Nvidia in gaming. Advanced Micro Devices Lags Intel Badly Advanced Micro Devices says it is also a “strong No.2 in computing”, but has struggled for years to successfully compete against industry titan Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel is expected to report sales of around $59 billion this year. AMD stock will log just over $4 billion in sales, making it about 7% the size of Intel. Advanced Micro Devices has lagged Intel for years now. The race was much closer around 2000, but Intel has moved forward and AMD stock has not. Obviously, Intel is much larger and can easily outspend Advanced Micro Devices in research and development. Last year, Intel invested $12.1 billion in R&D, qualifying it as one of the largest spenders on R&D in the world. AMD spent less than $1 billion, and its annual R&D spend has fallen in recent years. Advanced Micro Devices is said to be at least a couple of years behind Intel in terms of technology.  AMD is just rolling out 14-nanometer chips while Intel has had the technology for a couple of years now. Advanced Micro Devices also doesn’t have the strength to produce its own chips any longer. Instead, it has to pay outside parties to do so, which increases costs. The market share differential says it all. Intel’s computing market share is nearly 88%, while AMD’s is only 12%. Intel has also been increasing its share recently.

But the technology has been slow to mature, and it may be years before it takes off. At CES last week, Dell showed a wireless charging PC called the Latitude 7285, a 2-in-1 with a detachable screen attached to a keyboard base. It's the first wireless charging laptop based on the AirFuel Alliance's emerging wireless PC charging standard. But Dell doesn't have widespread plans to put wireless charging in a host of new devices. That's partly because the technology, with slow charging speeds, is limited to low-power devices and isn't mature enough to replace wired charging. The wireless charging Latitude 7285 has a low-power Intel Kaby Lake chip that draws just 4.5 watts of power. Wireless charging in the Latitude 7285 is an optional feature, and wired charging can be done through a USB-C port. For wireless charging, a specialized keyboard dock can be attached to a wireless charging mat. It's similar to the way smartphones are charged today, except the Latitude 7285 is a much larger device with a 12.3-inch screen. The Latitude 7285 will available in June with prices starting at about US $1,099, and the wireless charging mat and keyboard will cost extra. For Dell, the Latitude 7285 is a pilot device that will give the company an idea of how customers respond to wireless PC charging, and if there's a real need for it. Wireless charging hasn't set the mobile device world on fire. There are questions about whether people need it for laptops. Dell hopes to answer those questions with the Latitude 7285. The usability of wireless charging will depend on charge time and user convenience, said Shannon MacKay, marketing director for Latitude at Dell. The wireless charging will be powerful enough for on-the-go charges and fueling up between meetings, Mackay said. Dell hasn't benchmarked how long it takes to fully charge a battery, but it isn't as fast as wired charging. "It would never work on an Alienware [gaming laptop] today," Mackay said.

Trump relied heavily on Kushner's advice during the campaign, and his move to the White House was expected. But ethics experts have raised questions about whether Kushner's role in the new administration will run up against a federal anti-nepotism law and how he will separate himself from his real estate business to avoid conflicts of interest. His appointment is expected to be formally announced later this week.

Trump relied heavily on Kushner's advice during the campaign, and his move to the White House was expected. But ethics experts have raised questions about whether Kushner's role in the new administration will run up against a federal anti-nepotism law and how he will separate himself from his real estate business to avoid conflicts of interest. His appointment is expected to be formally announced later this week.

Gallery: the weird and wonderful gadgets unveiled at CES 2017 Gallery: the weird and wonderful gadgets unveiled at CES 2017 CES 2017 56 items 08 Jan 2017 ADVERTISEMENT The chipmaker's Project Alloy was unveiled in 2016, but since its first demo it has been refined and the headset is set to be turned into a product by other companies before the end of this year. At CES 2017, the firm went big on its VR technologies - showing journalists applications that broadcast live 360-degree footage - and included tests of Alloy. WIRED tried the firm's hardware for size. Read more This car headrest monitors your brain waves to stop you falling asleep at the wheel This car headrest monitors your brain waves to stop you falling asleep at the wheel By Matt Burgess The first completely noticeable thing about Intel's developmental headset is the wires. Or, to be precise, the lack of them. Unlike other forms of high-end VR (Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive) the unit is self-contained: the battery, sensors, screen and more is all within the headset and allows complete freedom of movement around a room. It is closer to Microsoft's HoloLens than traditional VR sets. To wear, the headset is comfortable and doesn't feel heavy on the head or neck, although the test was only five minutes and a prolonged use may end-up with different results. Intel staff demonstrate Alloy at CES Intel By scanning Intel's testing room with its real-sense technology (a depth sensor and array of cameras) the company is able to change the physical environment around you into a digital one. When Alloy was set-up, the mock living room buried within the Las Vegas convention centre became a gaming environment. ADVERTISEMENT Read more Death to the dashboard: AR windscreens in cars could make driving safer and easier Death to the dashboard: AR windscreens in cars could make driving safer and easier By Matt Burgess Inside the headset, the scenario presented by Intel was a game where you are placed on a spaceship and face incoming aliens. Waves of floating machines fly towards the player and using a handheld controller – created by a third party manufacturer – WIRED had to point and fire a gun, while trying to avoid incoming shots. The in-game view, when played with two players Intel Real-world objects become digital. For instance, the couch and coffee table within the room were turned into physical objects on the spacecraft you are transported to. The idea behind this, and the entire premise of Alloy, is to allow someone to 'merge' their world and still be able to walk and move around while wearing a VR headset. WIRED managed to bump into the physical table several times while trying to shoot aliens in the digital world. But the technology works. ADVERTISEMENT Read more Dog voices, binge eating: Podcast 300 Dog voices, binge eating: Podcast 300 By WIRED It was completely possible to move around the room, walking from one wall to another and avoiding in-game objects that in reality are obstacles. After watching multiple videos of people falling over in VR after becoming too immersed, WIRED's first steps were extremely tentative (almost a shuffle). The Project Alloy headset turns physical spaces into digital worlds Intel Once acclimatised to the merged realities, also with repeated encouragement from Intel staff, it was possible to move around the room at an almost walking pace. The company's spokespeople encouraged faster movements and ducking behind the coffee table. ADVERTISEMENT There were some laggy glitches with the headset when we tried the headset, although Intel staff put this down to a the Wi-Fi within the heavily populated CES conference centre. Moving the controller, which was a gun in the game, was not quite as smooth as it could have been and (as with many VR headsets) the screen resolution could be higher. Intel staff said the device, currently in its first generation, has a battery life of 30 minutes but it hopes to treble this when production ready. WIRED Overall, the gameplay is immersive. WIRED managed to become engrossed in the game and the gaming world was plausible. As with other VR experiences, this is not enough to make you truly believe you're on a spaceship. But being able to move around the room does show promise. Being able to walk within VR is more satisfying than pressing a button on a controller and the system gives a possible glimpse of VR's future. There's still a lot of unknowns about Intel's VR efforts though. The firm isn't making the headsets itself but is licensing them and the technologies to third party companies, who will manufacture and sell their own products. This leaves questions about the price, how it will stack-up against competitors, and who will make software that is immersive. Whatever happens, Intel has developed technologies other VR providers haven't yet made, giving them a possible advantage.

One of the things that made it so fascinating was that everyone and their brother had cars demonstrating one form of technology or another. It kind of makes me wonder what we'll see at the next car show -- PCs, drones, tablets and smartphones? That wasn't the only surprise at the show, though. Nvidia, long thought of as living in Intel's shadow, broke out, taking over the prime keynote spot in a big way and demonstrating that it has all but cornered the market for car brains. I'll close with my product of the week, the most important product at CES. Dell Embarrasses Apple Apple for decades has rubbed Dell's face in the fact that it builds a better creative set of products. When Apple launched the iPhone, it embarrassed all of CES by pulling virtually all attention away from the show. Well, this year, Dell got even. Dell formally launched two products, the XPS 27 and the Dell Canvas 27, which together make the iMac look like last decade's solution. Which it kind of is if you think about it. Dell got there by bringing in a bunch of artists to help define the products. Animators, musicians and engineers worked together to create their dream tool, basically a touchscreen all-in-one with studio monitor speakers, incredible performance, and a touchscreen work surface that can transform into any digital interface the job requires. This interface can represent everything from digital musical instruments to an animator's canvas and digital ink. It can be pretty much anything the user or an application developer could imagine. The CEO of Avid, along with an animator and a number of musicians, raved about the product at CES, and it made the latest iMac look pitiful in head-to-head comparisons. Now that's revenge served cold. Nvidia Steps Into the Lead Nvidia is now the fastest-growing company in the fortune 500, according to the head of CES, who opened for Nvidia CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang. I don't think many understand how amazing this is. Nvidia has long been viewed as a small player when compared to Intel. Like all of the PC companies, Nvidia bet heavy on mobile and lost badly. After its Tegra mobile platform seemed to crash and burn, many thought Nvidia was done. Then it pivoted like I've never seen a company pivot before. It doubled down on graphics, pushed hard on gaming, and made huge bets on deep learning and artificial intelligence -- and you know what? Those bets paid off -- oh man, did they ever pay off -- and now Nvidia pretty much has the market cornered for self-driving cars, and it supplies a critical part of the deep learning solutions of every major IT vendor. You have to admit that is pretty impressive. Corning's Glass Car One of the most impressive marketing efforts I've ever seen is Corning's "A Day Made Of Glass." It is visionary, and it not only makes you believe in a future with tons of touchscreens and smart windows, but also makes you want to live in that future. Well, Corning pulled out all the stops at CES and commissioned a car with displays all across the dash, in the steering wheel, in the doors, and even replacing the license plate. It is actually a pretty decent car -- racy, electric, and apparently very fast. Sadly, I didn't get to drive it. The Gorilla Glass Windshield is one of the most interesting parts. It not only resists nicks and scratches, as you'd expect, but it is substantially lighter, far clearer, faster to defrost, and works better with heads-up displays. Even the roof is glass -- smart glass, in this case -- that can be electronically shaded. The display license plate makes sense, given that it would be digitally connected to the car, arguably more secure, and could be used to broadcast a signal in the event of a stolen car or driver in distress. Panasonic's Robot Family It never really occurred to me that a true home robot solution would require a family of robots, each with different skills to complete tasks around the house. A small robot to greet you at the door and patrol the home protecting it from bandits could be supplemented by larger robots that could clean and maintain the home. That approach would be far better than trying to build a single robot to do everything, which is often the science fiction solution. The idea of a family of robots, each specialized to do a series of tasks, just makes more sense -- and you have to admit that living with a robot family just seems kind of cool. Given that one of the robots likely would be your autonomous car, the biggest robot could be impressively large. I should add that Panasonic showcased its idea of an autonomous car, and it was more like a rolling sitting room, with tables and chairs. If you don't have to drive, there are likely a lot of other things you'd want to do during that time. AMD's Ryzen and the Power of the Desktop CES marked the coming-out party for AMD's latest processor, now named "Ryzen." The company showcased some of the coolest PCs I've ever seen at its cocktail party, and I honestly had lust in my heart for a large number of them. Most of the PCs on display were water cooled, with water blocks for the major components. Some even had coolant that looked like blood. I thought I'd entered techno geek heaven, and it was hard not to drool every time I turned around. AMD is another company that is firing on all cylinders. Expect to see some amazing hardware when these PCs hit the market in a few months. Wrapping Up I'm writing this after midnight on my last day at the show. I'm beat, but I'm also kind of excited about the future. These products all promise a future when our homes will do much of the work, when we won't care much about traffic because we are being entertained or sleeping and not driving, and when company turnarounds actually work. CES promises that this future not only will be amazing, but also will arrive far sooner than most expect -- and I think that is very cool. The product that most stood out for me at CES is Norton Core, a router and security solution from Symantec. You see, with all of this connected and ever-smarter stuff, we really, really need to be secure -- and our home networks are anything but. What makes the Norton Core router special is that it secures not only against outside attacks, but also against inside attacks, and it is part of an overall solution in the home. It's an overall solution because it is packaged with a subscription that contains 20 licenses for security software for your PCs, smartphones and tablets. Because it uses Qualcomm's latest technology, it's not only a strong security solution, but also is likely one of the highest-performing routers. It will be upgradable to support a mesh network, allowing you to cover even the biggest home with WiFi. It is even pretty cool to look at, bringing back the geodesic dome and placing a halo light at the bottom for effect, so you can feel good about putting it in the open. With all of this connected stuff, we desperately need a better home security solution. With Symantec's Norton Core, we get one -- and thus it is my product of the week.

The information comes from the Dutch website Hardware.info who confirmed the information with Intel. (Image credit: Hardware.info and users  Sw333t and J_C_W) Intel’s website states that the Pentium G4560, G4560T, G4600, G4600T and G4620 will all support Hyper Threading. Previous Pentium chips normally  featured a maximum of two cores and two threads with the exception of a special model that was on the market a couple of years ago. With the addition of Hyper Threading the Pentium CPU have become pretty similar to Core i3 CPUs. According to Hardware.info the major difference is now the support of the Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2) instruction set which becomes clear by comparing the CPUs on Intel’s website. When comparing the Core i3 7300T and Pentium G4560, which both run at 3.50 Ghz,  the main differences appear to be the cache of respectively 4MB and 3MB, the TDP of respectively 35W and 54W and indeed the support of AVX2. But the major difference is the price, the Pentium has a MSRP of $64, while the Core i3 has a MSRP range of 138.00 – $147.00. The AVX2 instruction set that is missing on the Pentium CPUs was introduced with Haswell and should optimize the performance of floating point operations. AVX2 is mainly an advantage for high intensity database and video processing. The information was confirmed by Intel’s chat support.

Now we're right at the beginning of 2017 and Intel has only just launched its seventh-generation Kaby Lake CPUs on the new 200-series Z270 chipset, leading many to believe Cannon Lake would be pushed into 2018--but Intel has set the record straight.   At CES 2017 Intel CEO Brian Krzanich demoed a prototype 2-in-1 device running an eight-gen 10nm Cannon Lake CPU that displayed a promo video. "For those who are wondering if Moore's Law is alive, if 10 nanometers going to be here, the answer is absolutely yes," Krzanich said on stage.   Expect to see 10nm Cannon Lake CPUs shipping in late 2017, bringing reduced power consumption and heat and boosted performance to smaller mobile devices and notebooks.   NEWS SOURCES:Hexus.net, Theinquirer.net Recommended for You AMD's 4-core Ryzen CPUs ready to take on Core i3/i5...

Instead of fixing the problem and re-releasing it, Intel decided that they were done with it and announced that they would be shutting down Peak’s software support, which seemed to suggest that the company was done with Basis. Recently at CES 2017, Engadget’s Daniel Cooper managed to sit down and talk with Dr. Jerry Bautista, the VP of Intel’s wearables division. According to Engadget’s report, it seemed that Intel could be done releasing their own wearables in the future, or at least that’s the feeling they got from the interview. In particular it seemed that Bautista’s response to Intel pursuing partnerships in favor of making their own wearables was what led to the conclusion. According to Bautista, the idea behind the partnerships is to allow Intel to address various parts of the market that they might not be able to do by themselves, like teaming up with TAG Heuer to target the luxury watch market, or New Balance where they get to target the sporting sector. While Bautista never outright said that Basis was dead, the fact that partnerships seem to be Intel’s new focus, we guess if you’re hoping for new Basis products in the near future, maybe you shouldn’t hold your breath.

Monday 16 Jan 2017 / Tehran - 07:02 / GMT - 03:32 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Mon Jan 09, 2017 1:15 AMD: Zen CPU Architecture Expected to Last Four Years Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- AMD spent four years developing its Ryzen microprocessor, and that’s the same length of time the company expects it to live on in its ongoing war with Intel in the PC processor space. Mark Papermaster, AMD’s chief technology officer, confirmed the four-year lifespan in a conversation here at CES 2017 in Las Vegas, though he declined to discuss specifics. AMD’s Ryzen—the CPU brand which is the public face of its Zen chip architecture—enters at a particularly serendipitous time. Rival Intel just released its mainstream quad-core Kaby Lake microprocessors, and the chips have met with mixed reviews from the tech press. In part, that’s because Intel’s famous “tick-tock” manufacturing model stuttered, resulting in a third 14nm chip, Kaby Lake, instead of the previously expected two.  AMD, meanwhile, has worked hard developing a fresh approach, aiming and apparently hitting a 40 percent performance improvement target over its previous chip architecture, Excavator.  The combination of a relatively mild Intel launch and a radical new architecture has AMD executives and enthusiasts buzzing about true competition in the PC processor market for the first time in years. With everything riding on Ryzen’s launch, AMD isn’t taking chances. Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s Computing and Graphics business, told PCWorld that Ryzen chips will be available from day one. “We’re not going to do a paper launch,” he said, referring to a “launch” where customers have to wait weeks or months for the products to actually arrive. “We’ve done that before. We’re not going to mess with it.” Zen to live on While Anderson’s responsible for bringing Ryzen to market—“you don’t have any idea how many hours I and my team have spent on this,” Anderson said—it’s Papermaster who has to think of the future. When asked how long Zen would last, compared to Intel’s two-year tick-tock cadence, Papermaster confirmed the four-year lifespan and tapped the table in front of him: “We’re not going tick-tock,” he said. “Zen is going to be tock, tock, tock.” Intel’s tick-tock cadence has typically meant that it develops a new microarchitecture every two years, with Kaby Lake the exception. Though AMD has never taken the time to formalize it, a three- to four-year lifespan for its own CPU architectures is about average. For example, the K8 series architecture debuted with the Opteron and Athlon 64 in 2003; with 2007’s mobile Sempron, the K8 trickled out. The K10 series lasted from about 2007 through 2010. AMD’s last Bulldozer architecture debuted in 2011 and persisted through the Piledriver, Steamroller, and Excavator updates. If Papermaster’s words are to be taken literally, it seems AMD plans to iteratively improve its Ryzen chips through an additional three generations, about one per year. What those improvements will be, of course, is anyone’s guess. But Papermaster said he’s a believer in architecture improvements that go beyond simple manufacturing, something he’s previously referred to as “Moore’s Law Plus.” One of the things AMD has tried to do with the Zen architecture is “go wide,” increasing the number of instructions that the chip can process, and Zen uses predictive tables and machine learning to improve its ability to ask and process data before it’s actually needed, known as branch prediction.  Operationally, though, the next step is putting Ryzen in the hands of journalists and customers. AMD’s already set the stage for the latter, revealing over a dozen motherboards and 16 performance PCs already committed to Ryzen. The company has also revealed that every Ryzen chip will be overclockable. On the horizon, of course, lurks Intel’s 10nm Cannon Lake, most likely due this fall, and the still somewhat mysterious Optane technology. That’s of little concern at AMD, though. For now, the company’s focused on releasing Ryzen, and it’s full speed ahead.         LATEST STORIES (8) Bahrain: Protests Erupt after 3 Shiite Men Executed Syrian Army Repels ISIL's Massive Attack on Gov't Positions in Deir Ezzur City Week of Protests Kicks off with Rallies in DC, Chicago, California Libyan National Army's Fight against ISIL in Benghazi Syria: Buses Arrive to Evacuate Civilians and Militants from Wadi Bardi Syria: Aleppo's Famous Bazaar Reopens after Two Years of Closure Iranians Pay Tribute to Late Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani Bahrainis Simmering with Anger over Death Verdicts A Timeless American Tradition: Trump, Syria, and Giving in to Flinching Senior MP Renews Iran's Support for Political Solution to Iraq's Problems Iranian Speaker's Advisor Blasts Bahraini Regime for Executing Youth France Warns US about Serious Consequences over Embassy Relocation Senior Taliban Commander among 21 Killed in Security Operations across Afghanistan Eastern Ghouta: Syrian Army Tightens Up Grip on Terrorists in Wadi Al-Bardi, Recaptures Key Height Local Germans Want US Tanks to 'Get Out' Bahrain: Protests Erupt after 3 Shiite Men Executed TEHRAN (FNA)- Clashes erupted between police and protesters in Sanabis, Sunday, after news broke that Bahrain had executed three anti-regime activists who were convicted over their alleged role in a 2014 bomb attack.

He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

Quotes in the article Intel Corp INTC ▲ 36.79 +0.08 +0.22% And he made an error that almost got him fired. "I wiped out the output of an entire factory for a week," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told Fortt Knox podcast in an interview. "I'm lucky to be employed at Intel, sometimes I say." Instead of dooming him, his handling of the problem influenced the company culture, helping to birth a system called "Copy Exactly" that's become part of its identity. Krzanich went on to make a name for himself as the executive responsible for all of Intel's factories, a job that prepared him to be CEO. It happened in the 1990s; Krzanich was in his early 30s. At the time, Intel was just beginning to hit its stride with a strategy that would make it the world's top supplier of chips for personal computers. His job was to transfer the chip manufacturing process from one facility in New Mexico to the one next door. It didn't work. Production ground to a halt. And for an agonizingly long time, he had no idea why. "It went all the way up to the CEO. And my boss at one point walked into my office and said, 'You have about two more weeks to figure out this issue, and if you don't, I've got to let you go,'" Krzanich recalled. "And luckily, a friend of mine and I, we said we're just not going to sleep until we solve this. And then, sure enough, we found the problem about a week into that two week time period." What sets Krzanich apart as a leader isn't just the way he rallied in a situation like this, though his conversation with Fortt Knox did unearth some gems that should help anyone navigate a career crisis. What sets him apart is the no-frills approach he brings to his work, and the adaptability that has allowed him to push his career – and now, Intel itself – in unexpected directions. Here are just a few of the concepts explored in a fascinating episode of Fortt Knox: © Provided by CNBC Krzanich grew up in San Jose, California, just miles from Intel headquarters. He didn't go to an Ivy League school: He got his bachelor's degree in Chemistry from San Jose State University. The prestige of a college's brand on a résumé doesn't impress him. "I've told my daughters this; my older daughter's about to go into college. It doesn't matter what college you go to. The thing that was great about San Jose State was, I got connected with some very good professors," he said. He did research for their projects on the side. "When I went into interviews, I could talk about real work that I'd done, not just textbook stuff," Krzanich added. That informs how he deals with job candidates today. "I ask real simple questions that just tell me, does this person know how to think?" © Provided by CNBC Krzanich had some more advice. "The other thing I tell my daughters is, I've had to terminate or fire more people for being difficult to work with than being dumb." That said, former CEOs of Intel haven't exactly distinguished themselves by being easy to work with—the legendary Andy Grove comes to mind. So what does he mean? "I think if you don't give people the tools and the expectations for success, and yet hold them to some value, then you're difficult to work with. I think the one thing about Andy was, if you listened to him, if you tried to understand him, then you actually understood what the expectations were," the CEO said. "They may be hard, and you may not have been able to do it, but you at least had a chance. The difficult bosses – the ones that have been hard for me to work for – have been the ones where, I never knew what success meant," Krzanich added. In other words, it's okay to challenge your team. But it's also important to recognize the value of their different perspectives, give them the tools, and clearly define success. In the show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," contestants can solve difficult problems by asking the audience, or phoning a friend. Moments in Krzanich's career are reminiscent of that. A friend helped him solve the early puzzle that had brought production to a halt. And when Intel began searching for a new CEO about four years ago, he took an unorthodox approach to competing for it: He teamed up with another Intel executive and presented to the board together. The board ended up naming him CEO, and his teammate president—the number two position. "It was more important to me that it was an insider, because I felt like anybody from the outside would slow the company down," Krzanich said. "Even if they were better, it would take them two years to learn how Intel works and to figure out how to make Moore's Law happen." The CEO "was willing to do whatever it took to have an insider, even if that wasn't me, or if it was a group of us, I was going to figure out a way .... By partnering up, I figured that was our best chance. Two of us could beat one outsider." Fortt Knox is a weekly podcast from CNBC anchor Jon Fortt.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing AMD declares Ryzen will be a four-year architecture, details overclocking plans, emphasizes hard launch AMD declares Ryzen will be a four-year architecture, details overclocking plans, emphasizes hard launch By Joel Hruska on January 6, 2017 at 5:08 pm Comment AMD released some additional information about its upcoming Ryzen chips at CES this week. Having spent over four years designing the architecture, the company plans to keep it around for at least that long. That’s according to CTO Mark Papermaster, who was on-hand to discuss the chip. First things first — AMD is promising a hard launch for Ryzen, without any paper launches, limited availability, or limited product introductions. When Zen debuts it’ll debut in multiple (still unknown) configurations, not a single eight-core part. As PCWorld details, Papermaster also confirmed the four-year target and emphasized that it didn’t mean AMD wouldn’t iterate the core. “We’re not going tick-tock,” Papermaster said. “Zen is going to be tock, tock, tock.” There are several ways to read this sentence. Tick-tock refers to Intel’s previous practice of introducing new CPU architectures in one product cycle and new manufacturing nodes in the other. AMD has never strictly deployed an equivalent approach over multiple product cycles. I wouldn’t necessarily conclude that Papermaster is saying AMD won’t deploy Zen on new manufacturing nodes over time, but that AMD intends to implement an aggressive series of tweaks and improvements to the current core as time goes by. There’s a significant lag between when a design tapes out and when it ships to consumers. This means AMD’s CPU design team is almost certainly hard at work on Zen’s successor already, even though Zen hasn’t actually shipped yet. While I can’t make any concrete predictions about how Zen will compete against specific products in Intel’s lineup, the demos we’ve seen and the product information already available has convinced me that Ryzen will be at least a meaningful and significant improvement on AMD’s overall power efficiency, performance, and performance-per-watt. With Intel’s CPU performance largely stuck and performance gains relegated to single-digit increases year-on-year, there’s a great deal of excitement for Ryzen. Even if it doesn’t seize the pole position from every price point, there’s pent-up demand for strong parts at good pricing. AMD wants to capitalize on that, and the best way to do so is to keep delivering core improvements year-over-year. I think we can reasonably look forward to that. The first Ryzen APUs are probably going to be DDR4-based, but there’s no reason for AMD not to push into HBM2 as that standard becomes more affordable. Power consumption and efficiency will continue to be important targets in years to come because AMD is unlikely to match Intel clock-for-clock and core-for-core with its very first launch. Ryzen is the beginning of AMD’s comeback, not the end of it, and setting a four-year target for the architecture now makes sense. It also gives AMD time to think about what it wants to come next. Intel’s Kaby Lake debut this week didn’t do much to excite the enthusiast community, but we’ll have a much better sense of how the two chips compare once we get a little closer to Ryzen’s still-unspecified (Q1) launch date. Overclocking features, Crossfire Meanwhile, PCWorld’s Brad Chacos reports on some interesting news on the overclocking front. All AMD Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked and overclockable, but only three motherboard chipsets — X370, X300, and B350 will have overclocking support. If current rumors are accurate, that corresponds to the upcoming enthusiast-class chipset (X370), mainstream (X300), and small form factor (X300) chipsets. That’s most of the chipsets AMD is launching (most of the non-budget ones, at least) and should cover virtually the entire overclocking market. AMD motherboards have historically been cheaper than their Intel counterparts, so this shouldn’t be a major issue. Crossfire and SLI support will only be implemented on the X370, however. According to AMD, the relative handful of people who use multi-GPUs always use higher-end motherboards. Practically, this makes sense, since most people can’t afford or don’t want a second card, and if you do want one, you can probably afford a slightly more expensive motherboard. Given the typical price gap between AMD and Intel we don’t see this being a major issue, either.

Until Intel took (mostly) everyone into a room at CES 2017 and told them to put on an Oculus Rift headset. The virtual reality keynote was an opportunity for Intel to showcase three areas they expect virtual reality to become increasingly prevalent: sports and live entertainment, tourism and, of course, video games. And that meant telling everyone - or at least the press and industry folk who lined up early enough to get inside the conference - to pop on the Oculus Rift in front of them. As far as Intel is concerned, VR can play a major factor in three things: travel, work and play. The travel pitch was pretty simple: imagine you could look and move around your next holiday spot, the hotel room you're going to book, the monument you'd like to go visit. So to demonstrate, Intel fired up a VR experience of flying over the desert, complete with jumping out of a helicopter while wearing a wingsuit. The people in the conference weren't wearing wingsuits, but it was pretty good to see a few queasy reactions. The next part required the co-founder of Hype VR, Ted Schilowitz. While video has enjoyed jumps in fidelity, resolution and quality over the years, it's still predominantly a moving image shot from a single camera, a single perspective. Hype VR and Intel's answer was a high-def video from a Waterfall in Vietnam, viewed through the Rift. The kicker with Hype VR's technology was the ability to move around the physical space in the video, without distorting the perspective or point of view. That theme revolved throughout the conference: being able to control the perspective, to become the cameraman. Perhaps the strongest theme of the keynote was Intel's alignment with real-world sports, both through a deal with La Liga to introduce their 360-degree video technology to three stadiums, and a live broadcast of a college basketball match. The trick with the live basketball match in VR was the ability to look around and choose different camera perspectives. It wasn't a free-roaming camera like one would hope, and when Intel first cut to the game it was half-time (leaving viewers with bugger all to see beyond warmups). The live feed - which took about 40 seconds to beam simultaneously to all the headsets in the conference - was truly live courtesy of a platform called Voke. Voke's currently available for the Samsung Gear VR, and is scheduled for release for the Oculus Rift at the end of the year. Krzanich added that the content available won't just be limited to sports, but music and other forms of live entertainment as well. It's hard not to see it as a future route for pay-per-view content, especially when broadcasters have the ability to overlay statistics and information throughout. As far as work is concerned, Krzanich pitched the idea that virtual reality could be a way to reduce the danger associated with hazardous jobs. Intel then streamed 4K, 360-degree live video from a drone inspecting solar panels, a job that would typically be done by a human. While it wasn't the smoothest feed, it was also pretty functional. The idea is that VR could be used in these situations to scope out hazardous work, or for use in search and rescue missions where conditions make it too problematic for a helicopter and crew to investigate. Intel also showed off the work they've been doing on Project Alloy, their open-source HMD first announced at the Intel Developers Conference last year. All of the sensors and processing power is done in the headset itself, using Intel's RealSense technology and a Kaby Lake Core i7 CPU. There's no word on how it matches up to a Rift or Vive that relies on far beefier hardware - but Intel said they would begin productising Project Alloy by the end of the year. Image: Twitter (@intel) Apart from the promise of a VR headset that doesn't have wires and is hooked into something with more processing power than your smartphone, Intel also pulled off a neat trick with "mixed reality". It's basically a fancy term for scanning the space around you and incorporating that into the environment into the headset, which gets around VR's current problem of not having enough space in your living room to move around. As an example, the stage opened up and showcased two people wearing Alloy prototypes in a faux living room. The couches were transformed into bunkers that could be used for cover in-game, which is wonderful encouragement to leave large objects lying around every now and again. Nobody in the crowd got to get hands-on with Project Alloy, but that was besides the point. The demo, much like the whole keynote, showcased ways in which VR might actually have a role in our day to day lives. The technology behind VR has come an awful long way. But from a gaming perspective, developers are very much still figuring things out. Many titles are little more than short experiences, rail shooters and short experiments lasting no more than a few hours at most. It's still very disposable. But being able to watch live sport, or a concert, or the live feed of a drone, isn't. It's something we already do every day, and will continue to do going forward. The conference helped give VR a place in our lives that made sense, and that was the cool part. The technology is almost there, but what we don't have yet is purpose. It probably still won't happen by the time 2017 comes to a close, especially when you factor in the capabilities of Australian internet. But it's not far off. The author travelled to CES 2017 as a guest of CORSAIR. Comments pooh_bear @pooh_bear Jan 10, 2017, 9:03am Im looking forward to VR becoming a more mature product. Had a go of a friends rift with assetto corsa the car racing game and while it is incredible the resolution at distance was still a bit of a problem that slighty tarnished the experience. when they reduce the weight of the head sets and make them wireless it will also be a huge step forward. Reply 1 Roland @roland Jan 10, 2017, 10:25am hope ur friend had it tweaked to get the most out of it... sure resolution isn't there like a 4k screen but the immersion is the winner hands down... :) Reply 0 pooh_bear @pooh_bear Jan 10, 2017, 11:26am yeah had it running well. Driving it with a titan only thing better would be the latest titan or a 1080. That's just me being super super picky. Did really enjoy my first real Vr experience.

As timing would have it, AT&T also announced their “5G Evolution” plans for 2017, which detail what they hope to achieve with the new wireless technology. The global 5G modem announced by Intel today reportedly achieves speeds “exceeding 5 Gbps” while maintaining ultra-low latency connections. Intel’s 5G modem is already compliant to multiple industry 5G specifications, along with being able to provide fallback to a 4G connection when needed. It can even interwork 4G/5G connections. Intel says they should begin testing the 5G modem in the second half of 2017, before going into production. AT&T’s 5G announcements show that the company is tackling the evolution head on. John Donovan, chief strategy officer of Technology and Operations at AT&T says, “Our 5G Evolution plans will pave the way to the next-generation of higher speeds for customers. We’re not waiting until the final standards are set to lay the foundation for our evolution to 5G. We’re executing now.” As part of their 5G Evolution plan, AT&T is aiming for: 1 Gbps speeds in 2017 at some cell sites using their 4G LTE-Advanced network, 5G video trials with DIRECTV NOW in the first half of 2017 to residents in Austin, 5G business customer trials that launched last fall in Austin, and additional 5G trials in a team up with Qualcomm Technologies and Ericsson in the second half of 2017. After the iPhone 7’s original release, Jeff Benjamin wrote a detailed report on the distinct differences that both Qualcomm and Intel’s modems bring to the iPhone 7. Most readers seemed to be on the side of supporting the Qualcomm chip as those particular modems have the capabilities to enable Ultra HD Voice, something that only T-Mobile currently supports. Intel and AT&T’s announcement today begs the question if Apple will move in the direction of Intel’s new 5G modem for future devices. With the iPhone 7’s modem variations between Qualcomm and Intel it seemed as though Apple was testing both chips for a variety of reasons. Doubts remain if Apple will use Intel’s new global 5G modem in the next iPhone as the modem’s production will be after the second half of 2017.

Audi, BMW and Daimler own Here, whose mapping technology is designed to assist self-driving cars. Intel’s investment follows its May acquisition of a computer vision startup called Itseez, and a July deal with BMW to pursue autonomous vehicles. The companies did not report the value of Tuesday’s investment, but the automakers paid 2.8 billion euros ($2.9 billion in U.S. dollars) in 2015 to buy Here from Nokia. Fifteen percent of that is more than $400 million. In November, Intel created a new organization within the company to focus on self-driving cars. The chipmaker hopes its microprocessors can be adapted to run the new technology as Intel’s core business, the PC market, fades.   Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

More videos Advertisers flock to Instagram Instagram will overtake Twitter next year in attracting US advertisers, according to research firm eMarketer. But how much do these teens understand what they've agreed to give up when they start an account with those sites? Probably very little, according to a report released last week — and dense terms and conditions that are "impenetrable and largely ignored" are partly to blame. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Instagram's terms of use in total run at least seven printed pages, with more than 5000 words.  "'Terms and conditions' is one of the first things you agree to when you come upon a site," said Jenny Afia, a privacy lawyer and partner at Schillings law firm in London. "But of course no one reads them. I mean, most adults don't read them." Afia was a member of a "Growing Up Digital" task force group convened by the Children's Commissioner for England to study internet use among teens and the concerns children might face as they grow up in the digital age. Advertisement The group found more than a third of internet users are younger than 18, with 12- to 15-year-olds spending more than 20 hours a week online. Most of those children have no idea what their privacy rights are, despite all of them agreeing to terms and conditions before starting their social media accounts, Afia said. The task force, which included experts from the public and private sector, worked for a year and released its report Wednesday. "The situation is serious," Afia said in the report. "Young people are unwittingly giving away personal information, with no real understanding of who is holding that information, where they are holding it and what they are going to do with it." One reason for this became apparent when the task force asked a group of teenagers to read and interpret Instagram's terms and conditions. Many of them balked at the exercise: Instagram's terms of use in total run at least seven printed pages, with more than 5000 words, mostly written in legalese. "Boring!" one 13-year-old girl declared during the exercise. "It doesn't make any sense." After 20 minutes, the same teen questioned why she should continue reading. "Are you sure this is necessary?" she said. "There are, like, 100 pages." Afterward, the teenagers said they understood very little about privacy rights on Instagram, despite getting through the terms and conditions. "I don't know due to the sheer amount of writing and the lack of clarity within the document," a 15-year-old said, according to the report. The group ran Instagram's terms and conditions through a readability study and found that it registered at a postgraduate reading level, Afia said. She was tasked with rewriting the company's terms and conditions "in plain English." It took her several hours, she said. "It was doable," Afia said. "But it was quite taxing and definitely time-consuming." The simplified terms of service fit on a single page. The following paragraph is taken from Instagram's terms of use: "You are responsible for any activity that occurs through your account and you agree you will not sell, transfer, license or assign your account, followers, username, or any account rights. With the exception of people or businesses that are expressly authorised to create accounts on behalf of their employers or clients, Instagram prohibits the creation of and you agree that you will not create an account for anyone other than yourself. You also represent that all information you provide or provided to Instagram upon registration and at all other times will be true, accurate, current and complete and you agree to update your information as necessary to maintain its truth and accuracy." After Afia rewrote it for teenagers to be able to understand, it became, simply: "Don't use anybody else's account without their permission or try to find out their login details." Other complex paragraphs were similarly condensed to sentences that were easier to digest: "Don't bully anyone or post anything horrible about people." "Officially you own any original pictures and videos you post, but we are allowed to use them, and we can let others use them as well, anywhere around the world. Other people might pay us to use them and we will not pay you for that." "Although you are responsible for the information you put on Instagram, we may keep, use and share your personal information with companies connected with Instagram. This information includes your name, email address, school, where you live, pictures, phone number, your likes and dislikes, where you go, who your friends are, how often you use Instagram, and any other personal information we find such as your birthday or who you are chatting with, including in private messages (DMs)." The result was heartening, the report said. The task force asked the same group of children and teenagers to read the simplified terms and found they understood them far more clearly. "I think they should show these Terms and Conditions to people who sign up because otherwise you don't really know what you're signing up to," said the 13-year-old who had declared the original document "Boring!" "I would use Direct Messaging a lot less if I knew (Instagram) could read them," she added. The task force said the same message could be applied to most social media sites, but it focused on Instagram for its ubiquity and popularity among teenagers. Last month, Instagram announced that it had grown to 600 million users, with 100 million of those joining during the previous six-month period. According to the report, more than half of 12- to 15-year-olds in the United Kingdom — and nearly half of 8- to 11-year-olds — who are active on social media have an account on Instagram, despite the company dictating in its terms that users have to be at least 13. "Instagram, like many social networks, leaves the user with very little information to exercise their rights or any genuine privacy," the report said. "This exercise makes it clear that the current offering made by websites and apps to their users is not acceptable. Children and young people have the right to know how the relationship between their rights and the rights of the service that they have signed up to use, functions." Instagram did not respond to an interview request over the weekend. The group hopes its study — and the simplified terms of use — will spur conversations between parents and their children that privacy online is important, no matter the platform. "I think the timely goal is just plain English so that children can actually give informed consent," Afia said. "And then once there is more transparency around how the site works, we hope that will lead to some consumer pressure from the children and they will start demanding more. And parents need to bear in mind children are children until they become adults — not until they pick up a smartphone. We need to treat them as children." At least one teenager quoted in the report said he would take privacy matters into his own hands, however, after going through the exercise. "I'm deleting Instagram," 13-year-old Alex said, "because it's weird." The Washington Post 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Twenty-five years ago, the man who is now CEO of the world's largest maker of computer chips was an engineer at the company. And he made an error that almost got him fired. "I wiped out the output of an entire factory for a week," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told Fortt Knox podcast in an interview. "I'm lucky to be employed at Intel, sometimes I say." Instead of dooming him, his handling of the problem influenced the company culture, helping to birth a system called "Copy Exactly" that's become part of its identity. Krzanich went on to make a name for himself as the executive responsible for all of Intel's factories, a job that prepared him to be CEO. It happened in the 1990s; Krzanich was in his early 30s. At the time, Intel was just beginning to hit its stride with a strategy that would make it the world's top supplier of chips for personal computers. His job was to transfer the chip manufacturing process from one facility in New Mexico to the one next door. It didn't work. Production ground to a halt. And for an agonizingly long time, he had no idea why. "It went all the way up to the CEO. And my boss at one point walked into my office and said, 'You have about two more weeks to figure out this issue, and if you don't, I've got to let you go,'" Krzanich recalled. "And luckily, a friend of mine and I, we said we're just not going to sleep until we solve this. And then, sure enough, we found the problem about a week into that two week time period." What sets Krzanich apart as a leader isn't just the way he rallied in a situation like this, though his conversation with Fortt Knox did unearth some gems that should help anyone navigate a career crisis. What sets him apart is the no-frills approach he brings to his work, and the adaptability that has allowed him to push his career – and now, Intel itself – in unexpected directions. Here are just a few of the concepts explored in a fascinating episode of Fortt Knox: Reality Beats Résumé Getty Images Intel Corp. CEO Brian Krzanich delivers a keynote address at CES 2016 at The Venetian Las Vegas on January 5, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Krzanich grew up in San Jose, California, just miles from Intel headquarters. He didn't go to an Ivy League school: He got his bachelor's degree in Chemistry from San Jose State University. The prestige of a college's brand on a résumé doesn't impress him. "I've told my daughters this; my older daughter's about to go into college. It doesn't matter what college you go to. The thing that was great about San Jose State was, I got connected with some very good professors," he said. He did research for their projects on the side. "When I went into interviews, I could talk about real work that I'd done, not just textbook stuff," Krzanich added. That informs how he deals with job candidates today. "I ask real simple questions that just tell me, does this person know how to think?" This gets you fired Krzanich had some more advice. "The other thing I tell my daughters is, I've had to terminate or fire more people for being difficult to work with than being dumb." That said, former CEOs of Intel haven't exactly distinguished themselves by being easy to work with—the legendary Andy Grove comes to mind. So what does he mean? "I think if you don't give people the tools and the expectations for success, and yet hold them to some value, then you're difficult to work with. I think the one thing about Andy was, if you listened to him, if you tried to understand him, then you actually understood what the expectations were," the CEO said. "They may be hard, and you may not have been able to do it, but you at least had a chance. The difficult bosses – the ones that have been hard for me to work for – have been the ones where, I never knew what success meant," Krzanich added. In other words, it's okay to challenge your team. But it's also important to recognize the value of their different perspectives, give them the tools, and clearly define success. Use Your Lifelines show chapters Intel CEO: Need to make the US more competitive for manufacturing    Friday, 6 Jan 2017 | 11:17 AM ET | 01:40 In the show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," contestants can solve difficult problems by asking the audience, or phoning a friend. Moments in Krzanich's career are reminiscent of that. A friend helped him solve the early puzzle that had brought production to a halt. And when Intel began searching for a new CEO about four years ago, he took an unorthodox approach to competing for it: He teamed up with another Intel executive and presented to the board together. The board ended up naming him CEO, and his teammate president—the number two position. "It was more important to me that it was an insider, because I felt like anybody from the outside would slow the company down," Krzanich said. "Even if they were better, it would take them two years to learn how Intel works and to figure out how to make Moore's Law happen." The CEO "was willing to do whatever it took to have an insider, even if that wasn't me, or if it was a group of us, I was going to figure out a way .... By partnering up, I figured that was our best chance. Two of us could beat one outsider." Fortt Knox is a weekly podcast from CNBC anchor Jon Fortt.

That all changed this week at CES, where Intel showed off a developer kit to select media. Gizmodo was lucky enough to be invited into the private demonstration — and we're happy to report that it was well worth the wait. Before we dive into the experience, it's important to make a few caveats: First of all, this is not a finished product. The images you're looking at are just a reference design. Intel plans to work with hardware manufacturers to build different versions of the headset. What enables Project Alloy is Intel RealSense, a tiny camera array that debuted at CES 2014. The camera set is able make a 3D map of any room and the objects in it. Developers can then use the 3D computer model created by the cameras to layer graphics on top of it, which becomes especially handy for creating immersive VR experiences inside of a room. The developer kit is actually a ridiculously good-looking headset considering it's only a reference design. It's completely black and has unnoticeable RealSense camera arrays in the front of the goggles. At the back of the headset is the big battery that enables the headset to be completely untethered. Eliminating the wire from the back of a VR headset is a huge deal. Anyone that's ever played around with the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive will tell you one of the major pain points about those headsets is that you're always tripping over the wire that connects it to power and a nearby computer — especially if you have room tracking enabled. The Project Alloy headset I played around with let me walk around a room filled with book shelves, a coffee table and other objects in it. The demo room was basically made to look like a small apartment. The RealSense cameras took about a minute to scan the room, then another minute to turn the objects inside of the real room into elements in the game. The coffee table was turned into a big generator and the book shelves turned into rusty pipes and other weird objects straight out of a sci-fi film. The game demonstrated doesn't have a name and will never be available for public release. It was made to show off the room mapping and 3D tracking as you walk around the room shooting bad guys. The gameplay was similar to SuperHot VR, but I was shooting drones rather than humans. The graphics were also solid and easily comparable to anything I've played on the Oculus or Vive. My only major complaint about Project Alloy was the controller. It felt a little too flimsy and is most comparable to the controller that comes with the Google Daydream headset. It has a trackpad right where your thumb goes and a trigger on the back. They're basically standard VR controller elements at this point, but the quality just wasn't as good as the higher-end headsets. Still, the whole experience was awesome, especially compared to the other high-end virtual reality headsets out there. I was a little sceptical about how important the cable-free headset would be — but it makes tremendous difference when you're walking around the room, ducking behind objects to dodge bullets, swinging your head in every direction to fire at bad guys. This is one of the few truly innovative products at CES and one I'm extremely glad I had a chance to play around with. The Project Alloy developer kit will be made available to in the second quarter of this year, and there's still no price tag on it yet. The public probably won't see this thing for sale for a long time, but let me be the first to say it will be well worth the wait once an untethered VR headset finally makes its way into your home.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 8, 2017 at 4:00PM It's no secret that the personal computer market is shrinking. There are many common explanations about why it's happening, but whatever the reasons, this is the reality that personal computer manufacturers, as well as their many component vendors, must cope with. Intel's Navin Shenoy. Image source: Intel.  Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) enjoyed tremendous success over the years by dominating the market for personal computer processors. However, the company's dependence on PCs turned from a clear benefit to a clear negative as the market suffered a multiyear decline in unit shipments. Although there's not a lot that Intel can do to fundamentally change the trajectory of the personal computer market, the company has taken actions to try to maximize its profitability within this market. These include the development (and in some cases integration) of auxiliary chips and technologies to boost its content share within personal computers, as well as aggressive market segmentation actions to encourage up-sell to higher-value products. These moves appear to have paid off, at least based on the company's year-to-date financial results. During the first nine months of 2016, Intel reported a reduction in notebook platform shipments of 1% and desktop platform shipments of 5%. However, it enjoyed overall revenue growth (albeit anemic in nature) in notebook revenue thanks to a 2% boost in average selling prices. Desktop average selling prices were, too, up 2%, though that wasn't enough to completely counteract the unit decline. At a recent investor conference, Navin Shenoy, the head of Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG), offered some insight into the potential drivers of the company's desktop and notebook average selling price trends going forward. The overall strategy Shenoy began by offering a high-level overview of the company's strategy in these markets. "When I think about our strategy going forward, there's a few key tenets that we have in the strategy that ultimately drive the [average selling prices]," he said. First, the company needs to deliver an "annual cadence of new products," asserting that delivering on that timeline is "core and fundamental" to CCG. Intel's seventh-generation Core processor. Image source: Intel.  He noted that delivering new products in a predictable fashion helps the company to maintain or grow its average selling prices. Beyond that, Shenoy said Intel is "focused on integration." "As we look at future [manufacturing technology] nodes, we think about what more we can integrate," he explained, referring to combining of technologies that previous would have required separate chips into the company's processors. Shenoy obviously didn't give specifics about future products, but did speak about what kinds of technologies Intel is looking to integrate into its chip in broader terms. "As we think about where we go in the future, we look at things like voltage regulation, communications capabilities, and various auxiliary chips that are around the [system-on-chip] today and we think about how we can integrate those things and use Moore's Law to our advantage," he said. He pointed out that as the company integrates technologies into its chips, it has the "ability to monetize provided [that] the end user sees utility." Finally, Shenoy claims Intel is "focused on the segments of the market that are growing," citing gaming, 2-in-1, and commercial personal computers as examples of stable-to-growing sub-markets within the overall personal computer market. Can Intel keep raising its average selling prices? After outlining the company's broader strategy, Shenoy circled back to address the core question: Can Intel continue to grow personal computer processor average selling prices? He was candid in saying that this depends on Intel's execution toward the strategy that he laid out, implying that Intel has some degree of control over its fate (at the very least, the average selling price portion of it) in a market that's largely viewed to be in secular decline. We'll get a better sense of Intel's expectations for personal computer processor average selling price trends during 2017 when the company hosts its annual investor meeting next month.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Rosenwald facebook SHARE twitter TWEET email google-plus linkedin reddit More The US government has strictly limited the sale of firearm silencers for as long as James Bond and big-screen gangsters have used them to discreetly shoot enemies between the eyes. Now the gun industry, which for decades has complained about the restrictions, is pursuing new legislation to make silencers easier to buy, and a key backer is Donald Trump jnr, an avid hunter and the oldest son of the president-elect, who campaigned as a friend of the gun industry.

Lee, a suspect in an influence-peddling investigation. More videos Donald Trump Jr. backs Hearing Protection Act The oldest son of President-elect Donald Trump has lent his support to proposed legislation that will make firearm silencers easier to buy. The legislation stalled in Congress last year. But with Republicans in charge of the House and Senate and the elder Trump moving into the White House, gun rights advocates are excited about its prospects this year. They hope to position the bill the same way this time - not as a Constitutional issue, but as a public-health effort to safeguard the eardrums of the nation's 55 million gun owners. They even named it the Hearing Protection Act. It would end treating silencers as the same category as machine guns and grenades, thus eliminating a $US200 tax and a nine-month approval process. Related Content Trump insider Jared Kushner chases a massive Chinese deal for family firm Among red state Donald Trump supporters, indifference to Russian interference "It's about safety," Trump jnr explained in a September video interview with the founder of SilencerCo, a Utah silencer manufacturer. "It's a health issue, frankly." Violence prevention advocates are outraged that the industry is trying to ease silencer restrictions by linking the issue to the eardrums of gun owners. They argue the legislation will make it easier for criminals and potential mass shooters to obtain devices to conceal attacks. Advertisement "They want the general public to think it's about hearing aids or something," said Kristen Rand, the legislative director of the Violence Policy Centre. "It's both a silly and smart way to do it, I guess. But when the general public finds out what's really happening, there will be outrage." The silencer industry and gun rights groups say critics are vastly overstating the dangers, arguing that Hollywood has created an unrealistic image of silencers, which they prefer to call "suppressors." They cite studies showing that silencers reduce the decibel level of a gunshot from a dangerous 165 to about 135 - the sound of a jackhammer - and that they are rarely used in crimes. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Donald Trump jnr wants silencers to be more readily available in the US. Photo: AP But gun-control activists say silencers are getting quieter, particularly in combination with subsonic ammunition, which is less lethal but still damaging. They point to videos on YouTube in which silencers make high-powered rifles have "no more sound than a pellet gun," according to one demonstrator showing off a silenced semiautomatic .22LR. Proponents say that's not a good way to judge the sound. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link All about protecting your hearing. Photo: iStock "You're still going to hear the gunfire from far away," said Knox Williams, president of the American Suppressor Association. "These things are still incredibly loud." Even with the restrictions, silencers have become one of the fastest-growing segments of the gun industry, which pushed accessories as gun sales level off. In 2010, there were 285,087 registered silencers. Last year: 902,085. Representative Matt Salmon, an Arizona Republican who regularly shoots with silencers, introduced the Hearing Protection Act in the House in 2015. A companion bill in the Senate was championed by Senator Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. Though the bill never made it to committee hearings, it generated tremendous interest, becoming the third-most-viewed piece of legislation on Congress's website last year. (Top was the Democrat-led Assault Weapons Ban of 2015.) Salmon recently retired, and it's not clear yet who will reintroduce the measure. The bill had 82 co-sponsors - all but two of them Republicans. Easing the restrictions could have a profound public-health impact, champions of the legislation say. Hunters often shoot without hearing protection so they can hear prey moving. Many recreational shooters don't like wearing ear covers, which can be heavy and hot and in gun ranges lead to many conversations ending with, "I can't hear you." Silencers are also marketed as must-have attachments for high-powered rifles - a tactical necessity that reduces recoil, thus improving aim. "Quiet guns are easier to shoot," the National Rifle Association says in its American Rifleman magazine. "Try it." Silencer use in crimes is likely to be the focus of the legislative debate later this year. Gun rights proponents and the silencer industry cite a study showing that in California, from 1995 to 2005, silencers appeared to be used for criminal purposes only 153 times in federal cases. "Suppressed firearms are clearly not the choice of criminals," according to a briefing paper by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is based in Newtown, Connecticut, and represents gun manufacturers. "The fears and concerns about suppressor ownership and use are unfounded and have not been seen in the over 100-year history of suppressors." Gun-control advocates contend that serious crimes are being committed with silencers on guns. Former police officer Christopher Dorner used silencers on an AR-15 and a 9mm handgun during two-day rampage in Los Angeles in 2013. A serial killer in Vermont used a silencer in the killing of at least one of his 11 victims. And the planner of a disrupted mass shooting targeting a Masonic temple in Milwaukee last year was charged with possessing a silencer, in addition to other weapons charges. "They wanted these things so they could kill quietly," said Rand, of the Violence Policy Centre. "The industry wants to make silencers less scary, but they can't." Gun owners such as Trump jnr can't understand why people like Rand don't get it. In the video, after he's shown shooting several guns with silencers, Trump jnr says they can help with getting "little kids into the game." "It's just a great instrument," he says. "There's nothing bad about it at all."

"Bunch of crybabies," Reed Guidry, 64, offered from across the table. The subject of conversation was the report released Friday by US intelligence chiefs informing President-elect Donald Trump of their unanimous conclusion that President Vladimir Putin of Russia ordered an extensive, but covert, cyberoperation to help Trump win the election. The Russians had hacked and leaked emails, unleashed "trolls" on social media and used their "state-run propaganda machine" to spread stories harmful to Hillary Clinton. Related Content Trump accepts US intelligence on Russia hacking, chief of staff Russians dismiss US intelligence's election meddling charge as baseless In Washington, the report was viewed as extraordinary, both for its timing, raising sharp questions about the president-elect's legitimacy on the verge of his taking office, and for its assertions, describing the operation as Russia's boldest effort yet to meddle with US elections, to spread discontent and to "undermine the US-led democratic order." But interviews with Trump supporters here in Louisiana, a state the president-elect won by 20 points, and in Indiana, a state he won by nearly the same margin, found opinions about the report that ranged from general indifference to outright derision. Advertisement "From the parts of the report I've seen," said Rob Maness, a retired US Air Force colonel who twice ran for Senate here as a Tea Party favourite, "it seems silly." There are genuine concerns about Russia's cyberoperations, he said, but the notion that they changed the outcome of the election was absurd.

The Russians may have very well gotten involved, several people said. They added that kind of interference should be combated. But many assumed that foreign actors had long tried to play favorites in US elections, and that the United States had done the same in other countries' elections. Even if the Russians did do it -- which some were more willing to concede than others -- what difference did it make?

Russian hacking was concerning, sure, Emenes said. He added that, as long as Trump was not involved himself, "it doesn't change the way I view him." Tina Gunaldo, 44, taking blankets off the citrus trees in her Mandeville, Louisiana, front yard after the previous night's frost, had a similar attitude.

"Do I think he's going to become more of a friend to Russia because of this? No I don't. I think -- I hope -- his focus will be on making America great again." Gunaldo would not reveal whom she voted for, but she did say Trump's slogan resonated with her. It apparently resonated quite widely in this parish, which he won by more than 50 points. But it was a quiet support, she said. She knew of only one yard in the whole subdivision with a sign. That yard belonged to Thurston Yates Sr. "I don't believe it," Yates, 78, said flatly of the intelligence report. He was standing in the yard under his "Make America Great Again" flag, which he bought at a gun show several months ago. "Why would Putin even want Trump?" Yates, who is retired from a career in pharmaceutical sales, was not concerned about what Trump might do in office, but said he was deeply alarmed about what President Barack Obama might do before he leaves office. It was Obama who was too soft on Russia, who let Putin get away with things, Yates continued. Trump would be much tougher. But Yates then added: "Why is everybody so afraid of Russia? I'm not against Putin." This last sentiment was not uncommon. Even among those who were troubled by the hacks, few felt that Russia was a serious threat. The country was "a basket case," and not the powerful foe it once was, said Marino, from his seat at McDonald's. Others said that North Korea, the Islamic State and China were the real threats. Russia could even be a potential ally in some fights, suggested Valarie Kubacki, 54, a real estate broker in Valparaiso, Indiana. Kubacki said she perceived Russia as "somewhere in the middle" between friend and enemy, but agreed with Trump that the United States could work with Russia to defeat the Islamic State group. "We may have to line up with people who may not be our 'friend' to make that happen," she said. That those on the right seemed to be warming to Russia was not seen as a particularly unusual development, though some joked about the incongruity of the left putting such faith in the CIA. As they watched their son skate with his Boy Scout group at the public ice rink in downtown Valparaiso, Monty and Mary Willis, both registered Republicans, considered the ramifications of the intelligence report. "The idea of a fair election" had been placed in doubt, Willis said. "We were concerned about money being involved in the election. Now you're talking about espionage." The Willises, who both work in real estate, might be Republicans, but they were not Trump voters. In fact, they had last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 2008, when Sen. John McCain of Arizona ran. The party seemed to have changed in recent years, they said. And the incoming administration had them deeply worried. "Our president being in cahoots with the Russian government?" Willis said. "Yes, I'm very concerned about that." In Louisiana, David Gubert, 56, chain-smoked Eagle 20's cigarettes in the cab of his pickup, with stacks of firewood for sale behind him in the bed. Like the Willises, he ruminated on what it would mean if the Russians had gotten involved, and possibly even swung the election. But Gubert came to a different conclusion. "If that's what it took," he said, "I'm glad they did it."

Intel Working With Wine Developers On User-Mode Instruction Prevention Written by Michael Larabel in WINE on 8 January 2017 at 02:24 PM EST. 8 Comments The Intel developer working on UMIP (User-Mode Instruction Prevention) support for the Linux kernel has been collaborating with Wine developers about this security-minded feature to be introduced with future Intel CPUs. The User-Mode Instruction Prevention (UMIP) feature prevents SGDT, SIDT, SLDT, SMSW, and STR instructions from being executed outside of ring 0. UMIP was developed to help prevent user-space applications from using these instructions in exploiting code execution vulnerabilities. But given Wine's design, this could be a bit of a problem but fortunately the involved Intel developer is working with Wine to ensure a sufficient design with their kernel implementation. Those wishing to learn more about UMIP and Wine can read today's latest World Wine News and the associated mailing list thread. It looks like UMIP will debut with Intel Cannonlake processors. 8 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience. Michael has written more than 10,000 articles covering the state of Linux hardware support, Linux performance, graphics drivers, and other topics.

Project Alloy is an all-in-one virtual reality headset. The device is a full computer on your face allowing for an untethered VR experience, meaning no cords. It also removes the need for outside sensors and cameras for tracking, as it’s equipped with computer vision technology leveraging Intel’s RealSense offering inside-out tracking. Alloy’s computer vision capabilities, which are made possible by Intel’s RealSense cameras and chips from Movidius, which Intel acquired late last year, is what allows the device to create what Intel has coined “merged reality.” As there is a sea of definitions being used when it comes to VR and AR, I began my interview with Intel vice president and general manage of its perpetual computing group, Achin Bhowmik, by asking him to define the term and put it in context to the other realities. Here is what he told me: “If you look at the definitions there is VR where you are completely occluded you don’t see the real world you only see what is rendered. Then there is augmented reality where you see a display overlaid, then there is mixed reality where you render objects in the real world. So what is merged reality? Blending in the real world into the virtual world. In other words, I can have a VR headset like Alloy but I am able to blend in the real world objects into it. You are bringing in the real world into the virtual world. That is merged reality.” Alloy is not a mixed reality device like HoloLens and it’s also not an augmented reality device like Epson Moverio BT-300. It isn’t even a VR headset like the Oculus Rift. Rather, it’s a virtual reality device that can bring in real world elements to enrich the experience. And this is exactly the type of experience I had during the demo. While the current prototype of Alloy is large, it was actually pretty comfortable considering I was wearing a laptop running a PC class core processor on my face. But my demo was extremely short so I would have to wear the device a lot longer to really conclude anything here. And ultimately this doesn’t matter as Intel is not the one that will be producing the consumer ready device, although the company is continuing to iterate on the design to work on things like balance. The device fit on my head very similarly to Playstation VR although the back of the headband was much larger since it contains the battery. After my demo I did notice that the top of the device got pretty heated but I didn’t hear any fans like I have in other AR/VR devices. With the headset on I first saw the room around me which was previously scanned. Slowly the objects in the room around me started to change into game elements. The coffee table in the middle of the room became a glowing generator, and the walls were finally removed to show the sky which quickly became filled with enemy drones (which by the way were almost too cute to shoot).  The game itself was pretty simple. I was given an Ximmerse 3 degrees of freedom controller which I would use to point and shoot the drones and when I was out of ammo, I had to walk around the room to collect some more to continue shooting. One of Alloy’s main features was to use the room around me to make it easier to walk within the space without crashing into things. There were a couple of times when I bumped into the coffee table — which in the game was the virtual generator — as they didn’t completely exactly line up. Overall, I would say that I didn’t leave the demo feeling entirely confident I could run around the room in the game with the same ease as I do in the real world without knocking into things but it was clear that the real world objects were being taken in consideration in the virtual environment and I was able to move about the game again without the need for outside sensors.  While Intel did say that down in the main area at CES they had a demo of Alloy where you could put your hands in the experience to interact with the virtual world, the demo I experienced used a controller which left a lot to be desired. My virtual hand in the game was a good 15 degrees from where my real hand was. Bhowmik did tell me that Alloy can work with various inputs including controllers with six degrees of freedom and that eventually at launch the device will also feature voice control. I asked Bhowmik what he thought the predominant use cases would be for Alloy. Gaming topped his list as he felt that Alloy could provide a “richer experience when you are not connected to the PC.” Virtual tourism, education and sports rounded out his list of experiences we may expect to see using the production version of the device. Intel has confirmed that Alloy developer kits are already in the hands of partners that they will work with to commercialize this technology. And in a press conference earlier at CES, Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, confirmed that we will see Alloy technology ship in Q4 of 2017. Intel could not confirm who these “major” partners were, but Intel previously stated that they are “collaborating with Microsoft to optimize Windows-based content and experiences on Intel-based VR devices such as Alloy.” Bhowmik told me that some of the partners will use the Project Alloy developer kit as a reference design while others with more stronger device design capabilities will take the guts of it to create their own including one 400 RealSens camera and the Movidius chip (in the version I tried Intel used two specially-developed variations of our 200 RealSense cameras). RealSense also has a chip on it that calculates the 3D data points. While the battery life will depend on the partner, Bhowmik did say that like a laptop you should expect multiple hours of battery life. Overall I would say that I left pretty excited about Alloy, although the experience wasn’t as magical as I had hoped. I am a huge believer that an all-in-one untethered device with no need for outside sensors is the future. And I have no doubt that with the help of major partners that Intel will continue to improve upon the technology.

More videos Russia hacks: Intel chief pushes back at Trump Speaking to a Senate panel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pushed back on President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion the intelligence community did not have solid evidence that Vladimir Putin's Russia was responsible for email hacks during the 2016 election. "Bunch of crybabies," Reed Guidry, 64, offered from across the table. The subject of conversation was the report released Friday by US intelligence chiefs informing President-elect Donald Trump of their unanimous conclusion that President Vladimir Putin of Russia ordered an extensive, but covert, cyberoperation to help Trump win the election. The Russians had hacked and leaked emails, unleashed "trolls" on social media and used their "state-run propaganda machine" to spread stories harmful to Hillary Clinton. Related Content Trump accepts US intelligence on Russia hacking, chief of staff Russians dismiss US intelligence's election meddling charge as baseless In Washington, the report was viewed as extraordinary, both for its timing, raising sharp questions about the president-elect's legitimacy on the verge of his taking office, and for its assertions, describing the operation as Russia's boldest effort yet to meddle with US elections, to spread discontent and to "undermine the US-led democratic order." But interviews with Trump supporters here in Louisiana, a state the president-elect won by 20 points, and in Indiana, a state he won by nearly the same margin, found opinions about the report that ranged from general indifference to outright derision. Advertisement "From the parts of the report I've seen," said Rob Maness, a retired US Air Force colonel who twice ran for Senate here as a Tea Party favourite, "it seems silly." There are genuine concerns about Russia's cyberoperations, he said, but the notion that they changed the outcome of the election was absurd. (The report made no determination on how they affected the election.) SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump cheer during a campaign rally in November.  Photo: AP Of the comments he had seen from fellow Trump supporters on Facebook and in emails, he added, "90 percent of them are like, 'What's the big deal?'" The Russians may have very well gotten involved, several people said. They added that kind of interference should be combated. But many assumed that foreign actors had long tried to play favorites in US elections, and that the United States had done the same in other countries' elections. Even if the Russians did do it -- which some were more willing to concede than others -- what difference did it make? People did not need the Russians to make up their minds about Clinton, Trump's election opponent. Blaming her loss on the Russians was, as one Trump supporter here said, "just being sore losers." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link President-elect Donald Trump. Photo: AP "I don't think the Russians posed as big a problem to the Clintons as the Clintons posed to themselves," said Paul Emenes, 49, while he sold ribs, shoulders and chops from a small table at a frigid outdoor farmers' market. Russian hacking was concerning, sure, Emenes said. He added that, as long as Trump was not involved himself, "it doesn't change the way I view him." Tina Gunaldo, 44, taking blankets off the citrus trees in her Mandeville, Louisiana, front yard after the previous night's frost, had a similar attitude. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link No big deal: Russian President Vladimir Putin  Photo: AP "Trump is Trump," she said. "Do I think he's going to become more of a friend to Russia because of this? No I don't. I think -- I hope -- his focus will be on making America great again." Gunaldo would not reveal whom she voted for, but she did say Trump's slogan resonated with her. It apparently resonated quite widely in this parish, which he won by more than 50 points. But it was a quiet support, she said. She knew of only one yard in the whole subdivision with a sign. That yard belonged to Thurston Yates Sr. "I don't believe it," Yates, 78, said flatly of the intelligence report. He was standing in the yard under his "Make America Great Again" flag, which he bought at a gun show several months ago. "Why would Putin even want Trump?" Yates, who is retired from a career in pharmaceutical sales, was not concerned about what Trump might do in office, but said he was deeply alarmed about what President Barack Obama might do before he leaves office. It was Obama who was too soft on Russia, who let Putin get away with things, Yates continued. Trump would be much tougher. But Yates then added: "Why is everybody so afraid of Russia? I'm not against Putin." This last sentiment was not uncommon. Even among those who were troubled by the hacks, few felt that Russia was a serious threat. The country was "a basket case," and not the powerful foe it once was, said Marino, from his seat at McDonald's. Others said that North Korea, the Islamic State and China were the real threats. Russia could even be a potential ally in some fights, suggested Valarie Kubacki, 54, a real estate broker in Valparaiso, Indiana. Kubacki said she perceived Russia as "somewhere in the middle" between friend and enemy, but agreed with Trump that the United States could work with Russia to defeat the Islamic State group. "We may have to line up with people who may not be our 'friend' to make that happen," she said. That those on the right seemed to be warming to Russia was not seen as a particularly unusual development, though some joked about the incongruity of the left putting such faith in the CIA. As they watched their son skate with his Boy Scout group at the public ice rink in downtown Valparaiso, Monty and Mary Willis, both registered Republicans, considered the ramifications of the intelligence report. "The idea of a fair election" had been placed in doubt, Willis said. "We were concerned about money being involved in the election. Now you're talking about espionage." The Willises, who both work in real estate, might be Republicans, but they were not Trump voters. In fact, they had last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 2008, when Sen. John McCain of Arizona ran. The party seemed to have changed in recent years, they said. And the incoming administration had them deeply worried. "Our president being in cahoots with the Russian government?" Willis said. "Yes, I'm very concerned about that." In Louisiana, David Gubert, 56, chain-smoked Eagle 20's cigarettes in the cab of his pickup, with stacks of firewood for sale behind him in the bed. Like the Willises, he ruminated on what it would mean if the Russians had gotten involved, and possibly even swung the election. But Gubert came to a different conclusion. "If that's what it took," he said, "I'm glad they did it."

More videos North Korea close to test of ICBM North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says that the isolated nuclear-capable country is close to test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). "The ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by the supreme headquarters of the DPRK," an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by the official KCNA news agency, using the acronym for the country's name. The North is formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Related Content Trump's Asia stance likely to further increase tensions Trump tweets North Korean missile test 'won't happen' US Defence Secretary Ash Carter said on Sunday that North Korea's nuclear weapons capabilities and ballistic missile defence programs constitute a "serious threat" to the United States and that it was prepared to shoot down a North Korean missile launch or test. "We only would shoot them down ... if it was threatening, that is if it were coming toward our territory or the territory of our friends and allies," Carter said during an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" program. Advertisement The United States said on January 5 that North Korea had demonstrated a "qualitative" improvement in its nuclear and missile capabilities after an unprecedented level of tests last year. North Korea has been testing rocket engines and heat-shields for an ICBM while developing the technology to guide a missile after re-entry into the atmosphere following a lift-off, experts have said. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link A missile is launched during a drill at an undisclosed location in North Korea.  Photo: AP While Pyongyang is close to a test, it is likely to take some years to perfect the weapon, according to the experts. Once fully developed, a North Korean ICBM could threaten the continental United States, which is around 9000 km from the North. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5500 km , but some are designed to travel 10,000 km or further. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link People watch a TV news channel airing an image of North Korea's ballistic missile launch published on Thursday in North Korea's Rodong Sinmun newspaper. Photo: AP US President-elect Donald Trump responded to Kim's comments on an ICBM test by declaring in a tweet last week that "It won't happen!" A US State Department spokesman said last week that the United States does not believe that North Korea is capable of mounting a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile. North Korea has been under UN sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. The sanctions were tightened last month after Pyongyang conducted its fifth and largest nuclear test on September 9. "The US is wholly to blame for pushing the DPRK to have developed ICBM as it has desperately resorted to anachronistic policy hostile toward the DPRK for decades to encroach upon its sovereignty and vital rights," KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying. "Anyone who wants to deal with the DPRK would be well advised to secure a new way of thinking after having clear understanding of it," the spokesman said, according to KCNA.  Reuters Related Content Kim Jong-un says North Korea close to testing inter-continental missiles Enough of the tweets, China's state media tells Donald Trump Advertisement Most Popular If you thought you'd deciphered Trump's master tweeting plan, you're probably wrong 'Pence could be the most powerful VP ever, or he could be kicked to the curb really fast' Trump dumps top officials in purge without precedent CIA director tells Donald Trump to watch his words Pendant identical to Anne Frank's found at notorious Nazi camp Follow Fairfax Foreign Share on FacebookFacebook Share on TwitterTwitter Follow SMH Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on EmailNewsletters Advertisement Most Viewed Today Previous slide Next slide World Trump dumps top officials in purge without precedent CIA director tells Donald Trump to watch his words Video shows police tackling and beating a black man suspected of stealing a car.

Graham also said he supports a permanent US military training presence in Ukraine, Georgia and the Baltic states, according to a transcript provided by the network. "We're going to give President Trump an opportunity to make Russia pay a price for interfering in our election so it will deter others in the future," Graham said. "I hope he will take advantage of it." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Trump faces a divide in his party if he is not tougher on Russia. Photo: AP Graham said he thinks Trump is worried that delving into what Russia did during the election campaign will undermine his legitimacy in the Oval Office. "I don't know what drives him on Russia, but I do know this. That if our policies don't change vis-a-vis Russia, the worst is yet to come," Graham said. "And the Congress is going to have a different view on Russia than the president-elect does." Advertisement Trump on Saturday suggested warmer relations were coming between the Washington and Moscow, a day after US intelligence chiefs briefed him on the evidence tying interference in the election campaign to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing," Trump said in a series of three tweets. "Only 'stupid' people, or fools, would think it is bad! We have enough problems around the world without yet another one." SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Senator Lindsey Graham plans to introduce legislation for tougher sanctions against Russia. Photo: AP McCain, also speaking on NBC, said the Senate Armed Services Committee, which he chairs, will continue to conduct hearings around cyber threats. McCain said he supports appointing a special Senate committee to investigate the campaign hacking, rather than having several committees do their own probes. Trump's approach to Russia is expected to be debated on January 11 at the confirmation hearing for Rex Tillerson, his nominee for secretary of state, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Panel members have said they'll press Tillerson, the former chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation, about his years of friendly business dealings with Putin. While Committee Chairman Bob Corker said on Friday that Tillerson's views on Russia "are not in any way out of the mainstream," the Tennessee Republican added that Russia has done "very nefarious things." Similarly, Graham said Tillerson has to convince him that as a career oilman he sees Putin as undermining democracy with actions such as the hacking attacks, and that new sanctions are justified. "I'm looking for a secretary of state who understands Russia and understands the world as it really is. I had a great meeting with him," Graham said. "I hope he can articulate to the American people that he understands Putin has been a disruptive force when it comes to democracy."

"I don't know what drives him on Russia, but I do know this. That if our policies don't change vis-a-vis Russia, the worst is yet to come," Graham said. "And the Congress is going to have a different view on Russia than the president-elect does." Advertisement Trump on Saturday suggested warmer relations were coming between the Washington and Moscow, a day after US intelligence chiefs briefed him on the evidence tying interference in the election campaign to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing," Trump said in a series of three tweets. "Only 'stupid' people, or fools, would think it is bad! We have enough problems around the world without yet another one." SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Senator Lindsey Graham plans to introduce legislation for tougher sanctions against Russia. Photo: AP McCain, also speaking on NBC, said the Senate Armed Services Committee, which he chairs, will continue to conduct hearings around cyber threats. McCain said he supports appointing a special Senate committee to investigate the campaign hacking, rather than having several committees do their own probes. Trump's approach to Russia is expected to be debated on January 11 at the confirmation hearing for Rex Tillerson, his nominee for secretary of state, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Panel members have said they'll press Tillerson, the former chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation, about his years of friendly business dealings with Putin. While Committee Chairman Bob Corker said on Friday that Tillerson's views on Russia "are not in any way out of the mainstream," the Tennessee Republican added that Russia has done "very nefarious things." Similarly, Graham said Tillerson has to convince him that as a career oilman he sees Putin as undermining democracy with actions such as the hacking attacks, and that new sanctions are justified. "I'm looking for a secretary of state who understands Russia and understands the world as it really is. I had a great meeting with him," Graham said. "I hope he can articulate to the American people that he understands Putin has been a disruptive force when it comes to democracy."

Dell's latest XPS 13 2-in-1 tries to woo consumers with an eye-catching display, a thin, durable chassis, and the latest processors from Intel. The XPS 13 convertible's 360° hinge allows it to function as both a laptop or a tablet, depending on the display's orientation. The hinges are constructed of solid steel wrapped in aluminum. Solid materials aren't restricted to the hinges, since the main body is made of aluminum, carbon fiber, and Gorilla Glass. The convertible is 0.54" (13.7mm( thick, and weighs 2.7 lbs (1.24 kg). Dell claims that this is the world's smallest 13" 2-in-1, and that's partly thanks to its display portion. The InfinityEdge touch display has a very thin bezel and an IGZO IPS panel with wide viewing angles. Shoppers can pick between a display with 1920x1080 or 3200x1800 resolution. Under the hood, Dell installs one of two processors. The base model comes with Intel's Core i5-7Y54 processor, which has a max turbo frequency of 3.2 GHz and a 4.5W TDP. Buyers can upgrade to Intel's Core i7-7Y75, a dual-core processor with four threads, a max turbo frequency of 3.6 GHz, and a 4.5W TDP. For graphics, the convertible uses the processor's integrated HD Graphics 615. The XPS 13 2-in-1's different configurations either have 4GB or 8GB of 1866Mhz LPDDR3, and users can pick between a 128GB SSD or a 256GB PCIe SSD. The XPS 13 convertible employs a fanless design to dispel heat, enabling it to run very quietly. Dell claims the machine can go for about 15 hours when running productivity applications, and about 13 hours when streaming Netflix. For connectivity, the laptop offers has two USB Type-C ports, one of which supports Thunderbolt 3. Both ports have charging and display functionality. Since some users might miss their old USB ports, Dell includes a USB Type-C to Type-A adapter in the box. The convertible has a backlit keyboard, and is equipped with a fingerprint reader. The XPS 13 2-in-1 is sold exclusively at dell.com and Best Buy stores, and is available right away. Pricing ranges from $1,000 to $1,300 depending on the options.   Tags: Mobile computing User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

According to the authors, the report covers "the motivation and scope of Moscow’s intentions regarding US elections and Moscow’s use of cyber tools and media campaigns to influence US public opinion." In the preamble to the report, the authors made all remarks needed for such an important document. For example, the published document is described as a "declassified version of a highly classified assessment" that has been submitted only to the US president and to people approved by the President. In such a context, the declassified version omits the input information and provides only the conclusive assessment US intelligence analysts. © Sputnik/ Mikhail Voskresenskiy US Intel Report: 'RT & Sputnik Are Being Accused of Doing Journalism'The authors also underscored that they used the most advanced and refined analytical methods, especially concerning critical assessment of collected data. Thus, the report is expected to be politically unbiased and technically accurate. Moreover, they pointed out the apparent difficulties of their analytical process when it comes to cyber activities. "The nature of cyberspace makes attribution of cyber operations difficult but not impossible. Every kind of cyber operation – malicious or not – leaves a trail," according to the document. The analysts stressed that their assessment of attribution of activities in cyberspace is not a "simple statement of who conducted an operation, but rather a series of judgments that describe whether it was an isolated incident, who was the likely perpetrator, that perpetrator’s possible motivations, and whether a foreign government had a role in ordering or leading the operation." Such a long and sophisticated preamble to the report is indicative of its considerable political importance though. The political significance of the document can be considered in two dimensions, according to an article in the Russian online publication Gazeta.ru. "On the one hand, the authors send a signal to the next US presidential administration that they are ready to cooperate and this report is just their job. On the other hand, finally the US intelligence community seems to be ready to express solidarity with the Barack Obama administration on Russia’s meddling in the election," the article read. © Flickr/ Steve Rhodes WikiLeaks: US Intel Report on Russia Hacking 'Has Poor Sourcing and No Evidence'The analysis came to a conclusion: "We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.  Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments." "Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations – such as cyber activity – with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or 'trolls,'" the report read. Furthermore, the report also read that the Russian military intelligence (GRU) used a hacker or a group of hackers known as Guccifer 2.0 and the whistleblowing project WikiLeaks, in order to publish leaked data, including emails of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). WikiLeaks was quick to respond to the allegations, saying: "US government's declassified 'Russian hacking' report has the curious disclaimer that it is based on watching TV and reading Tweets."

The assessment provided in the report is unlikely to have a serious impact on relations between Washington and Moscow, according to Ivan Kurilla, a professor at the European University at St. Petersburg. "I think that in this situation no one gains anything. Of course, nothing will change for those who don’t like Putin. As for those supporting Putin, this report is another example of his valor. I don’t think the situation will change," Kurilla told Gazeta.ru. © REUTERS/ Carlo Allegri/File Photo Trump Says US Intel Has 'Absolutely No Evidence' Alleged Hacking Affected ElectionRussian officials have repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues. After receiving an intelligence briefing on the report, US President-elect Trump said the election outcome had not been affected. US House of Representatives speaker Paul Ryan also suggested that the assessment should not be used by partisans to delegitimize Trump's presidency. Kurilla also suggested that President-elect Donald Trump is unlikely to embrace a more hardline stance towards Moscow, in a bid to shake off a reputation of a pro-Kremlin man. "There are no guarantees that this will work. If he does he will have to prove he didn’t have contacts with Russia. Such a defensive position is not good for Trump. He is likely to apply a different approach, stressing that Moscow is a friend, not a foe," Kurilla concluded.  ...

The document entitled "Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections" was jointly prepared by analysts of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Agency (NSA).] This report is a trick. There is just no possible way all three of these agencies could be this stupid. They are trying to make it look fake in a calculated way. For example switching the date from April 7th to July 4th: well July 4th is Independence Day, a date which registers pride in every American, even when reported on RT as a mistake. It is also difficult to believe that the CIA-FBI-NSA could ever be so utterly and blindly supportive of Hillary Clinton or the Democrats, to make charges that look this ridiculous and transparently false. It looks like they are sandbagging on Hilary's unpopularity and how idiotic these charges sound to send secret messages to people or something. If this is the best the US has, then they are all doomed. This report just has to be some kind of advanced trick, designed to distract people from some more important deeper purpose to all of this election hacking nonsense. I no longer believe that these intelligence agencies believe in this report at face value. They seem to be making purposeful and amateur-like errors, to cover-up something else entirely. These guys are acting like idiots on purpose, and the report is posing as an amateurish joke, while masquerading some serious forms of maliciousness hidden underneath. Why is the US government pretending to look so stupid and moronic to the rest of the world? Reply drblack 22:40 08.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete AHAHAHAHA!!!!

Reply Darrell R 22:53 08.01.2017 | 2 | Edit | Delete Obama demanded a report on this before he left office. The whole thing is just a bunch of political garbage. While it reinforces hysteria in some, more and more people are getting tired of this hateful stunt. Trump wants to improve relations with Russia in a sincere way and he has popular support on this. He will prevail no matter how hard these hawks try to stop them. They are just exposing their true colors. Long before WikiLeaks brought this out, Trump had huge crowds that quickly filled any facility he used. Despite all the negative press coverage and the polls they used, it was clear the presidency was within his grasp throughout the campaign. As far as Russia helping him goes it was his words that made a difference. The whole idea of getting along and working with Russia and not against was popular. Reply Adrienne Adonis 23:43 08.01.2017 | 2 | Edit | Delete All of their assessments is based on judgements and percentages ............ The report has to be written this way in order to avoid egg on their faces. They have no choice but to stick to their own narratives.

When I first saw the first political adds, the one I saw was NOT from Russia. It was from MSN online. They had a CLINTON picture saying to click, saying I am with you. SWAMP POLITICS. Not a single Trump add was there. ALL was ridicule and saying he should step off. I saw the potential and came and said, they don't have an idea what they facing. Not even OBAMA have an idea. They will lose and will never understand it. I understand the kind TRUMP is . But they don't. Just KEEP pushing buttons to please OBAMA , Clinton. Actually it was their own fault, that TRUMP won. But that happened long ago. \You don';t go to an educated country spreading that BULL HORN. TRUMP would had respond harshly IF he found real evidence. Electoral college went and accessed the same evidence. And found no evidence of tampering with U.S elections. Was all BULL HORN from a server that did NOT stopped Democrats from voting. \ Time to MATURE. Reply hopscotch64 04:28 09.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete The sanctions keep coming and the troops keep moving east and war is on the horizon. Russia cannot continue to ignore these developments and pretend it is business as usual. Trump today is signaling that he accepts the intel evaluation and no matter what is being said about this incident not changing Russian/US relations, it certainly will and not for the good.

They would need to invest time and effort far beyond their budget to research background information on Podesta's connections to the Clinton Foundation, or that the US State department knowing allowed arms supplies to be channeled to ISIS. In Auckland we have only one newspaper, and its 'World' page is buried somewhere between Christmas sales and Real estate advertisements.😀Most world stories are just cut and pasted from the Associated Press, Washington Times etc. 😀 Local journalists spend most of their time covering stories about such things as traffic accidents, whale sightings and ... real estate prices then off for drinks at 16:30 on Friday. Without the support of the large news organisations provincial newspapers can only publish the stories coming down the wire. So if the Main Stream Media choose to run weeks of stories about a diversion they effectively mask for the greater public, the more important issues of corruption and duplicitious foreign policy.

The big deal with this refresh is that not only has LG stuffed seventh-generation Intel processors into these laptops, but batteries capable of up to 24 hours of use on a single charge. That is a bold claim, but the company states that its LG Chem branch is using new materials in the batteries it’s producing, enabling the long lifespans. News of the refresh stem out of LG Electronics in South Korea and lists eight models spanning 15.6, 14, and 13.3-inch form factors. There are actually two sets of LG Gram laptops: one “Alligram” group weighing between 2.07 pounds and 2.40 pounds, and an ultra-light “Glimmer” group with devices weighing from 1.82 pounds to 2.16 pounds. Here are the refreshed laptops in the first Alligram group: 15Z970-GA75K 14Z970-GA5HK 13Z970-GR30K 13ZD970-GX3PK Size: 15.6 inches 14 inches 13.3 inches 13.3 inches Panel type: IPS IPS IPS IPS Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 1,920 x 1,080 1,920 x 1,080 1,920 x 1,080 Processor: Core i7-7500U Core i5-7200U Core i3-7100U Core i3-7100U Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Memory: 16GB DDR4 @2,133MHz (8GB x 2) 8GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz (8GB + one open) 4GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz (4GB + one open) 8GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz (4GB x 2) Storage: 512GB SSD 256GB SSD 256GB SSD 256GB SSD Connectivity: Wireless AC (2×2) Wireless AC (2×2) Wireless AC (2×2) Wireless AC (2×2) Weight: 2.40 pounds 2.13 pounds 2.07 pounds 2.07 pounds Color: Snow Pearl White Snow Pearl White Snow Pearl White Metal Pink Ports: HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 Battery: 60 Watt-hour 60 Watt-hour 60 Watt-hour 60 Watt-hour Max battery usage: 22 hours 23 hours 24 hours 24 hours OS: Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Home Unknown Price: $2,049 $1,480 $1,279 $1,187 LG Electronics labels this group as Alligram, which is apparently short for “All Day Gram.” The company doesn’t explain what exactly makes the 60 Watt-hour battery so special in this group, only stating that owners won’t need to carry a heavy charger or hunt down an electrical outlet in coffee shops. The company adds that these batteries feature fast charging too, coughing up three hours of use after charging for merely 20 minutes and up to 10 hours after charging for a single hour. In addition to a new battery, LG Electronics also improved the internal cooling system by optimizing the blade structure of the cooling fan. The fan is based on a material that causes less sound, thus the laptop only reaches up to 30 decibels (dB). The fan is also 40 percent larger than the one used in the previous generation and the passageways that send the heat outward are twice as large too. Other notable features with the Alligram group include backlighting in the keyboard that can be switched on and off, optional fingerprint readers, and optional touchscreens. The company notes that this group will actually offer three colors instead of the two listed above — Snow Pearl White, Dark Silver, and Metal Pink. Now here are the four ultra-light Glimmer models: 15Z970-EA50K 14Z970-EA50K 13Z970-ER3NK 13ZD970-EX3PK Size: 15.6 inches 14 inches 13.3 inches 13.3 inches Panel type: IPS IPS IPS IPS Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 1,920 x 1,080 1,920 x 1,080 1,920 x 1,080 Processor: Core i5-7200U Core i5-7200U Core i3-7100U Core i3-7100U Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Memory: 8GB DDR4 @2,133MHz (8GB + one open) 8GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz (8GB + one open) 4GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz (4GB + one open) 8GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz (4GB x 2) Storage: 256GB SSD 256GB SSD 180GB SSD 256GB SSD Connectivity: Wireless AC (2×2) Wireless AC (2×2) Wireless AC (2×2) Wireless AC (2×2) Weight: 2.16 pounds 1.89 pounds 1.82 pounds 1.82 pounds Color: Snow Pearl White Snow Pearl White Metal Pink Metal Pink Ports: HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 Battery: 34 Watt-hour 34 Watt-hour 34 Watt-hour 34 Watt-hour OS: Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Home Unknown Price: $1,530 $1,446 $1,196 $1,137 As the specs show, the thinner form factor required LG Electronics to swap out the special 60 Watt-hour battery for a 34 Watt-hour version. There are no seventh-generation Core i7 processor in this group, there is not a 512GB SSD option, nor is there a model that ships with 16GB of system memory. Otherwise, these four units are similar in features. Of course, that could change when LG’s updated Gram notebooks begin to ship. More: As thin as cardboard, LG’s ‘wallpaper’ OLED TV slaps on your wall like a poster As the charts above show, the Alligram group will range between $1,187 and $2,049 whereas the Glimmer group will range from $1,137 to $1,530. All these numbers are converted from South Korean Won, so they may change when the units arrive in North America. Currently, they are set to hit store shelves in the first half of 2017, so there could be adjustments in the pricing before then. Also watch: Share

Apex is crafted to be a natural fit for showcase PC builds for gaming and style-conscious enthusiasts — where pure adrenaline meets style. ROG Strix: ROG’s newest recruit, ready to strike up gaming excitement ROG Strix is the all-new gaming creed, consisting of boards crafted to appeal to every type of gamer: ROG Strix Z270E Gaming, ROG Strix Z270F Gaming and ROG Strix Z270H Gaming ATX gaming motherboards, mATX ROG Strix Z270G Gaming  and mini-ITX ROG Strix Z270I Gaming. ROG Strix Z270 gaming motherboards combine bold aesthetics with premier performance and incredible SupremeFX audio to deliver unrivaled gaming experiences and style. Unique, angular patterns inspired by the slashes of a sword lend toROG Strix series’ striking visual accents, and a reflective polychrome ROG logo emblazoned on a diamond-cut metal nameplate shines as a mark of gaming pride. Additionally, Aura Sync technology adds a burst of vibrancy as it syncs with Aura-enabled components for a system that glows in a nearly infinite spectrum of colors. Support for the latest 7th Generation Intel Core processors and technologies, plus exclusive ROG innovations, take performance to the next level to give ROG Strix gamers the edge against their opponents. World-leading innovations: The newest and best air- and water-cooling technologies The new ROG Maximus IX and ROG Strix Z270 motherboards are loaded with the newest and best technologies for those who love to cool with air or water.[1] These technologies include several M.2 cooling solutions that efficiently remove heat from this vital area. Maximus IX Extreme has a liquid-cooled M.2 heatsink, the result of expert design that integrates the M.2 heatsink with the monoblock for unmatched heat dissipation. Maximus IX Apex comes with DIMM.2, which allows two M.2 drives to be vertically mounted in a DDR4 interface. ROG Strix Z270I Gaming features an innovative double-decker heatsink design that allows the M.2 SSD to be stacked on top of the PCH heatsink, which is then topped off with an additional metal heatsink for the M.2 drive. The two heatsinks are thermally isolated to prevent the PCH and M.2 from affecting each other. The double decker design not only cleverly maximizes the board space on mini-ITX board, but also dramatically improves heat dissipation, cooling the M.2 SSD by up to 20°C for better stability and enhanced gaming performance while featuring a stylish angular design to enhance the look of ROG Strix Z270I Gaming builds. Additionally, selected ROG Z270 motherboards also support a 3D-printed M.2 fan holder. Maximus IX Formula features CrossChill EK II, the renowned hybrid heatsink. Redesigned with the cooling masters at EKWB, CrossChill EK II delivers MOSFET temperatures that are up to 23˚C lower with water versus air. The latest CrossChill EK II design also features new, thinner fins that offer a 4˚C cooling improvement over the previous version ─ delivering efficient, quiet cooling. ROG’s Water Cooling Zone lets gamers monitor the speed of both cooling fans and water-pump output power. The dual water-temperature headers and flow-rate header feed information straight into ROG’s intuitive Fan Xpert 4 utility, which itself has been upgraded to allow DIYers to set the GPU temperature as a fan-tuning source — enabling a dynamic cooling response to system power output. Overclocking and performance: Frequency-pushing innovations for the fastest-ever speeds ROG motherboards are revered for their overclocking credentials, and the new Maximus IX models enable enthusiast to push frequencies further than ever for the fastest speeds. The Maximus IX Apex is positioned as a true performance-oriented motherboard, with ROG’s R&D team breaking all the boundaries to create the most optimal circuit-board layout and highest-quality power delivery. With its 2-DIMM DRAM design, Apex has already gone beyond the performance peak by placing multiple world records (WRs) and global first places (GFPs) to break several long-standing records. These include the best CPU-frequency score with Intel Core processors since the X58 platform-based motherboards with a single-core, single-thread frequency of 7.383GHz, and 7.328MHz at four cores and eight threads. It also set a reference clock (BCLK) record at 584MHz and a memory frequency surpassing 5GHz in single channel, with 5041MHz. In total, Maximus IX Apex has secured eight WRs and 13 GFPs. SupremeFX: Exclusive codecs for the best gaming-audio experiences The latest ROG and ROG Strix motherboards benefit respectively from the exclusive S1220 or S1220A audio codec. Designed in close collaboration with Realtek, the codec improves performance to provide 120dB signal-to-noise ratio for the stereo line-out and up to 113dB SNR for the line-in, to capture pristine audio; and has an impedance-sensing circuit that automatically adjusts the gain to ensure the optimal volume range for headphones. Sonic Studio III has an all-new intelligent routing feature made for streaming. The new routing system transports different audio streams to different outputs. This gives gamers full control over who hears what — such as browser audio to headphones and game audio to speakers. It also enables app-level preferences for instant audio profiles and improved noise filtering for conversations with total clarity. Sonic Radar III is ROG’s evolved audio engine that processes sounds more accurately than ever, ensuring gamers always know what's going on around them. A new on-screen arrow has also been added to instantly pinpoint enemy positions. Aura Sync: The world’s first motherboard-controlled synchronized RGB lighting ASUS Aura Sync is the world's first motherboard-RGB-synchronization technology, delivering up to nine distinctive lighting effects across Aura Sync-capable motherboards, graphics cards and peripherals3 — all controlled via the simple and intuitive Aura app. Users are able enhance their illumination still further, either via the integrated 4-pin/12V Aura RGB header or the included extension cable. Aura offers a brilliant spectrum of colors, and can react to the beat of music and even change shades to reflect the CPU temperature, providing valuable information at a glance. Aura takes motherboard aesthetics to extremes and creates immersive gaming atmospheres for gaming builds. 3D-printing friendly: Unlimited personalization and customization opportunities ROG has always strived to make it easier for users to customize the cosmetic appearance of their PC components, and now it has become the world’s first motherboard brand to support 3D-printed components — making it easy for users to print their own parts to customize the motherboard's appearance, improve system performance or manage cables. Dedicated onboard 3D mounts that use the same screws as M.2 and standard motherboard mounting holes make fitting 3D-printed parts easy, so users can quickly add custom nameplates, cable covers, or even an M.2 fan holder to lower M.2 temperatures by up to 30°C — preventing throttling. ROG has also designed a series of 3D-printable accessories, including 2-way SLI™ bridge cover, fan grill, ROG-font letters and all sizes of cable combs, keeping PC tidy and adding style to any build. ASUS worked with Shapeways, the world’s largest 3D-printing service company, to launch the ASUS 3D Printing store. This online store hosts the full selection of ASUS 3D-printable parts, enabling users to select the parts they want to print — replete with preferred materials and color — and order directly via Shapeways.  Gaming networking: Faster, smoother, safer and more intelligent online experiences ROG and ROG Strix motherboards have the very latest Intel Gigabit Ethernet to reduce CPU overhead and deliver exceptionally high TCP and UDP throughput, freeing up more computing power for gaming and gameplay. They also feature exclusive LANGuard with signal-coupling technology and premium surface-mounted to ensure reliable connections and better throughput, plus electrostatically-guarded and surge-protected components (ESD Guards) for 1.9X-greater tolerance to static electricity and 2.5X-greater protection (up to 15KV) against surges. With an eye on the rising demand on network resources and bandwidth, ROG will also introduce ROG Areion 10G, the world’s first consumer Ethernet card to use the latest PCIe 3.0 interface. Manufactured by Aquantia, ROG Areion 10G comes with an extra-large and stylish heatsink for cooler and more stable performance for super-speed 10Gbps[2] data transfer for serious performance. GameFirst IV optimizes network traffic for faster, lag-free online gaming, and includes Multi-Gate Teaming that enables users to team all their networks for maximum bandwidth and the smoothest-ever gameplay. GameFirst IV also includes all-new Intelligent Mode, which automatically compiles a database by parsing new app data to ensure that every game is optimized to maximize performance potential. Some models[3] also include next-level 802.11ac Wi-Fi with 2x2 dual-band 2.4/5GHz antennas for up to 867Mbps transfer speeds, plus the very latest Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) technology to ensure that every connected user experiences the best wireless and online speeds. Gaming connectivity: Breathtaking speeds, brilliant convenience and flexible expandability The new ROG and ROG Strix Z270 motherboards are all equipped with USB 3.1 Type-A ports for ultra-fast transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps with great backward compatibility, and most models also have at least one USB Type-C™ (USB-C) socket3 — the futureproof reversible connector that makes attaching USB devices quicker and easier. These motherboards also have a USB 3.1 front-panel connector3 for everyday convenience. Dual M.2 is also a key feature of the latest ROG and ROG Strix Z270 gaming boards, enabling gamers to quickly and easily expand their storage options and tap into a blistering 32Gbps of PCIe bandwidth.

I don't like the decals and "ROG!" badges shown in some other pics. I really don't like the Apex having traces for both DDR4 and DDR3 at the expense of 2 DDR4 slots. It isn't that hard to stabilize DDR4 - most of the problems are just users not understanding the CPUs have the IMC and are specified for 2133/2400 and expecting 3600 to work out of the box.

"Only thing I could tell you was when he came out of Iraq, he wasn't feeling too good," his uncle, Hernan Rivera, told Newark's Star-Ledger newspaper. His aunt told the newspaper that Santiago was hospitalised after returning from Iraq. Related Content Suspect in Florida shooting charged with federal crimes, could face death penalty Gun given back to Florida shooting suspect "He lost his mind," Ruiz Rivera said in Spanish. He had seemed to get the help he needed, and became a father in September, she told Noticias Telemundo. But his mental health issues, she said, worsened in December. Advertisement "They took him to the hospital, but they didn't tell me what for, but they had him in an isolated room because he was a little wrong in the head and he started to like hear things," she said. Santiago should have been hospitalised for longer than four days given the gravity of his claims, his brother, Bryan Santiago, said, according to NBC News.

Federal law enforcement officials investigated Santiago last year. He told FBI agents that he heard voices in his head that told him to watch Islamic State videos, but he said he was in control and had no intention of hurting anyone, according to The New York Times. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link First responders secure the area outside the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airport after the shooting.  Photo: South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP Santiago showed signs of violence and what authorities called "erratic behaviour" in the months before they said he travelled 6000 kilometres from home, loaded a gun in a baggage area and killed five people in about 80 seconds. "The area was crowded with newly-arrived passengers retrieving their luggage," according to a news release from the Department of Justice. "Santiago started shooting, aiming at his victims' heads until he was out of ammunition." SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Suspect Esteban Ruiz Santiago flew specifically to Florida to carry out the attack. Photo: Broward Sheriff's Office Santiago is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Monday at 11am before a magistrate judge in Fort Lauderdale. Investigators said on Saturday that Santiago drew frequent police attention for domestic violence in his Alaska home town and twice was arrested within the past year. Two months before the shooting, they said, he was admitted to a mental-health facility after showing up at an FBI field office and telling agents that his mind was being controlled, complaining that the government was forcing him to watch Islamic State videos. Police held his gun for a month and then gave it back to him, authorities said. Those sporadic run-ins now raise questions about how Santiago evaded detection as he boarded two flights – checking in a weapon – before he landed at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and allegedly fired at unsuspecting travellers. Investigators said they were still trying to determine if there was a terrorism motive. A day after the shooting, agents had interviewed more than 100 people, including Santiago, who surrendered after firing all of his ammunition by dropping onto the floor, spread-eagle, near a baggage area when a sheriff's deputy approached him, according to an FBI affidavit. Investigators are scouring Santiago's electronics and digital media and are trying to determine whether he had any real contact with Islamic State sympathisers, and whether that motivated him to carry out the shooting, said a law enforcement official familiar with the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "We have not ruled out anything," George Piro, the FBI special agent in charge of the bureau's Miami division, said on Saturday morning at a briefing. "We continue to look at all avenues, all motives for this attack. And we continue to look at the terrorism aspect as a motive." The bloody rampage sent people scrambling through the terminals and across the airfield at one of the country's busiest airports, shutting down all flights for hours as paramedics flooded the scene along with federal and local law enforcement officers. Six people were injured in the shooting, and dozens more were hurt in the chaos that followed. Santiago was placed in federal custody on Saturday morning, following a lengthy interview by Broward County Sheriff's deputies and FBI agents. The federal charges against him are: performing an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation that caused serious bodily injury; using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence; and causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm. The FBI is leading a sprawling investigation that spans from Florida to Alaska. Names of the victims have not yet been released, because not all families have been notified. The Associated Press reported that at least four of the five were vacationers picking up their bags before going to board cruise ships. Santiago is believed to have lived most recently in Anchorage, with a girlfriend and a young child. Neighbours said two other children also lived at the house. Local police and FBI officials in a Saturday news conference described his life as chaotic, with frequent police run-ins. At least four times in 2016, police were called to Santiago's house for physical disturbances or domestic violence. It is unclear who made those calls. In one case, he appears to have taken a plea deal and, in exchange for compliance with its terms, the charges were dismissed. When he showed up in November at the local FBI office, he had a newborn and a weapon in the car, Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley said. But in an interview at the time with the FBI, Santiago stated that "he did not wish to harm anyone," said Marlin Ritzman, special agent in charge of the FBI's Anchorage field office. "Our agents contacted local authorities who took custody of Mr Santiago and transported him to a local mental-health facility for evaluation," Ritzman said. He said that the FBI interviewed his family members, conducted database reviews and interagency checks, and ultimately closed what it termed an "assessment" of Santiago. Santiago's weapon was logged "for safekeeping," Tolley said. But one month later, the weapon was released to him. Santiago arrived in Fort Lauderdale on Friday after flying from Anchorage, with a layover in Minneapolis. He travelled alone and checked a single bag – one that contained his firearm, said Jesse Davis, chief of police at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where passengers routinely check weapons. "We're a big hunting state, so we get quite a lot of that," Davis said. Travellers are allowed to bring firearms with them onto flights as long as the guns are unloaded, locked in a hard-sided container and in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration. Ammunition can be brought onto flights but also must be placed in checked baggage. "Everything appeared normal," Davis said. Santiago checked in for his Delta flight more than four hours early, which was unusual, Davis said, but "didn't call attention to himself at all." In Fort Lauderdale, at the Terminal 2 baggage claim, Santiago picked up his bag from the carousel, went to the bathroom and loaded his Walther 9mm semi-automatic handgun, federal officials said. When he came out, he began firing, shooting the first people he encountered, according to an FBI affidavit. Mario Andrade, a driver from Carey Limousine, was waiting for his customer, Ari Fleischer, who was White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, near the bottom of the escalator in the Delta baggage area of Terminal 2. He was holding a sign with Fleischer's last name and talking on the phone with another driver. Fleischer's 12:15pm flight was late, and it was nearly 1pm. Then, Andrade heard gunfire. "It was very fast, like tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat," Andrade said. "I said, 'Oh my God, someone is shooting!' " He said that he immediately dropped to the floor, people were running and he heard screaming all around him. Andrade said he looked up and saw a man in a blue shirt who had a gun in his hand. The gunman, he said, began walking slowly toward him and had a "surprised look" on his face, "like, 'Oh my God, what happened?'

"I don't think I underestimated him, but I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation, for cyberhacking and so forth, to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating," Obama told the ABC's "This Week," according to a transcript of the interview airing on Sunday.

This Week host George Stephanopolous reminded Obama that he had dismissed Republican Mitt Romney's contention during a debate in the 2012 campaign that Russia was the biggest geopolitical threat to the United States. The report released on Friday from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Russian operatives hacked into the emails of Democratic Party officials and released them publicly to harm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and, ultimately, help Republican Donald Trump, who emerged victorious.

Trump, who has expressed scepticism over the findings, received a private briefing on the report from US officials on Friday in New York. In a statement afterward, Trump acknowledged that foreign actors from China, Russia and other countries attempt to hack into US institutions, but he emphasised that the election outcomes were not altered in any way by foreign actors. The intelligence report stated that officials did not attempt to assess the effect on the outcome. Advertisement Obama reiterated his concerns that some Republicans seem "to have more confidence in Vladimir Putin than fellow Americans because those fellow Americans were Democrats. That cannot be." Asked if Obama included Trump in that category, the president said: "We have to remind ourselves we're on the same team. Vladimir Putin's not on our team. If we get to a point where people in this country feel more affinity with a leader who is an adversary and view the United States and our way of life as a threat to him, then we're gonna have bigger problems than just cyber hacking."

In an interview on NBC's Meet The Press," Senator Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., said: "When it comes to Trump and Russia, I am really perplexed. I'm not questioning his motives. I'm questioning President-elect Trump's judgment. I don't care why the Russians hacked into our system. I don't care if they were trying to help Trump or trying to help Clinton. I want to stop it. I don't know what drives him on Russia, but I do know this. That if our policies don't change vis a vis Russia, the worst is yet to come. And the Congress is going to have a different view on Russia than the president-elect does."

Page 1 of 5. 29 Comments In preparation for Intel Kaby Lake socketed CPU benchmark results soon on Phoronix, the past number of days I have been re-tested many of the systems in our benchmark server room for comparing to the performance of the new Kaby Lake hardware. For those wanting to see how existing Intel and AMD systems compare when using Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 and the latest Linux 4.10 Git kernel, here are those benchmarks ahead of our Kaby Lake Linux CPU reviews. 26 different Intel/AMD CPUs/APUs were tested for this comparison and all of them were running Ubuntu 16.10 with the Linux 4.10 kernel. Each system had an appropriate motherboard and each system was using the maximum number of memory channels supported for the given system and at the maximum supported memory frequency. None of the CPUs in this comparison were overclocked. These tests are focusing exclusively on the CPU performance and not the graphics or storage performance due to those components varying in the test systems. Those wanting to see integrated graphics results can see yesterday's Intel IvyBridge/Haswell/Broadwell/Skylake OpenGL & Vulkan Benchmarks On Linux 4.10 + Mesa 13.1. The CPUs/APUs chosen were simply with what hardware I had available and for the systems that weren't preoccupied in other benchmarking / development tasks at Phoronix at the time of testing. Each time Ubuntu 16.10 + Linux 4.10 was cleanly installed on each of the systems and using an EXT4 file-system, the stock GCC 6.2 compiler, etc. The tests were freshly built from source and the CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS were set to "-O3 -march=native" for the built-from-source tests being configured to make use of each CPU's available instruction set extensions. All of these Intel/AMD Linux CPU benchmarks were carried out in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software. With that said, if you would like to compare how your own Linux system(s) speed compares to all of the results in this article, simply run phoronix-test-suite benchmark 1701086-RI-RACKRACK803 for your own fully-automated, side-by-side benchmark comparison.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Articles PC In Theory: Can AMD Ryzen break the Intel CPU monopoly? It's time for a processor upgrade - and 2017 could finally shake up the gaming CPU market. By Richard Leadbetter Published 08/01/2017 This week, we reviewed the Core i5 7600K, the latest mainstream gaming processor from Intel. The verdict? In line with every Intel Core i5 release since 2012, it's the fastest offering available in its price bracket and therefore the best buy. However, Intel has effectively had no rival for years now, leading to only small jumps in performance from one year to the next while graphics power has moved on from strength to strength. Genuine advances in CPU power are lacking to the point where Ars Technica wonders whether the desktop CPU is dead. We'd prefer to be a little more optimistic, and there are some promising signs that the processor market will get the shake-up it needs over the next 12-18 months. For starters, AMD is returning with a new 'Ryzen' CPU - and it's looking very promising. Little has been seen of the Ryzen processors' capabilities outside of controlled demos, but the impression AMD wants to give is that an eight core, 16 thread Ryzen processor is faster than an Intel equivalent. Multi-threaded benchmarks shown by AMD have revealed a 10 per cent advantage compared to an equivalent Core i7 6900K, something we've seen recently in an on-stage demo of video encoding using x264/x265 tool, Handbrake (video embedded below). The Ryzen chip was shown running at 3.4GHz with turbo disabled, while the Intel chip was operating at its stock performance of between 3.2GHz to 3.7GHz, depending on how the workload affects its turbo state. There are a few caveats to these demos - it would have been easy to lock the 6900K to the same 3.4GHz as the Ryzen chip for example, and it's direct IPC head-to-heads that are often most illuminating. Secondly, we have to wonder what market segment AMD is choosing for its Ryzen debut - by targeting the Core i7 6900K, it's attacking a highly lucrative market sector, the $1000 premium-price CPU. What we don't know is how much cheaper Ryzen will be, and what the timing is for taking on Intel in the mainstream gaming markets. An eight-core Ryzen chip for quad-core money seems... unlikely. Competition in the gaming segments will come, but in the meantime, Intel still has an iron grip on this market - perhaps explaining the lack of ground-breaking innovation. However, with the arrival of its new desktop Kaby Lake processors, what we are seeing is - perhaps - the final iteration of Intel's current mainstream i3/i5/i7 load-out of dual-core and quad-core chips. Kaby Lake features higher clocks and overclocking finally hits an attainable 5GHz, but we're hitting the frequency wall and further architectural advances in the desktop space are years away - so where does Intel go next? AMD big boss Lisa Su demos AMD Ryzen beating Intel Core i7 6900K in a video encoding benchmark. And it does so with a 95W TDP vs the Intel chip's 140W. Impressive. Recent roadmap leaks point towards a challenging time ahead for Chipzilla. 10nm chips dubbed 'Cannonlake' are coming, effectively shrinking the current processors (with tweaks) to a new 10nm process - but this appears to be limited to mobile CPUs only. The desktop chips will seemingly remain on 14nm and will retain the same Kaby Lake core - and the suggestion is that Intel will finally offer a six-core CPU solution to the mainstream market in order to provide a performance advantage over its existing parts. Prior to this, six, eight and ten core i7s have been restricted to the enthusiast market with hefty price-premiums to match. Will a mainstream six-core CPU result in lower prices for the still-excellent dual-core and quad-core Intel processors? Quite possibly, but this will depend on how competitive Ryzen is from a performance standpoint and the price-points AMD delivers. And it's also going to depend somewhat on how eager consumers are to embrace the new products. After all, AMD's efforts in offering performance and value in the GPU market with the RX 470 and RX 480 have made little impact on Nvidia's dominance, nor the pricing of GeForce products. In the mainstream market, the power of the brand is all-important - which may explain in part why AMD's early focus seems to be on the enthusiast high-end and server markets. Establishing credentials with enthusiasts and key opinion-formers, then scaling down is a good strategy. For Intel, moving up to six cores is the obvious solution to providing more performance when clocks can go no higher - and in theory, games should benefit. Virtually all modern games are built with current-gen consoles in mind, meaning that a new six-core i7 should offer tangible upgrade over today's quads. However, the reality is that despite widespread adoption of full multi-core support, something is holding back these chips from full utilisation - as I discovered last year when I compared the quad-core i7 6700K with the six-core 5820K and the mighty eight-core 5960X in a full-on Core i7 Face-Off. We want more cores and more performance - but these results suggest it's going to take a profound shift in game design to make the most of them. 1080p/Titan X Maxwell OC i7 6700K/ 3000MHz DDR4 i7 6700K 4.6GHz/ 3000MHz DDR4 i7 5820K/ 3200MHz DDR4 i7 5820K 4.6GHz/ 3200MHz DDR4 i7 5960X/ 3200MHz DDR4 i7 5960X 4.4GHz/ 3200MHz DDR4 Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 88.4 89.3 84.2 84.6 84.4 84.6 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA 124.4 124.7 119.4 120.8 124.4 125.5 Grand Theft Auto 5, Ultra, no MSAA 89.4 92.7 79.0 86.7 81.9 90.3 Far Cry 4, Ultra, SMAA 120.4 125.9 92.0 104.5 84.8 95.4 Shadow of Mordor, Ultra, FXAA 141.0 142.9 139.6 139.5 139.9 139.9 The Witcher 3, Ultra, HairWorks Off, Custom AA 105.8 106.4 103.4 103.4 103.5 103.8 The surprise result was that in only in the most well-threaded titles did the six and eight core chips perform better than the quad, and for the most part, the mainstream i7 6700K beat off the challenge of its competitors. A more modern Intel architecture (Skylake vs Haswell) combined with higher clocks proved decisive - and in titles run by one dominant core (the Far Cry engine is a great example of this), the 6700K didn't just inch-out the many-core competition, but clock-for-clock at 4.6GHz, it offered a 15 per cent advantage over a six-core i7 5820K. The remarkable reality is that even though we're now well into the new console era, where multi-threaded game engines are the norm, performance in PC gaming is still more reliant on efficient architecture paired with high per-core frequency than it is on core count. At this point, it's fair to say that the PC's legacy underpinnings - specifically the DirectX 11 API - are perhaps more of a serious bottleneck to performance increases. This is likely to continue because DX12 - which brings multi-core optimisation to the fore - still isn't the primary target for games developers. Instead, we've only seen DX11 ports to the new API, as opposed to new engines built from the ground up for the new technology. All of which is to say that a potential move from four to six cores for Intel will be an enthusiast crowd-pleaser, but actual performance increases in games may be fairly minimal without a profound shift in the way titles are made. It'll take time but history suggests we'll get there eventually - after all, there was a time when an Intel dual-core chip was preferable to a Core 2 Quad, a processor that proved to have a far longer lifespan overall. Rich's video review of the Core i5 7600K - by default it's the best mainstream gaming CPU, but improvements over Skylake are minimal. However, in the short term, the continuing importance of single core performance also lays down a daunting challenge to AMD: either it matches or exceeds Intel's IPC and clocks, or it provides a better balance of price vs performance. Ideally we'd like to see both but value can be defined in many ways, of course. A standard, single-socket motherboard standard with more longevity than the Intel equivalent is a good start. The new AM4 standard is looking promising here, allowing entry-level CPU and APU users to transition to full-power performance processors - though this assumes that there's not an AM4+ coming along (something we saw with both FM2 and AM3). On top of that, CES announcements appear to confirm that all Ryzen chips will have unlocked multipliers and all but the very cheapest boards will allow for overclocking. This can only be good news, adding value beyond the stock clocks. What the hell is Gamechurch? Jesus, for the win! While games are still predominantly limited by the GPU, clearly there is an opportunity here for AMD to do well in the processor market. Many gamers are still using first and second-gen Core processors, and as we discussed last year, there are still avenues available for a cheap upgrade that offers tangible leaps in performance on these older platforms - faster memory combined with an i7 upgrade can help. But in maintaining 60fps gameplay throughout, older CPUs are starting to show their age. Meanwhile, other areas in PC hardware have become much more important, making an upgrade even more compelling: the advances made in solid-state storage are profound and wider memory bandwidth is unlocking further processor performance. To get the most out of both, a CPU and motherboard upgrade is required. It's going to be a fascinating 12-18 months. If 2018's Coffee Lake is effectively another 14nm Skylake refresh with the frequency wall hit, where does Intel go from there? More CPU cores at the top-end will help, but what extras can Intel offer the mainstream - and to what extent can Ryzen shake things up? Where AMD intends to pitch its eight core/16 thread flagship processor will set the tone for the releases to come - and we can't wait to put it through its paces later this year.

Thanks -- relatively strong consumer demand with more top -- -- markets here. -- just talked about Intel last time you said first quarter would be. The start mind at that happen. What we've seen from start mine in terms of their expectations for the second quarter already happening to people ask them it's highly rated analysts who believe. That Intel's earnings per share could be as high as 61 cents for the second quarter this is stronger than consensus of 55 cents an Intel accords its own bullet forecast. So optimism about the fact that everyone was worried about what happened with PC sales of weakness there options go in that he -- what happened. Well he cells remain resilient in the first quieter on top of that analysts are very optimistic about the inventory levels and manufacturing operations of Intel. And also the new introduction of the new processor coming later this year. Therefore our analysts to believe that for the next four quarters we're gonna see an increase in earnings for print out and have the Smart business that's coming up to -- So there have to be some risk for the company what are some things that I am on the red lights and economic growth in Europe and China. And also some competition with the tablets however it's important to note that. Based on how resilient they weren't first quieter it looks it looks promising for profit expert.

Underwhelming? Maybe. Harbinger of death for the desktop CPU? Probably not. reader comments 324 Share this story Further ReadingIntel Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake review: Is the desktop CPU dead? Our review of Intel’s new flagship consumer desktop CPU, the Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K, was less-than-favorable. Out of the box, the chip runs faster than the i7-6700K that preceded it, but that’s just because it ships at a higher default clock speed. When running at the same clock speed—something easily achievable because these chips are specifically intended for overclocking—CPU and GPU performance is identical. This feeds into a growing perception that, after several years of modest-at-best performance improvements, Intel is having trouble making its processors faster. Granted, that's not a problem for many casual-to-moderate PC users, and it's not like Intel's chips haven't improved in other big ways in the last half-decade. Power consumption is down, battery life is up, and integrated graphics performance isn't nearly as laughable as it was ten years ago. But for high-end pro users who don't want to spend $1,000 or more on a processor, the lack of performance improvements in Intel's mainstream quad-core desktop processors in particular has been frustrating. This is an unfortunate reality brought on by the difficulties Intel is having switching to new process architectures. Moving from the 22nm process to the 14nm process in 2013 and 2014 caused several delays that pushed back the launch of the Broadwell architecture and protracted its rollout. The move from 14nm to 10nm is proving even more difficult, breaking Intel's longstanding “tick-tock” development model in which it changed manufacturing processes every two years. If leaked roadmaps are correct, “Cannonlake” laptop chips may move to the 10nm process at the tail end of 2017. But the “Coffee Lake” desktop chips will remain on the 14nm process until well into 2018. If you don’t know why this is a big deal, here’s a brief explainer: a manufacturing process shrink makes it possible to fit more transistors in a smaller amount of space and reduce the amount of electrical current needed to switch transistors on and off (the type of material used and the type of transistor, two other things that Intel and others often change when they change processes, affects power usage too). This lets chip companies add more features and improve performance (usually by adding more transistors) while keeping power consumption at around the same level as before (or sometimes reducing it). Without process shrinks, improving performance without also hurting battery life becomes that much more difficult. That's Intel's current predicament. But it doesn’t mean that desktop performance needs to stop improving. It just means that Intel needs to do things a little differently if it wants to make those improvements. Adding more cores Surprise! Adding more cores makes CPUs faster. The 10-core and 8-core chips are well ahead of the dual- and quad-core offerings in multi-threaded tasks, regardless of architecture. The most obvious way to improve performance, at least in desktops, is to add more cores. This was what both Intel and AMD started doing a little over a decade ago when improving performance primarily through clock-speed increases began to become more difficult. And desktops have more room for cooling fans, which means that there’s headroom to push their maximum power consumption up without straining systems too badly; a mainstream quad-core desktop processor from Intel today has a TDP of 65W where a mainstream desktop Pentium 4 chip had a TDP of 115W. We wouldn’t want to return to 2004’s power consumption levels, but there’s some wiggle room. In fact, Intel already does this in its small enthusiast processor lineup. Six, eight, and ten-core processors with a 140W TDP already exist, and multi-core performance is excellent. But these CPUs are ridiculously expensive—you could build a respectable quad-core gaming computer for the cost of the $1000-ish eight-core chip, to say nothing of the $1700 ten-core version. They also use more expensive motherboards with chipsets that are updated less regularly, and they usually trail Intel’s flagship processor architectures by 12 to 18 months. Finally, they need more robust quad-channel memory controllers to keep all of those cores fed compared to the dual-channel controllers in mainstream processors. All those controllers add even more transistors and complexity. Further ReadingIntel pushes out the rest of its Kaby Lake processors for 2017’s PCs Even with those downsides, adding more cores is probably the easiest and best way to boost performance at the high-end and convince consumers to replace that three-to-five-year-old PC. Enough apps are built to take advantage of multiple cores that users would see benefits immediately. Intel’s Turbo Boost tech (particularly Turbo Boost 3.0, introduced in the aforementioned Broadwell-E CPUs but not available anywhere else yet) can maintain good performance for single-threaded or lightly threaded tasks. If the leaked roadmaps we cited before are to be believed, Intel may be planning to do this when the “Coffee Lake” processors are released in 2018. The highest-end versions of these CPUs on the roadmap are six-core part, giving users a reason to be optimistic about Intel’s fourth (!) CPU architecture shipped using some version of its 14nm process. Still, it’s disappointing that Intel has taken this long to improve its mainstream desktop processor performance, and the company could still decide to price those high-end chips far above the prices that current quad-core processors command. Luckily, some serious competition at the high end could both speed Intel up and force its prices down. Competitive pressure from AMD... and from Intel? AMD talks a big game with its upcoming desktop processors. AMD The underlying platform looks modern, at any rate. AMD Let’s begin by saying that no one in the last decade has lost money by underestimating AMD. The company’s “Bulldozer” architecture and its many descendants could never rise above mediocrity, and Intel has shut AMD out of the mid-to-high-end desktop market and almost every segment of the laptop market. AMD has a history of over-promising and under-delivering, and if Intel’s recent CPU launch delays have been disappointing, AMD’s delays are just business as usual. That said! Given what little we’ve seen about AMD’s upcoming Zen architecture (now called “Ryzen,” pronounced rye-zen), AMD might conceivably challenge Intel at the mid-to-high end of the market for the first time in years. AMD is boasting that a high-end Zen chip with eight cores and sixteen threads can hold its own with the $1,000 Intel chip we highlighted above. If AMD can deliver a full range of dual-, quad-, hexa-, and octa-cores alongside an appealing AM4 platform that provides PCI Express-based storage and integrated 10Gbps USB 3.1 gen 2—and if it can do so while significantly undercutting Intel on price—AMD could definitely regain some credibility with the enthusiast crowd. The rise of Ryzen is obviously a good thing, even if you don't want to buy into an AMD platform. If Intel feels threatened, it will be quicker to drop prices and introduce new chips to counter AMD’s. Intel just hasn’t had a reason to feel threatened in a while. Further ReadingAMD’s Zen CPU is now called Ryzen, and it might actually challenge Intel But even if AMD never fulfills its promises, Intel still has one big competitor in this space: itself. If you pay attention to the slides in Intel’s presentations and its message in recent ads, you may have noticed that the company hardly mentions AMD at all. It doesn’t spend much time comparing its newest chips to the previous generation, either. What the company focuses on overwhelmingly is PCs from about five years ago. The PC market is saturated, which means most computers sold are replacing an older one. What Intel has to do is convince you that you need a new computer, and none of the chips from the last two or three years has made a great argument for that. Processors are complicated, and two to three years normally elapse between the start of development and shipping them to consumers. Let’s assume that, as of 2013 or even 2014, Intel assumed it could still rely on the same tick-tock engine that kept things marching forward. Intel wouldn’t need to overhaul its lineup to keep selling chips because it would be able to improve speed and power consumption enough that there would be clear benefits to upgrading every three years or so, give or take a year. Now say that somewhere between the official announcement of the Kaby Lake refresh in 2015 and the public death of the tick-tock model in early 2016, Intel saw the writing on the wall and decided it couldn't just rely on improved manufacturing tech to speed up its chips. Assuming a two-to-three year lead time for new architectures, it makes sense that we won’t see six-core mainstream desktop chips from Intel until 2018. Intel just didn’t know that it would need them to keep incentivizing upgrades until pretty late in the game. Whatever the catalyst ends up being, there’s still life in the desktop CPU. Plenty of people get by with fanless convertible laptops and lightweight Ultrabooks, but people in STEM fields, graphic design, publishing, photo and video production, gaming, app development, and elsewhere can still benefit from high-end processors that are both relatively speedy and relatively affordable. For an unusually long period of time, that sweet spot has been occupied by quad-core CPUs from Intel. But in the next year or two, more competition and realigned priorities ought to get things moving again.

This news follows the partnership that was announced between the BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye in July of last year. The companies have since developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to pursue state of the art designs and create differentiated brands. The offerings scale from individual key integrated modules to a complete end-to-end solution providing a wide range of differentiated consumer experiences. "Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye,” said Klaus Fröhlich, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development. “This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles. Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies – manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies – to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform. This year our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle.”  “From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform. The car to cloud system will perform with consistent, predictable behaviour and is validated to the highest level of safety,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “That’s why this partnership is breaking new ground.  We have established a dedicated team with clear, shared goals and a culture of innovation and agility and accountability.” “Over the last six months, we have made very good progress in designing a state-of-the-art solution for autonomous driving on both highways and in urban areas. The solution has been defined in a scalable manner to allow affiliate automakers to meet their unique needs,” said Mobileye co-founder, chairman and CTO Professor Amnon Shashua. As part of this partnership, the BMW Group will be responsible for driving control and dynamics, evaluation of overall functional safety including setting up a high performance simulation engine, overall component integration, production of prototypes and eventually scaling the platform via deployment partners. Intel brings to the partnership innovative high performance computing elements that span from the vehicle to the data center. The newly launched Intel GO solution for autonomous driving offers world class processor and FPGA technologies for the most efficient balance of performance and power, while meeting the stringent thermal and safety requirements of the automotive industry. Within the car, the Intel GO solution offers a scalable development and compute platform for critical functions including sensor fusion, driving policy, environment modelling, path planning and decision making.  In the data center, Intel GO offers a wide range of technologies ranging from the high performance Intel Xeon processors, to Intel Arria 10 FPGAs and Intel Solid State Drives to the Intel Nervana platform for artificial intelligence that provides a powerful machine and deep learning training and simulation infrastructure required for the autonomous driving industry. Mobileye contributes its proprietary EyeQ 5 high-performance computer vision processor offering automotive-grade functional safety and low-power performance. The EyeQ 5 is responsible for processing and interpretation of input from the 360-degree surround view vision sensors as well as localization. EyeQ 5, in combination with Intel CPU and FPGA technologies, which forms the Central Computing Platform to be integrated into each autonomous vehicle. Mobileye will further collaborate with the BMW Group to develop the sensor fusion solution, creating a full model of the environment surrounding the vehicle, using input from vision, radar, and lidar sensors. As well as establishing a driving policy, including Mobileye’s reinforcement learning algorithms used to endow the vehicle system with the artificial intelligence required to safely negotiate complex driving situations. To further propel the development of the autonomous platform, the partnership plans to release hardware samples and software updates in the upcoming years. The BMW iNEXT model, which will be introduced in 2021, will be the foundation for BMW Group’s autonomous driving strategy. Following this vehicle, a range of highly automated models from all BMW Group brands will follow. – TradeArabia News Service Tags: Intel | BMW | autonomous vehicles | Mobileye | More Motoring Stories BMW i pilots augmented reality product visualiser Dubai Taxi set to launch smart car recovery project Toyota launches new bold, stylish 2017 Corolla Souq.com launches new automotive section Fiat Chrysler accused of emissions cheating Al Haddad Motors presents Fab 5 Volkswagen 2016 sales top 10m vehicles Volkswagen agrees $4.3bn settlement in emissions case Dubai RTA in deal with Uber to deploy 14,000 cars McLaren reports record sales growth in 2016 Hertz connects vehicles with Orange IoT solutions Ebrahim K Kanoo sponsors Japan National Day reception Infiniti showcases 'co-pilot' technology BlackBerry offers advanced OS for automotive sector BMW Group appoints head of corporate communications Michelin selected as official tyre partner for Roborace Nissan looks to ‘zero-emission, zero-fatality’ future Nissan announces key breakthrough technologies, tieups Hyundai unveils vision for hyper-connected car New colour scheme for Dubai metro feeder buses Dubai plans 64 initiatives for taxi service Dubai’s RTA links 4,500 taxis with GPS system Du provides Dubai Taxi with wi-fi, smart screen 35pc of UAE drivers to pay more for insurance Dollar Rent A Car opens new branch in Muscat airport Bahrain F1 race tickets go on sale Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Still, real 5G might be years away from being a reality.More There’s a continuing argument in the wireless industry over 5G — even what it actually will look like — but that’s not stopping companies like Intel from pushing forward with efforts to at least attain 5G speeds during 2017. Intel is showing off at CES 2017 a sample of its 5G modem, which according to press materials will attain speeds of over 5Gbps. While no speed standard has been set by the industry, it’s generally agreed that 5G networks will offer multigigabit-per-second connections. Intel’s 5G modem also attains the ultra low latency and bandwidth aggregation sought by the industry as part of transition to 5G. More: AT&T lays out its 2017 5G deployment plans In more layman’s terms, in order for our wireless networks to attain those crazy speeds, devices will need to mesh together several channels of downstream data to do so. At the same time, to make all of these new technologies truly work over wireless — say augmented reality or AI-infused autonomous vehicles — you’ll need to reduce lag to almost nil to make them viable in real-time applications. Intel hopes to have samples ready by the second half of this year, with full production starting soon after. But in the interest of accuracy, we should mention that this “5G” is really just an effort to make today’s technology work in a next-generation like manner rather than a full-blown new standard. “Today’s communications systems weren’t designed to accommodate the massive bandwidth required to support such an evolution, or the ultra-low latency needed to allow devices or even vehicles to react to split-second events,” said Aicha Evans, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel’s Communication and Devices Group. What the Intel 5G modem does is take several different current technologies, including both sub-6Ghz and mmWave capabilities and MIMO. Some of these are key parts of the 3GPP 5G new radio technology, and the company says that’s by design. “Our goal is to support both early trials and to lay a foundation enabling accelerated development of products that will support the 3GPP NR specification and help drive global adoption of the 3GPP 5G standard,” Evans adds. Standard or not, it’s clear the industry is clamoring for 5G. When we actually get there though is another question — and it’s likely that we won’t see true 5G for many more years to come. There's no HTC Vive 2 (yet), but a wireless upgrade and new peripherals are incoming AT&T will begin testing 5G network technologies in Texas later this year Start getting ready for 5G!

In the past, this was a technology only reserved for Core i5 and Core i7 series processors, but times have changed. When Intel rolled out the Kaby Lake desktop processor lineup earlier this week we were excited about the Intel Core i3-7350K processor. The Intel Core i3-7350K is an interesting part it is a dual-core unlocked K-sku processor with relatively high clock speeds (4.2GHz) and hyper-threading technology for a modest $168. Not bad for a chip that has 4MB of L3 cache, Intel HD 630 graphics and a TDP of just 60 Watts. While we were meeting with Intel at CES 2017 we were shown a demo on an Intel Core i3-7350K processor overclocked to 5.0GHz. Not bad for a CPU that comes from Intel without Turbo Boost being enabled. Intel was using Mini-ITX Small Form Factor (SFF) system and was using a Corsair H115i CPU liquid cooler to pull off the rather impressive overclock. Intel Kaby Lake processors all seem to overclock to 5.0GHz and beyond, so we are really excited about the headroom in this new 14nm processor series. Intel ran Cinebench R15 on the system and got an overall score of 514 points on the standard CPU test that runs on all available cores/threads and then 204 points on the CPU single core test. We took a peak at the CPU core voltage in CPU-Z to see what Intel was using on the MSI Z270 mini-ITX board and the software was showing it was using 1.440V, which isn’t too bad. Single-threaded performance looks great on this processor, so we see it being a hit for those that can get away with two physical cores. A dual-core processor with Hyper-Threading running at 5 GHz yields a very responsive system when combined with a SATA SSD or PCIe SSD. Those looking for a low-cost build should be able to build a system around this processor and use a low-cost high-capacity hard drive and then a 16GB Intel Optane Memory M.2 solution to also have a peppy little system without breaking the bank. We have an Intel Core i3-7350K processor being delivered this week and will have our own in-depth review and analysis real soon. We are excited by Intel’s teaser and hope you are as well! Paulo Felisberto Not that impressive if it requires a Z motherboard. Maybe if some vendor releases BIOS for H110 or B150/B250 Motherboards, it turns diferente as it worked with old Pentium K G3258 Terry Perry Like my 6350 AMD 6 core. Tried to load Titan 2 the game came on and said the game needs a Real 4 core to run.go get the I7. gerwingr Exciting, i say that because, i am so finding that going from 32 bit to 64 bit operating system: that core speed, and fast hard drive response, is so needed. i have championed my getting my video work done on x58 operating platforms. i have moved from 920’s to 960’s and am in the blueprint of getting to where many of you have been for years. i have purchased a 980x and have on call a 990, what i have found, is higher clock, and limited threads, still gets my video work done quicker, what i speculate is, my program is one or two core efficient ” that”s all ” call me out on my errors, but going up to 4 Ghz. has made a striking improvement. So, i would like to follow these benchmarks with an i3, and go to the z270 platform, to get the equivalent or better. then on craigslist, goes all my old hardware. i would like to follow along on your test and set up, and build two systems. i know of x99 v3, ” like it, but still retro imo” i think you can get me into ddr4 with this, and i won’t stay stuck with ddr3 🙂 ., cheers, love reading your set ups, builds, and testing, thomas, gx, vancouver canada, best 2017 to yourselves and readers.

A few weeks later, he was 35 in a Vocativ story about Obama voters who wound up voting for Donald Trump. “I think people who felt like an underdog might have identified with Trump more, because he was being picked on so much,” Nainan said. “I felt it was very liberating to vote for him and thumb my nose at everybody.” There he was again in Cosmopolitan in July. This time he was a millennial who swore off porn. “Of course I liked looking at it, but after awhile, something about it struck me as wrong,” he said. He claimed once in an interview that the website Help a Reporter Out had gotten him “100 media placements, large and small” by 2013, from Fox News to CNN to NPR. For reporters, Nainan’s a unicorn: a punctual, on-topic, quasi-funny man with a hell of a life story. Just ask Forbes. Nainan left his career as a senior engineer at Intel to travel the world and tell jokes. Twenty-eight countries and a Tesla, all by the age of 35. He’s performed for Donald Trump. He’s met Hillary Clinton. Barack Obama endorsed him in a four-second YouTube video. And on Sept. 11, 2001, while at Intel, Nainan “was able to watch both towers fall from his corner in Manhattan, NYC,” according to Business Insider in 2011. “After watching so many people die right in front of him, he realized that he needed a change. He left his job to pursue comedy full time,” Business Insider’s Personal Branding Blog wrote. Wait a minute. “A few years prior to September 11th, 2001, Dan Nainan was a senior engineer with Intel Corp.,” the story reads. It’s written by Millennial Branding LLC media branding expert Bill Connolly. “His job was to travel the world with Chairman Andy Grove, doing technical demonstrations on stage at events.” After years of giving technical demonstrations with the chairman of Intel, millennial Dan Nainan, then 20 years old, watched the towers fall from his corner office as a senior engineer, and decided he needed a career change? “His story is incredible, though as we are learning, not unique,” Connolly writes.

Nainan was 36 in 2012 in The Wall Street Journal, but 31 in The New York Times in the same year. In 2006, he remembered when he got the bug to do comedy: In 1998, while he was working as a senior engineer at Intel. As a 17-year-old. Then, there it is on paper: a Maryland traffic court case from last year. “Failure to display registration card upon demand by police officer.” Daniel Nainan of New York City. Date of birth: May 1961. And then, for good measure, there’s a Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department incident report for the time a sprightly 32-year-old Nainan punched then-Daily Beast reporter Josh Rogin after he made fun of his set at a D.C. comedy club in 2013. (Rogin and I have never met, for what it’s worth.) Under “exact age or range” it says this: 52. Nainan pleaded guilty and served probation. A Virginia speeding ticket in the database Lexis-Nexis says Nainan was pulled over for speeding in 1987. The ticket is so old that it’s not retrievable anywhere but on archived public-records searches. Fairfax County General District Court only retains records for resolved traffic cases for 10 years, according to both a FCGDC spokesperson and Virginia law. Millennial Dan Nainan would’ve had to have been a 6-year-old with a speeding ticket. “He’s been called that several times,” said Rob Maher, who has been sparring with Nainan for years now, of Nainan being described as a millennial. “He’s obsessed with being 20 years younger than he really is.” Millennial millionaire Dan Nainan is 55 years old. He doesn’t really even look 35. If you Google Dan Nainan, it will say his age: 55 years old. There’s even a website called ComedianDanNainanIsOver50YearsOldAndHisFollowersAreFake.com. Last week, one of the world’s most successful international comedians, Russell Peters, called him a “sociopath that is a 55yr old man child” on Twitter. Nainan used to open for him. It is not a well-kept secret. So why is he telling every journalist he can find that he’s something else? And why hasn’t anybody told them? *** The first of the few hundred angry emails Joe Robinson got from Dan Nainan came a little while after they did a show together at a Hyatt in Bethesda, Maryland. Joe was the headliner and Dan was the emcee. “It went all right. After the show, he sold a book, a DVD, and a CD. He did eight minutes of comedy. So I decided to say something about it, about how he shouldn’t be selling a book about how to make it in comedy if he’s emceeing at a Hyatt,” Robinson said. He then brought up the exchange on his podcast with Maher, a fellow D.C.- and Baltimore-based comedian. “He’s had a long reputation of having battles with comics. I didn’t know that,” said Robinson. “To be frank with you, I never would’ve said anything if I had known that back then.” Ever since, Robinson has been on an infamous email chain featuring every comic who has ever slighted Dan Nainan. “I’ve gotten, without exaggeration, 300 emails,” he said. Sometimes the emails were only addressed to him. Sometimes they were to every comic, dozens of them, all lumped in together. At their peak, they’d come a few times per day. The gist of the emails? Nainan would go down his rival comics’ tour dates and alert them to the much bigger room he would be performing at halfway across the world on the same day. “He loves to say comedians are drunks and drug addicts, and he likes to champion that he’s a clean-living person,” said Maher. That’s just the start of it. “He can play 19 instruments. He speaks x number of languages fluently, flies first class, drives a Tesla. I’ve never met anybody that cared more about what other people thought,” said Robinson. “Did he tell you about how he’s able to slam dunk a basketball?” There were times, Robinson said, where it got out of hand. Robinson claims Nainan called his bosses at his day job at one point to try to get him fired. “I saw him. I made fun of him. I just made fun of the practice of what he was doing once. He went through a criminal history. He talked to my employers,” said Robinson. “Then there was that email he offered to fight me to the death on the Isle of Man.” That’s not a joke. “Yeah, he gave places you’re allowed to legally fight to the death,” said Maher. “No, we’re not going to fight you to the death. By the way, my buddy has kids. He’s gonna fight to the death? Just be 55. It’s OK.” All of this because Joe made fun of him for selling a book at a Hyatt? “If you think this is bad, you should talk to J-L Cauvin,” said Robinson. *** “I became his enemy No. 1,” said J-L Cauvin. Cauvin is a part-time comic who’s also a lawyer in New York. He doesn’t have many dates booked nowadays, he said, but he is a regular on The Adam Carolla Show. He spends a lot of time wondering what it’s going to take to break through, if he’s on the precipice of something big, or if he said the wrong thing to the wrong booker along the way. One time, he wrote a blog post about “how feature acts are being squeezed out of comedy, like the middle class in America.” He mentioned corporate comedians, ones who play birthday parties and company meetings for cash. He mentioned Dan Nainan. “He wrote about 40 comments under his real name under the post,” said Cauvin. “He’s never subtle about this stuff.” After his blog post, Cauvin made the email list. Probably the top of the list. “I became the go-to,” said Cauvin. “In the mass emails, I’m the one he’s calling out a lot of the time. I’m the specific target. They were insane and mean-spirited emails. It took a turn for the aggressive." Then, by some miracle, the emails stopped. And that miracle was Patrick Melton. Melton was on the list. He has a comedy podcast called Nobody Likes Onions. He knows Joe and Rob and J-L and a lot of the other people on the chain. “I kept badgering [Nainan] to do the podcast. I said, ‘I’ll let you talk as much as you want.’ I knew if I didn’t have him come on, I’d regret it,” Melton said. “I don’t get it because he’s successful. He goes to do these corporate gigs. I’d imagine he makes a half-million a year doing comedy. It seems to drive him nuts he doesn’t have respect. I don’t get why he needs approval of these ‘nobodies,’ as he calls them.” Plus, Melton was not particularly worried about a visit to the Isle of Man. “I’m a big dude, anyway,” he said. Nainan shows up on the podcast in April 2015. He lies about his age. He says, jokingly, over and over that he’s 74. Otherwise, the show goes smoothly. Joe Robinson and a few other comics call in and Melton plays mediator. “After the show, I say, ‘We should get all the comics you hated on, the ones you emailed, and let’s put on a charity show.’ He agreed to do all that. He took a photo with me. He seemed happy,” said Melton. “Then he left.” Within 20 minutes of leaving, Nainan blocked Melton and his podcast on Twitter and never answered an email from him again, Melton said. “Whatever that interview did broke him. He stopped the emails to everybody. He stopped harassing me entirely,” he said. So that might be why Nainan, a 55-year-old man, winds up giving millennial sex tips in Cosmo in July and nobody corrects it until months later. Cauvin said he feels bad for him a little bit, but he also doesn’t want the emails to restart. “I feel bad, but it also feels like there’s some sort of danger to it. Other than speaking to you, I, for the most part, have abstained from talking about it. It’s 85 percent because I don’t want to bother him,” said Cauvin. “It’s like Catch Me if You Can. That’s what I’m worried about, is that one day he’ll get a movie out of his bad behavior.” After all, if this is a bit, it’s the best bit Dan Nainan has ever dreamed up. He’s duped the media countless times just by going onto a help-a-reporter website. Even if it isn’t a bit, why wouldn’t he just pretend it was? It’s so transparent. He doesn’t look 35. Every official record says he was born in May 1961. Why won’t he just admit to it? “If your article ends up being a big thing, the real joke is that he’ll end up optioning his story,” said Cauvin. “Then he really will be rich.” *** Forbes had just pulled its story on Dan, along with the accompanying video calling him a “Millennial Funnyman,” when I emailed him last Thursday. People had been tweeting about his age. Eleven minutes later, I got a response. “You’re doing a story about a story? Now that’s a first!” Nainan wrote. He followed it with a smiley face. I know. Pretty weird, I told him. “But, yeah, it appears to be scrubbed from the internet because of discrepancies about your age, which is the second time it happened in the last few months,” I said. “So are you 35 or 55? It appears from a couple of official documents you’re 55.” This time Nainan replied in 18 minutes. He ignored the question. “You might enjoy this—my goal for next year is to get a sitcom made which closely parallels my life. I’m pitching it as Seinfeld meets Silicon Valley,” he wrote. He then attached the screenplay. “Logline: After suffering a traumatic brain injury, an introverted Intel engineer terrifies his parents by deciding to pursue his dream of becoming the only half-Indian, half-Japanese comedian in the world, and opens the country’s first all-clean comedy club.” Then, a few minutes later, he sent over his hospital admission paperwork for the brain injury. It says he checked into Bellevue Hospital on December 16, 2015. No birthday. I asked him again: Wouldn’t this be a good place to start telling people your real age? Nothing. The next day, I called Dan. His cellphone number was on his website. I told him: Cosmo just ran a correction. They know you’re 55. “I just don’t think there’s any benefit to me commenting. It is what it is,” he said. “Just to see what’s going on with Twitter and all this stuff, it’s amazing that people would be so concerned about someone that isn’t on the radar. I’m not well-known in any shape or form. It’s really amusing to me to have all this going on. It’s quite amusing.” That’s understandable. So why not just give your real age? “The thing of it is, there’s no benefit. Whatever I say, it’s not going to matter,” he said. “I’ve been trying to get clubs and agents and Comedy Central to notice me. Nobody paid me even a second of time. I’ve performed for the president, president-elect, Hillary. I’ve been to 28 countries. I’ve tried and tried and tried to get on TV. I can’t even perform at the local clubs.” That’s when I asked him about Joe Robinson. “That guy went on and posted a whole bunch of lies,” he said. “I contacted an attorney. I was seriously thinking of suing him for everything he had. He didn’t have any money. The ones who criticize me the most are the ones who are the least successful.” I said I understood. “The only way I’ve gotten attention is with this, of all things. I friggin’ hate this industry so much and the people in it. I’m flying first class around the world. Despite what these people say, I’m a happy guy. I’ve done all of this with nobody’s help. I did it all myself,” he said. “The only time that anyone has paid attention to me is when something like this happens.” I get it, I told him. It’s time to tell the whole story, I said. Being in your forties and leaving Intel to become a millionaire comedian is even more impressive than some guy in his twenties making it in comedy like everybody else, right? We talked for a half-hour. After a long discussion about internet hate mobs, he asked, “Are you threatening me?” with the internet hate mob. I told him I’m not. I just want to hear your real story, I said. At points, he asked if I was being pressured by an editor to publish the story, if he could ask for it not to be published, if he could make all the stuff he previously said off the record. I told him no, no, and that he couldn’t. At one point he asked, “Can it get any worse?” Finally, I laid it all out. I have official state documents with his real age on them. They’re public records. His timeline with Intel doesn’t make any sense. He gives different ages at different times depending on which publication he’s talking to. It’s all over. It’s OK. The jig is up. So tell me, are you 35 or 55? Then a pause. “I’m 35,” he said. “The mistake is in my birth record.” A few minutes later, he said he wanted to talk to his lawyer before he said anything else. The next day, in an email, I asked him to show me any document proving a mistake in his birth record, or that his real age is 35. I called him back repeatedly to ask for comment on this and other specific allegations Joe and Rob and Patrick and J-L have made. Nainan never responded. At press time, his website was no longer online. *** Rob Maher said Dan asked him if he wanted to be on a reality-TV show a few years ago. “It was something about ‘people think that you’re lying but you’re not and you want to prove it to them.’ He wanted me and Joe to go on his show,” said Maher. So, Maher said, to prove that he was “talking to the producer,” Nainan showed him a screenshot of a call log on his phone. “It’s an 800 number. He was calling the switchboard of the network,” he said. “In the same screenshot, he has Barack Obama calling him. Like, it says ‘Barack Obama.’ He’s trying to get us to believe he’s talking to the president about who knows what.” Maybe it’s a bit? “He’s not funny enough to do that as a joke,” said Maher. “It would be funny if it was performance art. But it’s not. He does this constantly.” Cauvin has a brother who works at The New York Times, in which Nainan has appeared at least six times. He believes what Maher just said—that Nainan’s antics are not funny enough to be a joke, and not unbelievable enough to be worth making up—is what got him this far. “It reminds me of Sean Connery in The Untouchables. He says, ‘Who would claim to be that who is not?’ Why would I claim to be 35? Exactly! Nobody ever cares enough to check. He’s built an empire out of lies and manipulation,” said Cauvin. “Other than that, he’s a really good guy and a good comedian.” He’s joking, if you can’t tell. After all this, it’s hard to know anymore. “Comedy is a tough business,” said Cauvin. “You can either deal with it and grit through it, or you can create an alternate universe.” READ THIS LIST 1 The Media’s Favorite ‘Millennial’ Is 55 Ben Collins About Advertise Contact Jobs Help Privacy Community Policy Terms & Conditions Copyright & Trademark © 2017 The Daily Beast Company LLC

(Photo : Mike Coppola/Getty Images for DELL) Dell has recently announced its improved Dell XPS 15 for 2017 during the Consumer Electronics Show and it's good for it's patrons. The Dell XPS 15 is already impressive but the company has decided to listen to its customers rather doing what they want.  Although the overall performance of the Dell XPS 15 was as good as its competitors, there are still some issues that their customers raised -- like battery life and speed. This time, Dell made sure that consumers will appreciate the new enhancement on the device. The specs of the new XPS 15 varies and consumers will get to choose what type they. However, all types of the model laptop sports a 15.6-inch Full HD screen with touch screen capability that is optional. Last year's XPS 15 ran an Intel Skylake CPU, but the 2017 version will have the latest 7th Gen Intel Kaby Lake processor to solve heating problems. This change in processor will ensure that the laptop can perform its full potential. What's more interesting is that Dell incorporated the latest Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU for more graphics improvement, Digital Trends reported. Simply put, Dell has just made a powerful laptop for a mid-sized machine. However, the Intel Kaby Lake CPU varies and has three options: the dual-core Core i3-7100H, Quad-core Core i5-7300HQ and the Core i7-7700HQ. There is need not worry about the performance messing up on the battery life because the Intel Kaby Lake processors will take care of it with an increased battery life of up to 97 watt-hours, PC World reported. Dell also made the XPS 15 work with most professionals as it upgraded the new 32GB of RAM. The new XPS 15 also has an upgraded 1535 Wi-Fi chipset for better connection. The device includes wired ports such as HDMI, two 3.0 USB ports, a USB Type-C port and SD card reader. As for the storage options, users can opt to use the traditional 500MB of hybrid drive or a 1TB hard drive that is paired with the M.2 drive with the use of the Intel Smart Response Technology caching. Users can also choose to go on a straight M.2 PCle SSD with 256GB, 512GB or 1 TB capacity.

PC Gamer News Reviews Hardware Pro Best Of More Magazine Meet the team Newsletter Signup Community Guidelines Affiliate Links Search Popular Mass Effect Hardware Guides Games of 2017 Overwatch Best RPGs Star Wars on PC Worst Ports Gigabyte has a range of new Kaby Lake gaming laptops By Matt Porter Powerful and slim. Shares Gigabyte had a range of new laptops to show off at CES this year, each featuring Intel's new Kaby Lake generation of processors, and pretty powerful graphics cards too. The P56 is a 15.6-inch laptop which comes with an optional 4K display if you want it. The processor is the new Core i7-7700HQ, and to run that high resolution it has a GTX 1080 graphics card. The laptop has a Thunderbolt 3 port, and a fancy keyboard with per-key RGB lighting.  The Sabre 15 will also have a 7th generation Intel processor, and but isn't quite as beefy as the P56 as you only get a choice of a GTX 1050 Ti or a GTX 1050. Still, these cards will run games at 1080p medium/high just fine, and you get the same RGB backlit keyboard. (You can get a good estimate of 1050/1050 Ti performance from our desktop GPU reviews.) There's also the Aero 14, which comes with a GTX 1060 running a decent 2560x1440 IPS screen. Gigabyte also showed off what it calls the "world's lightest 14-inch GTX 1050 Ti laptop" in the P34, which weighs just 3.73lbs. Plus, the company is boasting the "world's slimmest 15.6-inch GTX 1070 laptop," which is 20.9mm and has a rather tasty 3840x2160 IPS display. It also houses a swappable bay that allows you to swap between a Blu-ray drive or 2TB of extra HDD storage. Gigabyte hasn't announced the prices of these laptops yet, nor do we know when exactly they'll be released, so keep an eye on PC Gamer for more information soon.

Supercomputers the size of a credit card, 4K TVs as thin as wallpaper, and smartphones that can 3D map their environment were just a few of the inventions showcased during this year’s exhibition. But while CES can be a showcase for trends that are likely to dominate the tech world over the coming months, it’s also home to the bizarre and strange. This year’s conference, which officially concluded on Jan. 8, included demonstrations of everything from “smart” hairbrushes to “intelligent” toothbrushes and shoes that suck up dust and crumbs as you walk. Here’s a look at some of the strangest devices from the CES show floor this year. View as 1 of 10 Replay SHARE Kérastase Hair Coach Powered by Withings L'Oréal You know what your next hair brush really needs? No, not softer bristles or a rounder shape for easier styling — an Internet connection. That’s what L’Oréal, Nokia-owned fitness tech startup Withings, and luxury haircare company Kérastase are betting. The three companies collaborated on a smart hairbrush with a microphone that “listens” to the sound of hair brushing, as well as an accelerometer, gyroscope and other sensors. The brush then feeds data to a mobile app, with the goal being to prevent users from damaging their hair. The most surprising aspect may be its price; the brush will retail for “under $200” when it launches in mid-2017, making it pricier than even most high-end hairbrushes. Replay SHARE Hushme Voice Mask Roman Sakun via YouTube We’ve all been stuck next to that loud person bellowing over the phone, whether it be at a coffee shop, on a bus, or while waiting at the airport. The HushMe aims to get rid of these unpleasant encounters, but in a seemingly uncomfortable and utterly bizarre way. The HushMe consists of a pair of earbuds attached to a padded mask that covers the wearer’s mouth to muffle his or her voice while speaking. It doesn’t look like an accessory most would choose to wear. Replay SHARE Swagtron Swagsurf Electric Surfboard Swagtron Swagtron is hoping that the electric “hoverboards” that dominated 2016 will be equally as popular with the beach crowd. The company debuted the Swagsurf, a $2,400 motor-powered surfboard that can reach up to 15 miles per hour on water, during this year’s conference. Let’s just hope the Swagsurf’s battery isn’t as prone to overheating as those found in Swagtron’s older Swagway scooters. Replay SHARE Denso Vacuum Shoes CES is full of peculiar home products, but perhaps the oddest came from Japanese firm Denso. The company showcased a pair of vacuum-cleaning shoes capable of sucking up dirt as you walk. The heel includes a pedal which activates the motor, as CNET explains, prompting the shoe to inhale nearby debris and store it in a tiny box in the shoe’s sole. It’s a concept in the prototype stage, so there’s a slim chance you’ll ever be able to wear Denso’s housecleaning footwear. Replay SHARE Uzer Eugene Trash Scanner Uzer French company Uzer wants us to think twice before throwing something in the trash. Its Eugene gadget tells users how to sort recycling and trash items by scanning its barcode, assuming the product packaging is still in good enough shape to do so. Each time an item is scanned, the app stores it so that it can easily be reordered. Replay SHARE Hypersuit VR Simulator Hypersuit VR, the-ory.com Virtual reality can trick your mind into feel like you’re standing on the edge of a cliff or using a jetpack to soar above the clouds. But it does little else to simulate the sensation of movement, which is where the Hypersuit comes in. The simulator is a massive exosuit that can be controlled via arm movements while lying on the device. This, its creators hope, will make the virtual reality experience all the more convincing. Replay SHARE Jagger & Lewis Smart Dog Collar Jagger & Lewis Wearable tech is usually easy to find on the CES showroom floor, but most of these gadgets are typically meant to monitor a person’s health and activity. This isn’t the case for Jagger & Lewis’ latest product, which it bills as a high-tech dog collar that can help owners understand how their pets are feeling. It claims to detect changes in behavior, which can make it easier for dog caretakers to pick up on illnesses earlier. Replay SHARE Kolibree Ara Smart Toothbrush Kolibree The tech industry has developed an obsession with artificial intelligence over the past several years, as evidenced by gadgets such as Kolibree’s new toothbrush. The oral hygiene product includes its own processor and is said to use deep learning algorithms that learn about the user’s habits, complete with an “offline” mode. Replay SHARE Ekko Connected Mirror French company Miliboo is betting people want to use their mirror for much more than grooming and assembling outfits. The startup showcased its Ekko smart mirror at CES, which plays music and video, displays the news, tells the time, and more. Replay SHARE Lovebox Jean Gregoire via YouTube The Lovebox is being promoted as a discrete way to correspond with a significant other. It looks like a $99 wooden trinket box that connects to the Internet and works with a mobile app. When the recipient receives a new message, a heart on the front of the box spins, and the text appears on a mirror that sits on top of the box.

This announcement coincides with Sherpa Technology Group’s rebrand from 3LP Advisors, reflecting its role in advising clients at the intersection of business, technology and IP.  The name change will become effective immediately. Mr. Detkin is a founder of Intellectual Ventures, a multi-billion dollar fund that invests in invention and currently holds over 40,000 patents. He will remain involved with the company. Prior to founding Intellectual Ventures, Mr. Detkin was a Vice President at Intel Corporation, where he oversaw Intel’s patent, licensing and litigation departments. Before that, he was a partner at the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. Mr. Detkin was recently named the second most influential “IP market maker” in the world by Intellectual Asset Management magazine. Mr. Detkin’s knowledge and deal experience will bolster the firm’s ability to offer business strategy and transaction execution services to its varied roster of clients, which includes Fortune 500 companies, emerging technology companies, investors, and investment banks. “Since 2008, 3LP has been offering advisory services to help Boards and management utilize technology and intellectual property to compete in their chosen markets. We have decided to rebrand ourselves as Sherpa Technology Group to emphasize our role as an experienced guide that enables our clients to reach the peak and achieve their ultimate objectives,” said Ralph Eckardt, Managing Partner of Sherpa Technology Group and former head of The Boston Consulting Group’s IP Strategy Practice. “The image of the “sherpa” resonates with us because it highlights our role as a trusted fellow traveler, and our commitment to helping our clients succeed by offering in-depth knowledge and practical experience that will enable them to reach the summit.” “Sherpa Technology Group’s diverse expertise and collaborative approach separates it from the dozens of other IP consulting shops,” said Peter Detkin. “Its professionals have unmatched credibility, experience and breadth of knowledge to advise senior management and Boards of Directors on critical business issues at the intersection of technology and IP, including both strategy development and technology transactions. Sherpa Technology Group is the premier advisory firm in this space, and I’m excited to add my knowledge and transaction experience to the firm.” “We are pleased to welcome Peter Detkin – a highly-regarded visionary and innovator – to our team,” said Kevin Rivette, Managing Partner of Sherpa Technology Group, former Vice President at IBM Corporation, and former Senior Advisor to The Boston Consulting Group. “Peter and I have known each other and worked together for 30 years and are excited to join forces at the same firm.  I could not have a higher level of respect for him personally and his accomplishments. His entrepreneurial spirit and strong IP and technology expertise make us stronger and add new dimensions to our client offering.” About Sherpa Technology Group  Founded in 2008 as 3LP Advisors, Sherpa Technology Group is a strategy and M&A advisor on technology and intellectual property (“IP”) matters. The firm’s clients range from Fortune 500 companies, to emerging technology companies, to investors and investment banks. Advising at the intersection of business, technology, and IP requires the specialized knowledge, expertise and creativity that our experienced team possesses.

Inventor Woes January 9, 2017 4:28 pm https://hbr.org/2014/07/the-evidence-is-in-patent-trolls-do-hurt-innovation IPdude January 9, 2017 5:58 pm Inventor Woes – hedge funds do not produce or manufacture any products. They manipulate markets while producing nothing. In fact, when they short stocks or sectors (as they did in 2008) it can and has exacerbated market slides considerably. I don’t hear the big tech companies calling them trolls – even though they have had a greater impact on the economy than NPEs. Hedge funds have hurt the economy and the average consumer by a much greater margin than NPEs. Not defending NPEs but at least they are buying and monetizing an asset (patents). There are greater evils to address, if that’s what your concerned with. angry dude January 9, 2017 10:42 pm Inventor Woes @2 Dude, You obviously never invented anything of importance in your entire life Cause if you did (like many of the readers of this blog) then you might be thankful to those evil “patent trolls” – at least they used to give some money to original inventors (up until a few years ago – thanks to relentless efforts of SV infingers lobby and VERY receptive obama/congress/scotus/you name it branch of US government) I am very serious – you should be thankful to those patent trolls for some of the things you use every day angry dude January 9, 2017 11:03 pm IPdude @3 I don’t get your apologetic tone What’s wrong with IP valuation/trading/enforcement ecosystem (provided IP is a real one and not a fake like those zillions of worthless junk patents issued to googles and apples of this world on rectangular phones and pinch to zoom alike patent garbage) ??? They have trading in futures and futures on futures or whatever financial scams they invented, but trading in real IP assets is wrong ??? If Edison or Tesla lived today they would already jump off the bridge Sad, very sad… IPdude January 10, 2017 11:44 am angry dude – not apologetic. Pointing out that hedge funds and big tech are the infringers and hedge funds do more harm than good, they both heavily lobby to get away with what they do and often harm small business. Pointing out the hypocrisy. Inventor Woes January 10, 2017 10:36 pm I agree that hedge funds don’t do anything and are just promoting rent-seeking behavior. However, the “there are much worse things” argument isn’t really an argument. It’s a red herring. Post a Comment Respectfully add to the discussion.

Many of the important advancements are really continuations of previous ideas, some of which had lost prominence but now are surging back to the front thanks to new devices. In other words, what’s old is new again, but that doesn’t dampen the way it will change the computing world in 2017. VR marches forward, with or without the mainstream Anyone could finally buy virtual reality in 2016, but it didn’t go mainstream. VR headsets are still a niche product and the most capable sets – the Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive – are priced outside most people’s reach. Neither company has publicly shared its sales. Patrick Moorhead, President of Moor Insights & Strategy, told us VR is “on a very slow ramp. Until the visual quality improves, more solutions are wireless, costs decline, and setup is simplified, VR won’t be mainstream.” Please enable Javascript to watch this video That hasn’t dampened anyone’s enthusiasm. Virtual reality’s presence at CES 2017 was serious, taking up significantly more space than the previous year. And there were plenty of announcements. HTC took the veil off its new Tracker system, which lets third-party companies build peripherals to use with Vive experiences. That of course opened the floodgates for the announcement of peripherals, ranging from toy guns, to gloves, to baseball bats. We also saw a kit from TPCast that turns the Vive into a wireless headset. It was announced prior to the show, but CES 2017 was our first chance to try it out – an important milestone, because wireless VR often has problems. To our surprise, TPCast worked well, without any noticeable lag. The biggest restriction is battery life. You can play wirelessly for up to 90 minutes. The money is staying around, and VR will keep improving so long as that’s true. No one knows how quickly virtual reality will catch on with consumers, but that doesn’t seem to be hampering VR’s prospects. Even Moorhead agrees with this, saying that, despite its issues, “VR, AR and MR investment will rise this year, especially on the content side, which is sorely lacking.” That’s important. In the past, VR fads have fizzed out as companies headed for more profitable shores. This time, the money is staying around, and VR will keep improving so long as that’s true. Big data needs big pipes The most important problem facing the PC this year is a classic; memory, and how to deal with it. Time and time again we heard different companies, in their own ways, outline their plans to deal with the coming data crunch. AMD, which plans two new chip architectures this year, is implementing aggressive new data management schemes in both. Ryzen, the company’s new processor, will have a massive cache paired with a prediction algorithm that can learn what data software is likely to need and call it up before it’s required. And AMD’s new GPU architecture, Vega, is designed around a high-bandwidth cache controller. While built to work initially with High Bandwidth Memory 2, the company says Vega can support many memory solutions. It can even be hooked up directly to long-term memory, if the storage solution is fast enough. Please enable Javascript to watch this video Intel, meanwhile, is positioning itself to lead a revolution in long-term memory with Optane. This new technology, first teased in 2015, will come to PCs sometime in 2017. Its speed supposedly exceeds that of any solid state drive, even those connected over the most modern NVMe interface. Initially, it will be sold as a super-fast cache drive, but the plan is to ramp it up to become main storage. That, if it works, would change a fundamental pillar of PC architecture. Home computers have, since their existence, paired fast low-capacity RAM with slow, long-term storage. Technology like Optane might make that unnecessary by accelerating long-term storage. RAM’s days might be numbered. More: Intel spills the beans on 3D Xpoint, the tech behind its Optane drives Even if that proves untrue, it’s clear fast storage is a priority for everyone. Seagate, the well-known hard drive brand, told us it expects demand for capacity to hit 2,900 exabytes (one exabyte is one million terabytes) by 2020. That’s a massive amount of data, and it’ll be impossible to handle without faster ways to access it. HDR comes to monitors High Dynamic Range was arguably the television technology of 2016, even more so than 4K resolution. Our Senior Editor of Home Theater and Audio, Caleb Denison, raves about it at every chance. Now, that same technology is coming to monitors. If you haven’t heard of it, here’s the deal brief. High Dynamic Range aims to increase contrast by allowing a greater range of brightness. In doing so, it makes images brighter and more lifelike. The blinding light of a sunny day looks dampened on a “normal” display, but with HDR, it can truly shine. More: What is HDR, and why should you care? HDR’s arrival on monitors could mean another leap forward in quality. However, all the monitors we saw at CES, or which we know will be available later this year, are missing HDR’s dance partner; OLED. The pair works best together because it’s hard for a traditional, backlit LCD to hit the brightness peaks HDR can achieve without blowing our black levels. Unfortunately, CES 2017 didn’t give us hope that OLED will be available in desktop monitors soon. Still, it’s good to see monitors focusing on quality more than they did in the past. Johnson Jia, Lenovo’s Senior Vice President, PC & Smart Device Business Group, told us “Our culture is becoming increasingly visual in the way we consume content. In fact, our customer surveys show that display is the number one experience customers care most about.” Frankly, we think consumers have cared about display quality for awhile, but at least companies are now listening. Samsung and Google partner to challenge Windows and Intel Chances are great that if you’re reading this on a computer, it’s a PC running Windows on an Intel processor. This partnership, sometimes called “Wintel,” is nothing official, but it’s been the norm for two decades. Google’s Chrome OS, released in 2011, was the first potential threat. And it in fact did catch on, in a way – Chromebooks often trend on Amazon’s best-selling notebooks list. They’re simple, they work, and they cost less than $500 even with sweet hardware. That’s enough for most people. Unfortunately, though, app support remains an issue. Chrome OS just doesn’t have many apps, and that often leaves it off shopping lists. Brad Bourque/Digital Trends Samsung’s Chromebook Plus and Pro have an answer for that, as they offer full support for Google’s Play Store. Yes, that means you can run Android apps. And unlike previous Chromebooks that tacked on this support after the fact, the Plus and Pro have all the features needed to make the apps work as they should. That could be a boon for Chromebooks, says Moorhead. “One of the biggest drawbacks to Chrome being a full-fledged rich operating system was the lack of apps,” he told us. “Adding Android apps to chrome will increase its popularity. Android games tend to scale better on a large screen, and the Microsoft Office android apps on Chrome look promising.” Chrome OS users will be able to tap into a selection of apps that includes millions of titles. However, as Moorehead went on to point out, “developers will need to do a lot of improvement to the apps as most Android apps are designed for 4” displays. Running a 4-inch app on a 13-inch display is a suboptimal experience.” While the potential of Google Play is intriguing, Wintel isn’t on its deathbed yet.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 09, 2017 12:22pm   Comments Share: Related NVDA In Honor Of Friday The 13th, Here Are Some Of The Unluckiest Trades Of 2016 If Lendingtree Continues To Deliver, A Major Short Squeeze Could Be On The Horizon Financial Mortal Combat (Seeking Alpha) At a meeting with CFO Colette Kress and the IR team from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) at CES 2017, Oppenheimer’s Rick Schafer noted that management’s tone was positive, with a “steady as she goes” outlook, as the company continued to execute on various growth drivers, such as gaming, automotive and AI. Following the sitdown, Schafer maintained a Perform rating on the best performing S&P 500 stock of 2016.  CES Takeaways “CEO Jen-Hsun Huang kicked off CES with his annual keynote, announcing GeForce Now, which delivers NVDA GPU technology to users via the cloud, an upgraded Shield incorporating AI and personal assistant capabilities to its streaming device,” the analyst mentioned. Management also provided fresh details regarding plans to roll out autonomous driving vehicles, in collaboration with Audi, by 2020. “While these greenfield initiatives will take time to root, we believe they represent a broader strategic trend by NVIDIA to leverage its industry-leading GPU technology, and its inherent technological strength in AI, to more pervasive applications,” Schafer stated. What To Expect In gaming, NVIDIA expects the momentum that led to 33 percent growth in 2016 to persist, driven by upgrades to its Pascal, ASP [average selling price] increase due to user demand for higher performance SKUs [stock keeping units], as well as next-gen Volta GPU, expected later in 2017. “Auto growth is expected to moderate as infotainment matures and Drive PX for autonomous driving applications begins its nascent ramp. DC [direct-to-consumer], however, should continue its momentum as NVDA continues to dominate the AI training market driving growth in Tesla and GRID,” the analyst added. Schafer believes that the stock now faces increasing difficult comps and would prefer to wait for a more attractive entry point.

The side panel is an LCD screen which is backlit by the case’s interior lighting, allowing it to function as a transparent display. The LCD screen is a 19-inch display with a resolution of 1,280 x 1,024. The panel connects to a single PCI expansion slot inside the case, which then routes to a video input on the back of the chassis. iBuypower first showed off its Project Snowblind side panel last year, but has now officially announced its pricing and release date. According to PCWorld, the Snowblind panel will cost $250 and will be available from February 2017.

Andrew English, Motoring Correspondent 11 January 2017 • 1:42pm "Glorious, stirring sight!" murmured Toad. "The poetry of motion! The only way to travel! O bliss! O poop-poop! O my!" OK, so maybe Kenneth Graham's The Wind in the Willows character Mr Toad's first reaction to a motor car isn't shared by every commuter in the car park that constitutes Monday morning on the M25. The automotive freedom we're discussing here, however, while far from that of Toad's, is important. What do self-driving cars, this year's hot automotive technology, mean for people who don't have a self-driving car? Will these new vehicles, be they a bumbling Google driverless taxi, or a sleek Mercedes chauffeur-less limo, threaten your freedom to drive whenever and wherever you please? Tech trends | An acceleration in driverless cars The benefits of autonomous cars are widely trumpeted as the electronics and automotive industries plunge headfirst into what one independent forecaster describes as a "gold rush". A 2016 McKinsey report suggested that by 2030, global new car sales could comprise up to 15 per cent autonomous models, up to 50 per cent electric vehicles and up to 10 per cent shared-mobility vehicles. Clearly in the way we get around, there is change afoot, but there was scant discussion of a concomitant erosion of freedoms in the vapid bubble of technology utopianism at this week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.  In fact the tech industry is in trouble; it's meteoric and profitable and influential growth is slowing. A decade on from the 2007 first Apple iPhone units aren't shifting as they did and tech share values have teetered. There are no clear new trends to replace smartphones, particularly the lacklustre so-called internet of things or connected wearables, which have also been identified as a convenient backdoors for hackers and cyber terrorists. As one cynic observed, at least autonomous cars provide way for the tech industry to shift more units and get a choke hold on car makers. Concept-i Toyota pics But does the public really want autonomous cars? One survey, released just before Christmas, showed the public don't believe fully autonomous cars will be available anytime soon and they're not sure they want them compared with simpler tech to help find their parked car, avoid an accident or prevent it being stolen. Nevertheless, the motor industry is forging ahead, staking claims to establish standards, technology platforms and the high-definition maps essential for the top level of autonomous driving; levels four and five defined in a five-point hierarchy from the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). BMW, for example, announced a new alliance with chip-maker Intel and tech company MobilEye, aiming at building autonomous cars in 2021. Nissan's even teamed up with Nasa to provide a kind of autonomous car help desk for the car to call when it meets something it's never seen before and doesn't know how to proceed. So are self driving cars safe? Some models are already equipped with limited level two self driving capabilities. Last year we commented on the abrupt way in which such systems (on Mercedes-Benz's new E-class and BMW's new 5-series) simply switch off with no more warning than an extinguished lamp when they can't 'see' the road markings. BMW is in the driving seat of European driverless car technology Gill Pratt, Toyota's American research boss, is concerned about this 'hand-off' and whether drivers remain aware enough to safely take back control in such circumstances.  "Level two hand-off can happen at any time with no warning," he says, "and the driver needs to supervise the autonomy. Indications are that drivers tend to under or over trust the system... Is level two autonomy a bad idea? Some companies think it is and are skipping this level. We are not sure." Volkswagen's Christian Senger, vice president of e-mobility, thinks car makers not producing levels one to three autonomous driving cars are missing out. "The hunger from people for better functions is there, it's unstoppable and we need to provide it," he says. "We might, however, have to provide level-three vehicles, but sell them as a pretty good level twos." Senger suggests that autonomous driving might even require abandoning the traditional model of car manufacturing and adopting one similar to that of Tesla. This is where customers are part of the development fleet and manufacturers automatically flash updates and download data to develop and refine software. "If we try to stay with our [old] model, that would kill our future," he says. "Imagine trying to develop level-three autonomous driving with 100 million test kilometres, how long would that take? But with a few hundred thousand [customer's] cars doing 100km a day, that's a way to rapidly improve software problems." ces 2017 weirdest gadgets With companies such as Nokia's former map maker, HERE now owned by Audi, BMW and Mercedes, customers will be part of the development process, even if they don't own an autonomous driving car. High definition maps (along with vehicle-to-vehicle communication, high-tech cameras and laser range finding) are must-haves for self driving cars and your car's sensors will be press ganged into providing data to develop maps and software. And then there's the cost. As well as the sensors, just processing the data they produce will be expensive. Mercedes-Benz is developing advanced camera systems and software for its autonomous cars. "It is a neural data analysis system," says Marius Cordts, a Mercedes engineer working on image recognition "with thousands of images and millions of parameters teamed with an intelligent learning algorithm. At its peak we need to process up to 7 terabytes per hour." Watch | How do driverless cars work? 01:33 "Each car could be producing as much as 4,000 gigabytes of data a day, so there's likely to be a significant increase in the need to process it," says Bridget Karlin, MD of the internet of Things at Intel. "We'll also need high-speed, low-latency and ultra-reliable throughput, and robust data processing."   "The reality is that the tech exists today," says Kevin Clark chief executive of Delphi, a tier-one supplier which introduced its own autonomous concept at CES.  "The biggest problem for the manufacturers is the cost, legal and liability responsibilities." Assuaging those costs, which VW's Senger suggests could add up to a total of about €20,000 (£17,152) a car, is one reason for the current flurry of activity, mergers and buy outs. Ford, for example, is committed to introduce autonomous vehicles for ride sharing schemes by 2021 and has invested $75 million in Velodyne Lidar, along with matched funding from Baidu, the Chinese internet search provider, to reduce the cost of this notoriously expensive technology. Panasonic pics CES The potential benefits of self-driving cars could be huge, although exactly how much and to whom they accrue is a moot point. One estimate suggests that America could free up some 5.7 million square metres of parking space saving up to $190 billion (though where the autonomous cars will go when not in use remains a mystery). If crashes were reduced by what is assumed to be up to 90 percent, there's also a potential saving of up to $180 billion in US emergency healthcare. Again, what happens to your insurance for your 'risky' manually driven car is unclear, as is the question of whether car makers or motorists will have to underwrite an autonomous car's liabilities in law? The safety benefit is interesting and, according to Tom Gebhardt, Panasonic's president of automotive systems in America its one of the key benefits of autonomous driving which he says "is not that far away". This comes just weeks after Uber suspended controversial trials of its driverless taxis in San Francisco after cars were seen running red lights and the state of California threatened legal action. According to the World Health Organisation, in 2013 there were over 1.25 million road deaths worldwide. Awful as this figure is, it important to understand that these deaths are disproportionately concentrated in developing nations (Africa, India and China represented over three quarters of a million), where roads aren't always well maintained, and lanes and road-edge markings not as well defined as required by most self-driving systems, plus observance and enforcement of road rules aren't as stringent as in more developed nations. Some parts of the world have less stringent road regulations than others Credit: ANTONY NJUGUNA/Reuters Most car makers agree that making autonomous driving work in such conditions will be tough  "Adoption will be a steeply stepped process," says Mercedes's Källenius. "Autonomous cars won't be appearing simultaneously in New York City and the rain forests of Borneo. Initially it will be on certain roads and in certain cities, but it will grow." "An automated car in India? That's a long way off," says Delphi's Clark. But just what level of safety is acceptable in a world of autonomous cars?  "Historically humans have zero tolerance of death by machine," said Toyota's Pratt, "but we don't yet know the answer, or whether it will be local or the same across the world." Panasonic is working with the Colorado Department of Transportation on an experimental smart road out of Denver and 90 miles into the mountains, on which autonomous cars can be tested. Shailen P Bhatt, executive director for Colorado's DoT spoke at the Panasonic press conference pointing out that "there were 35,092 road deaths in North America in 2016, which is the equivalent of a 747 airliner crash every week." Again you need to drill down into the numbers. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2011, over 3,331 people were killed and over 387,000 injured in motor vehicle accidents connected to distracted driving and that's a low figure. The US National Safety Council reckons the figure for vehicle crashes caused by cell phone use is nearer to 28 per cent of the total. So isn't autonomous driving just a technical salve for a problem partly created by technology in the first place? "You could say that autonomous driving is technology recovering a problem created by technology," observes VW's Senger. Autonomous cars: who is winning the race? The Apple Corporation was recently the recipient of a civil lawsuit in connection with a 2014 accident in Dallas where a five-year old girl died after the car in which she was travelling was rear ended by an SUV driven by a man allegedly chatting on Apple's Facetime app. The lawsuit alleges that Apple failed to adopt its own safer version of Facetime, which disabled the app when being used in a moving vehicle. It's the sort of nonsensical case which sends shivers through the Silicon tech industry, which has been generally notable for its buccaneering attitudes to safety, product liability, corporation tax and corporate responsibility. Uber's taxi research in San Francisco raises further questions. Up to now, the industry has assumed that autonomous cars would defer to everything, but as Glen De Vos, Delphi's vice president of engineering, electronics and safety says: "if the car is too conservative, it'll never go anywhere. It needs to be sufficiently aggressive and assertive to make its way and that's where machine learning comes into play." But if autonomous cars are pushy and rude, at least you'll be able to get past them, won't you? Not necessarily. Since much of the technology depends on vehicle-to-vehicle communications, which also allow platoons of cars to be electronically linked together just inches apart to improve aerodynamics. Such platooning, also described in the Satre roadtrain EU project, might well require a motorway lane of their own. Also greedy for road (and toad) space is a proposal in front of the UK's Highways Agency for dynamic wireless charging highways for battery cars. This is a suggestion from research body, the TRL, which is projected to cost around £3.9 million a mile. While not all autonomous cars will be battery electric, most pundits think the twin technologies will come together, which means another lane of road closed to ordinary motorists. Ask about the freedoms that might have to be sacrificed and you get a variety of answers. "Freedom will not necessarily be lost," says Mercedes's Källenius. "There are over 30 billion cars on the road, so replacement will take time and the two will have to coexist." "Any car company that is not adapting their futures right now is in the red zone," says VW Senger. "The technology, the legal framework, and the acceptance of the public are all important discussions about the future of autonomous cars. We need to talk about it..." We do indeed.

Scott Applewhite The Enigma of US Intel or How RT "Meddled in US Elections"BERLIN (Sputnik) — In December 2016, reports emerged that the German government feared potential influence on the 2017 parliamentary elections from Russia after the CIA had accused Russia of being behind cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) computer systems in an attempt to influence the November US presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. "Targeted propaganda and cyberattacks from abroad will pose a great threat to the electoral campaign in Germany," Oppermann told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. Russian officials have repeatedly denied the allegations, calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert US public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues. ...

Less extensive but a recent report indicated same trend in Germany so what are they bleating about? the truth is out there and the public are incensed with the ruthless mob on the hill preaching lies and deceit. A new era is now dawning its a cyclic thing a pendulum of reform and healing its time for a peoples government just as the UK and US have voted in the last 12 months. All there protestation is futile it is the will of the people that want there government and there nation back! Reply Angus Gallagher 15:41 09.01.2017 | 1 | Edit | Delete Dog whistle for censoring reports on migrant crime. This is a policy worked out by anti-Russian globalist think tanks and it's the reason they went after Breitbart over Dortmund when the exact same story was reported in dozens of newspapers in precisely the same way. The point is that the strategists have singled out Breit because it's going to open a German platform and they're terrified Trump will use it via Steve Bannon to take down Merkel. We all know exactly what happened in Dortmund. Playing nice doesn't work by obfuscating the facts to get that warm PC glow of self congratulation. There's no appeasing the EU-NATO Axis. Truth first. Reply kooka 15:42 09.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete opperman of the spd knew already that this former socialist party will fail next Bundestag election. The reason is not Russian hacking but that they are nowadays (since Gerhard Schröder with HartzIV-laws) only a neoliberal party without any difference to the merkel party. I never will elect the spd again in my life. Reply Zoanthropy 15:50 09.01.2017 | 1 | Edit | Delete The propaganda will come from the Frau Merkel group, evil bunch.

The shaderFloat64 device feature is for exposing support for 64-bit floats data type and similar to the ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 extension in OpenGL.

Is Apple ripe to be disrupted? Image: Apple 10 years ago, Apple rewrote the history of computing with the unveiling of the iPhone. But Apple should remember that no disrupter is safe from displacement, warns John Kennedy. The richest, most poignant and absolutely beautiful irony of the tech industry is that no disrupter is safe from being disrupted or displaced by a newer, more nimble and relevant newcomer. It’s called continuum and it will go on forever. The fact that Apple wasn’t even a newcomer when it came along in 2007 and disrupted – or more likely destroyed – the cosy order of things dominated by Nokia, BlackBerry, Palm and Microsoft made the victory all the sweeter for the tech giant. ‘The tech world in 2017 is a strange, beguiling and confusing landscape that is ripe for disruption… or leadership’ That sweet victory, celebrated with pomp, circumstance and deserved pride, could be short-lived if Apple fails to take on board the savage and contradictory realities of its own existence. 9 January 2007 is being marked as the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. I watched the “and one more thing” moment from my desk via a live video feed after Steve Jobs ran through his customary Mac and OS X product line-up at Macworld in San Francisco. He removed a shiny device from his pocket, demonstrating how easy it was to send a text message using the iPhone, and a new era in computing was born. The device wasn’t even any more sophisticated than others on the market, but it did something different – it made phones easy to use. Smart became simple. The device did not come to market for almost nine months after that, but what followed was a revolution in operating system technology and it upended the entire software business model with the subsequent arrival of the App Store. The core message was that ‘smart’ phones should really be simple and easy to use phones. Comparing an iPhone from 2007 with an iPhone from 2017 under the hood would be like comparing a Ford Fiesta with a Porsche 911, but from a usability perspective, the changes since then are subtle. It’s still pretty much the same phone, albeit with faster processors, bigger screens, better radios and more powerful cameras. Some will say that this moment in 2007 was the moment that the modern Apple was born. Wrong. Back to the core: When Apple was really reborn Then and now. The iPhone in 2007 and the iPhone in 2017. Image: Apple The modern Apple was born almost 10 years earlier. I remember sitting at a computer at the Harvard library close to MIT during an idyllic summer holiday in Boston, scouring the web for news, when the unthinkable happened and I nearly fell out of my seat. Apple’s nemesis, Microsoft, bailed out a near-bankrupt Apple with a $150m investment that saw the return of Steve Jobs to the fold. This, in my mind, is what kick-started a new chapter in computing industry history. 6 August 1997 will be forever engraved in my mind as the real moment Apple was reborn. It also epitomises to me the constant struggle Apple has had to define itself. In a sense, this is why Apple has such a tight connection with artists, musicians and other creators. That sense of necessary, constant reinvention reaches a pinnacle of achievement every time. Since the late 1970s, Apple was seen as the real disrupter in personal computing but got caught in a dogfight with Microsoft and IBM. Its machines were considered the best but just too expensive. A ‘Wintel’ pact between Microsoft and Intel pretty much sealed the matter, resulting in cheaper machines for the masses. Microsoft was in the ascendancy by the late 1990s when Apple was close to the wall. Jobs’s vision of a pure end-to-end computing experience from hardware to software was denied by his dramatic departure from Apple, and what followed was a slow and steady demise as a succession of CEOs – including John Sculley and Gil Amelio – fought without success to steady the ship. The darkest hours saw Apple almost succumb to licensing its OS for other OEM manufacturers to build Macs. The return of Steve Jobs, albeit at first for a $1 salary and the use of a corporate jet, ignited a design culture that saw overlooked designers like Jony Ive and operations supremos like Tim Cook find their feet and flex their muscle. The NeXT operating system developed by Jobs during his exile sowed the seeds of what we knew as OS X, or today as Mac OS. Apple in the late 1990s must have been like Florence during the Renaissance The first flourish of innovation – or swagger – from this reborn Apple came in 1998 with the iMac G3. Until that time, all computers were either black or beige (mostly beige). With its 15in screen and multicolour luminescent shell, Apple redesigned the personal computer. The timeline of iMac from 1998 to 2015, comparing it with the original Macintosh 128K (1984). A higher res version can be found here. Image: iMac/Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 4.0)  It was a sign of things to come and the real feeling that computing could be an extension of your personality in terms of colour and appearance. Apple once again set the standard for breaking with convention. This design ethos and sense of tearing up the rulebooks had caught hold. The iPod wasn’t the world’s first MP3 player when it launched in 2001. Indeed in 1999, in an office on Harcourt Street in Dublin, the two founders of Movidius – David Moloney and Sean Mitchell – demonstrated to me what was later to become the guts of the iPod Shuffle in 2005. Moloney and Mitchell last year sold their company Movidius to Intel for a rumoured $300m. With the iPod and the subsequent arrival of iTunes, Apple showed how it could reinvent itself and transform and, in doing so, became a music industry mogul but also one of the world’s biggest e-commerce repositories. Software, movies and books followed. But what was coming with the iPhone would be the company’s biggest transformation yet. The end of the phoney war: Why the mid-2000s were an awful time for phones Before the iPhone came along, smartphones were in their infancy. But they were terrible to use. The idea of a device that could surf the internet, send and receive email, or send data via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi wasn’t new in 2007. I first hefted a Nokia Communicator machine in 1997 (a destroyer of the lining of many a jacket) and it could do most of these things. While Nokia was in its heyday at the start of the 2000s, producing popular devices with seemingly never-ending battery lives, BlackBerry had the swagger of a disrupter. At first, BlackBerry started with handy email/paging machines around 1999, but by 2005, devices like the BlackBerry Pearl were seen as state-of-the-art, as were some devices from Palm. The problem by 2007 was that the machines – and the electronics inside them – were constantly evolving but the operating systems were not. Nokia’s N-series devices could do all kinds of amazing things, from multimedia audio and video playback to photos, video and mapping – but they were horrible to use. To give you a sense of how bad things were getting, Microsoft had been championing its own version of Windows for mobile devices. This began with Windows CE before culminating with Windows Mobile 6.5, and was pretty much the same as putting an entire desktop version of Windows on a phone. No one understood that for smartphones to be smart, they needed to be simple and elegant to use. But Apple itself made some frightening mistakes. The old ‘design by committee’ tradition that nearly destroyed the company in the 1990s hadn’t entirely been eradicated and one of the spoiled fruits to emerge was the Motorola Rokr E1 in 2005, a candy bar device that came with iTunes and could – at best – store around 100 songs. To me, the Rokr signalled the end of a glorious mobile phone design era at Motorola that was epitomised by the immortal and much-loved Razr. Purple reign But just as Motorola entered its own dark ages, a secret effort called Project Purple began at Apple in 2004. Project Purple, which included Jobs and Ive, initially intended to produce a tablet computer that would ultimately become the iPad in 2010. However, a collaboration with AT&T’s (then mobile arm Cingular) steered this in the direction of a smartphone. Before 9 January 2007, the notion of Apple producing its own smartphone was appealing and exotic but almost sinful in the spirit of Catholic guilt. No one could forget past failures like the Newton PDA, and while many suggested Apple could simply put a cellular radio into the iPod, it just seemed too fantastic. Rumours of an Apple phone that were abound then were echoed in 2012, when Apple television rumours circulated wildly, and this hype continues now, with talk of Apple cars. But until that moment when Steve Jobs said “one more thing”, it was believed by many to be an impossible dream. At first Nokia, BlackBerry and Microsoft mocked the new phone. Then Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer sneered that “it has only one button” while the leadership of BlackBerry, or RIM as it was known then, decided to firmly place their heads in the sand. Nokia tested its swagger with the N96 and N97, BlackBerry destroyed its loyal base with the mediocre BlackBerry Storm and Microsoft acquired Nokia’s phone business – with disastrous consequences. The core lesson of the iPhone in 2007 was that even though it didn’t have the same technical firepower or specifications as other rival devices, Steve Jobs correctly guessed that people just wanted a phone that would be easy to use. The iOS operating system structure is pretty much the same today as it was 10 years ago. That was the gap in the market. And now the iPhone is responsible for around two-thirds of Apple’s revenues. Products like the iPod and iPad aren’t selling as well as they used to and are rarely mentioned in the companies’ earnings. But can the iPhone remain Apple’s primary cash cow for the next 10 years? Who will disrupt the Apple cart? Various iterations of the iPhone since 2007. Image: Apple For the first time in almost a decade, 2016 saw Apple’s revenues from iPhone sales drop. Even though the iPhone continued to deliver for Apple in the fourth quarter, beating analyst estimates, the illusion or mask of immortality has begun to slip. And rivals scent blood. Apple has an Achilles heel, but no one has found it yet, or is big enough to exploit the chinks in the armour. Apple’s sheer scale has created many enemies, including the European Commission, which wants to exact a €13.9bn pound of flesh from the tech giant by alleging a sweetheart tax arrangement with Ireland. Apple can either circle the wagons or innovate. This is because the only weapon Apple has now is momentum. Until it comes up with a new disruption – be it a car, a TV or a new phone – it is precisely in the besieged place that its rivals like Nokia, Microsoft and BlackBerry were in the short years after 9 January 2009. The problem with the momentum that Apple needs is that smartphone sales are saturating. The smartphones that Apple sells are comparatively expensive in the market and this is happening in a world that no one but the rich are getting richer, and confidence of ordinary people to spend will be eroded by the spectre of a Trump presidency. Apple has incredible loyalty to its technology and has an instinctive grasp of its users’ preferences, as demonstrated with the iPhone SE last year, which had all the technology of an iPhone 6s crammed into the diminutive body of an iPhone 5s. This was clever and intuitive on Apple’s part, but how many ace cards does Apple still have up its sleeve? The tech world order in 2017 is in a strange array. Opportunities are possibly abound in areas like smart homes, smart cars and smart cites, all aided and abetted by the internet of things and cloud. But right now, could Amazon’s Alexa voice-based assistant really be the shape of things to come? I mean, really? Microsoft, through Satya Nadella’s leadership, has found an alluring sense of zen. It is relaxed in its dominance of cloud and it is even cooperating with Apple in terms of iOS apps, actually accruing a new generation of loyal followers by imitating Apple’s hardware model with its Surface Book personal computer. The VR revolution currently led by players like Oculus, Samsung, Sony and HTC is a slow burner, and as the AR potential – as espoused through Microsoft’s HoloLens – offers some opportunity to shake things up, Apple has yet to pounce on VR or AR. The tech world in 2017 is a strange, beguiling and confusing landscape that is ripe for disruption… or leadership. Could Apple mark 10 years of the iPhone with a game-changing device like a new smartphone? Could it simplify the confusing and troubled start to the VR age as only Apple can? Will it really create an Apple car? Hints for me lie in the AirPod wireless earphone products, in terms of how Apple has created an invisible, intuitive interface that sets the standards for wearables through gestures and responsive hardware. But as usual, only Apple knows. My instinct is that if the company really wants to survive, thrive and remain disruptive for the next 10 years, it needs to reach back to a point in time before 9 January 2007, when its back was to the wall and it was vulnerable. Technology changes but spirit and heart don’t. It needs to reach back to that spirit of innovation that was born anew in 1997. For that, it needs humility, a sense of vulnerability and the naïve quality of artistry that made computing simple and beautiful for the masses.

Ryzen is the culmination of four years of development at AMD, and that happens to be the same amount of time the chip designer expects its forthcoming CPU architecture to be relevant. After four years, AMD will move onto something else. We know this because PCWorld had a chat with Mark Papermaster, AMD's chief technology officer, who told the site AMD was aiming for a four-year lifespan out of Ryzen. Essentially what AMD wants to do is release processors that have a bigger impact on performance compared to the previous generation. It is a different approach from Intel, which for many years followed a two-year "tick-tock" release cadence with less of a performance gap in between CPU architecture releases. "We're not going tick-tock. Zen is going to be tock, tock, tock," Papermaster said. A "tick" in Intel's tick-tock cadence represents a CPU release built on a smaller process technology than its predecessor, whereas a "tock" is a completely new architecture released on the same manufacturing process. For example, Intel's 14nm Broadwell architecture is a tick, as it is a refined version of Haswell (22nm). What came after Broadwell is Skylake (14nm), a new architecture built on the same 14nm process node as Broadwell, making it a tock. The performance gap between Skylake and Haswell is greater than it is between Broadwell and Haswell. To be clear, Papermaster is not saying that AMD will release a batch of Ryzen CPUs and then make users wait four years before new processors arrive. AMD will likely release new CPUs every year, but the improvements it makes to Ryzen with each release will go beyond minor upgrades consisting of power efficiency improvements with a few performance optimizations sprinkled in. Of course we're getting ahead of ourselves here. Before any of this can come to fruition, Ryzen has to live up to the hype. Whether or not it will is something we'll find out in just a couple of months. If it does, one good thing to note is that AMD plans to be ready with available stock. "We're not going to do a paper launch," Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics business, added. "We've done that before. We're not going to mess with it." Ryzen is scheduled to release in March. For enthusiasts who are hot to trot with Ryzen, there will be plenty of high-end accompanying hardware to go with AMD's new CPUs, as AMD has worked with all of the big names in the motherboard market to have AM4-based boards ready to go.

While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers – as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. “What’s going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs – and the music is still playing,” said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. “Everyone is changing partners.” Several suppliers – notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive – are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. “If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player,” said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. “The technological challenges are immense,” Shashua told Reuters. “I would compare it to sending a man to the moon.” Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems – the building blocks for self-driving cars – to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla’s Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel, and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi’s chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5,000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW’s senior vice president for automated driving. “We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021,” Frickenstein said. “That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption.” Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMW’s joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG’s Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia. Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF and Bosch. “We’re not looking to develop a proprietary system,” said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch’s board of management who oversees autonomous driving. “We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping.” While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. “There’s not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution – no one who knows everything, every part of what’s needed to make an autonomous car,” said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi’s head of development for driver assistance systems. Some key components of self-driving systems – cybersecurity, for instance – should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo. But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said. “There will be a mix because it’s quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on,” Devauchelle said. “Those are big blocks.” Reuters Tags: automotive, BMW, driverless cars, Ford, General Motors, General Motors Co, Nvidia, Self Driving cars, self-driving, Tesla Also read Uber defies order from California DMV to cease operations, says its self-driving cars will remain on road CES 2017: BMW and Mobileye plan to deploy 40 self-driving cars for tests in US and Europe X Recommended For You Tesla Motors is rolling out software update enabling fully autonomous vehicles Uber self driving car program in San Francisco comes to a halt as DMV revokes registration of cars Hyperloop could very well be the future of transportation Uber defies order from California DMV to cease operations, says its self-driving cars will remain on road Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

They hit 7026MHz specifically, with a CPU multiplier of 70, and an FSB of 100.   The new Core i7-7700K has a base clock of 4.2GHz and boost of 4.5GHz, with most people able to hit 5GHz without a problem. The CPU retails for $305 in the US, and obviously changes throughout the world - so for me in Australia, it'll cost $1500 or something ridiculous (jokes, jokes - probably $1200).

Although the domestic semiconductor industry has been developing rapidly in recent years, China has a smaller market share than the top five foreign suppliers combined, including U.S.-based Qualcomm and Intel, said Chen Feng, vice president of Chinese fabless semiconductor maker Rockchip. Chen is currently in Las Vegas at the CES 2017, where Samsung unveiled its latest Chromebook, reportedly powered by a Rockchip chipsets. "U.S. semiconductor companies still have an advantageous position, so claiming that Chinese firms pose a threat to U.S. national security is nonsense," he told the Global Times on Sunday. On Friday (U.S. time), the U.S. government released a report on ensuring long-term leadership in semiconductors from the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). According to the report, the U.S. semiconductor sector faces challenges in innovation, competitiveness and integrity. The report also noted "that Chinese policies are distorting markets in ways that undermine innovation, subtract from U.S. market share, and put U.S. national security at risk." The U.S. government has concerns over the development of Chinese semiconductors, which may reshape the industry's outlook and affect profits at U.S. firms, Xu Xiaohai, senior analyst in the semiconductor industry research division at CCID Consulting, told the Global Times Sunday. U.S. authorities intervened in the potential merger and acquisition (M&A) of Chinese semiconductor Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund and German firm Aixtron by telling German authorities that the purchase would be used for military purposes, Reuters reported in October 2016, citing the Handelsblatt newspaper. The potential 2 million-deal has been put on ice since then. In its report, PCAST argued that Chinese subsidies for strengthening domestic production encourage foreign firms to relocate to the country. Further, higher market concentration in China, "can increase national-security risks for the U.S. and other countries." "The development of the domestic semiconductor industry comes from upgrading China's overall electronic information industry. The downstream industry, China's end-terminal device [computers or smartphones] assembly industry is mature, but its technical content and profit level is low. Yet the upstream integrated circuit industry has more technology and much higher profit level," Xu said. Foreign companies still hold a large share of the global semiconductor market, according to IC Insights. The five top chip suppliers - Intel, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom and SK Hynix - held 41 percent of the market in 2016, according to a research bulletin published on December 6, 2016. While China's electronics market grows, the demand for finished semiconductors is also increasing rapidly, said a report presented by the Semiconductor Industry Association to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission in April 2016. China accounts for 20 percent of global personal computer consumption, 29 percent of global smartphone consumption and 17 percent of tablet computer consumption, while the country's demand for semiconductors totals nearly 27 percent of the global demand, according to the report. The PCAST report suggests that the U.S. government could enforce trade and investment rules as one response to challenges posed by Chinese semiconductors. "In the Internet era, there are more and more open platforms for developers, such as Google's open developer platform, and companies need more communication to push the whole industry ahead," Chen said, noting that blocking access to the market is not a smart option. Facing challenges China's semiconductor companies should continue to improve the competitiveness of their core technology, not only by attracting and training high-level talent, but more importantly, through innovations to merge into the global technology and industry development. There is still a big technology gap between the top Chinese semiconductor company and the leading international firms, according to Xu. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp which has the most advanced manufacturing technology in the Chinese mainland, released their 28-nanometer technology for mass production in 2016, while Intel, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co have already release 14/16 nm technology, a two-generation gap. In addition, when it comes to M&As, Chinese companies should pay more attention to international practices and rules, instead of just offering a higher price, which may spark concerns about "hostile takeovers," Xu noted. "Stepping up efforts to respect others intellectual property rights (IPRs) and protect their own IPRs is equally important," he said.

We actually totally forgot all about the project, but when we were on the CES 2017 show floor we ran across the new iBUYPOWER Snowblind PC that is actually coming to market next month. iBUYPOWER teamed up with Intel to create the panel and together they created half a dozen panels before finally being happy with the one they picked to go into production with. Pricing for the Snowblind Gaming PC is not finalized yet, but they said that the tempered glass side panel that has the translucent 19-inch 1280 x 1024 LCD display on it only costs about $250. The other thing that will drive up the cost for this side panel is that the inside of the case needs to be a uniform color in order to get the best clarity on the translucent display. The iBuypower Snowblind gaming PC will be fully customizable, but the inside is all white and silver to get the best image quality on the display. That means they’ll have to paint the inside of the chassis white and use white PSU cable sleeves, motherboards, case fans and so on. We see this driving up the price of the PC a good bit as that will likely increase the build cost due to sourcing all the white parts and the extra time needed to switch come components out. You can see a video of the demo that iBUYPOWER was doing in their private meeting suite below. Check out our new #Snowblind #GamingPC! Want one? Available early February! #CES2017 www.ibuypower.com/Snowblind Posted by iBUYPOWER on Thursday, January 5, 2017   The case in the Intel booth was basically showing the Windows desktop when we saw it (see below), but you can program the display to do whatever you want with open-source software. If you aren’t a coder you’ll be able to run multiple pre-configured effects. You can also play a video, show system specifications (Rainmeter was shown at CES 2017) or a custom message on the digital side panel while still being able to show off the inside of your system. You can find out more on the iBUYPOWER Snowblind Gaming PC on it’s landing page. If you want the side panel you will not be able to buy it alone as it is designed for the iBUYPOWER Noctis gaming case that is exclusive to iBUYPOWER. iBUYPOWER is also not selling the case by itself, so you’ll have to configure and purchase an entire Snowblind Gaming PC to get this side panel technology. We can’t wait to see what the entry-level price will be next month!

Bryant Executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group for Intel Corporation. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn + This article is part of New Europe’s: Our World in 2017 USA – SANTA CLARA –In 1965, Intel Corporation’s co-founder Gordon Moore famously predicted the rate of advancement of integrated circuits, noting that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit would double every year. A decade later, he revised his statement to doubling every two years and the concept is now known as Moore’s Law.  Moore’s Law translates to a doubling of a computer’s computational capability every two years and continues to serve as a guiding principle for the technology industry. These advances enabled by Moore’s Law now produce a new mechanism to derive value from computing. As we enter 2017, we are crossing the threshold of a new era for human innovation – one in which machines can analyze significantly more data and recognize difficult to find patterns in that information. With the increased ability and affordability of computing, machines are able to continuously analyze and learn from data and accurately predict outcomes; this is what we call Artificial Intelligence (AI). Researchers have been working on AI for more than 50 years. We are now starting to see the benefits of those decades of investment in capabilities such as machine learning and machine reasoning. These technologies exhibit tremendous potential to improve society in areas ranging from better healthcare and safer driving to more efficient agriculture and energy development. For example, AI used in cars is now capable of interacting with not only the static elements of the road – signage, painted lines, etc. – but also pedestrians and other cars on the road. AI-enabled (also called automated driving) vehicles are currently being tested on roads worldwide and have the ability to assist drivers, optimize traffic flow, and reduce collisions resulting in saved lives.  Of course, AI has applications beyond vehicles that will impact the future. AI will benefit the industrial and agriculture sectors through the rise of smart factories and cities, precision agriculture and power management. The healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors are incorporating AI to assist with early diagnosis, precision medicine delivery and drug discovery. The financial sector is benefitting from fraud detection, risk assessment and asset management. Cybersecurity firms are using AI to predict threats of network intrusion, thereby, using data to protect data. Even the sports industry is incorporating AI for performance optimization, injury protection and fitness management. To keep up with the potential of AI innovation and the benefit it can bring society, the world will need laws and regulations that embrace these innovations while protecting people from unintended consequences.   Governmental regulation will need to keep up with the pace of AI advancements to protect the public and invest in long-term sustainable policy approaches. To ensure the benefits of the burgeoning AI field are made available to the greatest number of people possible, we must do three things: 1) Drive; 2) Democratize, and 3) Guide.  First, we need to “drive” AI by building the technology, optimizing its performance for AI applications, and advancing public policy to keep pace with AI development. At Intel, we are actively working with a wide range of industries to accelerate AI development. To do that, Intel and many of our technology partners are also maintaining an open dialogue with national governments and international regulatory bodies to identify and implement long-term and sustainable policy approaches.  By building and maintaining strong partnerships as these emerging technologies blossom, the computing industry and its regulators can work together to mitigate risk, drive accountability and reap incredible benefit. Second, we need to “democratize” AI by working with developers, academia, government, industry, and civil society to promote open access to the data and tools that will fuel broad development of AI.  This means engaging with the developers of tomorrow today. Isolated data stores, complex tools and a small talent pool currently limit access to AI. Government and industry both have roles to play to democratize AI.  Government can play an important role to encourage the creation of an AI workforce, including supporting graduate students and funding research.  Intel has committed to democratize AI innovation, leading the charge for open data exchanges and initiatives. One example is the Intel Nervana AI Academy created to increase accessibility to data, tools, training and intelligent machines for a broad community of developers, academics and startups. Democratization will improve overall access to the technology and allow societies to reap the benefit from AI. Democratization also requires global data flows that protect privacy and the reliability, integrity, and security of the data. Restricting data within national boundaries may inhibit AI from taking advantage of greater data diversity that comes from study across different geographies and cultures. Third, we must “guide” AI into the future to ensure it is used for the collective good and to solve critical problems previously believed unsolvable.  Guiding AI will require that we grapple with complex questions of ethics, privacy, discrimination, employment and even human autonomy.  Public discussion and debate must happen early and often as we advance AI to experience a safer and more productive world. While these will not be easy conversations, they will enable the successful and beneficial use of these promising technologies. In 2020 we will look back on the capstone decade of artificial intelligence.  That is to say, the time where years of research combined with the computing power made possible by Moore’s Law translated into bold applications.  This is an exciting moment to be building the brains of the platforms that will fundamentally change the way people engage with the world.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam By Paul Lienert and Alexandria Sage | LAS VEGAS LAS VEGAS Automotive suppliers and automakers are expanding alliances to develop self-driving car technology that can serve multiple automakers, as the race to put such vehicles on the road separates companies that can go it alone from those that need help sharing the financial and technical burdens. While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers – as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. "What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing," said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. "Everyone is changing partners." Several suppliers - notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player," said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. "The technological challenges are immense," Shashua told Reuters. "I would compare it to sending a man to the moon." Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel, and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5,000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW's senior vice president for automated driving. "We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021," Frickenstein said. "That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption." Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber [UBER.UL] to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMW's joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's (VOWG_p.DE) Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia. Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF [ZFF.UL] and Bosch [ROBG.UL]. "We're not looking to develop a proprietary system," said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch's board of management who oversees autonomous driving. "We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping." While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. "There's not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution - no one who knows everything, every part of what's needed to make an autonomous car," said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi's head of development for driver assistance systems. Some key components of self-driving systems - cybersecurity, for instance - should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo. But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said. "There will be a mix because it's quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on," Devauchelle said. "Those are big blocks." (In 9th paragraph, corrects cost of Delphi turn-key system to $5,000 from $8,000.)

When we tried the first-generation prototype, though, it was in a very early state. Well, Intel is back with a new demo, and we’re still in the early days — but that’s still pretty exciting. Intel says the Alloy headset at CES is its third generation, and it’s supposed to feature improved tracking, among other incremental upgrades. However, it still hasn’t made the changes that Intel mentioned last year: a chip from recently acquired computer vision company Movidius; the transition from two RealSense cameras to a single, wide-angle RealSense 400 series one; and a seventh-generation Kaby Lake processor. It looks very similar to the previous design, which means it’s big, clunky, and not particularly comfortable. But it’s still very impressive to walk around with no wires or external trackers, something I’ve only done in a handful of headsets. My demo was short, and it didn’t include the complex real-world interactions Intel showcased last year. (My colleague Lauren Goode also tried the first generation instead of me, so I can’t comment on any improved performance.) Instead, it mostly focused on Alloy’s inside-out tracking, and its ability to map virtual environments that reflected real obstacles. In this case, the Alloy team had pre-scanned a room full of furniture with a separate RealSense camera, although it’s also possible to do this with the headset. Once I put the headset on, a small, fenced-in metal platform appeared around me, with props strategically placed where I might bump into things — a coffee table, for example, became a round, screen-equipped... sci-fi coffee table, effectively. Coffee table, meet sci-fi coffee table It was less outright merged reality than virtual reality informed by spatial awareness, but again, that’s impressive. The relatively simple graphics were rendered crisply and smoothly, although the headset was so heavy I had to hold it up to get the best angle. Project Alloy’s inside-out VR tracking is the second-best I’ve seen, after Oculus’ Santa Cruz prototype. There’s only a little of the “swimminess” I’ve experienced in some other headsets at CES — the unreal feeling you get when the tracking camera doesn’t quite pick up small motions like leaning. But unlike Santa Cruz, where it’s almost impossible to tell you’re not using traditional trackers, the experience is distinctly worse than current tethered headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. It doesn’t help that the controller Intel brought to CES, which simulates a virtual gun, doesn’t have full motion tracking. It only translates rotation, and for me, the gun never felt oriented in quite the same direction as my real hand. As small flying robots began to appear and I had to shoot them, this stopped me from getting completely immersed in the experience, even though the weapon was responsive and easy to aim. Intel says that full tracking is possible, but here, the lack of it is distracting. Intel isn’t directly bringing Project Alloy to market, but it says at least one unnamed partner will be releasing a finished version later this year. If what we’re seeing at CES is any indication, there’s still a lot to fix before then, but also a lot of promise.

Optane, which Intel claims will replace today's SSDs and DRAM, is exciting for many reasons. Game play, PC booting, and productivity applications will be much faster with the new class of storage and memory. Intel has said Optane could be up to 10 times faster than conventional SSDs, but real-world tests on the storage have yet to be done. The first Optane storage was announced at CES, but it's only in the form of low-capacity 16GB and 32GB units to be used as cache and not as primary storage. The initial Optanes will not have a meaty capacity, but it will be a good start to test and play with the storage, said Pat Kannar, marketing director for Precision desktops at Dell. "You are going to see it roll in higher densities and capacities over the next few years, and different form factors too," Kannar said. Optane still remains a bit of a mystery, but here's what we know based on data gathered from Intel and PC makers. What is Optane? Optane is based on a technology called 3D Xpoint, in which memory cells sit in a three-dimensional mesh. Intel and Micron -- which share many memory manufacturing resources -- cooperated on the development of the technology. The first 16GB and 32GB storage will work only on PCs with Kaby Lake chips. It won't work on PCs with older Intel chips like Skylake or Broadwell or on PCs with AMD chips. While the new Optanes are exclusive to Kaby Lake, that could change in the future.  Ultimately, Intel will ship large-capacity Optane SSDs, which will replace conventional SSDs. Intel will also ship the versatile Optane as a DRAM replacement that could plug into DIMM slots. The Optane memory will be denser and retain data, unlike DRAM, which deletes data once a PC is turned off. When will Optane ship? Intel says the low-capacity Optane storage will ship in the second quarter of this year, and PC makers indicated it could be a while before large-capacity Optane SSDs are available. The large-capacity Optane SSDs will likely be installed in servers before coming to PCs. Facebook and IBM are already testing large-capacity SSDs in servers. Like any new storage technology, Optane won't be cheap. Optane technology is still being produced in limited quantities in a factory in Dalian, China. The production will ramp up over time, reducing the cost of making Optane. Intel is projecting a quick switch to mass production, when prices will start dropping. What systems will Optane be used in? Many PCs that will get the 16GB or 32GB Optane storage installed were announced at CES this week. The storage initially will go into sockets on motherboards. Ultimately, you'll be able to plug in large-capacity Optane storage into m.2 or 2.5-inch slots. The first laptop announced was Lenovo's ThinkPad T570, with a price starting at US $909. It'll have an optional 16GB Optane PCIe M.2 2242-S3, but the laptop's price will shoot up if you select that storage option. The laptop will ship in March, though the Optane option may be available later. HP's revamped Envy Curved All-in-One 34 with Kaby Lake will get Optane during the spring update to the product, said Mike Nash, vice president of product management for consumer PC and solutions at the company. Nash declined to provide a specific timeline, but it is in line with Intel's planned second-quarter release of Optane. Dell plans to install Optane in some of its Precision laptops and OptiPlex desktops around June. Intel's new "tall" NUC systems -- the NUC7i3BNH with 7th Generation Core i3, NUC7i5BNH with Core i5, and the NUC7i7BNH with Core i7 — will support Optane. Supermicro also announced new SuperO motherboards for gaming and business PCs with support for Optane. Optane could make hard drives relevant again For Dell's Kannar, Optane will make it feasible to put traditional hard drives into laptops or desktops, especially if you are on a budget. A PC with a hard drive as primary storage and an Optane cache could load the OS and applications faster than an all-SSD system, Kannar said. The trick is that Optane -- which is closer to the CPU -- would need to hold images of the OS and key applications. "It's cheaper to do that in some cases than having an all-SSD system," Kannar said.  But, of course, having Optane alongside SSD as primary storage will be much faster, but more expensive. Optane is plug and play for Windows There are also questions of how Optane will work with various OSes. Intel has said software will need to be adjusted to effectively work with Optane. PC makers said its likely Windows 10 will be aware of Optane, thanks to Intel drivers and technologies like the chipmaker's RST (Rapid Storage Technology), which will harness the speed of Optane. Questions still remain on whether Linux and MacOS will have similar plug-and-play capabilities. Linux is notorious for being late on adding support for new technologies.

Xeon HD Graphics P530 With OpenGL & Vulkan On Mesa 13.1-dev + Linux 4.10 Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 8 January 2017 at 09:18 AM EST. 2 Comments On Saturday I published Intel IvyBridge / Haswell /Broadwell / Skylake OpenGL and Vulkan Benchmarks On Linux 4.10 + Mesa 13.1 using various Core CPUs. But for some fun benchmarks this Sunday morning are GL/VLK results when using a Xeon E3 v5 Skylake CPU with HD Graphics P530. It's been quite a number of months since last trying out the HD Graphics P530 and thus while having a Xeon E3-1245 v5 running Ubuntu 16.10 + Linux 4.10 for some fresh benchmarks after changing out the motherboard, I figured I would see how the graphics performance for this Xeon CPU compares to the Core IVB / HSW / BDW / SKL results from yesterday. Like the other systems, this Intel Xeon E3-1245 v5 + MSI C236A WORKSTATION + 32GB DDR4 system was running Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 with Linux 4.10 and Mesa 13.1-dev from the Padoka PPA. Basically with this Xeon E3-1245 v5 CPU with HD Graphics P530 you get around the speed of the Core i5 6500, to not much surprise. The P530 graphics have a maximum dynamic frequency of 1.15GHz while the CPU is quad-core + HT and has a 3.5GHz base frequency with 3.9GHz turbo. The i5-6500 is just a quad-core part with 3.2GHz base and 3.6GHz turbo while its HD Graphics 530 top out at 1.05GHz. Thus in the heavier tests it sides with the E3-1245 v5 over the i5-6500 due to the higher clock frequencies. Find more of these OpenGL results via this OpenBenchmarking.org result file. The Vulkan results via this OpenBenchmarking.org result file. Now to see how the Kaby Lake Core i5/i7 socketed HD Graphics 630 performance compares under Linux in just a day or two. 2 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

BROWN/AFP/Getty Images) 67 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE LAS VEGAS—CES teaches hard lessons about preserving a phone, tablet or laptop’s battery life and connectivity, starting with this: If you value those things, don’t go to CES. Having 175,000-plus people swarm around the city while constantly on e-mail, the Web, navigation apps and social networks will crumple wireless networks and leave batteries in the red. Getting through all this takes advance preparation—the kind that can also help you get through lesser battery and bandwidth challenges. • Cables and chargers: The first rule of CES is ABC: Always Be Charging. If you’re standing still or sitting down and you see an outlet, plug in your devices. But chaining yourself to an outlet is no way to cover the Consumer Technology Association’sconvention, so external phone battery packs are standard accessory here. Your phone’s charger and battery pack should also support high-speed charging. Finally, when you’re next shopping for a phone, tablet or laptop, note that devices that charge over USB-C cables free you from having to remember to pack proprietary cables. In some cases, these allow you to not just charge a phone from a laptop or (non-Apple) tablet, but vice versa. • Police your phone’s power usage: Both Android and iOS will show you which apps use the most power, in each case by opening the Settings app and then touching “Battery.” You probably won’t see any outliers there, but if you do then you should think about uninstalling them. You may get more benefit from regulating the entire phone’s appetite for data. Disabling wireless data—in Android’s Settings app, tap “Data usage”; in iOS’s Settings, tap “Cellular”—will stretch the device’s battery life if you can get by with calls and texts. If your connection gets unusably slow, putting the phone in airplane mode will spare you the frustration of getting nowhere online but stop your phone from burning through its battery by trying to connect to the network over and over.

Some prepaid services don’t, and the “unlimited” T-Mobile One plan that the carrier introduced last year and updated at CES limits tethering to 3G speeds, which will leave your laptop or tablet sputtering along at a few megabits per second instead of the 15 Mbps or more that LTE usually delivers. Note that using your phone as a hotspot not only chews through your plan’s data allotment but will also hurt its battery life more than almost anything else you can do with it. If you have cable Internet at home, you can also use free “Cable WiFi” hotspots at some half a million locations across the U.S. by signing in with your cable account’s user name and password. • Use apps that let you switch between mobile devices: Having only one device get any connectivity happens too often at CES, making it important to use cloud-hosted apps that let me move between devices. For example, by taking notes in Evernote I can switch between my phone and my laptop (provided each device has enough bandwidth to synchronize my changes). But if I start a story in Apple’s TextEdit app on my MacBook Air, I can’t do anything with it on my Android phone—or my iPad, if I were to carry it. Google Docs doesn’t have that hangup and even allows offline editing—but I had to start writing this column in TextEdit anyway, because the press-room WiFi was out at the time.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Market News | Sun Jan 8, 2017 | 1:48pm EST CORRECTED-RPT-Automakers, suppliers team up to share costs of self-driving cars (In 9th paragraph, corrects cost of Delphi turn-key system to $5,000 from $8,000) By Paul Lienert and Alexandria Sage LAS VEGAS Jan 8 Automotive suppliers and automakers are expanding alliances to develop self-driving car technology that can serve multiple automakers, as the race to put such vehicles on the road separates companies that can go it alone from those that need help sharing the financial and technical burdens. While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers - as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. "What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing," said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. "Everyone is changing partners." Several suppliers - notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player," said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. "The technological challenges are immense," Shashua told Reuters. "I would compare it to sending a man to the moon." Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel , and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5,000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW's senior vice president for automated driving. "We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021," Frickenstein said. "That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption." Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMW's joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia . Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF and Bosch. "We're not looking to develop a proprietary system," said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch's board of management who oversees autonomous driving. "We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping." While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. "There's not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution - no one who knows everything, every part of what's needed to make an autonomous car," said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi's head of development for driver assistance systems. Some key components of self-driving systems - cybersecurity, for instance - should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo. But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said. "There will be a mix because it's quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on," Devauchelle said. "Those are big blocks."

Owned and produced by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) [TM] , CES 2017, the world’s largest innovation event, runs through tomorrow, January 8, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Keynotes and Headline Speakers During Friday morning’s keynote, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf introduced the 5G future, a new kind of network with unprecedented scale, speed and complexity. "5G will be the tipping point that builds on LTE and finally enables IoT," said Mollenkopf. During the keynote, Qualcomm introduced the Snapdragon 835, the first 10 nanometer mobile processor that can deliver extended battery life, built-in security, eye-based authentication, secure audio, on-device machine learning and immersive experiences. Under Armour Founder and CEO Kevin Plank took the keynote stage Friday afternoon and emphasized the importance of branding saying that “the key to any brand is to have personality and point of view.” Under Armour is innovating by putting technology front and center, investing $1 billion in health and fitness tech. Plank unveiled three new models of the company’s Record Equipped shoes, which give performance feedback based on workouts. Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all-time, joined Plank onstage to demo the shoes and talk about UA Healthbox, powered by UA Record, the world’s first connected fitness system. The keynote wrapped with the unveiling of a new line of sleep apparel, dubbed Rest Win Repeat, in collaboration with Patriot’s quarterback Tom Brady, designed to rebuild the body while it rests through infrared technology. Top industry executives and influencers joined global government officials at the annual Leaders in Technology Dinner on Friday evening. Ford President and CEO Mark Fields shared the company's vision for how the future of mobility will be transformed by connectivity. "Imagine what could happen when the way you get around looks completely different. Cities will change. The way we work and play and socialize will transform. And it will all be enabled by connectivity," said Fields. He announced that Ford Sync is expanding to deliver cloud-based services and that soon all Ford vehicles will be controlled remotely with the FordPass app. He also recapped Ford's recent partnership with Toyota to form the SmartDeviceLink Consortium to establish industry-driven standards for in-vehicle apps. Conferences Day two and three of CES 2017 featured SuperSessions and conference tracks focused on technology trends and policy issues, as well as C Space Storytellers and the Sports Business Innovation Track. Friday’s SuperSession Powering the Sharing Economy to Transform Lives featured panelists from Grab, the Prime Minister’s Office of Singapore and Lyft. Panelists discussed the potential of the sharing economy to democratize transportation and make travel an enjoyment, not a burden. Annabel Chang, director of public policy, Lyft, explained that among her company’s customer base, “Most people do not live within a quarter mile of a transit stop. A significant percentage of our riders take Lyft to a transportation hub, then take public transportation on their final leg.” The Self-Driving Cars: New Rules of the Road SuperSession moderated by USA Today’s tech reporter, Mike Snider, discussed with top executives from Blackberry, Intel and Mobileye how a collaborative approach between automakers, hardware and software developers is driving the rapid pace of self-driving innovations. The panelists agreed that in order to reach the expected goal of having self-driving cars on the road by 2020, the industry needs to fully solve the convergence of IoT and artificial intelligence. Friday’s SuperSession The Power of Hidden Figures, sponsored by IBM, focused on illuminating the story of women and minorities in traditionally non-cinematic roles: advancing the math and science fields. Moderated by journalist Soledad O'Brien, panelists included actress Octavia Spencer and representatives from IBM, New York City Department of Education, 20th Century Fox and Girls Who Code. IBM highlighted its organic commitment to diversity and inclusion over the past century. The Opportunities for the Global Innovation Economy SuperSession, moderated by Time Inc.’s Alan Murray, examined with CEOs from Flex, Ford and Intel how consumer technology companies are leveraging their power to build global brands and advance innovation in a rapidly changing world. The panelists - Mark Fields, president and CEO, Ford Motor Company; Brian Krzanich, CEO, Intel Corp and Mike McNamara, CEO, Flex – discussed how globalization and digitalization have been the two great trends in innovation over the last 50 years and what we can expect moving forward. C Space Storytellers During the Turner session, Otto Bell, vice president and group creative director of Courageous, Turner’s first-ever brand studio, announced the beginning of the “Post-Text Era” where images and video do all the talking. Courageous is developing new ways to utilize technology to reach viewers from 360 cameras to VR. At the Facebook session, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, VP of ads & business platforms, Facebook sat down for a fireside chat with Sony’s Josh Greenstein, president of worldwide marketing & distribution. Bosworth and Greenstein discussed how mobile and social media platforms are shaping Sony’s marketing campaigns to reach targeted audiences. Bosworth noted Facebook provides a myriad of platforms for marketing customization and distribution to targeted audiences. Executive producer of BBC Earth Productions, Charlotte Jones, provided a deep dive into the opportunities of storytelling through VR and AR during BBC’s Storytellers session on Friday. Collaborating with Oculus VR, BBC Earth Productions is creating interactive movies and games to be experienced by consumers using Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR. Twitter CMO Leslie Berland opened the company’s Storytellers session Friday afternoon with a look back on 2016 using Tweets. Twitter has positioned itself as more than a social media platform. By changing the rules of storytelling, Twitter is able to capture news and real-time moments through its users. Sports Business Innovation Technology spans all industries including sports. The Sports Business Innovation track, presented by Turner Sports ran a series of jam-packed sessions that featured Gary Bettman, Commissioner NHL, Don Garber, Commissioner, Major League Soccer, Scott Blackmun, CEO, U.S. Olympic Committee, Brian France, Chairman and CEO, Nascar, Dan Gilbert, Majority Owner, Cleveland Cavaliers and Alejandro Agag, CEO, Formula E. These big names from professional sports leagues and partners took a deep-dive into the future of sports tech. The series focused on topics including: how to extend the fan experience, what the future of arena technology looks like and how virtual and augmented reality can become part of the experience, generational differences in content consumption and viewing patterns, and how data analytics effect personnel management and player performance. Innovation Policy Track Friday’s panel The Trolls and Tech: How to Fix Patents was moderated by CTA’s Michael Patrick Hayes and featured Tyler Grimm, legislature director for Rep. Darrell Issa; Athenahealth’s Colin Anawaty; Tech:NYC’s Julie Samuels and InterDigital’s Rob Stein. The panelists discussed the harm and damage patent trolls can do to businesses, as well as how Congress can find a reasonable solution for patent reform. US Patent and Trade Office director Michelle Lee gave the panel's opening statement surrounding the agency's recent efforts, reform and projects to combat the problem. US Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA) made a surprise appearance, delivering closing comments and explaining how patent trolls can devastate small companies. Saturday’s panel New President, New Congress? What’s Next included Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH); Rep. Eric Swalwell, (D-CA); Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX), with moderator Tiffany M. Moore, VP, congressional affairs, CTA. The session showed bipartisan agreement about many policies needed to promote innovation and support technological leadership, including high skilled immigration reform, endorsing strong encryption, flexibility for emerging sharing economy business models and making more spectrum available for commercial and public use. Attending his 35th CES, Rep. Issa emphasized that high skilled immigration reform would be one of his priorities, saying, “We need to make sure the companies who want to expand get the resources they need, including talent.” Friday also featured the Stars of CES Awards, presented by What Hi-Fi recognizing the top 10 audio and video products launched at this year's show. The complete list of winners can be found at WhatHiFi.com. Saturday’s always popular Last Gadget Standing, presented by Living in Digital Times, featured the top products unveiled at CES 2017. Hosted by David Pogue from Yahoo! Tech, the innovations showcased included cutting-edge wearables, smart home technologies and connected networks. The Matrix Powerwatch, which never needs charging or battery replacement and displays how much electric power your body is generating and accurately measures calories burned was crowned the winner.

Who walked away with a year of bragging rights?  MATRIX PowerWatch, a body heat powered smartwatch, won in Last Gadget Standing, now in its 16 [th] year, while LinksysVelop, a Wi-Fi mesh router, captured the online vote. For the 7 [th] Annual Mobile Apps Showdown, MyScript Nebo, a handwriting recognition app, took home the coveted prize as both the best app at the live event and the favorite of online voters. Back for a second year, tech guru and founder of Yahoo! Tech, David Pogue held court as host.  All morning the audience was entertained with another year of creative and funny presentations from a body heat competition to a craft beer tasting and a live DJ set! There was even an appearance from a local Las Vegas news anchor.  Attendees were challenged to answer David's trivia questions to win great prizes, from fitness trackers and headphones to smart toothbrushes and drones.  Lenovo's ongoing sponsorship and commitment to innovation is appreciated. "I can't think of a more entertaining, more creative way to showcase some of the most innovative tech at CES, than by pitting products against one another for laughs and applause," said Robin Raskin, founder a and president of Living in Digital Times. "It's exciting to see the crowds turn up year after year to have their say in Last Gadget Standing and Mobile Apps Showdown." "After three days of exhaustion on the CES show floor, you'd think there would be nothing left to amaze us. But every year, the candidates for Last Gadget Standing and Mobile Apps Showdown blow my mind," said David Pogue, founder, Yahoo! Tech. "Every one of these inventions deserves an award for ingenuity and brilliance!" Last Gadget Standing 2017 Finalists BLOCKS Canary Flex Coros LINX Hubblo VR KUBO Robot Linksys Velop MATRIX PowerWatch PicoBrew Pico Portal Home Wi-Fi System Qkey Torch Pro Mobile Apps Showdown 2017 Finalists HomeAdvisor MyScript Nebo NewsON Notion Sesame True Key by Intel Security Each finalist was selected by a panel of judges, including journalists, engineers, designers and developers.  After passionate debate and discussion, the judges decided on the Top 11 gadgets as well as the Top 6 mobile apps to compete in a live competition and online vote to prove their staying power at CES 2017. Winners of online voting were determined by popular vote. In person, an applause-o-meter measured audience enthusiasm to determine the winner. Mobile Apps Showdown started with a special ceremony honoring four students who were named 2017 Young Innovators to Watch. Through the generosity of the Kay Family Foundation, Lenovo and Samsung, The Young Innovators program offers scholarship awards to high school and college students developing new technology products and experiences.  They are: Sara Du, Irvine, CA, developed Bluejay, an app to assist emergency responders. The app connects through Bluetooth to an Intel Edison (or Arduino or Raspberry Pi) that is attached to a drone. Emergency responders can then fly the drone over areas that have been impacted by natural disaster and collect data, such as GPS location, from those who are stranded. Shalin Shah, Las Flores, CA, developed Lumos, an app that can aid early detection of glaucoma, the leading cause of blindness worldwide.  The app connects to a low-cost lens attachment that allows non-specialists to photograph the retina, and an algorithm that analyzes the retinal image for patterns of glaucoma and identifies risk. Utkarsh Tandon, Cupertino, CA, developed OneRing, a wearable ring that analyzes movement patterns to diagnose and assess Parkinson's disease. It provides high precision monitoring at every hour of the day to the fingertips of patients to track disease progression and analyze the impact of treatments. Emily Post, New York, NY created Finding Clover, a geo-location mobile game that supports the movement to reduce and ultimately eliminate dangerous toxins. Kids look for clover and accumulate points while they learn how they can play a part in the movement. "All of the students that entered clearly have both technical acumen and a love of helping people and the planet. We hope scholarships and recognitions like this one help to raise a generation of innovators and problem solvers," said Robin Raskin, founder and president of Living in Digital Times. Scholarship winners received up to $2,000 (plus hi-tech gear), a free trip to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, international recognition, and the opportunity to meet technology industry professionals, journalists and influencers at a highly publicized awards ceremony.

MacBook Pro delivers on speed and design – for a price First look: The 13-in MacBook Pro's Touch Bar wows Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell What should you take away from the long, long wait for Apple's new 13-in. and 15-in. MacBook Pros and the fact that they're relatively pedestrian? For one thing, they might not be as pedestrian as they seem. Let's get this over with: Macs just aren't the coolest thing Apple does anymore. They don't bring in huge profits. People don't lust after them the way they do a new iPhone. They're not the second or third or even fourth thing that CEO Tim Cook and Design chief Jonny Ives are thinking about. [To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page.] So Apple let the new MacBook Pro release slip and then it let it slip some more. Before you knew it, the company was releasing sixth-generation Skylake laptops into the rollout of Intel's seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors. Apple needed something new and different and -- poof! -- the Touch Bar was born. Touch Bar is a red herring, a pink unicorn, eye candy designed to cast a "these aren't the droids you're looking for" spell on anyone who looks too closely at the new line up of MacBook Pros. What's more, even if Touch Bar might someday be useful, that won't be for another couple of years when mainstream software supports it. The list of supporting apps consists mostly of niche players with the exception of Microsoft Office. And Microsoft's support? Has anyone heard a timeline on that? By the time the Touch Bar gets real, Apple might be on to a full-size touchscreen. Adam Patrick Murray There's more to the new MacBook Pro than the Touch Bar. I bought my daughter a space gray MacBook Pro 13 for Christmas. (And you thought I was a hater.) The form factor changes have a greater effect in the 13 than they do in the 15. I'm not talking about the specifications; I'm talking about what it feels like to use these laptops in the real world. The 13 has something the 15 (and the previous generation 13) doesn't have: total portability. If you're not sure what I'm driving at, maybe boxing is a good analogy. The heft and size changes Apple made to the 13 put it into a lighter weight class. The differences between the old 15 and the new one are measurable, but they don't change the overall usage pattern. Given that the MacBook Pro 15 Retina I use is an early 2013 model, making it four years old, I'll need to upgrade soon. I'm certain to buy the latest MacBook Pro 15 because I've never been able to stand the 13-in. screen size. What tends to draw me to a new Mac isn't the slightly faster CPU, video or SSD performance. It's the little conveniences that get me: being able to plug in the power cord on either side because of the Thunderbolt 3 ports, the Touch ID login, a noticeably brighter LED display and a big beautiful trackpad. The Touch ID login is more useful than you might think. The new MacBook Pro is designed to sleep first. In fact, you really have to work to shut it down from the hardware. By default, when you press the physical off/Touch ID button the MacBook Pro goes to sleep. In my tests of the latest models, the MacBook Pro can go a long time in that sleep state. The next time you start the Mac you're waking it up -- not powering it on. Touch ID works beautifully when waking up, making apparent boot times much faster. The success of this sleep state should make Touch ID useful more often. (Apple requires password entry when the machine is started up from an unpowered state.) I'm not going to run down the new MacBook Pro's specs. If you're interested, you've likely read about them in four zillion stories that cover those details in minutia. There is only one aspect of the MacBook Pro that is revolutionary. It didn't come out of Ives' design studio either. Apple's decision to dump all pre-existing ports except (ironically for iPhone 7 users) the headphone jack is bold and smart. It replaced all of those ports quite nicely with the addition of four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C Gen 2 ports. Since each Thunderbolt 3 port has a theoretical throughput of 40Gbps, Apple endowed the late 2016 MacBook Pros with 120Gbps of I/O, which is very impressive. Two years ago the three USB ports on your computer combined for a grand total of 15Gbps. Susie Ochs Thunderbolt 3 ports all have dual personalities. They can alternatively function as one of two flavors of USB 3.1, the specification behind the latest version of USB. USB 3.1 has a new form factor: USB-C. It also has two variations, Gen 1 and Gen 2. The second generation doubles performance to 10Gbps. Apple opted for the more powerful USB-C Gen 2 implementation. So how can Apple get away with abandoning all those ports? No power port. No ports for DisplayPort, HDMI, Thunderbolt 2? I started using Thunderbolt 3 in late 2015 when I bought a Dell computer that sported a single Thunderbolt 3 port/USB-C Gen 2 port. USB, Thunderbolt and DisplayPort are peas in a pod. They were designed to be highly interoperable. The Thunderbolt 3 port (in combination with specific cables or adapters) can handle power both coming into and being shared out of your Thunderbolt 3 device, HDMI, DisplayPort, Mini DisplayPort, USB 2, USB 3, VGA,Thunderbolt 2, gigabit Ethernet and it can daisy chain USB-C/Thunderbolt 3. With the proper adapters, you can drive two 4K monitors or one 5K monitor at 60Hz. And that's just with one Thunderbolt 3 port. Thunderbolt 3 also makes an excellent basis for a docking port since it connects to just about every type of device used with a computer. Thunderbolt 3 is the new universal port for data connection and power. After six months with a 4K Dell XPS 15 9550 and its lone Thunderbolt 3 port, I knew we were looking at the greatest port killer of all time. USB-C's small form factor and ability to accept the USB-C plug in either orientation could eventually put Apple's Lightning cable out of business. The combination with Thunderbolt 3's throughput makes it unstoppable. We're beginning to see a glimmer of that at CES 2017, where a growing list of Windows PCs are adding at least one Thunderbolt 3 port. HP's just-announced 15" Spectre X360 offers two Thunderbolt 3 ports, as does Asus' Zenbook 3 Deluxe. You've got to love the fact that Apple bypassed the hedging-their-bets phase and just went whole hog with four Thunderbolt 3 ports. The maker of the Macintosh may be more focused on iPhones these days, but it still knows how to lead with innovation. Late 2016 MacBook Pro buyers needn't worry about getting connected with all the right cables. A slew of companies just announced Thunderbolt 3 docking stations, all of which do the adapting for you. (For more information about recent announcements, read Computerworld and check the Thunderbolt industry site. Touch Bar? Ho-hum. Apple examines the obvious and jumps in with both feet. It may seem a little worrisome now to lose the ports that we've had for so long, but it won't be long before the flexibility this gives the MacBook Pro becomes apparent to the industry. Along with the size and weight reductions, the very large trackpad, Touch ID, wonderful LED display, excellent portability of the 13, fast SSDs and yes, OK, the Touch Bar, Thunderbolt 3 makes this new line of MacBook Pros the leader.

They are not doing a paper launch, successor already discussed. (Photo : RedGamingTech/YouTube) AMD expects to return to its former glory with power users in the universe called the processor industry. They plan to do it with the release of its latest cutting edge tech, the AMD Ryzen processor, and it will be out by March. AMD says that Ryzen is the fruit of hard work in the past four years of development. This also happens to be the same time period AMD expects its upcoming Ryzen processor to become relevant. The processor developers expect something big of the AMD brand after four years starting from the launch of the AMD Ryzen in March. What is AMD's four-year plan like? This is proven at PCWorld's chat with Mark Papermaster, chief technology officer for AMD. Papermaster says that AMD was targeting for a four-year lifespan out of the AMD Ryzen. What AMD essentially wants is to release processors that will have huge impact on performance as compared to the last generation, as reported here. This is a different approach as what Intel is currently doing. Papermaster describes that their rival is doing a "tick-tock" release rhythm. Where "tick" is a mediocre release - using similar architecture from the previous one. "Tock" produces a big gap from the previous models such as a completely different architecture. AMD, on the other hand, plans to do a "tock, tock, tock" starting with the AMD Ryzen release. With concrete examples, a "tick" in Intel's pace can be represented by a 14nm Broadwell architecture since it is just a version of a 22nm Haswell. It became a "tock" when Skylake came along, bringing with it a new architecture built on the same 14nm process node. Simply put, the gap between Haswell and Skylake is much greater compared to the gap between Broadwell and Haswell. AMD Will Not be Doing a Paper Launch It is important to note also that Papermaster is not planning to release AMD Ryzen CPUs and make users wait for another 4 years to upgrade. AMD will most likely release newer CPUs annually but the plan is to have its improvements greater, not just minor improvements, ergo "tock, tock, tock". To realize the great plan, AMD Ryzen needs to live up to the hype to begin with. Jim Anderson, senior VP and general manager for AMD's Computing and Graphics division, says that they are not going to do a paper launch. Anderson also says that, they are not messing with it as they've done it before. AMD Ryzen Successor(s) Already in the Works? AMD Ryzen release date is scheduled for March 2017 and for enthusiasts, it is expected to have a motherboard ready for it when it comes out.

In an interview with ABC News broadcast on January 8, Obama said he did not think he had underestimated Russian President Vladimir Putin. "But I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation, for cyberhacking, and so forth to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating," he added. "And so part of the reason that I ordered this report was not simply to relitigate what happened over the last several months, but rather to make sure that we understand this is something that Putin has been doing for quite some time in Europe, initially in the former satellite states where there are a lot of Russian speakers, but increasingly in Western democracies." The comments come after a U.S. intelligence report concluded that Putin "ordered" a campaign of hacking and media manipulation aimed at influencing the November 8 election. The report released on January 6 by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the effort sought to help President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, by discrediting his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Russia's Embassy in London called the report a "a pathetic attempt at tainting Americans' vote by innuendo couched in Intel new-speak." The report's findings reinforced earlier assessments that hackers backed by Russia's government had intruded on computer servers of U.S. political parties. The report's release followed a briefing that Trump, who takes office on January 20, received from top intelligence officials on January 6. After the briefing, Trump issued a statement saying he had asked his staff to develop a plan in his first 90 days in office to "aggressively combat and stop cyberattacks." He also said he had "tremendous respect" for the work of the intelligence agencies. Trump has repeatedly dismissed claims that Moscow meddled in the election on his behalf, saying that those charges are the product of his political opponents trying to undermine his election victory. But Trump's incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, told Fox News on January 8 that the president-elect "is not denying that entities in Russia" were behind a hacking campaign that targeted the Democratic National Committee and a top aide to Clinton. Another Trump adviser, Kellyanne Conway, rejected any notion Russia may have affected the election. "Any attempt, any aspiration to influence our elections failed," she told CNN on January 8. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged Trump to punish Russia for trying to interfere in the election. "He's going to be the defender of the free world here pretty soon," Graham, a frequent Trump critic, said in an interview with NBC broadcast on January 8. ''All I'm asking him is to acknowledge that Russia interfered, and push back. It could be Iran next time. It could be China." Trump repeated on January 7 past statements about wanting to work with Moscow. "Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only 'stupid' people, or fools, would think that it is bad!" Trump wrote on Twitter. In the interview with ABC, Obama also said he had talked to his successor about having confidence in the intelligence community. "There are going to be times where the only way you can make a good decision is if you have confidence that the process is working," he said. Obama said he had also advised Trump not to attempt to run the White House "the way you would manage a family business." He said Trump must "respect" U.S. institutions and warned that there was a difference between governing and campaigning. "There are world capitals and financial markets and people all around the world who take really seriously what he says," the president said.

David Kretzmann (TMFPencils) Jan 9, 2017 at 4:17PM Friday was the third and final day of CES 2017 for us at The Motley Fool. We have been on the front lines talking to CEOs, engineers, and other industry experts to gain insights that investors can use to reap rewards over the long-term. We continued those explorations today -- featuring, among other things, a wrap-up keynote from Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) CEO Kevin Plank -- and didn't leave disappointed. The Internet of Things As expected, the Internet of Things (IoT) was on everyone's minds here at CES. Businesses are looking for ways to connect more devices to the internet in an effort to help people automate and enhance various daily tasks. Gartner estimates that the number of connected "things" will grow from 6.4 billion in 2016 to nearly 21 billion by 2020. As investors, the exciting part is identifying which companies are likely to lead the pack in enabling the number of connected devices to more than triple over the next several years. One of the businesses supporting this growing wave of mobile connectivity is Skyworks Solutions. Another company blurring the lines between hardware and software to create a back-end technology platform for IoT is NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI). NXP's platform powers the voice activation of a wide array of devices, including the Amazon Echo. Like other semiconductor businesses, NXP is also making inroads into developing the computers and sensors necessary for autonomous vehicles. In October, it was announced that Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) plans to acquire NXP for the cool sum of $39 billion. Qualcomm set the standards for mobile communication with 3G and 4G data speeds, and acquiring NXP would diversify Qualcomm into other areas like automotive, mobile payments (through NXP's near field communications, or NFC, technology), security, and more. Qualcomm made waves of its own at CES, particularly by sharing its vision for the next stage of mobile communication with 5G -- meaning far faster data speeds and much slower lag times (or latency) -- and what it means for the IoT. As reported by CNET: Think of it this way: If 3G ushered in the picture era and 4G was about video, 5G will be about tying our entire world together. What will we get? Live-streaming VR, autonomous cars that respond to real-time conditions, and connected cities where everything from the houses to the street lamps talk to each other. "5G will have an impact similar to the introduction of electricity or the automobile, affecting entire economies and benefiting entire societies," says Qualcomm CEO Stephen Mollenkopf. This shift toward 5G won't happen overnight -- the infrastructure still needs to be developed and put into place -- but large players like Qualcomm and Intel are both testing the waters with 5G technology starting later this year. In our conversation yesterday with Liam Griffin, CEO of Skyworks Solutions, he says he expects 5G solutions to make up 20% or more of the company's total revenue within the next three to five years. As more devices come online and cars increasingly become computers or robots with four wheels, the behind-the-scenes companies mentioned here are among the ones investors should watch closely to get a sense for how the IoT is taking shape. Bringing education online Innovation can happen in unexpected places, and when it does, we want to be ready as investors. The traditional model of higher education could be one of those spaces slated for some major changes in the coming years. I spoke with Chip Paucek, co-founder and CEO of 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU), which partners with top universities to build quality online degree programs. When you think of online college education, says Paucek, most people think of University of Phoenix, not Yale. 2U, however, is working with top universities like UC Berkeley, UNC Chapel Hill, and yes, Yale, to bring their curriculums online. This means that students can still get a quality education from a reputable university without having to uproot their lives. It's an attractive proposition for universities: 2U provides funding to get the program going and the online platform itself, and universities can admit more students online than they would otherwise have in their classes. Paucek says the sleeping giants of higher education are awake, with more and more nonprofit schools coming online. UNC Chapel Hill's MBA program alone has over 1,000 students going through its courses via the web. 2U's model is attractive, because it aligns its success with both the universities and the students. The company signs a 10-year contract to share student tuition with the university, so 2U only succeeds if students successfully complete their online degrees. When students drop out, 2U takes a financial hit. When 2U went public three years ago, it was adding new programs at a pace of about four per year. Today, the company is on pace to add 10 new programs next year. Paucek says 2U investors should pay close attention to the new universities it brings into its portfolio, since that is the main growth catalyst for the company in the coming years. Innovation can happen in hidden places, and 2U is a prime example of a young company bringing an innovative new approach to a long-established industry. Under Armour Kevin Plank, founder and CEO of Under Armour, was greeted on Friday with high expectations for his keynote presentation. It might seem strange for what is supposedly an apparel and shoes company to be giving a keynote at a tech conference, but Plank made the case that Under Armour is -- and always has been -- a technology company. "We are not just a logo slapped on a shirt or shoe," says Plank. Plank is one of the most competitive business leaders in the world today, and he has his eyes set on Under Armour surpassing Nike as the leading athletic brand in the world. That's no small order: Nike generated $33.5 billion in revenue over the past four quarters, compared to $4.7 billion for Under Armour. Plank used a colorful metaphor to distinguish his competitive spirit. To create fire, says Plank, some people rub sticks and others hit rocks to try to create sparks. Plank says he lights a match and dumps 100 gallons of kerosene on it. One way Under Armour is working to change how apparel is designed and manufactured is through its local-to-local manufacturing initiative, where the company aims to manufacture apparel in the respective countries in which it is sold (Brazilian goods will be manufactured in Brazil, U.S. goods in the U.S., and so forth). Up until now, says Plank, apparel and shoes have been manufactured the same way for 80 or 100 years. Plank calls that "criminal". Under Armour's new 70,000 square foot Lighthouse -- an innovation and design lab of sorts based out of its Baltimore HQ -- is one of the company's early steps to shift to the local-to-local model. Under Armour has taken big steps into the connected fitness space over the past several years. The company collectively spent $710 million acquiring three different fitness and nutrition apps (MyFitnessPal, Endomondo, and MapMyFitness). Plank made it clear that Under Armour's platform will remain hardware agnostic, meaning the apps can be used on an Apple Watch, a FitBit, or any other device. Except in certain instances where hardware can be integrated into its apparel and shoes, Plank says Under Armour plans to stay out of the hardware game. What these three apps -- which collectively have more than 194 million registered users with nearly 100,000 new users joining each day -- do very well is collect massive amounts of data. Whether users are logging the meals they eat, runs they take, or other fitness and wellness preferences and habits, Under Armour is gaining direct insights into the behavior and preferences of its customers. Plank showed the crowd an example of "user heat maps" in four major worldwide cities, where Under Armour can segment out different users based on whether they are walking, running, or using a bicycle. More than anything else, Under Armour's push into connected fitness is a way for the company to gather more data and better understand the needs and habits of its users -- and hopefully sell more apparel and shoes as a result. Plank says Under Armour strives to solve problems that people never knew they had. One of these oft-overlooked problems, according to Under Armour, is getting ample time for rest, sleep, and recovery. Plank announced a new line of Under Armour connected fitness sneakers which are equipped with UA Record -- an app that brings together all of Under Armour's connected fitness tools. Not only do these shoes automatically track data for athletes, but coming in February, Under Armour is launching a new feature where athletes can go through tests with the shoes to determine how hard (or not) they can/should push their body for that workout. Olympian swimmer Michael Phelps joined Plank on stage to showcase this new feature and explained how this data is vital for helping athletes both rest and perform better. Plank then dug deeper into explaining the important role that sound sleep plays in maximizing performance, whether as an athlete or throughout life. Like exercise and sleep, explained Plank, sleep also needs a strategy. Arianna Huffington, founder of the Huffington Post and author of The Sleep Revolution, joined Plank to expand on an exciting new partnership with Under Armour. The company also connected with John Hopkins medical scientists to study and unlock the science of sleep, leading to a new product line of sleepwear (backed by Under Armour athlete Tom Brady) packed with technology that is supposed to lead to a better night's rest. It remains to be seen whether Under Armour's new PJs are indeed a product we didn't even know we needed or if this is a case of the company pushing its luck with its brand power. This move into sleepwear makes sense to me, because Under Armour is now able to capture a wide array of data on people's sleeping patterns and habits and should be able to see whether certain products help improve the quality of sleep and subsequent performance. In any case, this goes to show the power at Under Armour's fingertips as it looks to do to the connected fitness category what Facebook did for social, Amazon did for online retail, and LinkedIn did for job search. Data is a powerful tool, and Under Armour just might be getting the data it needs to maintain its impressive growth trajectory in the years to come. Foolish bottom line And with that, our time at CES 2017 is a wrap.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 9, 2017 at 5:37PM Earlier this month, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) formally unveiled a set of new microprocessors targeted at the personal-computer market known as the seventh-generation Core processor family. Image source: Intel.  These chips, as would be expected, deliver improved performance and power efficiency relative to the company's sixth-generation Core processor family. What is interesting about these chips is that they represent a third wave of products manufactured in the company's 14-nanometer manufacturing technology, which was first used to build the company's fifth-generation Core processors. What allowed Intel to build better products, though, was that this wasn't the same 14-nanometer manufacturing technology that was used to build the fifth- and sixth-generation Core processors; it is a performance-enhanced version known as 14-nanometer+. At the recent J.P. Morgan Annual Tech Forum, Intel Client Computing Group (CCG) chief Navin Shenoy talked about the company's strategy in regard to chip manufacturing technology -- at least as it applies to his business unit. There were some interesting bits of information here that I'd like to go over. Following the 14-nanometer playbook at 10-nanometer The analyst speaking with Shenoy asked the latter if the company had plans to do multiple iterations of its 10-nanometer manufacturing technology -- i.e., 10-nanometer and 10-nanometer+ -- as it did with its 14-nanometer technology. Now, of course, Intel Senior Fellow Mark Bohr revealed back in August that the company indeed has three variants of its 10-nanometer technology planned -- 10-nanometer, 10-nanometer+, and 10-nanometer++ -- but Shenoy provided some additional business context around these plans in his answer. Image source: Intel.  "I think we're going to continually look at that," Shenoy said. "There's one thing that we learned in the process of getting 14-nanometer out is there is opportunity for us to continue to optimize the [manufacturing] process, maybe more so than we had historically." He then went on to say that such a strategy makes sense because "the most important thing is that we can deliver a predictable, annual cadence of new products." Shenoy further went on to explain that to deliver an annual cadence of competitive products, with an emphasis on the word "competitive" -- a company "can't just sit on the [manufacturing] process as it existed" and that the company needs to "continue to advance" the manufacturing processes that it uses to build its products. "If we can make optimizations on density or optimizations on performance or power, you're going to see us do that," Shenoy explained. Boasting superiority at 10-nanometers After explaining this strategy, Shenoy went on to say that the company is "very confident" that the company's manufacturing technology "continues to be the best in the world." Shenoy then went on to argue that the 10-nanometer technologies that its competitors Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) have recently put into production are "pretty close to what we had on [Intel's] 14-nanometer which [Intel] has been in production on for two years now." The executive didn't stop there, going on to say that he is confident that Intel's 10-nanometer technology comes out, Intel will have a "clear density advantage, and a clear performance and power advantage versus what others in the industry have." One more thing... It's worth pointing out that based on Shenoy's commentary, it looks increasingly likely that Intel's fourth wave of 14-nanometer products -- recently revealed to be called Coffee Lake -- will use a yet-again enhanced version of the company's 14-nanometer technology. Indeed, he made it quite clear that to build compelling new products, the company needs to make enhancements to the manufacturing technology to support its annual product rollouts. With 14-nanometer+, the company managed to get a 12% performance boost. It'll be interesting to see if the company can wring out another double-digit performance gain with the next iteration of its 14-nanometer technology. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Scott Gilbertson (US) - Jan 9, 2017 7:20 am UTC Enlarge Scott Gilbertson reader comments 123 Share this story Over the course of its four-year lifespan, Dell's extremely popular XPS 13 Developer Edition line has become known for one thing—bringing a "just works" Linux experience to the company's Ultrabooks. Of course, today Dell is just one of many manufacturers producing great Linux machines. System76 makes the Oryx Pro (still my top pick for anyone who needs massive power), and companies like Purism and ZaReason produce solid offerings that also work with Linux out of the box. Even hardware not explicitly made for Linux tends to work out of the box these days. I recently installed Fedora on a Sony Vaio and was shocked that the only problem I encountered was that the default trackpad configuration was terribly slow. Further ReadingSystem76 Oryx Pro review: Linux in a laptop has never been better Admittedly, the Vaio is a few years old, which means there has been time for hardware issues to be addressed. Getting Linux to run on bleeding edge hardware in 2017 remains tricky—or it requires running a bleeding edge distro like Arch. That's where efforts like Dell's Project Sputnik, led by developer Barton George, come in handy. With the XPS 13 Developers Edition, the hardware is already vetted. Drivers are pre-installed and configured for a great out-of-the-box experience. The latest Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, released in late 2016 and tested in the home office last month, is an exceptionally well-built, great-looking piece of hardware. Yet again, if you want your Linux rig to "just work," this is for you. But if you also want a powerful, svelte package that weighs under 3lbs, this is the XPS 13 you've been waiting for. Dell's most recent Linux laptop even features Intel's new Kaby Lake chip, which bumps the clock speed by about 10 percent. The more impressive side of the chipset upgrade is the graphics architecture, which is supposed to improve performance in 3D graphics and 4K video. Playback, especially 4K video, is incredibly smooth and not nearly as battery-draining as previous models. The specs Outwardly there's nothing new to see here. The 7th generation Dell XPS 13 DE uses the same wonderful InfinityEdge display that manages to pack a 13-inch screen into a body that looks and feels like an 11-inch laptop. The model I tested came with the 3200x1800 IPS touch panel. There's also a version with a 1920x1080 IPS non-touch panel, but I think the higher res display is worth the extra money. The new XPS 13 has simply the best-looking display I've seen in a laptop. Naturally the HiDPI model suffers a little in battery life compared to the lower res model. I've never used the lower res version, so I can't compare battery life times, but more pixels always takes more power. If battery life is your top priority, don't go with the HiDPI model. That said, I find the brightest setting (400 nit brightness) to be a bit much indoors. It's great for working outside and goes a long way to compensate for the inevitable glare on glossy screens. But I rarely push the brightness past 60 percent when I'm inside, which improves battery life considerably. The model Dell sent me featured an i7-7500U Kaby Lake chip with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid state drive. As configured, the whole enchilada would set you back £1,489. The lowest model—which has the 1920x1080 display, an i5 chip, 256GB SSD, and only 8GB of RAM—can be had for £1,069. For an extra £200, you can step up to the higher res screen. There's also a new option for what Dell calls a "Rose Gold" exterior. The laptop I tested had the same full aluminium exterior as previous models. Underneath it is an aluminium frame, which makes the XPS line feel solid even at its minimal weight. As has been my experience with most Dell machines, the construction is excellent. I used the previous model for over six months, shoving it in and out of my bag several times a day, every day. It doesn't have a scratch on it. I can see no reason to think the latest model would be any different. The ports remain unchanged on this version of the XPS 13 DE... You'll get: 2 x USB 3.0 (one with PowerShare), one Thunderbolt port that supports charging, 3-in-1 Card Reader, Native DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA, and HDMI. Sold separately: Ethernet and USB-A via the Dell Adapter. Also unchanged in this release are the ports and layout. There are still two USB 3.0 ports, one with PowerShare for charging your devices (note that USB charging generally requires a trip into the BIOS settings to enable; see Dell's support site for more info). There's also a Thunderbolt port that supports charging, a 3-in-1 card reader, DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA, and HDMI. As with any laptop this thin, Ethernet requires an adapter (sold separately). Further ReadingXPS 13 Kaby Lake review: Dell’s Ultrabook hasn’t changed and that’s a problemThe 720p webcam is the same one that has been in the last couple of models, and it's still at the bottom of the lid. Yes, it still sucks that it's down there, although in fairness to Dell, there is nowhere else to put it. The InfinityEdge display comes within 3mm of the edge of the lid. Nevertheless, like fellow Ars reviewer Peter Bright, I find this decision irritating. Why not just move the display panel down by 3mm and put the camera at the top so it's usable? Or, why not stop pretending that the bottom camera is useful and just ditch the camera altogether? The palm rests are made of a carbon fibre composite that I found very comfortable. The keyboard also appears to be the same as previous models. It's a very thin chiclet-style keyboard that works just fine, although coming from the ThinkPad world I still find these keyboards disappointing. What's more disappointing for some Linux fans is the fact Dell still uses the Windows logo on the super key. The touchpad is reportedly the same, although using the testing model next to the previous edition I felt a noticeable difference with the newer model being somewhat "stickier." That doesn't sound good, but I found my movements were actually more precise with the new trackpad. This was particularly noticeable in Darktable, a photo editing app with some of the tiniest imaginable control elements. Usually that can be a real pain to adjust, especially on such a HiDPI screen like the one the XPS 13 uses. The problem I experienced previously, where the trackpad would unaccountably freeze at times, appears to have been related to something in Ubuntu 14.04, because the new XPS, which comes with Ubuntu 16.04, did nothing of the sort. Another common complaint about the XPS 13 is a high-pitched coil whine that plagues some models, according to some Reddit threads. In the three models I've used, I've never encountered this issue. It's possible that the whine comes from something related to Windows drivers (some people report fixing the problem by reinstalling drivers), although I have seen reports of the whine being present on the Ubuntu-based models as well.

Since the Z270 chipset doesn't offer a whole lot other than some extra PCI-E lanes and Intel Optane support, motherboard vendors have had to pull out all the tricks to offer people a reason to upgrade.     The Z270 Gaming M7 departs from MSI's traditional red and black design and gravitates towards a much more color neutral black design, allowing users to customize the onboard RGB LEDs to choose their motherboard's color and set the stage for matching accessories.   The motherboard also adds better fan control, upgrades audio and USB controllers, adds extra M.2 with a shield, and even a USB 3.1 internal header.   Let's take a look at what MSI has to offer with the Z270 Gaming M7.     Specifications     The Z270 GAMING M7 has three M.2 ports, U.2, USB 3.1 at the rear and internally, SATA6Gb/s, and a slew of OC features. MSI has gone ahead and shown us exactly what the differences are between the Z170 and Z270 Gaming M7s.     Pricing   The Z270 GAMING M7 price is $249.99.

Specifically, Ayatollah Hossain Boroujerdi, recently released from prison after a decade behind bars. Boroujerdi “is one of those dissidents who are so beloved by the Iranian people that the murderous regime of Ali Khamenei does not dare to put them to death or even on trial.” He has “repeatedly criticized the fundamentalist doctrines of the Iranian theocratic state, and has dramatically spoken about the most explosive issues in the Muslim world, including anti-Semitism.” Inviting him to the inauguration would “deliver a stunning message to the Islamic world” and “show that we understand that there are freedom-loving Muslims.” Far East expert: Trump Tweets, China Retreats Chinese leaders “have been remarkably quiet” since the election, despite Donald Trump signaling that “his administration will pursue policies fundamentally disadvantageous” to Beijing, notes Gordon Chang at The National Interest. Some suspect they’re “merely lying in wait, but there are signs they have themselves been ambushed and still do not know how to react to Trump.” His two immediate predecessors “pursuing misguided approaches, tried to minimize” China’s initial provocations. But Trump, by publicly taking a call from Taiwan’s president, “turned the tables on Beijing, striking the Chinese even before the swearing-in.” As a result, he’s “unnerving overly confident Chinese officials.” The Chinese “have just met someone impossible for them to intimidate.” From the right: That Intel Report’s Missing Word An important word is missing from the joint intelligence report on Russia’s alleged election-based cyberattacks, notes Andrew McCarthy at National Review: “Podesta.” And the failure to even mention Hillary Clinton’s campaign chief, John Podesta, whose e-mails were hacked, is “significant . . . in light of the intelligence community’s recent history of politicizing its analyses.” Because “influencing elections” usually means disinformation, not publicizing “true but embarrassing information.” And the report “pointedly declines to tell us what specific information gives them such ‘high confidence’ ” Vladimir Putin was behind it. In fact, it “concludes that while Putin appears to have been rooting for Trump,” Moscow “assumed Clinton was going to win” and was “mainly trying to undermine . . . her anticipated presidency, not swing the election to Trump.” Crime expert: Black Lives Matter and the Torture Tape Heather Mac Donald at City Journal disagrees with those “incensed at the suggestion that the Black Lives Matter movement could have influenced the behavior of the four individuals in Chicago who tortured a disabled white man for hours.” In fact, she says, the blame lies with “the reign of racial victimology, inner-city gang culture and black anti-white animus.” Because “we live in Ta-Nehesi Coates’s America, characterized by the assumption that blacks are the eternal targets of lethal white oppression.” And Black Lives Matter is “just a more in-your-face manifestation” of this concept. She says “the establishment typically looks the other way at manifestations of black anti-white animus.” But “the violence in the Chicago torture video does not arise in a vacuum.” Conservative take: Sensible Plea for Immigration Limits People who want less immigration — 38 percent in a recent Gallup Poll, versus 21 percent who want more — traditionally “have been underrepresented in the US Congress,” argyes Ramesh Ponnuru at Bloomberg View. Now Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) appears to be succeeding Attorney General-designate Jeff Sessions “as the Senate’s foremost immigration restrictionist.” Yes, he overstates his case, but “he’s probably right” when he says that “low-skilled immigration puts downward pressure on wages at the bottom of the labor market and that reducing it would relieve that pressure.” It would “help low-wage workers and promote assimilation and social cohesion.” — Compiled by Eric Fettmann Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under black lives matter ,  china ,  donald trump ,  editorial ,  hacking ,  immigration ,  intelligence ,  iran ,  russia Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Remembering quintessential New Yorker Nat Hentoff Read Next Remembering quintessential New Yorker Nat Hentoff Most Popular This Week 1 Hell gets ready to welcome Charles Manson 2 Buzzfeed's Trump report takes 'fake news' to a new level 3 Giants blamed for trashing airplane after playoff blowout 4 Obese woman is now a stunning model thanks to 'teaspoon diet' 5 It's 'digital heroin': How screens turn kids into psychotic junkies 6 It's time to face facts: Obama's presidency was a failure Share Selection Columnists George F.

Here's what I remember from being there that day. Phones by Connie Guglielmo January 9, 2017 9:00 AM PST @techledes Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS We all knew it was coming. Reporters, analysts and industry insiders had been speculating about Apple making a phone for nearly a year by the time Steve Jobs walked onto the Macworld Expo stage that cold January morning in San Francisco. "Thank you for coming," he said, wearing his trademark Levi's and black mock turtleneck. "We're going to make some history together today." Apple's Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone on Jan. 9, 2007, calling it a "revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone."Photo by Apple Despite the months-long buildup, Apple's CEO managed to surprise the world when he finally unveiled the iPhone -- the company's big, risky move into the mobile phone market. "This is a day I've been looking forward to for two-and-a-half years," he told the audience of 4,000 people. "Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything ... One is very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career. Apple's been very fortunate. It's been able to introduce a few of these into the world. Apple's influence Apple's iPhone turns 10. Where does it go from here? 10 ways the iPhone changed everything Does the Mac still matter? "In 1984, we introduced the Macintosh. It didn't just change Apple. It changed the whole computer industry. "In 2001, we introduced the first iPod and it didn't just change the way we listened to music. It changed the entire music industry. Well today we're introducing three revolutionary products of this class. "The first one is a widescreen iPod with touch controls," Jobs said to whoops and cheers while I -- sitting on the floor near one of the rare power outlets in the hall -- furiously sent out Jobs' remarks in 83-character, all cap headlines for Bloomberg News, where I worked as the Apple reporter. "The second is a revolutionary mobile phone. And the third is a breakthrough Internet communications device. So three things: a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device. "An iPod, a phone and an Internet communicator. An iPod, a phone -- are you getting it?" he asked the audience. "These are not separate devices. This is one device. And we are calling it iPhone. "Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone ... We want to make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been and super easy to use." Ten years later, we know Jobs was right. Apple did make history on Jan. 9, 2007, when it unveiled one of the most iconic products in consumer electronics history. It's since become the phone of choice for hundreds of millions of people around the world. It redrew mobile phone design and changed the entire phone industry. And it pretty much led to the end of standalone music players, GPS receivers and low-end to midrange digital cameras. 18 The iPhone and the gadgets it laid to rest Master showman People always lined up for days outside San Francisco's Moscone Center to make sure they'd get a seat for the Macworld keynote. And while they camped out on Howard Street, they'd see the press, analysts and other VIPs escorted into Moscone West, where we waited on the top floor of the conference center. Back then, Apple didn't open the doors to the hall until 10 minutes before the event started, guaranteeing a frenzied horde of people scrambling for prime spots. By my guess, it takes just two minutes for 4,000 people to run into a conference hall and grab a seat. Let's just say Jobs already had a pretty receptive audience. And he certainly knew how to play a room. A master showman, Jobs kept the crowd of reporters, analysts, developers and Apple fans in a state of anticipation and wonder throughout the nearly two-hour keynote. He talked first about the move to Intel chips in Macs the year before, saying Mac sales proved the change over to the new architecture was a success. And he welcomed the loads of "switchers," who'd jettisoned Windows-based PCs for Macs. He touted the iPod, introduced more than five years earlier, calling it the world's most popular music player and the world's most popular video player. He got huge laughs from the crowd after cracking a joke about the mediocre launch of Microsoft's rival Zune player two months before. He played the latest iPod TV ad featuring neon-colored silhouettes of dancers rocking out to "Flathead," by indie Glasgow band The Fratellis. Oh, and he officially introduced Apple TV. And all the while I sat on the floor and typed out a steady stream of short, all-cap headlines -- a kind of primeval Twitter story. By the time Jobs reached the crux of his presentation, my headline only needed 19 characters: "Apple unveils phone." He'd been on stage for 20 minutes. The stock chart for Apple looked like a hockey stick just seconds after the news was out. Aha moment Apple's always been a magnet for speculation. Almost a year before Jobs stepped on that stage, rumors started flying that Apple was planning to enter the crowded mobile phone market with a cool new device. Talk turned from "if" to "when" in July 2006, after Peter Oppenheimer, then chief financial officer of Apple, pretty much confirmed the effort during in an earnings call with financial analysts. "We are very confident in our ability to compete in the marketplace, and we are very excited about what we have in the product pipeline," Oppenheimer said when asked how the company planned to compete against Sony and other rivals. "As regards cell phones, we do not think that the phones that are available today make the best music players. We think the iPod is. But over time, that is likely to change, and we are not sitting around doing nothing." That was an aha moment for financial types, especially since Apple doesn't make off-the-cuff comments about anything it's working on. The aha turned into "coming soon" three months later when news broke that Apple had filed a trademark application for iPhone. (Fun fact: Cisco owned the rights to the iPhone name when Apple launched the phone, but let Jobs have the trademark after reaching a legal settlement a few weeks later.) The iPhone: 2007, meet 2017 It was different, it was bold. How is it now? Ten years later, we dug up the original iPhone to give it another spin. by Scott Stein 2:24 Close Drag Bold promises It's hard for many to remember now, but back then few people could imagine how the iPhone's 3.5-inch touchscreen display and sleek design would upend a market that Nokia and BlackBerry ruled. BlackBerry's maker, then known as Research In Motion, later admitted it had underestimated the iPhone -- dissing it for its eight-hour battery life and because the phone ran only on AT&T's older, slower, second-generation wireless network. "By all rights, the product should have failed," David Yach, RIM's chief technology officer, told the Wall Street Journal in May 2015. I remember the iPhone was a big deal because it was such a big risk for Apple. Up until that day, Apple Computer Inc. was known for its Macs and the iPod. Jobs knew he was staking Apple's future on getting an even bigger slice of the consumer electronics market. He reinforced that idea when he announced at the end of his keynote that the company was dropping "Computer" from its name and would just be called Apple Inc. And he promised that the iPhone, which he called a "revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone," would be a success if Apple could capture even 1 percent market share of the mobile market in 2008. That would mean selling 10 million iPhones. The crowd went wild. A financial analyst told me the iPhone, with its widescreen, full Safari web browser, visual voicemail and the music, photo and video features courtesy of the iPod, was a "complete stunner." Another told me the 10 million sales figure for 2008 "sounds low." Apple beat that 10 million goal by September 2008 - three months ahead of schedule. In July 2016, Apple announced it had sold 1 billion phones since the phone's launch. "iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started," Apple CEO Tim Cook said Sunday in a message commemorating the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. "The best is yet to come." The right touch Here's what else I remember about the presentation that day. • Jobs saying "Boy, have we patented it" when he talked about the iPhone's design and its multitouch technology. He reveled in showing off how easy the phone was to use, calling out the single home button at the bottom of the glass screen. • Jobs making the first public call to Apple's chief designer, Jony Ive, who was sitting in the audience. Jobs asked Ive what he thought of the moment. Ive's reply: "It's not too shabby." • The laughter as Jobs called a local Starbucks, saying "I'd like to order 4,000 lattes to go, please. No, just kidding. Wrong number." • The disappointment when Apple didn't give developers a way to build native apps for the iPhone. (Jobs later changed his mind and decided to open that kind of access to developers, instead of just running web-based apps on the phone. Apple introduced the App Store in July 2008.) In the years since that launch, I've written a lot stories about the new models, about whether Apple can keep churning out designs that make us want to upgrade, and about how the phone changed Apple's partners, including Corning and AT&T. And so I'll share one of my favorite anecdotes, which comes from Marc Andreessen, who pioneered web browsing with Mosaic and Netscape and who is now one of the top venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. "In the fall of 2006, my wife, Laura, and I went out to dinner with Steve and his brilliant and lovely wife, Laurene," Andreessen told me in 2012. "Sitting outside of the restaurant on California Avenue in Palo Alto waiting for a table to open up, on a balmy Silicon Valley evening, Steve pulled his personal prototype iPhone out of his jeans pocket and said, 'Here, let me show you something.' He took me on a tour through all of the features and capabilities of the new device. "After an appropriate amount of oohing and aahing, I ventured a comment. BlackBerry aficionado as I was, I said, 'Boy, Steve, don't you think it's going to be a problem not having a physical keyboard? Are people really going to be OK typing directly on the screen?' "He looked me right in the eye with that piercing gaze and said, 'They'll get used to it.'" And so we all did.

All the denim Vered buys for his brand, YMI Jeans, comes from Chinese factories, which have come to dominate the industry because of China’s abundance of affordable labor, capital and lax environmental laws. Those same conditions help make China the world’s top producer of all manner of manufactured goods such as cellphones, furniture,and rubber boots . It’s difficult for foreign companies to source supplies from anywhere else and stay competitive. “It would be disastrous,” Vered, who remains a Donald Trump supporter, said of a trade war. “China is the whole production line. It would be very, very difficult for us.” Across California, companies reliant on Chinese factories and suppliers are mulling over what it means if the incoming Trump administration makes good on threats to slap new tariffs on Chinese goods. The president-elect and his surrogates have floated the idea of import taxes as high as 45 percent and as low as 5 percent to punish China for undervaluing its currency — a charge many economists say is outdated. Should the trade relationship with China sour, no state would feel the disruption more than California. About $143.6 billion in goods from China were shipped to the Golden State in 2015, according to the latest full-year census data. That’s three-and-half times more than second-place Texas. Meanwhile, the threat of retaliation from China looms large for state exporters. California sold about $14.3 billion in goods to China in 2015 — second only to Washington state’s $19.4 billion. The high trade volume helps keep more than 30,000 workers employed at the Port of Los Angeles, where 6 of every 10 containers arrive from China. And the raw materials and finished products that pour in ensure that California companies such as Apple and Intel remain among the most profitable brands in the world. “California has more to lose because we are the gateway to the U.S.” for Asian exporters, said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Cal State Channel Islands. “This is where the infrastructure, connections and merchants are.” The state also boasts the nation’s largest manufacturing base, employing about 10 percent of all U.S. factory workers, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Most of those jobs are in high-value sectors like computers, chemicals and aerospace — industries that can more easily absorb California’s higher wages, expensive real estate and stricter regulations than producers of, say, garments or toys. Still, many companies that choose to manufacture in California rely on components and raw materials from China. All signs point to a more adversarial relationship between Beijing and Washington once Trump assumes the White House. Trump, who nearly threw the “one China” policy into disarray last month, during the presidential campaign ran as a champion of displaced working-class Americans who believe they’ve been marginalized by globalization and Chinese mercantilist policies. Trump has promised to bring jobs back to the U.S. and slash America’s trade deficit with China, which hit a record $367 billion in 2015. One of Trump’s long-stated solutions for lost jobs and China has been to impose tariffs, much like President Reagan did with Japanese cars (a move that helped U.S. automakers but raised prices for American consumers). “I’m totally open to a tariff if they don’t treat us fairly,” Trump said during a GOP primary debate last year. “Their whole trade thing is tariff. You can’t deal in China without tariff. They do it to us; we don’t do it. It’s not fair trade.” Trump has kept the pressure on since being elected, mostly over Twitter, where he’s fired hundreds of barbs at China over the years. “China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won’t help with North Korea. Nice!” Trump tweeted last week. The next day, Trump picked Robert Lighthizer to be his U.S. trade representative. The lawyer and former trade official during the Reagan presidency has spent years arguing for tariffs on foreign goods. He joins a host of aides and appointees to the incoming administration, such as University of California at Irvine economist Peter Navarro, who favor a decidedly confrontational approach to Beijing. California “gets an advantage by simply facilitating the flow of illegally subsidized goods into the country,” Navarro, who was tapped to head the newly created National Trade Council and wrote a book called Death by China, told the Los Angeles Times last year. “We are unique in that we are the gateway for the disease, and people make money off of that.” It remains unclear how much blame to assign China for the loss of American factory jobs, which peaked at 19 million in 1979 before falling to about 12 million today. A study by Ball State University’s Center for Business and Economic Research in 2015 found that 88 percent of lost manufacturing jobs were due to efficiencies such as automation and robots. It’s also debatable what, exactly, a trade deficit says about a nation’s economy. Some economists note that the U.S. economy thrives when it runs a trade imbalance. “The challenge isn’t about how to get jobs back, but how to prepare jobs for the future,” said Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist for Silvercrest Asset Management. “The story of the U.S. economy has always been about creative destruction,” he said, referring to the capitalistic theory that new production methods always replace old ones. “The question is how to facilitate that in a way that’s humane and productive.” Moreover, many economists say the merits of using tariffs are overstated. They say a tax on imports could blunt some Chinese exports, but would also make consumer goods in the U.S. more expensive — a shift that would disproportionately hurt the working class. In 2009, President Barack Obama slapped a 35 percent tariff on Chinese tires. The move saved up to 1,200 U.S. jobs, but it also resulted in Americans paying an additional $1.1 billion on more expensive tires, according to a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It’s also no guarantee that tariffs on Chinese goods would result in more U.S. manufacturing activity — not when developing nations such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Mexico have spent years building a case as viable alternatives to China for production. “Tariffs on imports from China will not serve as a magic wand that brings back lost jobs,” said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who formerly headed the International Monetary Fund’s China division. “Rather, such tariffs could end up inflicting collateral damage on U.S. businesses and hurting job growth in companies that have built international supply chains.” Among the biggest sectors to have done this is the tech industry, which relies on countries across Asia to build its hardware. Apple can afford to build its high-end desktop computers in the U.S. because they are an expensive, niche product. But the equation changes when it comes to the iPhone, which accounts for about 60 percent of the company’s sales. Making the device in the U.S. requires access to tens of thousands of vocation school-trained workers at a single plant. In addition to higher labor expenses, Apple would have to pay for the added costs of importing parts across the Pacific such as processors from South Korea, cameras from Japan and rare-earth minerals from China. Building that supply chain from scratch could take years. The same problem applies to smaller companies and products that aren’t as high-tech. Bruce Gifford, chief executive of the Santa Monica, Calif.- and New York-based 360 Sweater, said it would be impossible to produce in the U.S. the sweaters he sells at stores including Nordstrom and Bloomingdales. “We don’t have the knitting equipment here,” said Gifford, who employs about 40 people. “For the most part, there’s no sweater production left in the U.S. anymore because there’s no sweater machines or ancillary products like the right washing machines, driers, presses or yarn suppliers.” The company would have little recourse other than to pass the higher costs onto consumers if Chinese imports were slapped with a new tariff. Almost all the world’s cashmere comes from China’s arid northern and western frontier provinces where cashmere wool goats thrive. Ultimately, Gifford hopes Trump’s tough talk on China is nothing more than residual campaign rhetoric. “I just can’t imagine the tariffs are anything more than a threat,” he said. “It’s to put China on notice.” Filed under: China, Export, Import, Tax Print Email Gmail Related U.S., EU Negotiators Propose to Eliminate Most Trade Tariffs As Prices of Raw Materials Drop, China October Imports Fall China’s February Imports Sink in New Sign of Weakness IN DEPTH: How Trump Plans to Punish Firms That Leave U.S. Vietnam Trade Deal Sparks A Running Battle On Shoe Tariffs More in Business Business Briefs – January 16, 2017 Wells Fargo Quarterly Earnings Fall in Wake of Bogus-Accounts Scandal Lockheed CEO Tells Trump Company Will Add 1,800 F-35 Jobs in Fort Worth Tax Filers Claiming Earned Income Tax Credit to Face Refund Delay This Year AUTO REVIEW: 2017 Genesis G90 Flagship Sedan Carves Out a Spot for Modest Luxury OP-ED Obamacare Repeal and Replacement: The Case for Moving Quickly A Last-Minute, Ill-Conceived Gambit A ‘Good Relationship’ With Russia Shouldn’t Be Trump’s Priority Don’t Defund the U.N. — Find Other Ways to Help Israel The Zeal to Repeal When Words Sprout Wings P.M.

And one of the most notable was the HP EliteBook x360: the world's thinnest 13-inch convertible laptop. Now that's particularly relevant, given that Dell also just announced its XPS 13 2-in-1 model. Which, so we thought at first sight, was the convertible king of the show. But HP doesn't half give it a run for its money. It's not quite as small, but it's stunning to look at - something we rarely say of laptops. CES 2017: The greatest laptops of the show HP has been through something of a renaissance of late, focusing on class-leading style. Just look at the new sharp logo (like, literally, it looks like you could prick a finger on that thing). Ok, so it might date badly in the coming years, but right now it's Bladerunner cool in our eyes. Pocket-lint The HP EliteBook x360's sub-15mm slimness obviously defines its style - but without compromising on its power potential. Just like its Dell 2-in-1 rival the latest Intel 7th Gen Kaby Lake processors are on offer, along with hefty amounts of RAM and storage. Specs are, in a sense, by the by though. The reason to give the HP a look is for a variety of other reasons: its obvious good looks (as we've pointed out); that it's designed to pass MIL-STD4 (a US military standard, so it's basically a hard bastard); and, for business types, comes fully equipped with a suite of security software. On the ports front, the EliteBook x360 offers both current and future standards. Given that slender frame we're pleased as punch that it's managed to squeeze in two full-size USB 3.0 ports, plus one smaller Type-C, an HDMI and microSD slot. There's even a SIM slot for 4G LTE use when on the go. Pocket-lint The screen doesn't have bezel quite as trim as its Dell competitor, but with resolution up to 4K Ultra-HD it's not missing a trick here. There's also a rather excellent "Privacy Mode" at the press of a button, which limits view from adjacent angles so neighbouring flight/train/public transport users can't see what you're doing. It's highly effective. It's thin with all the win. As convertible laptops go, this business-personal crossover has everything we could want... well, except for a full-size SD card slot. But we have to find something negative to say. And that's all we can muster.

"State and local autonomy over elections is our greatest asset against malicious cyberattacks and manipulation," the release stated. "Our decentralized, low [internet] connectivity electoral process is inherently designed to withstand such threats." Late on Friday, US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson decreed the state-run election systems as "critical infrastructure." © AP Photo/ J. Scott Applewhite The Enigma of US Intel or How RT "Meddled in US Elections"Monday’s release called the designation "legally and historically unprecedented, raising many questions and concerns for states and localities with authority over the administration of our voting process." Johnson’s decision was apparently prompted by earlier warnings from the Obama administration that Russian hackers could attempt to alter vote tallies to favor President-elect Donald Trump during the November 8 election. Since the election, the US Democratic Party has attempted to blame the unexpected loss by its presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Russian hackers. An intelligence report on Friday blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for orchestrating a cyber campaign to support President-elect Donald Trump — a charge that the Kremlin has consistently denied. © Sputnik/ Pavel Lisitsyn US Intel Says 'Russian Hacking' Retaliation for Panama Papers, Doping ScandalsMonday’s release noted that no credible evidence of hacking, including attempted hacking of voting machines or vote counting by any third party, was ever presented or discovered in any US state. Moreover, state and local autonomy over elections is the greatest asset against malicious cyberattacks and manipulation because voting systems are not connected to the internet, the release explained. Throughout the history of the United States, individual states have been responsible for voting and ballot tallies in national elections. The release’s description of Johnson’s action as unprecedented implied fears that some officials in Washington want to take control of elections away from individual states.

The devices were built in collaboration with Google, but it didn’t receive a lot of fanfare at CES. This is the first Chromebook built from the ground up with Android apps in mind, plus it comes with a stylus. The Chromebook Pro and Plus are identical except for one thing: processor. The Pro is equipped with an Intel Core M3 processor, while the Plus has an ARM chip. They have a 12.5-inch 2400×1600 LED display, 4GB of RAM, two USB Type-C ports, MicroSD card slot, up to 8 hours of battery life, and 32GB of storage. Basically, every spec you could need in a Chromebook. Where this Chromebook really shines is the display and stylus. The display can be rotated 360-degrees, which allows you to take advantage of the touchscreen in tablet mode. A laptop with a touchscreen isn’t exactly unique these days, but Samsung has also included a stylus. It can be used to take screenshots, jot down notes, or even as a faux laser pointer. It looks just like the stylus you would see in the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (before it caught on fire). The stylus really comes in handy when you’re using Android apps, which can be downloaded directly from the Play Store. Google even says the stylus is more responsive than the Microsoft Surface Pen. That’s obviously where Samsung and Google are going with these Chromebooks. The Surface Pro has slowly become a big hit, and people love the iPad Pro as well. Portable productivity devices are big right now. With Android tablets all but dead, Chromebooks can fill the void. The Chromebook Plus (ARM processor) will be available next month for $449. No word on release date or pricing for the Pro (Intel) model. We expect it to be somewhere around $550, which is still much cheaper than comparable devices from Apple and Microsoft. Are you interested in the Pro or Plus? Our CES 2017 coverage is brought to you by the Honor 6X (buy it here)! It offers rock solid performance, exceptional battery life with a 3340 mAh battery, and takes amazing pics with cutting-edge dual-lens rear camera, and best of all- it's affordable.

"It's crazy to think we’ve more than halved the distance to hitting 10 million in just 2 years. As the community’s collection grows so does the database." Discog's most popular format is vinyl, which accounts for more than 80 percent of its sales even while cassettes this year have had a marked resurgence, growing 42 percent to more than 60,000 units. According to the most recent music sales figures for the larger market in the first half of 2016, vinyl sales jumped 11.4 percent to 6.2 million. Discogs was founded by then-Intel programmer Kevin Lewandowski in 2000, who started it as a hobby to catalog his collection of electronic albums for which he cross-linked artists, releases and labels on a Pentium II server in his closet. The site slowly became a user-generated, wiki-like database. The platform experimented with ad revenue, paid subscription and membership models before 2007 when the site added a marketplace feature where users could buy and sell vinyl and and which led to something of a windfall. Today Discogs has a staff of 50 and offices in Beaverton, Ore. and Amsterdam and expects its 2016 revenue to break the $100 million sales threshold. Its business model is similar to eBay or Amazon with the site taking 8 percent of sales which would mean $8 million in revenues last year. With a database many independent retailers find indispensable, Discog's now claims 3 million users (although not all are active) and nearly 15,000 new users per week. The site gets some nearly 400,000 orders a month which would put it on pace for 4.8 million orders for 2016. In October the growing concern acquired the Crate Diggers franchise, a live event where Discogs users and others can interface in real time and revel to various DJs and performers while purchasing vinyl. "It’s really thanks to the passion of our users that we have been able to catalog the world’s music," says Rich. "The real thanks belongs to all the contributors out there that help give people access to music across the planet.” Read more on the Discogs news here.

All signs point to a more adversarial relationship between Beijing and Washington after Donald Trump assumes the White House. He has promised to bring jobs back the U.S. and slash America's trade deficit with China, which hit a record $367 billion in 2015. (The Associated Press) Print Email Los Angeles Times By Los Angeles Times The Oregonian on January 09, 2017 at 7:37 AM, updated January 09, 2017 at 7:53 AM comments California sold about $14.3 billion in goods to China in 2015 -- second only to Washington state's $19.4 billion. LOS ANGELES -- With each provocative tweet aimed at China from the president-elect, David Vered worries about a trade war that would hurt profits at his Los Angeles jeans company. All the denim Vered buys for his brand, YMI Jeans, comes from Chinese factories, which have come to dominate the industry because of China's abundance of affordable labor, capital and lax environmental laws. Those same conditions help make China the world's top producer of all manner of manufactured goods such as cellphones, furniture, rubber boots and even Christmas lights. It's difficult for foreign companies to source supplies from anywhere else and stay competitive. "It would be disastrous," Vered, who remains a Donald Trump supporter, said of a trade war. "China is the whole production line. It would be very, very difficult for us." Across California, companies reliant on Chinese factories and suppliers are mulling over what it means if the incoming Trump administration makes good on threats to slap new tariffs on Chinese goods. The president-elect and his surrogates have floated the idea of import taxes as high as 45 percent and as low as 5 percent to punish China for undervaluing its currency -- a charge many economists say is outdated. Should the trade relationship with China sour, no state would feel the disruption more than California. About $143.6 billion in goods from China were shipped to the Golden State in 2015, according to the latest full-year census data. That's three-and-half times more than second-place Texas. Meanwhile, the threat of retaliation from China looms large for state exporters. California sold about $14.3 billion in goods to China in 2015 -- second only to Washington state's $19.4 billion. The high trade volume helps keep more than 30,000 workers employed at the Port of Los Angeles, where 6 of every 10 containers arrive from China. And the raw materials and finished products that pour in ensure California companies such as Apple and Intel remain among the most profitable brands in the world. "California has more to lose because we are the gateway to the U.S." for Asian exporters, said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Cal State Channel Islands. "This is where the infrastructure, connections and merchants are." The state also boasts the nation's largest manufacturing base, employing about 10 percent of all U.S. factory workers, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Most of those jobs are in high-value sectors like computers, chemicals and aerospace -- industries that can more easily absorb California's higher wages, expensive real estate and stricter regulations than producers of, say, garments or toys. Still, many companies that choose to manufacture in California rely on components and raw materials from China. What Donald Trump's trade policies could mean for Oregon All signs point to a more adversarial relationship between Beijing and Washington once Trump assumes the White House. Trump, who nearly threw the "one China" policy into disarray last month, during the presidential campaign ran as a champion of displaced working-class Americans who believe they've been marginalized by globalization and Chinese mercantilist policies. Trump has promised to bring jobs back to the U.S. and slash America's trade deficit with China, which hit a record $367 billion in 2015. One of Trump's long-stated solutions for lost jobs and China has been to impose tariffs, much like President Reagan did with Japanese cars (a move that helped U.S. automakers but raised prices for American consumers). "I'm totally open to a tariff if they don't treat us fairly," Trump said during a GOP primary debate last year. "Their whole trade thing is tariff. You can't deal in China without tariff. They do it to us, we don't do it. It's not fair trade." Trump has kept the pressure on since being elected, mostly over Twitter, where he's fired hundreds of barbs at China over the years. "China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!" Trump tweeted last week. The next day, Trump picked Robert Lighthizer to be his U.S. trade representative. The lawyer and former trade official during the Reagan presidency has spent years arguing for tariffs on foreign goods. He joins a host of aides and appointees to the incoming administration, such as University of California at Irvine economist Peter Navarro, who favor a decidedly confrontational approach to Beijing. California "gets an advantage by simply facilitating the flow of illegally subsidized goods into the country," Navarro, who was tapped to head the newly created National Trade Council and wrote a book called "Death By China," told the Los Angeles Times last year. "We are unique in that we are the gateway for the disease, and people make money off of that." It remains unclear how much blame to assign China for the loss of American factory jobs, which peaked at 19 million in 1979 before falling to about 12 million today. A study by Ball State University's Center for Business and Economic Research in 2015 found that 88 percent of lost manufacturing jobs were due to efficiencies such as automation and robots. It's also debatable what, exactly, a trade deficit says about a nation's economy. Some economists note that the U.S. economy thrives when it runs a trade imbalance. "The challenge isn't about how to get jobs back, but how to prepare jobs for the future," said Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist for Silvercrest Asset Management. "The story of the U.S. economy has always been about creative destruction," he said, referring to the capitalistic theory that new production methods always replace old ones. "The question is how to facilitate that in a way that's humane and productive." Moreover, many economists say the merits of using tariffs are overstated. They say a tax on imports could blunt some Chinese exports, but would also make consumer goods in the U.S. more expensive -- a shift that would disproportionately hurt the working class. In 2009, President Barack Obama slapped a 35 percent tariff on Chinese tires. The move saved up to 1,200 U.S. jobs, but it also resulted in Americans paying an additional $1.1 billion on more expensive tires, according to a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It's also no guarantee that tariffs on Chinese goods would result in more U.S. manufacturing activity -- not when developing nations such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Mexico have spent years building a case as viable alternatives to China for production. "Tariffs on imports from China will not serve as a magic wand that brings back lost jobs," said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who formerly headed the International Monetary Fund's China division. "Rather, such tariffs could end up inflicting collateral damage on U.S. businesses and hurting job growth in companies that have built international supply chains." Among the biggest sectors to have done this is the tech industry, which relies on countries across Asia to build its hardware. Apple can afford to build its high-end desktop computers in the U.S. because they are an expensive, niche product. But the equation changes when it comes to the iPhone, which accounts for about 60 percent of the company's sales. Making the device in the U.S. requires access to tens of thousands of vocation school-trained workers at a single plant. In addition to higher labor expenses, Apple would have to pay for the added costs of importing parts across the Pacific such as processors from South Korea, cameras from Japan and rare-earth minerals from China. Building that supply chain from scratch could take years. The same problem applies to smaller companies and products that aren't as high-tech. Bruce Gifford, chief executive of the Santa Monica, Calif.- and New York-based 360 Sweater, said it would be impossible to produce in the U.S. the sweaters he sells at stores including Nordstrom and Bloomingdales. "We don't have the knitting equipment here," said Gifford, who employs about 40 people. "For the most part, there's no sweater production left in the U.S. anymore because there's no sweater machines or ancillary products like the right washing machines, driers, presses or yarn suppliers." The company would have little recourse other than to pass the higher costs onto consumers if Chinese imports were slapped with a new tariff. Almost all the world's cashmere comes from China's arid northern and western frontier provinces where cashmere wool goats thrive. Ultimately, Gifford hopes Trump's tough talk on China is nothing more than residual campaign rhetoric. "I just can't imagine the tariffs are anything more than a threat," he said. "It's to put China on notice." -Los Angeles Times Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

We don't know if you were busy last week, but things were pretty crazy here at TR HQ. We doubled down on CES coverage and did our best to take a good look at all the hardware news that poured out from the show. The biggest individual bit of news was probably the launch of Intel's 7th-generation Core processors, codenamed Kaby Lake. We did an in-depth review of the Core i7-7700K, so if you're curious about it go ahead and click that link. A new CPU release tends to produce a deluge of product line refreshes, and this CES was no exception in that regard. Both AMD and Nvidia had some big announcements to make, too. The red team had some meaty info about its Vega graphics architecture, showed off Ryzen-ready chipsets and motherboards, and FreeSync 2. Meanwhile, on the green corner, Nvidia G-Sync HDR is coming to some sweet high-end displays, and GPU-destitute gamers everywhere have access to GeForce Now game streaming. Let's dig deep into the news, shall we?

CES 2017 in Las Vegas was big on virtual and augmented reality, wearable tech, self-driving cars, drones and robots. Lots of robots. There was also plenty of products you didn't know you didn't need. A smart hairbrush, anyone? How about jeans with built-in GPS? Here's what media outlets are saying about CES 2017. CNET: "By and large, it was a weak show for phones, cameras, new virtual reality and augmented/mixed reality products and drones. That doesn't mean those genres are dead: far from it. It just means that the new year's really big products (think Samsung's inevitable Galaxy S8) will get company-specific product launches. You can thank the original iPhone -- which launched exactly 10 years ago, far away from the CES 2007 show floor -- for that." Yahoo! Finance: Gamified toothbrushes -- toothbrushes that turn cleaning your teeth part of a video game -- was one of the weirdest items Yahoo! found at the show. "The Grush toothbrush, due in March for $59, has youngsters scrubbing monsters off a depiction of their teeth; it won Intel's (INTC) America's Greatest Makers competition last year. The $29.99 Playbrush, meanwhile, is a pod where you stick an analog toothbrush (so you don't have to confiscate your kid's coveted "Frozen"-themed toothbrush), and it works in the same basic way." Tech Crunch: Amazon, along with Nvidia, had a particularly strong showing in Las Vegas. "The company's Alexa virtual assistant basically turned up wherever it made the slightest amount of sense - and even in some places it definitely didn't. Alexa's presence was mostly welcome, however. A fridge is a perfect place for the virtual assistant, for instance, since it's already basically a calendar, shopping and to-do list, just without the magnets. And Ford's in-car Alexa integration with SYNC 3 is a genius move, and one that could help the automaker get an early lead when it comes to anticipating the next wave of in-car experiences, which are very likely to focus on virtual, voice-powered assistants." Engadget: "LG's flagship OLED is our Best TV winner for the third consecutive CES. Even as the technology is popping up across other brands, as and LCDs continue to improve, this is still the best display we've seen during this show. Shifting its smarts and inputs to its Dolby Atmos soundbar enabled the "wallpaper-thin" design that makes it seem more like a window into another world than any TV we've seen before. With that, LG once again remains a step ahead of the competition." CES 2018 returns to Las Vegas on January 9-12, 2018.

The DT391GS tablets with Intel® Celeron® Dual Core Processors are used as Inspector Positioning Tablets with the critical hardware and software needed for line and grade determination on stakeless highway construction projects. ODOT needed to embrace the growing trend in highway construction sites to go "stakeless" and forego physical stakes by using modern Automated Machine Guidance (AMG) applications on jobsites to determine line and grade when building or fixing stretches of road. DT Research worked closely with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to design purpose-built Inspector Positioning Tablets that inspectors and construction crews can use to run applications that contain GPS locating and 3D modeling technologies. "ODOT selected the DT Research tablet as it was the only device on the market that provided dual frequency GNSS in a rugged Windows based device," Chris Pucci, Construction Automation Surveyor at the Oregon Department of Transportation. "The tablets have been very well received by our construction inspection personnel." The purpose-built Inspector Positioning Rugged Tablet solution has enabled ODOT to fully utilize its knowledge of the Oregon Real Time GNSS Network and expertise in survey grade RTK GNSS. The DT391GS offers four GNSS options, enabling inspectors and construction crews to run applications that contain GPS locating and 3D modeling technologies to enhance construction efficiencies through advanced location referencing and employ a combination of 3D modeling to guide construction workers. DT Research's California facility provided ODOT with a rapid time-to-market solution that leveraged DT Research's two decades of computer design and manufacturing experience. The purpose-built DT391GS Rugged Tablets are designed with a full survey grade RTK GNSS built-in for accuracies of +/0.05 ft., and the tablets can be handheld or used with an external antenna and rod. ODOT also benefited from significant savings in their IT budget by selecting the DT Research GNSS Rugged tablets -- netting nearly $12,000 per unit to date, when compared to using standard survey grade GNSS units. With a nine-inch backlight capacitive touch screen and Microsoft® Windows® 7 Professional operating system, the Inspector Positioning Tablets use Microsurvey FieldGenius software while also connecting to the Oregon Real Time Network, and can display XML files for alignment, surface and design files. With IP65 rating for water and dust resistance and MIL-STD-810G for shock and vibration protection, the DT391GS can hold up to Oregon weather and outdoor use by construction and maintenance crews.

IBM earned the No. 1 slot for the 24th consecutive year with 8,088 patents granted to its inventors in 2016. Samsung, again ranked second, earned 5,518 patents, and Canon came away with 3,665. Rounding out the Top 5 just as they did in 2015 are Qualcomm with 2,897 patents and Google with 2,835 patents. Overall, 2016 saw 304,126 utility patent grants, which is the most on record in a single year, according to data compiled by IFI CLAIMS Patent Services.  IFI, which specializes in patent analysis, tracks utility patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and each year it releases its annual ranking of the top 50 recipients. BE SURE NOT TO MISS: 8 big data predictions for 2017 Tech jobs due for biggest raises 7 hiring trends for 2017 Sixth-ranked Intel boosted its patent tally by 36% last year and came away with 2,784 patents.

Although the functionality can often be pretty good, where the camera goes is usually pre-set and the direction is what the user controls with a headset. The annual CES extravaganza in Las Vegas saw IT giant Intel showcase what it claims will be the next-level of virtual reality and video, helpfully demonstrated using a travel destination example. The demo is part of a longer, corporate presentation from the event, so pick it up from 36m00s onwards. The first item (looking around a US canyon) is impressive but uses the old style VR. Next-level stuff comes after 43m00s, until around 53m00s.

The Consumer Electronics Show has set the tech industry to a great start in 2017, following a week of amazing presentations and product unveilings that end this Sunday. While many of the exhibitions were flashy and made headlines around the world, other significant developments flew under the radar, and they deserve some love. Such is the case of 3D NAND technology. With demands for larger memory capacity and enhanced performance on the rise, 3D NAND standards seem to be the answer. The architecture has existed for some time, but 2017 could be the year it sees a wider adoption in the mainstream market. Companies such as Intel have introduced over the years brand series of 3D NAND-based SSDs for consumers, businesses, and data centers. Soon, we could see this technology making its way into our smartphones, laptops, and other gadgets. What is an SSD? Kingstone 480gb solid state drive. Image: Kingstone. A solid-state drive or SSD is a storage unit for computers that offers several advantages over traditional industry standards such as hard disk drives or HDDs. Opposite to HDDs or optical disk units, SSDs are not mechanical. That means they have no moving components, which in turn makes them faster options when it comes to reading and writing information. SSDs and HDDs differ little from each other regarding design, but mechanical units tend to hold more storage capacity due to its inner build. In contrast, solid drives can operate faster more silently, with less power, and in a more reliable manner. What is NAND? NAND is a flash memory architecture present in storage devices like SSDs, which arranges multiple storage cells across a single circuit board. The fundamentals of NAND memory made it so the technology would, eventually, reach a limit for how small the storage cells can be and how many can fit on a  motherboard. Manufacturers around the world have managed to squeeze out as much as possible from the NAND standard, managing to produce SSD units capable of storing terabytes of data in the same form factor as an HDD, although at higher prices. What is 3D NAND? 3D NAND takes a new approach to traditional NAND memory by adding a new dimension to storage cell design. This architecture not only lays out cells across the board but also stacks layers on top of each other like the floors in a building. As many can infer, 3D NAND not only increases capacity but also all the other aspects that make it the industry choice for SSD memory in laptops and other devices nowadays. However, the concept of 3D NAND opens the possibility to new form factors that had not been considered previously due to the inherent limitations of NAND. As such, mobile devices like tablets and smartphones could start adopting new memories with much higher capacity, faster performance, and lower costs soon. Desktops and data centers that demand even higher performance standards also benefit from 3D NAND, but companies like Intel and other tech leaders are already developing cost-effective solutions like 3D XPoint for these machines.

It brings in exhibitors from all around the world and every area of technology, allowing attendees to see what's coming. As CES 2017 ended yesterday, and since Neowin was there, we thought it would be a good idea to write down some of the trends that we noticed. The smart home is coming, and Alexa owns it If there was one word that I kept hearing over and over again at different product launches at CES, it was "Alexa". Indeed, Amazon's digital assistant seems to be popping up everywhere. Lenovo announced the Smart Assistant, which is similar to an Amazon Echo, and LG showed off some robots and a smart refrigerator that uses Alexa. Huawei is another of Amazon's partners, announcing the Mate 9, which will have Alexa support later this year. And of course, there were many others. But perhaps the biggest trend - which has been running for a few years now - is to put a CPU and a Bluetooth radio in everything, and that's where the smart home comes in. While you're reading this, take a look at any inanimate object around you, and you can bet that there was a 'smart' version of it at CES. But the smart home market right now is sort of a mess. Your Philips lightbulbs aren't aware of your Nest thermostat and so on, so it can be a bit frustrating to put your smart home together. There's simply no standard to build it on. And that's sort of where Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri (HomeKit), and Google's Assistant (Home) come in. While each device probably has its own hub and its own app, you can interact with them through these voice assistants. When it came down to the smart home devices that were out there (and they seemed to be everywhere), Alexa was one of the most commonly adopted standards. HomeKit was somewhat popular as well, but I didn't hear a peep about Google Home. Indeed, for a digital assistant that grew up without a mobile platform like iOS or Android, Alexa is doing quite well, and it really stole the show at CES. 8K is around the corner While we're still complaining about the lack of 4K content, 8K is most definitely coming. Dell announced a new UltraSharp 8K Monitor, and Samsung showed off some TVs that support the resolution. Dell's monitor is powered by two DisplayPort cables, and when I tried to ask the folks at Samsung how their TVs worked, I couldn't get an answer. Luckily, the HDMI Forum announced that its 2.1 spec is coming this year, and it will support up to 10K at 120fps. So we can all look forward to soon complaining about the lack of 8K content and how most people don't even have the bandwidth to stream it, but the good news is that this means that the price of 4K will continue to drop. Will anyone actually benefit from an 8K screen? Well, I suppose that if you use a really big TV and sit absurdly close to it, yes. I saw more than a few 8K displays and TVs at the show, and Dell's monitor was the only one I could find where the company could tell me when it was coming or how much it would cost. Most of them were prototypes. VR is still big, but AR is on the horizon Remember how 2016 was going to be the year of VR? Well, it's still not something that's widely adopted, but if CES is any indication, 2017 is totally the year of VR. Microsoft showed off a number of headsets at its Partner Showcase, Intel had VR demos, and every PC OEM was announcing new gaming rigs that are VR-ready. Indeed, you certainly never had to walk very far to see someone in a head-mounted display (HMD). What was surprisingly rare at the event was augmented reality (AR). It's been almost two years since Microsoft showed off its HoloLens, and similar devices are still hard to find. But down in the South Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center, there is a small section that's dedicated to AR. I tried out one device that uses a Snapdragon 835 and runs Android. When I asked why not Windows Holographic, I was told that Android was used for the app selection. Other AR HMDs that I tried were more similar to Google Glass, and those used proprietary operating systems. One thing that seemed very clear is that the AR market is very fragmented right now, and everything seems very premature. These devices are just beginning to show up, and I wouldn't be surprised if the market really expands in the year ahead. Wearables are still strong Do you remember how smartwatches are dead? That may or may not be the case, but wearables are still very strong. In fact, I saw dozens of booths that were showing off fitness trackers alone, all of which had their own differentiators. One fitness tracker claimed to actually know when you're eating, another said it could count steps more accurately than anything else on the market, and yet another said that they're just like Fitbit, except the products sell for $15. I also noticed quite a few hybrid smartwatches. These are the ones that look like standard analog watches, but provide additional functionality, such as vibrating when you get a notification, or moving the hands to certain numbers to indicate certain things. And that's just fitness bands. There were inserts for your shoes that can track how your feet are impacted when you walk or run, clothes that can track your movements, and even wearable sex toys. It all comes down to the idea that I mentioned above, which is that these companies want to put a CPU and a Bluetooth radio in anything and everything. Moreover, these products can apply to your health, giving you a reason to buy them. Don't expect the wearable trend to die down anytime soon, because it's everywhere. PCs are still coming in new form factors In fairness, this isn't an entirely new trend, but it's definitely worth noting. Remember when Microsoft first introduced Surface and the 2-in-1 was born? Clearly, the company still isn't done redefining what it means to be a PC. At CES, HP announced its second-generation Sprout Pro, which instead of a keyboard, uses a projected second display. It even has a 3D scanner, which is as simple to use as holding an object under it and rotating it. Dell produced some innovative devices as well, such as its XPS 27, which is the company's take on Microsoft's Surface Studio. It also introduced the Canvas, which is a touchscreen display that sits flat where your keyboard would normally be. When hearing about these announcements and getting hands-on time with HP's and Dell's new devices, I really was reminded of when Surface was introduced. At the time, we had something new, and I thought that was it; Microsoft has reinvented the laptop. But with more and more new form factors coming out, one can't help but wonder what's next. Final thoughts This was the first CES that I've been to, but it was really great to be able to see all of the exciting new stuff that the big companies are working on, as well as the smaller ones. Amazon's Alexa definitely stole the show, and it really goes to show just how much work is cut out for Apple, Google, and Microsoft. Microsoft has its upcoming Home Hub, but it's already running behind. 8K devices will certainly be exciting, if only because it will normalize 4K a bit more than it already is. It has four times as many pixels as 4K does, which is about 33 million. It will raise all-new questions about bandwidth for streaming, content creation, and content availability. And then there's VR. I knew that many companies have bold virtual reality ambitions, but it's clear that this is something in which everyone seems to want to take part. Of course, AR is harder to do, so it will take longer, but it's coming down the pipeline. I wasn't surprised by the amount of wearables that I saw. I had heard the stories of CES shows gone by, where companies will make something that sounds as silly as smart underwear. I'm glad to see the market still thriving, as I do think it's important to the future of technology. Oh, but if you want one more trend, here's a freebie. There are a lot of companies that think that their generic iPhone cases are good enough for people to want to see them at a massive show like CES.

That's about to change. By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | January 9, 2017 -- 12:00 GMT (04:00 PST) | Topic: Big Data Analytics At CES 2017, Under Armour unveiled shoes that assess an athlete's readiness to work out. Within just a few years, tens of billions of connected devices will be delivering real-time information from just about every aspect of life. Every industry is adding connected capabilities and services, from automotive to entertainment, as well as sports and health care. Still, technology leaders at CES 2017 said there's still a trove of untapped potential when it comes to measuring human performance. CES 2017 The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display Panasonic unveils 'human-like' companion robot Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' Voice is the next computer interface Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1 HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro Amazon revs Alexa everywhere strategy Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts See also: CNET's full coverage "Today, real-time data helps us know more about our cars than our bodies," said Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkompf in his CES keynote. "On board computers log everything that happens and dashboard indicators let us know when something goes wrong -- there's no system like that for your health." Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said his company's vision for connected fitness was inspired by the same challenge. "It frustrated us to know we know more about our cars and our bank account than we do about our own health and fitness," he said in his own keynote address. The projected growth in this area is significant: Mollenkompf noted that an estimated 40 percent of IoT-related technology will be tied to health care by 2020. That's why Qualcomm, via its Qualcomm Life unit, is teaming up with UnitedHealthcare to integrate the use of wearables into corporate wellness plans. It's also why Under Armour has been busy forging technology partnerships and finding new ways to make use of its customer's data -- like using data collected from your shoes to tell you whether you're ready for a workout. "We can help you turn your data into direction , to help you make better choices and reach your health and fitness goals," Plank said. The reasons for measuring human performance don't stop at health and fitness -- it also opens up new business opportunities in the world of professional sports. Human performance is one of two core competencies -- along with immersive video -- of the Intel Sports Group. Collecting and analyzing data on human performance is "how can we help athletes perform at their best and avoid injuries, and help scouts find talent they normally wouldn't," James Carwana, general manager of the Intel Sports Group, told ZDNet. When that data is combined with Intel's immersive video capabilities, it can create entirely new ways for fans and spectators to enjoy sports. They can watch a basketball game as if they were in the front row while finding out just how well their favorite athlete is performing. "People have a ton of passion about sports, following the athlete, following the team - learning about how high LeBron jumped," Carwana said. Last year, Intel participated in the X Games, outfitting BMX bikes with modules to track data on in-air rotations, jump height, jump distance, speed, and force on landing. While fans had a more enriched viewing experience, the athletes themselves also liked having the data at their fingerprints, said Jeff Hopper, who leads strategy and marketing for the Sports Group. As other industries have already, athletes and teams are now learning, Hopper said, that "the best data is going to win."

January 09, 2017 08:00 ET Oregon Department of Transportation Deploys DT Research Purpose-built GNSS Rugged Tablets for Construction Projects Unique Dual Frequency GNSS Rugged Tablets become Stakeless Construction Inspection Solution with GPS Locating and 3D Modeling SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - January 09, 2017) - DT Research, the leading designer and manufacturer of purpose-built computing solutions for vertical markets, today announced the successful deployment of the DT391GS Rugged GNSS Tablets for the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT). The DT391GS tablets with Intel® Celeron® Dual Core Processors are used as Inspector Positioning Tablets with the critical hardware and software needed for line and grade determination on stakeless highway construction projects. ODOT needed to embrace the growing trend in highway construction sites to go "stakeless" and forego physical stakes by using modern Automated Machine Guidance (AMG) applications on jobsites to determine line and grade when building or fixing stretches of road. DT Research worked closely with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to design purpose-built Inspector Positioning Tablets that inspectors and construction crews can use to run applications that contain GPS locating and 3D modeling technologies. "ODOT selected the DT Research tablet as it was the only device on the market that provided dual frequency GNSS in a rugged Windows based device," Chris Pucci, Construction Automation Surveyor at the Oregon Department of Transportation. "The tablets have been very well received by our construction inspection personnel." The purpose-built Inspector Positioning Rugged Tablet solution has enabled ODOT to fully utilize its knowledge of the Oregon Real Time GNSS Network and expertise in survey grade RTK GNSS. The DT391GS offers four GNSS options, enabling inspectors and construction crews to run applications that contain GPS locating and 3D modeling technologies to enhance construction efficiencies through advanced location referencing and employ a combination of 3D modeling to guide construction workers. DT Research's California facility provided ODOT with a rapid time-to-market solution that leveraged DT Research's two decades of computer design and manufacturing experience. The purpose-built DT391GS Rugged Tablets are designed with a full survey grade RTK GNSS built-in for accuracies of +/0.05 ft., and the tablets can be handheld or used with an external antenna and rod. ODOT also benefited from significant savings in their IT budget by selecting the DT Research GNSS Rugged tablets -- netting nearly $12,000 per unit to date, when compared to using standard survey grade GNSS units. With a nine-inch backlight capacitive touch screen and Microsoft® Windows® 7 Professional operating system, the Inspector Positioning Tablets use Microsurvey FieldGenius software while also connecting to the Oregon Real Time Network, and can display XML files for alignment, surface and design files. With IP65 rating for water and dust resistance and MIL-STD-810G for shock and vibration protection, the DT391GS can hold up to Oregon weather and outdoor use by construction and maintenance crews.

That’s not a restriction to high-end chips either: every single Ryzen CPU will be ‘unlocked,’ meaning every chip can be overclocked very easily. While once upon a time overclocking was a lucky extra that some CPUs were more capable of than others, somewhere along the way Intel decided it could use overclocking ability as a selling point, so it only unlocked the multiplier on some of its chips. That’s not a tactic AMD plans to use with its Ryzen chips though. Of course you will still need a decent motherboard with the right features (x370, x300 and B350 chipsets only) and enough stability to make it work – as with any overclock – but you won’t need a specialist CPU. You also don’t need fancy memory either, as one of the advantages of multiplier overclocking is that it affects the CPU only. Ryzen owners may not even need to do any overclocking themselves, as AMD’s Extended Frequency Range could see chips automatically overclocked to their full potential when needed. Also detailed in Infoworld’s break down of the new chips, was that if you are looking to run crossfire or SLI setups on a Ryzen platform, you will need an X370 motherboard. The other chipsets will not support it. According to AMD, that’s because only those who buy top end motherboards tend to use multi-GPU set ups anyway, so adding support for that to entry level models wasn’t seen as a necessity. Discuss on our Facebook page, HERE. KitGuru Says: It’s good to see AMD not putting limiters on the performance potential for its chips and forcing people to pay for the privilege of overclocking. Just make sure you get a compatible motherboard if you’re looking to get into it yourself.  Similar Posts Categories Tags Related Related Tags: AMDcesnewsprocessorRyzen Categorized Under: CPU Davor Jagec “multiplayer”, really?

I am sure that most likely it is because of the way the chips are designed that the multi is fully unlocked this time around. We may find that in a future revision of these chips down the road that they will start with the black edition CPU’s once more. I guess it could be just a marketing ploy as well to get people to switch over to their new Ryzen CPU’s and it is a good one at that because overclockers do like to squeeze the most out of their hardware and if restrictions are for the most part removed it does get their attention for sure.

It’s not a lot to do with cooling it’s down to the way the architecture is designed not as heat disapating as it could be that’s why they are tweeking skylake and renaming as kabylake. In fact it’s very little improvement. Amd chips can go very very high especially amd s apus they overclock so well better than the fx which is bit older in design. With the lower tcp in ryzen I think we will see world records smashed this year with overclocks of way over 8.00 ghz. Think a new record will be a lot higher. Intel are boasting kaby lake at 5.00 ghz is so way off amd have achieved that three years ago I’ve had my 6800k at 5.00 ghz on air! For over three years stable no crashes day in day out you can get 5.00 on and Intel i7 but your thermal limit is very very close slightest over pushing in apps and multi threaded programs and it crashes out. That doesn’t happen with Amd chips if your set up is good VA:F [1.9.22_1171] Rating: 0 (from 0 votes) Wibble 1 frame a second/ I guess overclocking isn’t your strong point.

In the past, updates in Intel’s desktop architecture could take a long time to filter through to the mobile space. As MSI’s product expert Alex Lin explained to KitGuru, Kaby Lake based gaming laptops will be available in January. Can MSI deliver on its promises of a lot more gaming bang for your buck? The numbers on MSI’s back drop claim that a gaming notebook with a ‘7th Generation CPU and the latest nVidia GTX graphics processor’ will deliver up to 25% more performance over the products they are replacing – in a number of gaming titles – is a pretty bold claim.   At the same time audio, keyboards and cooling have all been overhauled (more about in our next video). That’s enough innovation to spark interest – we will see in the KitGuru Labs if the delivery matches the pitch. For now, here’s Alex to explain in more detail. Watch via our Vimeo Channel (Below) or over on YouTube at 1080p HERE KitGuru says: With around 170,000 technology enthusiasts cruising close to a quarter of a million square metres of exhibition space, companies need to display some very impressive new technology. MSI and its competitors pulled out the stops for this show and the products we saw, certainly have promise.

Nvidia demoed its own self driving car as well as an Audi Q7 equipped with the same software and hardware. The GPU-maker also teamed up with Mercedes Benz for a vehicle with an onboard AI. Baidu also announced a partnership with Chinese vehicle maker BAIC Motor to work on smart car tech, with road testing expected by the end of this year. Ford demoed an updated version of its Fusion Hybrid vehicle with autonomous driving, while Delphi and Hyundai also demoed their self driving cars. BMW announced a partnership with Intel and Mobileye to develop a fleet of 40 test vehicles, to be deployed in the second half of 2017. In-car experiences were also a focus for automakers. Volkswagen started integrating Amazon’s Alexa in some of its cars, while Toyota introduced Concept-i, an in-car AI partner that acts as a copilot and a travel guide. Honda’s latest electric concept car the NueV also comes integrated with Honda’s Automated Network Assistant (HANA), built with SoftBank, to personalize driving experiences. Ford and Toyota also partnered up to launch a consortium to help set standards for in-car apps. This consortium currently lists Mazda, PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries and Suzuki as its members. Advertisement Home automation: Amazon’s Alexa was a top choice for home automation integration. The LG Hub Robot, which when placed in common areas, will recognize family members coming and going, respond to commands with gestures like nodding and control gadgets, and comes with Amazon’s Alexa on board. Similarly, the company’s new fridge, also comes with Alexa integration. Lenovo also launched its own smart assistant device with Alexa onboard. Google Assistant was less popular, although nVidia launched a new Shield TV that supports Google’s solution, and said it will updated older devices too. The CES also saw devices like Emotech, a personal home assistant that has a physical personality, and a smart toaster. More practically, Knocki demoed a device that attaches to walls or under a table, which can be tapped to trigger events like turning on a light, muting speakers etc. Gadgets/wearables: Unsurprisingly, smartwatches were not too popular this CES. A couple of smaller startups apart, Garmin was the only company to introduce new smartwatches. Samsung on the other hand only announced an update making its watches compatible with iOS. However, there were certainly some interesting devices. Among them is Blitab, an Android tablet that comes combined with a smart Braille surface, for enabling the visually impaired to use computers. Other interesting products included Siren Care’s health tracking with fabrics, and a 3D printer for printing real metal parts. In education, LEGO announced a kit called Move Hub for building and programming robots, to encourage children to build and code. For more advanced users, Chip Pro launched a $16 prototyping chip that can be used to scale to build IoT gadgets. Devices: Blackberry branded TCL phones were demoed at the CES, marking TCL’s entry into enterprise.  Samsung meanwhile launched the Chromebook Plus – a Chrome OS-based laptop with 360 degree hinges to convert it to tablet mode, a functionality previously reserved for WIndows laptops. Almost as if to make up for this, Razer demoed its new Windows laptop – Valarie, which sports three 4K screens, for a massive resolution of 11520*2160 04 Related #Autonomous Cars #CES 2017 #Devices #Internet #IoT #Mobile Related Fitbit to launch in India next month; preorders live on Amazon Pebble launches smartwatches in India exclusively on Amazon Autonomous cars to be considered as drivers in the US LYCOS to launch a line of wearables including wristbands and rings Infosys invests $3M in wearables technology firm Whoop #Outlook16: What Indian IoT and wearables companies plan to do in 2016 < Previous Next > Montblanc sues digaaz.com for selling fake luxury goods under its brand name Manav Sethi appointed CMO of ALT Balaji Daily Newsletter More in Devices FreeCharge to come integrated on Indus OS phones Autonomous cars and home automation take center stage at CES 2017 Cyanogen shutters flagship OS and related services Reliance Jio starts listing LYF phones, WiFi device on its online portal Acer suspends its smartphone business in India: report Digital Jobs Team Leader – Technical Development at Pemex Global Consultancy Requirement Operations Executive for Pemex Energy Gurgaon Require Chief Security Officer at Pemex Global Reviews Pemex Energy Complaints recruitment for Transaction Risk Investigator Require HR Manager – Performance Management System at PEMEX Global Comments youngskilledindia.com: FMCG Professionals always add value to the startup business....!

Asian Scientist Newsroom | January 9, 2017 | Technology AsianScientist (Jan. 9, 2017) - An international scientists team of scientists has found a way to make memory chips perform computing tasks that are traditionally done by computer processors like those made by Intel and Qualcomm. Their findings, published in Scientific Reports, mean that data can now be processed in the same spot where it is stored, leading to much faster and thinner mobile devices and computers. Redox-based resistive switching random access memory (ReRAM) chips use different electrical resistance to store information, making it possible to store the data in a higher number of states than the existing binary system. However, instead of storing information, NTU Assistant Professor Anupam Chattopadhyay in collaboration with Professor Rainer Waser from RWTH Aachen University and Dr Vikas Rana from Forschungszentrum Juelich showed how ReRAM can also be used to process data. The prototype ReRAM circuit processes data in four states instead of two. Using ReRAM for computing in this manner will be more cost-effective than other computing technologies on the horizon, since ReRAMs will be available in the market soon, Chattopadhyay said. “ReRAM is a versatile non-volatile memory concept. These devices are energy-efficient, fast, and they can be scaled to very small dimensions. Using them not only for data storage but also for computation could open a completely new route towards an effective use of energy in the information technology,” Waser added. The research team is now looking to engage industry partners to leverage this important advance of ReRAM-based ternary computing. The researchers will also work on developing the ReRAM to process more than its current four states, which will lead to great improvements of computing speeds as well as to test its performance in actual computing scenarios.

Automotive suppliers and automakers are expanding alliances to develop self-driving car technology that can serve multiple automakers, as the race to put such vehicles on the road separates companies that can go it alone from those that need help sharing the financial and technical burdens. While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers - as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. "What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing," said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. "Everyone is changing partners." Several suppliers - notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player," said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. "The technological challenges are immense," Shashua told Reuters. "I would compare it to sending a man to the moon." Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel , and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5,000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW's senior vice president for automated driving. "We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021," Frickenstein said. "That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption." Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMW's joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia . Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF and Bosch. "We're not looking to develop a proprietary system," said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch's board of management who oversees autonomous driving. "We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping." While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. "There's not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution - no one who knows everything, every part of what's needed to make an autonomous car," said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi's head of development for driver assistance systems.Some key components of self-driving systems - cybersecurity, for instance - should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo. But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said. "There will be a mix because it's quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on," Devauchelle said. "Those are big blocks."

(Photo: Reuters) Automotive suppliers and automakers are expanding alliances to develop self-driving car technology that can serve multiple automakers, as the race to put such vehicles on the road separates companies that can go on it alone from those that need help sharing the financial and technical burdens. While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers – as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. "What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing," said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. "Everyone is changing partners." Several suppliers - notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player," said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. "The technological challenges are immense," Shashua told Reuters. "I would compare it to sending a man to the moon." Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system.

MacBook Pro, Surface Book choice down to what you do with your hands Posted on 9-Jan-2017 15:13 by Bill Bennett. | Filed under: News : Bill Bennett. MacBook Pro and Surface Book are flagship laptops. They show the best hardware Apple and Microsoft have to offer. They are also showcases for MacOS and Windows 10. Each makes a powerful statement about what laptops are today and where they are going. The two share underlying technology. Both use the same Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processor families. Both have high-resolution displays. While the Surface Book packs more pixels per inch, most everyday users won’t notice. Both come in a slim clamshell case. They have decent battery life. They are powerful and mobile. Different pathsYet despite similarities they couldn’t be more different. Surface Book is a touch-screen hybrid. The MacBook Pro is a more traditional non-touch screen laptop. More traditional not traditional: most 2016 MacBook Pro models have a Touch Bar. You could see these differences as a fork in portable computing’s evolutionary path. Real choiceMost people considering one of these two laptops will have already made up their mind. A number will weigh the two up and choose the computer that most suits their needs. There are matters to consider. You may prefer Windows 10 or MacOS. You may have a fortune invested in apps. You could have a lifetime of habits, skills and muscle memory tied up in one or other operating system. You may have a deep-seated philosophical or ideological objection to Apple or Microsoft. This may, or may not, be rational. You may want a device with a detachable screen that acts as a tablet. You may feel you need plenty of ports or you have an aversion to dongles. You may want to punish Apple for not keeping faith with whatever was on your personal MacBook Pro wish list. Or you might like the look of the Touch Bar. All these considerations are valid. Only a fool would spend a few thousand dollars without thinking them through. The important thing is you have a real choice between two quite different machines. What you do with your handsSwitching from one line to the other is more than just a one-off investment in a new laptop. Yet the most important choice between the two ranges is simple and fundamental question: Do you prefer to work where your hands stay on the keyboard plane or are you happier reaching up from the keyboard to hunt and peck screen buttons? ProductivityApple thinks you’ll be more productive and comfortable keeping your hands on one plane. Microsoft begs to differ. Getting this decision right is vital. It depends on what you do with your computer. People who touch type, who write vast numbers of words each day might do better going with Apple’s keyboard-centric approach. 1 If you use your laptop more as a consumption device, then Microsoft’s touch-screen way of working may better suit your needs. Again there’s a qualification: may. Some readers who want a touch screen computer could be better served with something else. That could be an iPad Pro or it could be another brand of tablet. There are qualifications here because you don’t need me to tell you what to buy2. Once you’ve figured out how the physical user interface relates to the way you work, you’ll know yourself which is right for you. The question may be simple, the answer is not. Clash of ideasBoth computers appeal to the same class of demanding, well-heeled user. They both look and feel good. They power deliver power. They both cost a lot compared with alternatives. Apple is sticking with the clamshell-keyboard-screen laptop format that has been around in one form or another since the early 1980s. While it uses an old format, the MacBook Pro is not conservative. You only have to listen to the critics who decry the lack of ports or sneer at the Touch Bar to realise just how different it is to what went before. Computer makers don’t alienate customers with incremental design changes. Surface Book a break with traditionMicrosoft’s Surface Book is a departure. It is a hybrid device that works as both a conventional laptop and a tablet. Sure hybrids are no longer new. Yet the Surface Book feels like a fresh take on the format. At the time of writing it represents the state-of-the-art for hybrid devices. It is the most advanced, the most polished and the most powerful hybrid you can buy. The Surface Book has an elegant approach to docking and undocking the two parts. Most hybrids involve compromise. They sacrifice something of their laptop personality and part of their tablet identity. Microsoft avoids this. PhilosophyIt can sound pompous to talk of philosophy in this context, but there is a clear divide in the thinking behind Microsoft and Apple’s designs. It goes beyond the hands flat or hands moving between screen and keyboard choice. Microsoft built its device for people who want both a laptop and a tablet in a single package. Most likely, people who buy a Surface Book will use it as a laptop most of the time with occasional tablet forays. The Surface Book has a touch screen. This isn’t because it can function as a tablet, it’s because Microsoft sees touch screens as the future. TouchingMicrosoft bet the farm on touch technology when it released Windows 8. That was a mess of an operating system. It belongs among the great technology missteps of modern times. The mistake could have killed a less robust business than Microsoft. Consumers are less keen on touch screen laptops than Microsoft anticipated. There are good reasons for this. Touch interfaces are still clumsy. The jarring step between Windows tablet mode and desktop Windows is still not resolved. This makes for cognitive dissonance. The effect is not as pronounced in Windows 10 as in Windows 8, but it has not gone away. If you’re a Windows user and you don’t like or need the touch interface, it is easier to ignore in Windows 10. ExpensiveThe Surface Book is the most expensive Windows laptop choice. You’ll be hard pressed to find an everyday computer that costs more. Although if it meets your needs, the Surface Book is worth every penny. You can buy a Surface Book for NZ$2750. That money gets you a model with only 128GB of storage and an i5 processor. Going all the way to a i7 power plant and 1TB of storage will lighten your bank account by NZ$5800. That’s a big investment. Yes, if you work all the time with your computer and it lasts more than a couple of years it only amounts to $50 a week. Apple pricesApple’s prices are at the same nosebleed altitude. A bare bones 13-inch 2016 MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar but with 256GB of storage and an Intel i5 processor costs NZ$2500. If you crank the spec up all the way to a 2.9GHz i7 chip and 2TB of SSD storage, a graphics card and extra graphics memory then you can spend a whopping NZ$7250. As with the Surface Book, you’re only going to go for the full monty if you run applications that need all the power. If you do, then the price of the hardware is among the least of your problems. Apple touch screenApple doesn’t offer touch screen laptops. At least it doesn’t offer touch screen laptops running MacOS. You could argue the iPad Pro with Apple’s Smart Keyboard or with a decent third-party keyboard gives you what amounts to a laptop. Whatever that is and whatever its merits, it does not compete with the Surface Book or the MacBook Pro. It’s possible Apple may one day build an iPad with the power and versatility of a Surface Book or MacBook Pro. It won’t be soon, the chips needed to build such a device don’t exist today. MacBook Pro, Surface Book choice down to what you do with your hands was first posted at billbennett.co.nz Might because my experience is touch screen computers are painful after hours of typing. They may not trouble you. ?? Often when I write about comparisons readers think I’m telling them what to do. That’s not my aim. ??

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: ARVR VR zombie game Arizona Sunshine will get Vegas-themed Undead Valley mode in February David Jagneux, UploadVR@UploadVR January 8, 2017 12:10 PM Above: Arizona Sunshine is a zombie VR game. Image Credit: UploadVR Arizona Sunshine by Vertigo Games is a great game. We liked it so much, in fact, that we awarded it the designation of our favorite VR game of 2016. The complete single player campaign mode, cooperative multiplayer support, and addictive horde mode delivered a lot of content to a game that was already overflowing with fun and engaging gameplay mechanics. At CES 2017 in Las Vegas, NV this week, we caught a glimpse of some new content in the works for the zombie-slaying shooter that’s due to release next month. Outside of the Intel booth area on the show floor, there is a short teaser video playing that shows someone on a turret mowing down waves of zombies. After speaking with a representative from Vertigo Games, we’ve confirmed that the new game mode is multiplayer-focused and is set in a post-apocalyptic version of the Las Vegas strip (appropriate because it’s at CES in Vegas right now) as opposed to the Arizona desert featured in the core Arizona Sunshine game. Each player will take on a specific role in Undead Valley missions with up to four players. Roles include Sniper, Gunner, and two Runner positions. The Sniper and Gunner are intended to provide cover fire for the two Runners that will explore the environment and recover packages that are dropped into dangerously infested areas overrun by zombies. This new game mode is entirely separate from the existing Campaign and Horde modes already in the game and even includes its own self-contained mini-narrative. Throughout the match, you’ll also see supply drops that are valuable, but risky, to retrieve. The demo at CES was shown running on an Oculus Rift with Touch and will be designed to be endless once it’s available to consumers next month in February. Vertigo Games is undecided on if this will be a free or paid DLC. Do you have any questions about this potential new game mode? Let us know in the comments and we’ll get to the bottom of it all at CES this week in Las Vegas. Update: This story was originally posted as speculation based on the above video we recorded at CES, but has since been expanded and updated with official information and details after we spoke with a Vertigo Games representative at CES.

Targeting enterprise-level applications, virtualised environments and more, its innovative compute, storage and I/O 'books' allow it to be easily upgraded to keep up with demand. Supporting Intel's E7-4800 and E7-8800 v4 Xeons, the x3850 X6 employs up to four compute books each with their own CPU socket and DIMM slots. You can start easy with two and upgrade as the workload increases simply by slotting more books in. The server can also be performance-upgraded in situ by swapping the compute books out for new ones. Existing systems with older v2 or v3 variants of these CPUs can be boosted to the latest v4 models in minutes. This design does away with the maintenance blues as the entire chassis stays put in the rack. Everything can be accessed from the front or the rear so there's no need to pull the system out. Lenovo’s compute books hold one E7 Xeon CPU and 24 DIMM slots and can be field upgraded Lenovo's library Our review system had four compute books each with a 2.2GHz E7-8860 v4 Xeon and four 32GB TruDDR4 memory modules. Each book offers 24 DIMM slots so memory can be boosted to an impressive 6TB using 64GB LRDIMMs. Each compute book has dual dedicated fan modules in front and once they are unclipped, a lever can be flipped down and used to remove the book. The CPU nestles at the rear complete with a full height heat-sink and the 24 DIMM slots are evenly distributed on each side of the daughterboard. The books have inspection panels on each side and pressing their light path button shows which component has failed, making problem diagnostics a cinch. In fact, the server uses light paths throughout so you can see at a glance whether other components such as CPUs, hard disks, fans or PSUs have failed. Storage surprises The x3850 X6 may only have a single storage book but it is very versatile. Our system had eight hot-swap SFF drive bays, but you can start with four and add a second cage later. Storage books are available for eight or 16 1.8in SSDs and you can mix them with standard SFF drives. There's more, as the storage book supports up to four PCIe NVMe SSDs and dropping to two of these leaves enough space for eight 1.8in. SSDs or four SFF drives as well. The storage book is easily removed and we were impressed with its innards - it offers two PCI-e slots supporting a choice selection of RAID controllers. Our system had a Lenovo ServeRAID M5210 SAS3 card which had the RAID5 upgrade along with 2GB of battery protected cache. Adding a second RAID controller allows you to split the storage bay between both cards and there's a spare clip in the base for another cache protection module. You can manage and monitor your entire Lenovo infrastructure with xClarity Administrator I/O galore Expansion is massive as the chassis supports up to three I/O books and a wide variety of slot configurations. Base systems start with a primary I/O book, which provides three PCI-e slots plus Lenovo's mezzanine LOM (LAN on motherboard) slot. This book has two hot-plug cooling fan modules that look after the storage book in front. Beneath these are USB, serial and VGA ports plus a Gigabit port for the on-board IMM2 module. The other two bays accommodate optional I/O books, each with three PCI-e slots. Go for the full-length I/O books if you want GPU or accelerator cards, as these provide auxiliary power sockets that allow them to support 300W double-wide adapter cards. Power is plentiful as below the I/O books are four PSU bays. The price for our system includes a quartet of 900W hot-plug PSUs and Lenovo also offers 750W or 1400W modules, with the latter required for SAP HANA configurations. xClarity Administrator can be used to simultaneously deploy an OS to multiple servers  IMM2 and xClarity The IMM2 module provides remote management and is the only area we can criticise the server on. The web interface offers basic levels of information about server operations, but stacking it up against HPE's slick iLO4 shows how unsophisticated it is. We recommend Lenovo's xClarity Administrator as this links up with the IMM2 and delivers a wealth of agentless monitoring and management features for all Lenovo business systems. We tested the Hyper-V version and used it to inventory the server, view critical components, monitor power consumption and fire up remote control sessions. It also provides an image library for centralised OS deployment while patterns can be used to set up or repurpose multiple servers. We also tested the iOS app on our iPad and were able to remotely monitor the server's vitals. The IMM2 management module provides a comparatively basic web interface Conclusion Mission-critical servers represent a significant spend and the unique design of the System x3850 X6 means it can stay the course and protect your investment. The compute, storage and I/O books allow you to upgrade performance and capacity on-demand, making it much more affordable in the long term. Build quality is superb here, with the system offering a huge expansion potential plus extensive storage options. If you're using E7-8800 CPUs and want to migrate to eight-way processing, Lenovo's RPQ (request price quotation) process offers an on-site upgrade to a System x3950 X6 8U chassis, where all your books will be transferred across by a field engineer.

Here’s what they can expect. That means it’s more important than ever to get autonomous systems right. by Johana Bhuiyan@JMBooyah Jan 8, 2017, 1:05pm EST tweet share Linkedin Nvidia’s test car driving itself. Johana Bhuiyan Everyone — from auto executives to regulators — has said that transportation will change more in the next five years than it has in the last 50. So what will 2017 bring? There will be more self-driving tests in more cities, according to experts I interviewed at CES. That also means more consumers will be experiencing self-driving technology for the first time this year. That makes it a crucial period for auto and tech companies attempting to develop and deploy self-driving cars. There is still a chance that a lack of consumer trust can stall the progress of the technology, so there’s a ton of pressure on companies to quickly create a vehicle with a high level of autonomy that drives smoothly and is safe. During the onstage interview I moderated, panelist Jeff Owens, CTO at the auto supplier Delphi, told me “safety sells” when it comes to autonomous technology. More and more consumers are seeking vehicles that use the technology for use cases like emergency braking or driver-assist systems, according to him. Right now, companies are racing to get the best autonomous system on the road that offers the smoothest experience, so it’s not surprising there was no shortage of opportunities to test self-driving cars at CES. I personally rode in Hyundai’s autonomous Ionic as well as BMW’s autonomous 5 series and chipmaker Nvidia’s fully autonomous test car. Here are my impressions. Riding with Hyundai The semi-autonomous Hyundai navigated on local streets around the Las Vegas Convention Center alongside other vehicles. Some of the road markings were rather faded, but the vehicle was able to stay within the winding lanes thanks to a combination of its computer vision tech and 3-D maps. The car smoothly — albeit slowly — merged into the right lane as it prepared to turn. I was surprised that the engineer sitting in the driver's seat didn't have to take control. It wasn't exactly the speed a human might drive, but I was comfortable in the back seat as it navigated the busy Las Vegas streets. Little peek at my test drive of the autonomous Hyundai Ionic. #CES2017 pic.twitter.com/ysnz6ghoES— Johana Bhuiyan (@JMBooyah) January 3, 2017 Back seat with BMW The BMW test drive was a little different. For one, we manually drove to the highway and only turned on semi-autonomous mode once we merged to the left-most lane. Once on the highway, it drove as well as Tesla’s autopilot. But just like with Tesla’s, I had trouble feeling comfortable enough to take in the scenery as BMW’s staffers, who came along for the ride, suggested. The technology worked and maintained a safe distance behind the car in front of it, but I still felt unsure. BMW plans to roll out 40 self-driving cars in partnership with Mobileye and Intel by the second half of this year. At CES, the automaker showed off the car’s connected platform, which integrates with Amazon’s one-hour-delivery service and Prime Video offering as well as the driver’s calendar. From behind the driver’s seat on the highway, I was able to make a dinner reservation on the center console by using a few hand gestures to scroll through my onscreen preferences. The platform had already detected that I had a dinner appointment with a friend and prompted me to choose a restaurant for that time, offering a number of restaurant choices with openings for my scheduled appointment. It was, again, fairly difficult to peel my eyes off the front of the road at first. But once I was able to, I got a glimpse of Red Rock Canyon as we drove by. My test drive of the Nvidia-powered sedan. The bottom line is that the difference between how the two cars drove themselves was negligible. While Hyundai wanted to show off the technological capabilities of the vehicle, BMW focused on the things you’re free to do while the car drives itself. Luxury carmakers have an impetus to pitch more than safety, and in this case BMW is selling time as a luxury. As we enter higher levels of autonomy, getting consumers on board becomes more difficult. For one, fewer people will be exposed to fully self-driving cars. Both Uber’s and nuTonomy’s commercial fleet of cars are semi-autonomous. Then there's the hurdle of convincing a person to relinquish complete control of the vehicle. Nvidia goes full auto Chipmaker Nvidia, which typically works behind the scenes when powering consumer technology, also offered test drives during CES that forced me to do just that. Now more than ever, how autonomous systems work will be a key differentiator among carmakers. That’s why Nvidia was showing off how its AI processor worked and even introduced a new feature called co-pilot that detects what’s going on in and around a car and warns drivers when they need to react to something or take control of the car. The chipmaker — which also announced it was working with Audi to get self-driving cars on the road by 2020 — offered a demo that was vastly different from BMW and Hyundai. Not only did I sit alone in the fully autonomous Nvidia-powered vehicle, I was in the back seat. Aside from a big red button that said “STOP,” there was no real way for me to take control of the car. That’s why the company operated its test drives around a small track and also had staffers on hand with a remote control just in case they needed to step in. The car smoothly drove around in circles, over rocks and sand as well as plain road set up for the purpose of the demonstration, twice. Without stopping, the car began driving a third time around the track. About 10 seconds past the original starting point, I heard a loud beeping and was thrown slightly forward as the car stopped abruptly. The staffer operating the remote came to the car to restart the system. He had remotely disengaged the car because it was getting too close to the wall. I wasn’t in danger, but he was being careful. As a frequent rider in self-driving cars, I wasn’t entirely fazed by the situation. But I’m on record saying I'm more comfortable in fully autonomous vehicles than semi-autonomous, because I'm hyper-aware of the limitations of the latter. This ride was a little bit of a reality check. Had it been a first-time rider in the car, the experience could make or break trust in the technology. Though the technology is progressing faster than many expected, as Nvidia’s senior director of automotive Danny Shapiro told me, it'll be a long time before consumers can simply take a car driving itself for granted.

(Photo: Waymo) SAN FRANCISCO — Google's fleet of 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids is finally ready to hit the road. The white minivans, unmistakable with their bulbous rooflines and protruding fenders, will later this month start adding to the 2.5-million miles of road testing that Google has racked up, beginning first in California and Arizona. The high-tech cars are the result of a partnership between Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that was formed last spring. Search giant Google has spent the past seven years testing a variety of self-driving vehicles on roads near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., as well as in Austin, Phoenix and Kirkland, Wash. John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, the newly renamed autonomous car division of Google, told attendees at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit Sunday that the fleet packs an array of new sensors that were developed in-house, a critical step towards making a self-driving future an economic reality. USA TODAY At CES 2017, the frenzy over self-driving cars is palpable USA TODAY Bentley reveals its 209-mph, 'most powerful' car ever Krafcik cited a famous quote from computer scientist Alan Kay that insists tech companies with grand software ambitions must ultimately make their own hardware. "Well, we’re serious about creating fully self-driving cars that can help millions of people, and to do that we have to oversee both the self-driving software and the self-driving hardware," Krafcik said at the show's Automobili-D conference. That engineers can make a car drive itself is no longer in question, especially given the myriad programs underway at tech companies (from rumored Apple to Uber), automakers (from Audi to Volvo) and an array of parts suppliers (Nvidia, Intel and others took the spotlight at the recently concluded 2017 CES show in Las Vegas). The bigger issues include not just regulatory and insurance concerns surrounding self-driving cars, but developing affordable sensor technology that can make fleets of autonomous cars a fiscal reality. Google entered into a partnership with FCA last spring, the result of which is this fleet of 100 Pacifica Hybrids packed with self-driving tech.  (Photo: Waymo) The most prominent example of technology bringing cost breakthroughs involves the sci-fi eye that sits atop autonomous vehicles, a Lidar, or laser radar, device that scans that environment in all directions looking for obstacles. Krafcik, an auto world veteran formerly with Hyundai, said that when Google first started on its moonshot project, a good roof-top Lidar system cost $75,000. " Today, we’ve brought down that cost by 90 percent," he said. "That’s nine, zero. This is a big step in making this technology affordable and more accessible to millions of people." The other benefits of both bringing autonomous car tech in-house and the growing collaboration between Waymo and Fiat Chrysler engineers include more seamless integration of car sensors, quicker development cycles and, most recently, the development of a all-new Lidar system, Krafcik said. While self-driving cars currently have medium-range Lidar systems engaged to tell them about what is happening in their immediate vicinity, Waymo's new short- and long-range Lidar sensors are designed to provide the car's computer brain with more information about what is far down the road as well as very near its bumpers. "The detail we capture is so high that not only can we detect pedestrians all around us, but we can tell which direction they’re facing," said Krafcik. "This is incredibly important, as it helps us more accurately predict where someone will walk next." Waymo's self-driving minivan packs a complex Lidar system on its roof, a system that now features both short and long-range sensors in addition to standard medium.  (Photo: Waymo) Waymo executives say that adding FCA's 100 Pacificas to a self-driving fleet that already includes dozens of Lexus SUV and a homegrown two-person prototype dubbed Firefly will help the company speed up the pace of its testing, which ultimately should hasten the arrival of what most experts assume will be self-driving fleets of cars designed for ride-hailing purposes. While it took Google engineers about six year to drive its first million autonomous-car miles and 16 months to add another million, the three-milion-mark will be reached in only eight months. Krafcik also noted that the accuracy and efficiency of its autonomous systems is improving. In 2015, Waymo test drivers had to take over from the computer due to an unexpected issue at a rate of 0.8 times per thousands miles. "Today, that number is 0.2 disengages per thousand," he said. Waymo's California tests are done with the approval of the state's Department of Motor Vehicles, which requires companies to report all accidents that occur during testing. To date, most of the incidents involving Waymo cars have been the fault of other drivers that often rear-end the self-driving cars because they aren't driving as most human might anticipate. Uber, which is testing autonomous cars in Pittsburgh, recently announced it would begin testing its fleet of self-driving Volvo SUVs in San Francisco. But the ride-hailing company did not apply for a DMV permit, and the agency quickly denied its vehicles permission to drive in the state. Uber announced it would be moving its cars to Arizona, where the DMV stipulation currently does not exist.

Every year the industry's biggest names gather in Las Vegas to show us a glimpse of the devices and innovations that will define the months to come in consumer technology. With so many announcements hitting the wires at the same time, we've already brought you the top stories and highlights, especially those concerning personal and computer technology. Now, realizing not every product we've seen at CES will necessarily get a release date, the fun is in watching the announcements and recognizing the trends and hints of what's to come. In no particular order, here's our selection of the 10 most promising or downright cool products we found at CES 2017. LG Signature W7 OLED TV CES is often used to showcase the next generation of display technology. 2017 was no exception, and we were impressed by more than one company's efforts. However, LG is in for a repeat with their Signature W7 OLED TV, also known as the "Wallpaper TV." Touted as the thinnest TV in the world, the Signature W7 comes in 77- and 65-inch versions. At an incredible 2.5 mm thick, it's so thin it's best seen when attached directly to a wall, where it can hang as a painting would. To make this analogy closer to reality, the LG W7 is mounted to the wall using magnetic brackets, to keep the intended appearance that the company calls "picture-on-wall." The W OLED TV is webOS powered, sports a 4K resolution with active HDR (HDR10, Dolby Vision and more) putting out gorgeous images with near-perfect blacks and wide viewing angles. Of course, you won’t find any ports or inputs in the wafer-thin panel. It has a proprietary cable that connects to a companion sound bar where all wired connections are managed. The sound bar houses Dolby Atmos certified audio and connectivity includes 4 HDMI ports (HDCP 2.2), 3 USB ports, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and a Toslink connection for optical audio. Razer Project Valerie Think about this: three 17.3-inch 4k IGZO displays equipped with Nvidia G-Sync. In a laptop. Granted, at 12 pounds and 1.5-inches thick it's not the most practical machine to carry around, but never before you could cram so much hardware (including a powerful processor and GTX 1080 graphics) let alone three high resolution displays in a portable PC. In case you were wondering, Project Valerie's chassis is directly inherited from the current top of the line Blade Pro. To make this setup practical, there is supposed to be an automatic deployment mechanism that slides out the side of the main screen and adjusts the two additional screens into place, however Razer's working demo machines that we were able to touch and play with were using a less sophisticated mechanism. Properly driving AAA games at this resolution will prove challenging even for a GTX 1080, so that's something to consider. But in the few days since Project Valerie was shown we've read enthusiastic comments from people who would buy this for productivity instead of gaming, or maybe even completely forgoing a battery in this "laptop," so there's more space for proper cooling and more hardware. Project Valerie looks like someone photoshopped two more displays onto a gaming laptop, but Razer believes this will be a real product they'll offer in the future. But for now, more exploratory than true product, Razer was looking to create buzz and we won't argue with their intentions. A honorary mention goes to a second project Razer showed at this year's CES. Project Ariana is similar to Microsoft's IllumiRoom concept (2013) that uses a projector to show ambient lighting and video effects surrounding your main play screen and room. It was always meant to be a niche, but very neat project that maybe will come to fruition in Razer's hands. Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Dell’s XPS 13 has been consistently named one of the best Windows laptops in the past couple of years, receiving praise for its near bezel-free display and solid construction. Now the company is taking its winning formula to a convertible 2-in-1 design that’s a little bit thinner and lighter, too. The XPS 13 2-in-1 shares most of its looks with its laptop counterpart but adds a flexible hinge that allows the system to fold back into a tent orientation or all the way back into tablet mode. Just like the regular XPS 13, the 2-in-1 version uses an InfinityEdge display with a 5.2mm border, but there are also a few changes under the hood. For one thing, the XPS 13 2-in-1 uses a fanless design. The system is based on an Intel Y Series (formerly known as Core M) Core i5 or i7 processor from the Kaby Lake family, instead of the typically more robust U Series, so there’s a performance tradeoff here. Also, you won't find a full-size USB port, but you do get a couple of USB Type-C ports, a Thunderbolt 3 port, microSD card reader, DisplayPort, and headphone jack. The Dell XPS 2-in-1 is available in 1080p and Quad HD+ versions, with the base model starting at $999 and upgrades available to a Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM and 1TB SSD. The 46WHr battery is supposedly good for up to 10 hours in the QHD+ model, or up to 15 hours in the full HD version which sounds a bit generous but we'll likely find out soon since the 2-in-1 is shipping as soon as this week. HP Envy 34 All-in-One HP went back to the drawing board for this year’s refresh of the Envy 34 All-in-One and the result is both functional and stunningly beautiful. While most AIO designs these days squeeze every component into the back of the display, HP has opted to move the whole PC into a wide, blocky yet low profile base. This allows for a thin, elegantly curved display and skinny bezels, prevents cables from visibly dangling off the back, and keeps important IO connectivity within easy reach. Four Bang & Olufsen speakers with dual passive arrays are hidden behind a mesh on the front of the base. There's a touch-sensitive dial embedded on the right side of the base for controlling volume and playback, and an optional Qi wireless charging pad on the left side. The 3440x1440 IPS display looks bright and crisp and tucked inside along the top is a built-in pop-up camera that you can easily hide when not in use for some privacy peace of mind (the mic also turns off). You can tell HP has really thought this design through and it was by far the most beautiful AIO design of this year's show. HP hasn’t yet shared detailed configuration options, but 7th-gen Core i5 or i7 processors are a given, along with up to 256GB SSD and 2TB HDD and discrete Nvidia graphics. It’s not designed as a gaming powerhouse — all-in-ones rarely are — but it should otherwise be more than capable enough to handle pretty much any computing task you throw at it. It's expected to go on sale on HP's website on January 11 and at select retailers on February 26, 2017. Monitor Display Tech: 8K, HDR + Sync A few years ago it appeared like monitor display technology was stuck. Smartphones were getting really great and pixel dense displays with notable improvements arriving every 12 month cycle, and TV tech was not lagging either. But monitors were still shooting for the cheap stuff. Nvidia and AMD were trying to push sync technology for gamers, but few seemed to be interested in pushing the envelope, and 4K monitors were expensive and hard to set up and thus recommend. Much has happened in the last couple of years, but it was loud and clear during CES 2017 that companies are now truly invested in innovating on PC-class displays and creating great products. Case in point these three highlight products and underlying technologies: Dell UltraSharp UP3218K 8K monitor A drool-worthy 32-inch monitor with an insanely high resolution of 7,680 x 4,320 at 60Hz. The UP3218K offers 1.07 billion colors and packs in more than 33 million pixels – that’s four times as many as a 4K display and 16 times more than Full HD. That translates to a PPI rating of 280 which is very high for a desktop screen. At $4,999 it's expensive, but it also means it's not vaporware. Dell will start selling the UltraSharp 8K in late March. Asus PG27UQ gaming monitor The 27-inch PG27UQ is the first monitor to support 4K at 144 Hz. Even more impressive is the fact that this display uses IPS technology. Asus plans to take full advantage of Nvidia's G-Sync HDR tech (read more about it below) for HDR10 compatibility, with a prospective Q3/2017 release date and rumored $1,500 price point. Acer Predator Z301CT gaming monitor The Predator Z301CT is a 30-inch display with an 1800R curve and a modest resolution of 2560 x 1080, but the star of the show here is a refresh rate that can go as high as 200 Hz with 4ms response times. There are a number of gamer-friendly features, including Tobii eye tracking and G-Sync. The Z301CT comes with HDMI 1.4 and DisplayPort 1.2a inputs as well as a USB 3.0 hub. Interested gamers will be able to purchase this display in February for $899. AMD FreeSync 2 technology The next big thing that's set to hit PC displays in the coming year is HDR, or High Dynamic Range. Already seen in a range of TVs, HDR technology increases the color depth and dynamic range of imagery, creating greater contrast between bright and dark areas that leads to more detail and a more realistic image. The key aspect to FreeSync 2 is it eliminates display-side tone mapping when displaying a HDR image. It does this by giving game engines the exact characteristics of the attached display – data such as color gamut, supported dynamic range, brightness, etc. – so that the game itself can tone map directly to the display. AMD will also be certifying all FreeSync 2 displays so that gamers are guaranteed to receive a quality HDR experience when they buy a display branded with the FreeSync 2 logo. FreeSync 2 displays will also support all the features of the original FreeSync, chiefly variable refresh rates for stutter- and tear-free gaming. Low frame rate compensation will be a mandatory feature of FreeSync 2, as will low input lag in the "few milliseconds" range. Nvidia G-Sync HDR technology The idea behind G-Sync HDR is similar to AMD's FreeSync 2 technology: it provides gamers with a zero input lag HDR gaming experience on a new collection of top-end monitors. These monitors have been created in partnership with AU Optronics, who have created a brand new panel that will be seen in a range of displays, including the Asus PG27UQ. Like FreeSync 2, it appears as though PC games will need to integrate specific support for G-Sync HDR if they want to utilize the full capabilities of G-Sync HDR monitors. Mass Effect: Andromeda and Shadow Warrior 2 are two games set to support G-Sync HDR at its launch, and we can expect more titles to support HDR on PC in the future. Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC Set to become the SoC of choice among the smartphone elite in 2017, the Snapdragon 835 is Qualcomm's first 10nm SoC built on Samsung's FinFET process – in fact it's one of the first 10nm chips of its kind on the market, beating traditional leader Intel to the punch – and this helps the chip achieve new levels of performance and efficiency. The Snapdragon 835 is 30% smaller than the Snapdragon 820 it replaces, while packing up to 27% better performance and a 40% power consumption reduction. An impressive chip already, the latest Snapdragon carries the usual number of processing and graphics cores, wireless modem (Gigabit LTE!), and a series of specialized hardware to support a phone's GPS, camera and image processing, among others like VR-specific features. The first devices to use the Snapdragon 835 will be released in the first half of 2017, we'd assume mostly high-end smartphones, but as Qualcomm chips have become more powerful, the convergence of traditional PCs and handheld systems is inching closer ever more so. The Snapdragon 835 will run full Windows 10 and so this may finally be the year where ARM meets Windows in a truly convincing fashion. Mohu AirWave Mohu, best known by cord cutters for its Leaf over-the-air (OTA) antenna, has been working on combining OTA with over-the-top (OTT) streaming content. The Mohu AirWave is a wireless antenna that receives free over the air signals and can stream them over your network via the Mohu TV app on a compatible media streaming device — this will include the entire Roku lineup, the current generation Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, and Chromecast. Users will be able to browse program descriptions and up to 14 days of upcoming content in a cable-like program guide within the Mohu TV app. You can also select favorite channels, and Mohu claims its ClearPix technology will reduce pixelation for the best image quality possible of OTA broadcasts. The idea of mixing OTA content with OTT streams is similar to what Dish's upcoming AirTV Player does, except instead of requiring a new streaming box and supplying your own wired OTA antenna, Mohu’s AirWave’s approach is to bring live broadcasts to streaming boxes you already own through an app. The Mohu AirWave wireless antenna goes on sale this spring exclusively at Best Buy priced at $149.99. AirBar Neonode was just in time for CES showing a new working prototype of the AirBar. In its most basic form, the AirBar is a sleek, metal bar that attaches to the bottom of your laptop's display and connects to a USB port. The AirBar emits an invisible light field over the screen to recognize the touch of your fingers or a stylus when it makes contact with your non-touch display, then translate that into clicks. During our brief testing session we felt the AirBar was pretty accurate, maybe not like a real touchscreen, but for an affordable add-on ($69) it wasn't bad at all. Pinch-to-zoom and scrolling gestures are not yet enabled but we are told they should be working soon. AirBar for Windows is supposed to be ready now, while the MacBook Air version that was shown at CES is shipping in March. The difference has to do with size, with AirBars being offered at typical laptop widescreen sizes of 15.6 inches, 14, and 13.3 inches. The technology appears to be inexpensive and practical. Not everyone needs or wants a touchscreen, however in certain scenarios we see how older laptops and monitors could use touch and AirBar's tech could become the standard add-on for that purpose. Navdy Navdy is an aftermarket head-up display for your car that connects to your phone via Bluetooth and sits on the top of your dashboard. The small device projects a full color image that adapts to any light condition to a transparent display in your line of sight allowing you to keep your focus on the road. The device has built-in sensors monitoring for hand gestures above the steering wheel, so you can manage calls, messages, GPS and your car information with the wave of your hand, Tony Stark style. There's also a dial that can be attached in the steering wheel or gearshift that can be used for navigation or to access Siri / Google Now. It's a cool device, it's already available (since last quarter), and it's not cheap at $799, but from our brief time testing it we thought it was polished enough to make it a worthwhile investment for many, with the added plus that it can be adapted to your current car for an effective upgrade to your current dash info system. Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 2017 The core design of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon remains largely the same but sticking with a winning formula while refreshing components and squeezing a bit more performance and battery life has paid off for Lenovo. The X1 Carbon is a gorgeous if utilitarian-looking machine. As before, it's a professional-oriented laptop and still one of the most portable you will find at 2.5 pounds. The display is available in 1080p or 1440p IPS LCD variants, and Lenovo has crammed these 14-inch panels into the area normally occupied by a 13-inch display taking a cue from Dell's XPS, the screen bezels are much thinner now. The move from an Intel Skylake to Intel Kaby Lake CPU has resulted in an extra four hours of battery life; Lenovo now claims the Carbon is good for 15.5 hours of usage. Other improvements include the addition of two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, and the ability to pack both WiGig and Qualcomm's X7 LTE modem in the one unit. An IR camera with support for Windows Hello facial recognition is included alongside a fingerprint reader. Lenovo's signature ThinkPad keyboard and trackpad are still as good as ever here. You can kit out the X1 Carbon with up to 1 TB of PCIe SSD storage and 16 GB of RAM. The new X1 Carbon will be available in February starting at $1,349. 6 comments 148 interactions Back to TechSpot Gaming The 10 Most Anticipated PC Games of 2017 Software 10 Tech Predictions for 2017 Must Reads Biggest Rivalries in Computing History Buying Guides TechSpot PC Buying Guide Hardware DDR4 Memory at 4000 MT/s, Does It Make a Difference?

One day that division of labor might not be so stark. A team at Hewlett Packard Labs, in Palo Alto, Calif., has built a demonstration chip that could help push some particularly thorny computations into the realm of light, potentially boosting speed and saving energy in the process. Silicon integrated circuits containing parts that can manipulate light are not new. But this chip, which integrates 1,052 optical components, is the biggest and most complex in which all the photonic components work together to perform a computation... IEEE Spectrum Op-ed: The desktop CPU isn't dead, it just needs a swift kick in the butt Our review of Intel's new flagship consumer desktop CPU, the Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K, was less-than-favorable. Out of the box, the chip runs faster than the i7-6700K that preceded it, but that's just because it ships at a higher default clock speed. When running at the same clock speed -- something easily achievable because these chips are specifically intended for overclocking -- CPU and GPU performance is identical. Ars Technica EFF's 2017 wishlist For the last five years, EFF has greeted the holiday season by publishing a list of things we'd like to see happen in the coming year. Sometimes these are actions we'd like to see taken by companies, and sometimes our wishes are aimed at governments, but we also include actions everyday people can take to advance our digital civil liberties. This year has seen a few victories, including the fact that more and more websites are using HTTPS by default and using Let's Encrypt... EFF 'Copyright trolls' hit with class action lawsuit for theft by deception In recent years so-called copyright trolls have been accused of various dubious schemes and actions, including intimidation and extortion. Last month it became apparent that these concerns are not just one-sided complaints, when the U.S. Government launched a criminal case against two of Prenda Law's principals. This week, copyright trolling allegations are once again brought to the forefront. TorrentFreak Lessons learned from a composer turned game developer In a recent story from The Verge, Chris Tilton explained how he went from composing music for games like Assassin’s Creed Unity and SimCity to going hands-on with game development to create the upcoming isometric adventure game Divide. While the story contains some insightful lessons learned by the composer turned game developer, his take on how hands-on experience with a game changed his composition process is especially interesting. Gamasutra Inside the development of gaming's biggest mystery, 'Frog Fractions 2' "I'm trying to ship a game," remarked an exhausted-sounding Frog Fractions designer James Crawford during a Skype conversation recently. I joked that I didn't believe him, but after players used a mysterious key found at the end of an escape room on an equally mysterious box labeled "launch FF2," Frog Fractions 2 exists. Waypoint.Vice Researchers design one of the strongest, lightest materials known A team of researchers at MIT has designed one of the strongest lightweight materials known, by compressing and fusing flakes of graphene, a two-dimensional form of carbon. The new material, a sponge-like configuration with a density of just 5 percent, can have a strength 10 times that of steel. In its two-dimensional form, graphene is thought to be the strongest of all known materials. MIT Amazon's robot army grows by 50 percent The world's largest e-commerce retailer said it employed 45,000 robots in some 20 fulfillment centers. That's a cool 50 percent increase from last year's holiday season, when the company had some 30,000 robots working alongside 230,000 humans. The Seattle Times (also, Japanese white-collar workers are already being replaced by artificial intelligence) The making of Sapienza, Hitman's best level Sapienza, the second level of Hitman, began as two words: Coastal Town. "This was the only direction we got," says Torbjørn Christensen, lead level designer. "So we really had a lot of freedom to be creative." That coastal town would become the game’s standout level, against which subsequent Hitman episodes are compared. PC Gamer 2016 sees Internet Explorer usage collapse, Chrome surge At the start of 2016, Microsoft's Internet Explorer was still the most commonly used browser on the Web; it finished 2015 being used by about 46 percent of Web users, with 32 percent preferring Chrome, and 12 percent using Firefox. But Explorer's days have been numbered ever since Microsoft essentially ended its development. Ars Technica Android was 2016's most vulnerable product With 2016 officially over, we can crown Android as 2016's product with most vulnerabilities, and Oracle as the vendor with the most security bugs. This statistic is based on the number of vulnerabilities reported by security researchers in the past year, bugs which have received a CVE identifier.

Like that scam, the new Android Marcher Trojan is disguised as the Super Mario Run app and attempts to trick users with fake finance apps... ZScaler Apple's 2016 in review This has been the winter of our discontent. 2016 was the year the tone changed.

  Processors PC Cases Video Cards Motherboards Storage Mobile Memory Cooling Misc News Home | Forum | Shop | RSS Search Legit Reviews News  CyberPowerPC Hyper Liquid Series Prostreamer II Displayed at CES 2017 CyberPowerPC Hyper Liquid Series Prostreamer II Displayed at CES 2017 Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Sun, Jan 08, 2017 - 2:22 PM If you are aspiring to be a professional streamer or already one you should take a closer look at the CyberpowerPC’s updated version of its Prostreamer dual-system gaming and streaming PC that debuted last year. The new Prostreamer II is part of the Hyper Liquid series now and has been completely redesigned and features Intel’s latest 7th Gen Core Kaby Lake processors. This system has two computers inside one massive and impressive Enthoo Elite Ultra full-tower case by Phanteks. Most everything on this system can be customized as it starts at around $2,999 and at that price you get what you want. You can work with CyberPowerPC to use your favorite brands hardware and customize it they way you want with a crazy open-loop liquid cooler or RGB lighting. The price tag on the Hyper Liquid Series Prostreamer II starts out higher than last years model that was $2,365, but that is mostly due to the Phanteks Enthoo Elite Ultra PC Case as that alone costs $979 (based off £799 pre-order listing at OCUK). The Prostreamer II on display at CES 2017 runs around $6,000 and was loaded an impressive amount of hardware. The primary ATX gaming system featured an ASUS ROG Rampage V Edition 10 (Intel X99) motherboard powered by an Intel Core i7 6950X 10-core processor, two MSI Geforce GTX 1080 Gaming X 8GB graphics cards running NVIDIA SLI, 64GB of DDR 3200MHz memory, Samsung SSD 960 Pro PCIe NVMe 512GB drive, and a Corsair AX1500i power supply. The smaller streaming system used the mini-ITX form factor board by MSI (Z270i Gaming Pro Carbon AC Mini-ITX) and an unlocked Intel Core i3-7350K dual-core 4.2 GHz processor, 16GB of DDR4 3200MHz memory, Avermedia Live Gamer HD 1080p capture card along with the Coolermaster G650M power supply. CyberPower PC said that this system can stream at ultra high bitrates (6800+) with zero lag on the main gaming system as the media center or streaming system is doing all the work. Think about that for a second… 1,500 Watt PSU on the main system and 650 Watts on the secondary, so you could easily run 2,150 Watts of PC components on this beast. A typical home in North America is wired with 120-volt service on a 15-amp circuit that only can handle approximately 1,800 Watts of power before becoming overloaded.  For long-term loads, including anything that draws current for more than three hours, the maximum wattage recommended is 20 percent lower than the tripping power, so 1440 watts. The good thing is that this build went a little crazy on the power supplies, but if you wanted to custom order one that draws that much power for real you might as well upgrade your homes wiring to thicker 20-amp wiring and a circuit breaker! The inside of the CyberPowerPC Pro Streamer 2 is simply beautiful and was our favorite custom built PC at CES 2017 that you’ll be able to order soon for yourself. This is the ultimate streaming PC and should be affordable for pro-streamers that are looking for the very best performance.

What if I told you that same initiative could also change the trajectory of a young person's life and strengthen our ­community? And that it's already being successfully implemented in businesses across the United States and here in Minnesota. It's mentoring. January is National Mentoring Month, and it provides an opportune time to spotlight the ways youth mentoring meets business goals and community needs. Good for youth, business It's well-established that mentoring benefits children. For centuries, young people learned as apprentices and from extended family and their community. More recently, mentoring has become one of the most tested and proven youth ­programs. Studies show that young people with mentors are more likely to be successful in school, to be leaders in their community, to volunteer, and to pursue postsecondary education. But what about business? What effect does mentoring — specifically youth mentoring — have on the bottom line? I'm not talking about a corporate mentoring model where experienced employees mentor new hires. Those programs are vital and serve their purpose well. I'm talking about mentoring youth as a focused community partnership. Last year Ernst & Young LLP and the National Mentoring Partnership, or MENTOR, conducted a qualitative research study of 18 organizations with workplace mentoring programs. Researchers looked at a wide range of companies, including American Express, Citi, GE, Intel, 3M and Viacom. The benefits they reported were strikingly similar. The study found that mentoring is good for youth and good for business. Companies actively engaged in youth mentoring reported: • Improved retention of high-quality employees. • Employees who are more invested in their work and happier working for their ­company. • A talent pipeline of well-qualified candidates who are ready for the workforce. • Strong communities where employees live and work and where business can thrive. • And, every company reported that mentoring helped attract well-qualified job candidates. Many noted that millennials and new college graduates seek out employers with volunteering and community engagement programs. Business supports mentoring Awareness is growing among Minnesota business leaders that mentoring hits the intersection of business strategy, employee skills and ­passion, and the needs of young people in our ­community. Back in 2009, Comcast piloted a new type of business-based youth mentoring that incorporated mentoring directly into the workday. Since then, that program has provided one-to-one mentoring to nearly 100 St. Paul Public Schools students, and in doing so, established a template for other business-based mentoring programs. Here's another example: Federated Insurance, headquartered in Owatonna, Minn., believes that mentoring's return on investment is so powerful that since 2004, it has dedicated 100 percent of the money received through the Federated Challenge for Kids of Minnesota — that's nearly $25 million — to Big Brothers Big Sisters agencies in Minnesota. Federated Chairman, President and Chief Executive Jeff Fetters says that "mentoring is deeply ingrained in our business culture. It pays off in many ways. Our employees are more fulfilled and engaged, we're investing in the next generation, and we're contributing to a more vibrant community in which we do business." Fetters and his wife, Marty, count themselves among the dozens of Federated employees who are "Bigs." At Cargill, a cohort of employees are volunteer mentors to young scholars from Harvest Network of schools in north Minneapolis. These "Littles" board a school bus and visit their "Bigs" at work twice a month for facilitated group activities ranging from community service and career exploration to chess games and craft projects. First year results at Cargill were impressive, with 90 percent of participants maintaining or improving their scholastic competence. These Littles, all of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds, are beating the odds with the help of mentoring. Tone at the top is key Across the board, companies with successful mentoring programs note that a strong commitment from leadership, along with a culture that supports mentoring, are both essential to a program's success. "We make a point to tell our employees that their time spent mentoring is important and valued," said Mike ­LeSage, president of Cargill's Risk Management business and a volunteer Big Brother. "We know it's good for employees, good for the community and good for the company. We reinforce that message at all levels of the organization; companywide support helps keep the program going strong." Employee volunteers want to give back in ways that are meaningful and authentic. The best mentoring models provide training, tools and ongoing support. A good partnership involves mutual respect, clear communication and regular feedback — and ultimately makes launching and sustaining the program more manageable and rewarding. An invitation January is a month of new beginnings. A new year brings resolutions to eat healthier, to be more organized, to get to the gym each morning. We focus on small steps to improve ourselves and our lives. This year, I invite you to make a business New Year's resolution, and one that's a little more ambitious. Look beyond the walls of your organization and out into the ­community. Make a positive impact on a child and your business' ­bottom line with mentoring. Michael Goar is chief executive of Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Greater Twin Cities.

The company first showed off the original verison at Computex in 2015. The original black-and-red color scheme had given way to a more HTPC-ready all-black look by the time it showed up in the TR labs last summer. The Bulldog 2.0 kit still includes a unique angular Mini ITX case, a Hydro Series H6 SF all-in-one liquid CPU cooler, and an SF600 600W power supply. The original Z170 motherboard has given way for a Kaby Lake-ready Z270 model with built-in 802.11ac Wi-Fi and a USB 3.1 Type-C port. Buyers will need to hit their favorite PC parts vendor for an Intel LGA 1151 Skylake or Kaby Lake CPU. Corsair hopes shoppers will peruse its own offerings for the desktop DDR4 memory modules and storage needed to make a complete system. All Intel LGA 1151 CPUs have IGPs, and the Bulldog's motherboard has an HDMI jack and a DisplayPort output, but a discrete graphics card makes things a lot more fun. For example, a Seahawk liquid-cooled GTX 1080 made by MSI with a hand from Corsair would certainly be a good fit for the Bulldog 2.0. The Bulldog 2.0 is on sale now at Corsair's site for $400, though it's currently listed as sold out. The kit is backed by a two-year manufacturer's warranty.   Tags: CPUs Graphics Cases Systems Gaming User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Scott Gilbertson reader comments 123 Share this story Over the course of its four-year lifespan, Dell's extremely popular XPS 13 Developer Edition line has become known for one thing—bringing a "just works" Linux experience to the company's Ultrabooks. Of course, today Dell is just one of many manufacturers producing great Linux machines. System76 makes the Oryx Pro (still my top pick for anyone who needs massive power), and companies like Purism and ZaReason produce solid offerings that also work with Linux out of the box. Even hardware not explicitly made for Linux tends to work out of the box these days. I recently installed Fedora on a Sony Vaio and was shocked that the only problem I encountered was that the default trackpad configuration was terribly slow. Further ReadingThe XPS 13 DE: Dell continues to build a reliable Linux lineage Admittedly, the Vaio is a few years old, which means there has been time for hardware issues to be addressed. Getting Linux to run on bleeding edge hardware in 2017 remains tricky—or it requires running a bleeding edge distro like Arch. That's where efforts like Dell's Project Sputnik, led by developer Barton George, come in handy. With the XPS 13 Developers Edition, the hardware is already vetted. Drivers are pre-installed and configured for a great out-of-the-box experience. The latest Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, released in late 2016 and tested in the home office last month, is an exceptionally well-built, great-looking piece of hardware. Yet again, if you want your Linux rig to "just work," this is for you. But if you also want a powerful, svelte package that weighs under 3lbs, this is the XPS 13 you've been waiting for. Dell's most recent Linux laptop even features Intel's new Kaby Lake chip, which bumps the clock speed by about 10 percent. The more impressive side of the chipset upgrade is the graphics architecture, which is supposed to improve performance in 3D graphics and 4K video. Playback, especially 4K video, is incredibly smooth and not nearly as battery-draining as previous models. The specs Outwardly there's nothing new to see here. The 7th generation Dell XPS 13 DE uses the same wonderful InfinityEdge display that manages to pack a 13-inch screen into a body that looks and feels like an 11-inch laptop. The model I tested came with the 3200x1800 IPS touch panel. There's also a version with a 1920x1080 IPS non-touch panel, but I think the higher res display is worth the extra money. The new XPS 13 has simply the best-looking display I've seen in a laptop. Naturally the HiDPI model suffers a little in battery life compared to the lower res model. I've never used the lower res version, so I can't compare battery life times, but more pixels always takes more power. If battery life is your top priority, don't go with the HiDPI model. That said, I find the brightest setting (400 nit brightness) to be a bit much indoors. It's great for working outside and goes a long way to compensate for the inevitable glare on glossy screens. But I rarely push the brightness past 60 percent when I'm inside, which improves battery life considerably. The model Dell sent me featured an i7-7500U Kaby Lake chip with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid state drive. As configured, the whole enchilada would set you back $1,799. The lowest model—which has the 1920x1080 display, an i5 chip, 128GB SSD, and only 8GB of RAM—can be had for $975. For an extra $375, you can step up to the higher res screen and a 256GB SSD. There's also a new option for what Dell calls a "Rose Gold" exterior. The laptop I tested had the same full aluminum exterior as previous models. Underneath it is an aluminum frame, which makes the XPS line feel solid even at its minimal weight. As has been my experience with most Dell machines, the construction is excellent. I used the previous model for over six months, shoving it in and out of my bag several times a day, every day. It doesn't have a scratch on it. I can see no reason to think the latest model would be any different. The ports remain unchanged on this version of the XPS 13 DE... You'll get: 2 x USB 3.0 (one with PowerShare), one Thunderbolt port that supports charging, 3-in-1 Card Reader, Native DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA, and HDMI. Sold separately: Ethernet and USB-A via the Dell Adapter. Also unchanged in this release are the ports and layout. There are still two USB 3.0 ports, one with PowerShare for charging your devices (note that USB charging generally requires a trip into the BIOS settings to enable; see Dell's support site for more info). There's also a Thunderbolt port that supports charging, a 3-in-1 card reader, DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA, and HDMI. As with any laptop this thin, Ethernet requires an adapter (sold separately). The 720p webcam is the same one that has been in the last couple of models, and it's still at the bottom of the lid. Yes, it still sucks that it's down there, although in fairness to Dell, there is nowhere else to put it. The InfinityEdge display comes within 1/8-inch of the edge of the lid. Nevertheless, like fellow Ars reviewer Peter Bright, I find this decision irritating. Why not just move the display panel down an 1/8 inch and put the camera at the top so it's usable? Or, why not stop pretending that the bottom camera is useful and just ditch the camera altogether? The palm rests are made of a carbon fiber composite that I found very comfortable. The keyboard also appears to be the same as previous models. It's a very thin chiclet-style keyboard that works just fine, although coming from the ThinkPad world I still find these keyboards disappointing. What's more disappointing for some Linux fans is the fact Dell still uses the Windows logo on the super key. The touchpad is reportedly the same, although using the testing model next to the previous edition I felt a noticeable difference with the newer model being somewhat "stickier." That doesn't sound good, but I found my movements were actually more precise with the new trackpad. This was particularly noticeable in Darktable, a photo editing app with some of the tiniest imaginable control elements. Usually that can be a real pain to adjust, especially on such a HiDPI screen like the one the XPS 13 uses. The problem I experienced previously, where the trackpad would unaccountably freeze at times, appears to have been related to something in Ubuntu 14.04, because the new XPS, which comes with Ubuntu 16.04, did nothing of the sort. Another common complaint about the XPS 13 is a high-pitched coil whine that plagues some models, according to some Reddit threads. In the three models I've used, I've never encountered this issue. It's possible that the whine comes from something related to Windows drivers (some people report fixing the problem by reinstalling drivers), although I have seen reports of the whine being present on the Ubuntu-based models as well.

With 16GB (8GBx2) and 32GB (8GBx4) kits becoming the mainstream memory capacities in PC systems, 8GB-based kits are in greater demand for higher performance than ever. Upon the launch of Intel’s latest Kaby Lake platform, G.SKILL bumps up the maximum frequency speeds to a blistering DDR4-4266MHz at CL19-19-19-39 for 16GB (8GBx2) kits and DDR4-4133MHz CL19-21-21-41 for 32GB (8GBx4) kits. The Fastest 16GB (8GBx2) Kit - DDR4-4266 CL19-19-19-39 Extremely high frequency memory kits often are achieved at the sacrifice of unsightly CL timings. Not anymore! With a more streamlined and efficient CL19-19-19-39 timing memory kit at 4266MHz, the limits have been increased under the latest 7th Gen Intel® Core™ processor.  The Fastest 32GB (8GBx4) Kit - DDR4-4133 CL19-21-21-41 Those familiar with overclocking and high performance memory kits know that increased memory capacity also makes it difficult to raise the frequency speed. Built on decades of experience, G.SKILL is raising the limits of 8GBx4 kits to an unprecedented DDR4-4133MHz. Kaby Lake Platform Launch Records: 8 World Records & 21 Global First Places Upon the launch of the Kaby Lake platform are new overclocking and benchmark records, including a total of 8 world records and 21 global first place records achieved with the DDR4 Trident Z series memory and 7th Gen Intel® Core™ processors!  Rate this story Rating: 1 ...

Share story By Matt Day Seattle Times technology reporter LAS VEGAS — Wares from RCA, formerly the Radio Corporation of America, have been at CES since the technology show was born 50 years ago. For much of that time, though, RCA technically hasn’t existed as an independent business. Since the late 1980s, RCA has been a rented brand name slapped on products made under contract by companies from Toronto to the Philippines and China. CES, formerly the Consumer Electronics Show, showcases products made by some of the biggest manufacturing giants in the world, including Samsung, Toyota and Intel. It’s also a locus of the strange relationships wrought by capitalism. CES’ halls these days are filled with dozens of component manufacturers, many based in Asia, vying for business from companies with name recognition among consumers. That means the name on a finished television or smartphone often has little to do with what’s inside, or the people who made it.

Branding matters in technology. Many consumers don’t take the time to find out what makes gadgets tick. Marketing and the value that people assign to it help explain why Apple and Samsung products command a higher price than devices built by other companies. Hisense, a Chinese company best known in the U.S. for selling discount TVs at Wal-Mart, two years ago bought rights to sell Sharp-branded TVs in the U.S. The company’s gargantuan booth here mixes Hisense-branded TVs with those labeled with the name of the Japanese electronics firm from which it bought a brand. Across the Las Vegas Convention Center sat Kodak. Or, rather, two Kodaks. One is the successor to the legendary New York photo company that went bankrupt in 2012. The other, Kodak Pixpro, was created in 2013 when old Kodak was restructuring its debt pile. The company licensed the rights to sell Kodak-branded cameras to JK Imaging, a little-known outfit led by an executive at a Florida electronics distributor. Kodak Pixpro employs about 30 people between a Los Angeles office and a few sales and marketing hands in Europe. They were at CES primarily to showcase a line of cameras aimed at capturing video for virtual reality. “People see the Kodak name, and say, ‘Hey, can you sponsor this, invest in that?’” said Tracy Christall, JK Imaging’s marketing director. She often has to say no, telling people the company isn’t related to the other Kodak. Natalie Mizik, who studies marketing at the University of Washington Foster School of Business, says the value that consumers attach to brand names can last longer in high-tech businesses than other industries.   Pam Kunick-Cohen is trying to extend the life span of RCA. She works at Technicolor, the French conglomerate that owns the rights to RCA. The name traces its roots to 1919, when the U.S. government ended a wartime monopoly on radio technology. RCA grew into a giant, founding what became NBC and acquiring interests ranging from record players to rental cars. Research conducted by the company’s laboratories helped bring about color television, liquid crystal displays, and VCRs. The company was acquired by General Electric in 1986 and sold for parts. Now, RCA-branded products are built by contract manufacturers with a mandate to try to keep up with new technologies while making reasonably priced products. “We’re not going to be out there trying to out-innovate Samsung or LG,” Kunick-Cohen said. RCA customers tend to be residents of middle America, she said, shoppers who encounter RCA products at Target, Kmart or Wal-Mart. They also tend to skew older, folks who remember the earlier RCA. “We still have an amazing amount of market awareness for a brand that hasn’t been as active as it was 30 years ago,” Kunick-Cohen said. “The interesting part of this business model is the consumer often doesn’t know.” Matt Day: 206-464-2420 or mday@seattletimes.com.

Scott Applewhite US 15:54 08.01.2017(updated 17:25 08.01.2017) Get short URL 6760121 The declassified report released by the US intelligence community on Friday accusing Russia of meddling in the 2016 presidential race, while failing to produce any single evidence of Moscow’s wrongdoing, looks like a bad joke indeed. Instead of promised answers, all one gets sifting through the 25-page report, jointly prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency, are phrases like “we assess with high confidence,” “this is likely,” etc. What one does not get, however, is any hard evidence of President Putin personally authorizing a campaign of cyberattacks aimed at influencing the outcome of the recent presidential elections in the United States. © Photo: Pixabay CIA Chief: US Intel Report on Cyberattacks Focusing on Alleged Russian HackingThe only “proof” of Putin’s interference the report’s authors manage to produce is that the Russian president used to heap praise on Trump and stopped doing this in June 2016 in order not to undermine Americans’ growing support for the billionaire businessman, RIA Novosti commentator Andrei Smirnov wrote. The report also mentions Guccifer 2.0, a Romanian hacker or group of hackers who the authors claim also worked for the Kremlin. “Guccifer 2.0, who claimed to be an independent Romanian hacker, made multiple contradictory statements and false claims about his likely Russian identity throughout the election,” the report reads. “Press reporting suggests more than one person claiming to be Guccifer 2.0 interacted with journalists,” the report adds. This is about all its authors managed to dig up. Their main focus, however, is on the Kremlin’s alleged use of “state-sponsored” media companies and publications like RT and Sputnik that target overseas audiences to discredit Hillary Clinton and aid Donald Trump’s campaign. Eight of the report’s 25 pages are about RT, which the authors call Russia’s number one propaganda tool. However, most of this coverage happens to come from a 2012 CIA report, which is exactly when Barack Obama was reelected for a second term in the White House. Does it mean that Putin had a hand in this too? The report claims that RT threw its weight behind Trump in March 2016, while any Google user can see that in September 2016, shortly before the Americans went to the polling stations to elect their new president, RT published on its website materials about Donald Trump having used $258,000 of his charity's money to settle legal disputes. RT ran hundreds of other reports about Trump and Clinton, but the only thing that grabbed the authors of the report’s attention was the channel’s coverage of Clinton’s emails, physical and mental health and her links to Islamic extremists. The impression is that the intelligence experts who prepared this document completely missed out on numerous US media reports about Clinton blacking out right in the middle of a campaign speech and her subsequent pneumonia diagnosis. Neither could RT have ignored the front-page US media coverage of the Clinton Foundation’s links to financiers of terrorism, especially after Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton “the co-founder” of Daesh. RT has not been entirely pro-Trump either. In an October 2016 interview with RT’s Ed Schultz, Clinton's primary Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders, spoke at length why he thought Hillary Clinton was best suited to become America’s next president. © Sputnik/ 'Dear CIA!': RT Editor-in-Chief Mocks Accusations of 'Kremlin Propaganda'The report’s authors were particularly unhappy about RT’s active cooperation with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. To an extent that they called Assange’s chat with Dartmouth Films reporter John Pilger “an exclusive interview for RT.” As a result of all these foul ups, the report failed to gain traction even in the United States itself. After reviewing it a visibly disappointed The Daily Beast came up with an article titled “U.S. Spy Report Blames Putin for Hacks, But Doesn’t Back It Up.” “[The report] contains some outdated information that seems slapdash considering the attention focused on it. Errors in the report were almost inevitable, because of the haste in which it was prepared, said one US official briefed on the report,” the American news reporting and opinion website wrote. The Washington Post earlier quoted US officials who had read the report before it came out as saying that even its classified part offered no sensations at all. The New York Times disagreed, though, describing the report as “damning and surprisingly detailed.” “We must be reading different reports," Shaun Walker, the Moscow correspondent of The Guardian, observed.

The fact that they did not come out the way Clinton wanted them to, is no reason to start a new reality series, either, which is what all of this now is purporting to want or try." Good article! Reply jas 17:47 08.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete I assume RT viciously attacked Trump 2-4 times daily compared to an occasional article of very light criticism of Clinton a few times a week during the election. There was little difference from the MSM. That can be easily checked. It was the same at Sputnik. But that could have been allowed for a reason. It's easy enough to find the anti-Trump articles and the complaints in the comments section. Reply jas 17:59 08.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete It's a curiosity that Clinton was such a poor candidate that she had EVERYTHING rigged in her favor and still lost. And the DNC is going to lose the mayorship of New York if they are foolish enough to try and give it to Clinton. She's too mean, too old, too dishonest, too arrogant, too ignorant and too sick.

The false propaganda line of the US Media is failing and being exposed by the honest and truthful reporting of RT International.Show new comments (0) Сomment Reply in reply to(Show commentHide comment) | | Edit | Delete Save Thank you!

According to the document, Moscow used various tools, including cyberattacks and media activities, to influence the results of the election. Highlights of the Report © AFP 2016/ THOMAS SAMSON 'Embarrassment': How Foreign Journalists Reacted to Report on 'Russian Hacking'The document was prepared by analysts of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Agency (NSA). According to the author, the report covers "the motivation and scope of Moscow’s intentions regarding US elections and Moscow’s use of cyber tools and media campaigns to influence US public opinion." The report read that "Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards." However, according to the report, the targeted or compromised systems were not involved in vote tallying. As for the recent presidential campaign, the authors of the report concluded that the campaign was intended to "undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency." © AP Photo/ J. Scott Applewhite US Intelligence 'Laid Itself Open to Ridicule' by Accusing Russia of Hacker AttacksThe document also read the "influence campaign" was ordered personally by Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to US intelligence, President Putin and his entourage were interested in boosting Republican candidate Donald Trump’s chances of winning the election. "Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations – such as cyber activity – with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or 'trolls,'" the report read. The document does not contain the names of hackers or hacker groups allegedly involved in the cyber activities. However, previously issued US intelligence reports linked such hacker groups as Fancy Bear (APT 28) and Cozy Bear (APT 29) to Russian intelligence. In particular, according to US intelligence analysts, Cozy Bear were one of the hacker groups behind the of Democratic National Committee (DNC) email hack. © Flickr/ Steve Rhodes WikiLeaks: US Intel Report on Russia Hacking 'Has Poor Sourcing and No Evidence'In July, whistleblowing website WikiLeaks published almost 20,000 pages of hacked emails that revealed top DNC officials deliberately worked to obstruct Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders' campaign in order to boost his then-rival Hillary Clinton's chances of becoming the party's presidential nominee. After the emails were leaked, Clinton said that Russia was responsible for the hack as well as the publication of some unspecified DNC documents. On Saturday, President-elect Donald Trump said that the DNC were negligent in securing their private information. "Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place. The Republican National Committee had strong defense!" Trump wrote on Twitter. Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place.The Republican National Committee had strong defense! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 7 января 2017 г. ​Mysterious Hacker © Photo: Pixabay Hacker Guccifer Calls US Allegations Against Russia 'Fake Cyber War'The authors of the report assessed that the Russian military intelligence (GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to publish all the information they obtained. In early-summer, Guccifer 2.0 wrote in his blog that he obtained access to the DNC email leaks and then handed over the leak to WikiLeaks. The hacker illustrated his post with a report on Donald Trump, which was allegedly prepared by Hillary Clinton’s electoral office. The pseudonym Guccifer 2.0 refers to Romanian hacker Marcel Lehel Lazar, known as Guccifer, who obtained access to Hillary Clinton’s personal emails in 2013. © Flickr/ Dennis Skley Anti-Russian Campaign in Mainstream Media Fueled by 'Russian Hackers' HoaxSpeaking from prison in a Wednesday interview with Fox News, Lazar stressed that the allegations of Russia’s attempts to interfere with the US electoral system are "a fake cyber war" and that there is "hysteria" in the US regarding Russia stemming from the Cold War era. Nevertheless, US intelligence analysts assess that there is a group of people linked to the Russian government behind the Guccifer 2.0 persona. Previously, the same assumption was made by cybersecurity specialists from ThreatConnect and CrowdStrike. "Guccifer 2.0, who claimed to be an independent Romanian hacker, made multiple contradictory statements and false claims about his likely Russian identity throughout the election. Press reporting suggests more than one person claiming to be Guccifer 2.0 interacted with journalists," according to the report. At the same time, Guccifer 2.0 has made repeated statements that he did not like Moscow’s foreign policy. The hacker has also repeatedly denied media allegations of his links to Russia. "I read several reports, some experts found out that my proxy IP is hosted at a service that’s somehow connected with Russia and has a version in Russian as well as in English," Guccifer 2.0 wrote. "This is their strong evidence," he ironically added, as cited by The Wall Street Journal. WikiLeaks and Russian Media The US intelligence report also touched upon alleged links between the Russian government and the whistleblowing project WikiLeaks founded by Julian Assange. © REUTERS/ Brian Snyder US Intel Report Confirms WikiLeaks Data on DNC, Clinton Contain No ForgeriesAccording to the authors, Moscow "most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity." "Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries," the US intelligence assessed. As a piece of evidence, the report cited Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comment that it was important the DNC data was exposed to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks commented on the report: "US government's declassified 'Russian hacking' report has the curious disclaimer that it is based on watching TV and reading Tweets."

WikiLeaks has repeatedly denied such allegations. "Nothing in today's declassified ODNI report alters our conclusion that WikiLeaks' US election related sources are not state parties," WikiLeaks said in Twitter. © Sputnik/ Mikhail Voskresenskiy US Intel Report: 'RT & Sputnik Are Being Accused of Doing Journalism'Another piece of evidence, according to the document, is the alleged collaboration between the Russian broadcaster RT and Assange. Margarita Simonyan, RT’s editor-in-chief, visited Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in August 2013. "RT routinely gives Assange sympathetic coverage and provides him a platform to denounce the United States," the authors concluded. The report described RT’s activities as a "broader and long-standing anti-US messaging" campaign. On Thursday, Director of the US National Intelligence James Clapper said at a US Senate hearing on cybersecurity that RT had been "disparaging" of the US political system and was active in promoting its views on US hypocrisy regarding human rights and generally seeking out fissures in US society. Clapper also accused RT of spreading fake news stories. In response, Simonyan said that the broadcaster only reports on real events happening in the US. "The national intelligence head says that RT undermines the American system merely by reporting on what is happening in his country," Simonyan said. ...

The bottom line, in a courtroom, is that if the evidence does not make sense, it is because there is no truth in it, and you have to press for a summary judgement. Not being privy to all the information may make a case for the "intelligence community", but leaving me without a workable outline to present a case for them. with a preponderance of evidence, makes them look shit faced. And, knowing that this is a government conclusion, where money and imagination is always a premium, I am sticking with a Jason Bourne conclusion; "What do you want from me?" These are threads that go nowhere with anyone that is far more discerning than the man on the street. We are conditioned to being lied to, and have been, for years by our own government. Therefore, we do not believe you.

No official allegiance or party affiliation was required. For those of us that were dedicated to debunking the warmongers to help bring peace this was a big opportunity to do so in a very small window at a unique point in time. There was no pay day or payment of any kind not a cent I personally posted some 3500 posts which has been my retirement hours spent in the most noble of pursuits. Did we have a impact I dear say we did, we did it for peace and humanity with a determination to end wars designed to prolificate profit on the backs of death and destruction. I can also understand the bewilderment of some in the proficiency obtained in what I call my 'Masters degree in geopolitics' obtained in little over 12 months by a huge amount of hard work to unravel the deliberately confused trail portrayed in the mainstream of media. Sputnik amongs't others brought us piece by piece the parts to a 50,000 piece puzzle. In my opinion Sputnik was never a propaganda machine in fact at times I thought they were quite insipid for what ever reason. For me I feel a great sense of achievement to having completed the Masters degree by proxy and how paradoxical that might be. To reiterate not a cent was earn't or paid nor am I affiliated to any party or organisation. I can only offer my early experience at age 9 when I started to read 'The Industrial Revolution' by Karl Marx. To understand what a revolution it started in my mind to explore the truth,one would need to read the book there is no other like it! especially as a young mind.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Automakers, suppliers team up to share costs of self-driving cars By Reuters Published: 13:58 EST, 8 January 2017 | Updated: 13:58 EST, 8 January 2017 e-mail By Paul Lienert and Alexandria Sage LAS VEGAS, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Automotive suppliers and automakers are expanding alliances to develop self-driving car technology that can serve multiple automakers, as the race to put such vehicles on the road separates companies that can go it alone from those that need help sharing the financial and technical burdens. While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers - as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. "What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing," said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. "Everyone is changing partners." Several suppliers - notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player," said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. "The technological challenges are immense," Shashua told Reuters. "I would compare it to sending a man to the moon." Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel , and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5,000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW's senior vice president for automated driving. "We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021," Frickenstein said. "That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption." Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMW's joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia . Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF and Bosch. "We're not looking to develop a proprietary system," said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch's board of management who oversees autonomous driving. "We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping." While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. "There's not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution - no one who knows everything, every part of what's needed to make an autonomous car," said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi's head of development for driver assistance systems. Some key components of self-driving systems - cybersecurity, for instance - should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo. But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said. "There will be a mix because it's quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on," Devauchelle said. "Those are big blocks."

This is by making a Zen-based processor unlocked, which means soon to be owners can overclock Ryzen processors out of the box! AMD Ryzen Processor Features In efforts to attract more people, AMD finally heeded to the calls of gamers and PC communities to release a powerful processor which can be overclocked. AMD, like rival Intel, has been fighting this process in order to prevent any untold incident on processors while overclocking. As posted on WCCFTech.com, here are the things PC communities are waiting for: - All Ryzen CPUs will be multiplier unlocked and ready for overclocking right out of the box. There will be no locked Ryzen CPUs; - AM4 X370, X300 and B350 chipsets all support overclocking; - Ryzen CPUs will come in different configurations with varying core counts. The highest core count parts will have eight cores and support sixteen threads; -Ryzen will launch closer to the middle of Q1 or early Q1 rather than the end of Q1. AMD wouldn't give us a specific date, but sometime in February is a good bet. - Finally,AM4 compatible aftermarket air and liquid cooling solutions will be available on day one.

While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers – as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. "What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing," said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. "Everyone is changing partners." Several suppliers - notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player," said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. "The technological challenges are immense," Shashua told Reuters. "I would compare it to sending a man to the moon." Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel, and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $8,000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW's senior vice president for automated driving. "We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021," Frickenstein said. "That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption." Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMW's joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia. Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF and Bosch. "We're not looking to develop a proprietary system," said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch's board of management who oversees autonomous driving. "We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping." While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. "There's not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution - no one who knows everything, every part of what's needed to make an autonomous car," said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi's head of development for driver assistance systems.

Radio Sputnik talked to political commentator and the host of the daily radio newscast "CPR news" Don DeBar. “The interesting thing about this report is that it is only conclusions, not evidence or even a statement of a case. The very beginning of the report says ‘sorry, we can’t show you any of the evidence.’ The case that they make, the conclusions they arrive at are that Sputnik and RT provide platforms for voices other than that coming out of the mainstream media, that they view the mainstream media’s treatment of Trump as biased, that they published materials that created unfavorable feelings towards Clinton, such as the WikiLeaks releases,” Don DeBar said. “What Sputnik and the RT are really accused of is doing journalism, muckraking, taking materials for the public to make up their own minds about.” When asked why it seems that nobody cared about the actual content of the emails of Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta, which contain self-confessions of criminal activity, about the Democratic National Committee (DNC) suppressing Bernie Sanders’ campaign, and many other things besides, Don DeBar said that nobody actually denied that these things had happened. © Photo: Pixabay CIA Chief: US Intel Report on Cyberattacks Focusing on Alleged Russian Hacking“That is not part of the discussion. The main argument here is that the source of this [information] was a foreign government and that the purpose was to influence the US election. We call this whistleblowing in the US. We know how the Obama administration treats that, prosecuting more people on the Espionage Act than all of the prior presidents of the past 100 years,” DeBar noted. “But those of us who were raised here with the belief that a free press is essential to the functioning of a democracy look favorably as hell on it when someone says something we didn’t know about people running for office,” he added. Some of the Podesta emails shed light on Hillary Clinton’s improper use of the charitable foundation, her paid speeches at Goldman Sachs where she was less critical of Wall Street banks than she had been on the campaign trail. Other emails showed Clinton criticizing environmental activists and supporting hydraulic fracturing, which is a method of gas mining fraught with danger to the environment. The Democrats described the hacks as an attempt to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign and boost support for Donald Trump. © Sputnik/ Evgeny Biyatov RT Besieged by DDoS Attacks Days After US Think Tank Called for Cyber TerrorismDon DeBar also said that the password John Podesta used — “p@ssw0rd” — was so simple that “even some kid in his mummy’s basement” could crack it. “It’s a real possibility that they (the DNC) had absolutely no security, so I think that [all the talk about the alleged Russian meddling in the US election] is just a distraction from the fact that these are authentic emails that show criminal activity by the campaign of a presidential candidate, by the Democratic National Committee, by a whole host of players that are either government officials or would-be government officials, and that the press is no part of this criminal activity at all,” Don DeBar said. The declassified report released by US intelligence community on Friday accuses the Russian media of influencing the American public during the 2016 presidential race. However, it appears that material that was thought to provide evidence was compiled in December 2012, right after the reelection of Barack Obama. Notably, the report focuses on television shows and interviews that took place four years before Trump was elected, and well before he was even a politician. WikiLeaks derided the report in a tweet by saying that the document, "had the curious disclaimer that it was based on watching TV and reading Tweets." Have you heard the news?

RT and Sput are typically a couple days behind the real journalists of Breitbart. In fact, I believe this is where they get half of their material. Reply Darius 15:16 08.01.2017 | 1 | Edit | Delete In fact, it should be the duty of the American press to seek the truth and inform the American people. Not only this is not done, but when others do it, they are accused of «meddling» ! However, when Barack Hussein Obama told the British people how to vote, was this not meddling ?!

While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers - as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. "What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing," said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. "Everyone is changing partners." Several suppliers - notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player," said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. "The technological challenges are immense," Shashua told Reuters. "I would compare it to sending a man to the moon." Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel , and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5,000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW's senior vice president for automated driving. "We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021," Frickenstein said. "That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption." Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMW's joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia . Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF and Bosch. "We're not looking to develop a proprietary system," said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch's board of management who oversees autonomous driving. "We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping." While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. "There's not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution - no one who knows everything, every part of what's needed to make an autonomous car," said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi's head of development for driver assistance systems. Some key components of self-driving systems - cybersecurity, for instance - should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo. But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said. "There will be a mix because it's quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on," Devauchelle said. "Those are big blocks."
