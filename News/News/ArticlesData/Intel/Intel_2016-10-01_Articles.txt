Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 2, 2016 at 11:41AM Dividend returns can really stack up over time. Image source: Getty Images.  Many investors are attracted to technology companies primarily due to the prospect of significant, and relatively rapid, share price appreciation. However, there are also many investors that like the idea of investing in tech companies -- particularly ones that are poised to deliver reasonable amounts of revenue and profit growth in the years ahead -- that provide a steady (and growing) income stream in the form of dividends. In this column, I'd like to highlight three tech stocks that pay significant dividends and are well positioned to increase those dividends at a consistent clip over time. The chip specialist Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) currently pays a dividend of $0.26 per quarter, or $1.04 per share on an annual basis. For a while, Intel was a name that was known for offering a relatively high dividend yield – often to the tune of 4% -- but the company's share price appreciation over the last couple of years has brought it down to a smaller, though still quite respectable, 2.79%. Further, Intel is well positioned to grow its dividend payments out in time. Though some income seekers may have felt "burned" when Intel failed to raise its dividend in 2013 and 2014, the company's business performance has stabilized and is actually back on a growth path. As a result, the company delivered solid dividend increases in 2015 and again in 2016. In time, I expect that the company's attempts to stabilize its core personal computer chip business while looking to other markets (data center, non-volatile memory, and Internet of Things) for growth will allow it to deliver steady revenue and profit growth. As long as that strategy works out, Intel should be able to deliver consistent, reliable, and worthwhile dividend increases to its shareholders. The software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a household name in the world of technology stocks. Its Windows operating system powers the majority of personal computers, its Office suite of productivity software is extremely popular, it is one of the three major game console vendors, and its cloud and server software businesses have also been doing extremely well. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share (and that figure has grown consistently over the last several years), which works out to $1.56 per share on an annualized basis. As of this writing, this represents a dividend yield of around 2.72%. Generally speaking, dividends and other capital return programs are funded by a company's free cash flow, and Microsoft is a cash generating machine. Over the last twelve months, Microsoft generated nearly $25 billion in free cash flow, or approximately $3.21 per share. This means that even if Microsoft doesn't grow the amount of free cash flow that it generates from here (though I do expect Microsoft to continue to grow), it's well positioned to continue to deliver meaningful dividend increases for years to come. The iDevice maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) only relatively recently restarted its capital return program, but the company's efforts here have been quite aggressive. Though Apple seems to favor aggressive buybacks to aggressive dividends, the company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share ($2.28 per share on an annualized basis), working out to a dividend yield of 2.07%. Although Apple's business is expected to dip in the current fiscal year, analysts generally expect a rebound in both revenue and earnings per share in the company's coming fiscal year. Additionally, Apple's current dividend on an annualized basis represents just a fraction of the free cash flow per share that the company has been able to generate year-in and year-out. There's little doubt in my mind that, barring a "black swan" event that completely wreaks havoc on Apple's business, the iDevice maker will be able to increase its dividend for many years to come.         Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Everything We Know About 2017 MacBook Pro Posted: Oct 27 2016, 10:43am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     Its been a long time since Apple updated its MacBook lineup and now we have concrete evidence about a major update coming up for Apple's flagship Mac devices. Here is what we know about the 2017 MacBook Pro. The MacBook is considered to be one of the most powerful and productive laptops in the industry and this fall we are expecting a sizzling update in the machine. The Retina MacBook Pro has two versions which include the 13 and 15 inch machines. This fall it is expected that an update will occur which will include a thinner body and many people are looking forward to the lighter touch panel which includes a touch pad ID functionality. Don't Miss: The Black Friday Deals to Buy now on Amazon What is coming up in the next MacBook Retina Pro Design Alterations Authentic sources such as KGI securities and Bloomberg have given out the verdict that Apple will be giving out the new version of the MacBook Pro 13 and 15 inch this fall 2016. It is expected that the machines could be out as early as October which makes sense as Apple is aiming to release the mac software mac0S 10.12.1 also in October. This way we will be able to see the updated version by late October. The MacBook Pros is anticipated to have a much thinner and lighter composition than what we observe currently. However the body of the machine is not expected to be tampered with like we saw in other versions such as MacBook Air and Retina Macbook. You will be able to enjoy shallower curves on the edges. The track pad is also improved to be wide pressure sensitive along with a flatter and smoother keyboard. Other changes in the keyboard include an OLED display touch panel at the top of the keyboard which replaces the conventional physical keys. Apple has named this as the dynamic function row. It is also rumoured that the new version will have support for touch ID and thunderbolt 3. The touch ID button will most probably be included in the power button. Currently you see the power button right aside the function keys and it will stay there as it is in the most logical position it can be in. There are other rumors afloat which suggest that the OLED touch panel will be contextual. The panel might have buttons which change upon the app in use. Martin Hajek a designer has established a mockup of the Retinal MacBook Pro as it would look with an OLED touch panel. Kuo believes that the new MacBook Pro models have the most significant upgrades Apple has ever undertaken. The new Models will also include metal injection mould made hinges and butterfly mechanism keyboards which we have seen earlier in the 12 inch MacBook. In the past we have seen rumours which stated that Apple is developing ultra thin 13 and 15 inch MacBooks but it was unclear which line did the MacBook belong to but now with the information provided by Kuo it is pretty much suggestion that the information pertains to the MacBook Pro Line. We were able to see photos in May which said to depict components for the upcoming Retina MacBook Pro. The images gave the first look of the thin body device. They included the body of the 13 inch MacBook Pro but missing were the cutouts for the function row. There was a blank space instead where the OLED is expected to be placed. The sides of the device had four USB-C ports and a singular head phone jack. It isn’t for certain that these images give us the first look to our genuine MacBook but they certainly fall in line with the rumors we have heard about the MacBook Pro till now. Specifications Apple Retina MacBook Pro updates have been out of line in the previous two years because of the delay going on with the Intel chips. Apple launched the 13 and 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro at staggering times in 2015 only due to Broadwell. In fact the 13 inch model observed an update in March and the 15 inch model in May 2015. The 13 inch Retina MacBook pro works with Broadwell chips but the 15 inch continues with its previous generation Haswell chips. Apple is still waiting for Skylake chips from Intel and this 15 inch Retina MacBook will see a higher performance boost. The appropriate Skylake chips to be included in the 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro were shown in the price lists by Intel in Mid January and the 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro appropriate chips were announced in September. These chips are sought to be available to Apple in the initial months of 2016. A new series of Xeon E3 can also be potentially used in the 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro. This can boost CPU, memory, performance and even graphics but due to pricing constraints the Core i7 Skylake chips are more likely to be Apple’s choice. The new MacBook Pros are anticipated to contain much powerful graphic cards aiming the video gamers and other professionals who are in need of GPU power.Another rumor is that there might be an option for high performance through the Polaris graphics chip which gives more power but in a slimmer package. Date of Release The initial rumors had us thinking that ultra thin 13 and 15 inch MacBook would be introduced in the second quarter of 2016 but later on rumors suggested they will not be released till fall 2016. October is the month which is thought to be the one containing the potential release date. However the latest details regarding Apple’s software masOS10.12.1 which include its release on October 7 suggest that Apple is aiming to finalize the whole package and the timeline indicates the machines will be launched in late October. The Current Available Models On march 9 2015 Apple hosted a media event name ‘Spring forward’ in which it released the updated 13 inch Retinal Mac Book Pro. The updated version contained several improvements. A new Broadwell processor was included as well as improved Intel graphics. The battery was also upgraded and a Force touch trackpad. 13 inch Retinal MacBook Pro The 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro comprises of Broadwell Processors and when compared to the old generation Haswell processors gives more improved performance and better battery life. The improved battery life is deemed to give at least 12 hours of itunes movie playback. Many internal upgrades have been made but the outer design is the same has the previous generation laptops. It has 2560x1600 wide and 227 pixel per inch Retina display. Its weight is 3.48 pounds and is approximately 0.71 inches thick. This laptop is more focused on performance rather than portability. Basic configurations are available at different prices which depend on the processor chosen as well as storage space. Processing, Graphics And Storage The Geekbench 3 benchmarks is of the opinion that the Broad well chips in the 13 inch Retina MacBook Pros’s only give a rather small advantage over their predecessors. This comes as no surprise as Broadwell is more focused on efficiency and battery life rather than simple processing power. However, in general in certain bench mark tests a 3 to 7 percent increase has been seen in performance.The 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro also comes with a upgraded Intel Iris Graphics 6100 which is thought to be a bit more faster than the GeForce 820M. You will be disappointed as there is no discrete graphics card to add in the 13 inch MackBook Pro but there is an option in the 15 inch. Apple has stated that the 2015 version of the 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro has an upgraded flash storage which is at least two times faster than the older generation machines. Certain independent tests have confirmed that the flash storage is actually faster than the older models. 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro The 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro was updated on may 19 2015 by Apple. Due to the delays made by Intel it does not feature Broadwell processors but the 2015 version does have many of the same improvements in the 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro. The 15 inch Retinal MacBook Pro also includes a Force touch track pad, it has also has improved graphics from AMD, a faster storage and a battery life of about 8 to 9 hours. Interestingly the solid state drive included in the 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro is the greatest notebook drive the company has yet introduced. It can reach speeds of about to 2GB which is almost 2.5 times more than the SSD in the older generation 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro. Non Retina MacBook Pro The non Retina MacBook Pro has not been updated by Apple and do not contain Haswell processors and thus Apple has stopped selling the 15 inch non Retina MacBook Pro but still continues to sell the 13 inch non Retina MacBook Pro. This has not updated since June 2012. The reconfiguration had a cut of dollar. Recently the non Retina MacBook Pro is almost the same price as the Retina MacBook Pro so it is likely that Apple will discontinue its production of non Retina models at some point and time.

Vim 8.0, macOS Sierra, Libreboot, & GCC Were Popular In September Written by Michael Larabel in Phoronix on 1 October 2016 at 08:27 AM EDT. Add A Comment September was another busy month and here's a look at the most popular articles on Phoronix for the month of my 267 original news items and 17 featured Linux reviews/articles. It was yet another month with a lot of exciting open-source/Linux events with publishing nearly 10 articles per day. Below is a look at the most popular news and reviews. As always, if you appreciate all of the timely open-source/Linux news and interesting benchmarks, please consider joining Phoronix Premium. On the Phoronix side, September marked the release of Phoronix Test Suite 6.6 while sadly the Phoronix Oktoberfest pilgrimage / meetup didn't happen this year. The most popular September 2016 news: Libreboot Leaves The GNU, The Free Software Foundation Denounced It was only in May that Libreboot became an official GNU project but now this free software Coreboot downstream has parted ways. Microsoft Reportedly Requires "Signature PCs" To Be Locked To Only Running Windows Lately I've heard a few reports of some newer PCs being less than friendly with Linux, namely a number of Lenovo devices who have issues with installing Linux. Based upon new information that's come to light from a Phoronix reader, it appears that PCs receiving Microsoft's "Signature Edition" tag are being locked-out from running non-Windows platforms. No, AMD Will Not Be Opening Up Its Firmware/Microcode This issue comes up every so often by people suggesting it or otherwise inquiring about it... No, AMD has no intentions of open-sourcing its low-level firmware / microcode for their Radeon GPUs. FSF, RMS Issue Statements Over Libreboot's Accusations Thursday night we wrote about Libreboot leaving the GNU and denouncing the GNU and FSF with rather harsh words. That thread generated more than 120 comments with differing views while now the Free Software Foundation issued a statement as well as Richard M Stallman. Adobe Returns To Updating NPAPI/Linux Flash Player Adobe stopped updating its NPAPI-based Linux Flash Player four years ago and planned to stop supporting it entirely in 2017, but now the company has backtracked on those steps with a commitment to regularly update their NPAPI and PPAPI versions of the Flash Player for Linux. Vim 8.0 Released With GTK3 Support, Async I/O & DirectX Support Vi IMproved has been further improved with today's Vim 8.0 release. In fact, this is the first major release of Vim in the past decade! Trying Out The FreeBSD-Powered TrueOS With Its Custom Qt Desktop While I've been running PC-BSD on some systems for years I hadn't tried out any of its rolling-release FreeBSD 11.0-based spins under the new TrueOS brand nor had I tried out the project's Qt-based Lumina Desktop Environment since it reached 1.0. That changed today with trying out the latest weekly spin of TrueOS x64. GCC Might Finally Drop The GNU Compiler For Java (GCJ) The GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ) while made a lot of progress in its early years as a free software Java compiler, in recent years it's basically been in maintenance mode and might now be removed entirely from GCC. Intel Has Been Working On A Fast 2D GPU Renderer Focused On Web Content Intel's open-source developers have been working on a GPU-based high-performance 2D renderer that can be nine times faster than Cairo's CPU-based renderer and still multiple times faster than Qt (even with OpenGL), Cairo with OpenGL, or even Google's Skia with OpenGL rendering. The focus of this new project, FastUIDraw, is ultimately for speeding up the rendering of web content and being able to accelerate all of the HTML5 canvas operations. Here Are The Steam Survey Results For Linux During August 2016 The start of the new month brings a new percentage about the estimated Linux gaming population as measured by the Steam survey. Feral Interactive Said To Be Announcing "Massive" New Game For Linux Tomorrow The Mac/Linux game porters at Feral Interactive are teasing that tomorrow they will be announcing a "massive" game. QEMU 2.7 Released With Many Improvements For The Linux Virtualization Stack It's time for another stable QEMU update. And the most popular articles: macOS 10.12 Sierra vs. Ubuntu 16.04 Linux Benchmarking Apple released macOS 10.12 "Sierra" last week as the successor to OS X El Capitan. Given this annual update to macOS / OS X, here are benchmarks of macOS Sierra compared to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on a MacBook Air and Mac Mini computers. LLVM Clang 3.9 Mostly Trails GCC In Compiler Performance Following yesterday's GCC 5 vs. 6 vs. early 7 benchmarks, to no surprise LLVM's Clang compiler was brought up in the comments. I had already been running some fresh LLVM Clang benchmarks on this same Intel Xeon system and have those results to share now with Clang 3.8 and the newly-released Clang 3.9. Early GCC 7 Compiler Benchmarks On Linux: Some Performance Improvements While GCC 7 is still under heavy development and the GCC 7.1 stable release will not come until a few months into 2017, here are some early benchmarks of GCC 7.0 compared to GCC 6.2 and GCC 5.4 on an Ubuntu Linux x86_64 system. Intel Xeon E5-2609 v4 Broadwell-EP Linux Benchmarks Recently I purchased a Xeon E5-2609 v4 Broadwell-EP processor as a $300 Xeon with eight physical cores but clocked at just 1.7GHz and without any Turbo Boost while the TDP is 85 Watts. Here are some benchmarks compared to other LGA-2011 v3 CPUs in my possession under Linux along with an AMD FX reference point too and followed by some Skylake Xeon benchmarks. TrueOS vs. DragonFlyBSD vs. GhostBSD vs. FreeBSD vs. PacBSD Benchmarks For your viewing pleasure this weekend are benchmarks of TrueOS 20160831 (the rolling-release distribution formerly known as PC-BSD), DragonFlyBSD 4.6, GhostBSD 10.3, FreeBSD 11.0-RC2, and PacBSD 20160809 (formerly known as Arch BSD) all benchmarked from the same system! Plus for reference to the Linux numbers are Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS and Clear Linux 10040 being compared to these BSDs on the same tests and hardware. Intel Core i7 6800K Benchmarks On Ubuntu + Linux 4.8 While the Core i7 6800K has been available for a few months now, there hadn't been any review on it since Intel hadn't sent out any Broadwell-E samples for Linux testing this time around. However, I did end up finally buying a Core i7 6800K now that the Turbo Boost Max 3.0 support is finally coming together (at first, Intel PR said it wouldn't even be supported on Linux) so that I can run some benchmarks there plus some other interesting items on the horizon for benchmarking. Here are some benchmarks of the i7-6800K from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with the Linux 4.8 kernel. 7-Way Linux Distribution Benchmarks To Kick Off September In testing out a new Broadwell-EP system as well as for final validation of the new Phoronix Test Suite 6.6, I carried out a fresh Linux OS distribution comparison last week. Here are those results from Ubuntu, Clear Linux, Scientific Linux, openSUSE Tumbleweed, Fedora, Antergos, and Sabayon Linux. A Look At The Exciting Features/Improvements Of GNOME 3.22 If all goes well, GNOME 3.22 will be officially released tomorrow, 21 September. Here is a recap of some of the new features and improvements made over this past six month development cycle plus some screenshots of the near-final desktop that will power the upcoming Fedora 25 Workstation. Trying Out Eight BSDs On A Modern PC: Some Are Smooth, Others Troublesome Following the seven-way Linux distribution benchmark comparison published earlier this week, on the same system I set out to test a variety of BSD distributions on the same system and ultimately benchmark their out-of-the-box performance too. Those performance benchmark results will be published later this week while today were a few remarks I wanted to share when trying out TrueOS, DragonFlyBSD, GhostBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, MidnightBSD, and PacBSD (Arch BSD) on this modern Intel Xeon system. Intel 600P Series SSD NVMe M.2 Linux Tests Last month Intel introduced the 600P Series solid-state drives as the most competitively-priced NVMe SSDs launched to date. Here are a few Linux comparison benchmarks from my initial testing of the SSDPEKKW256G7X1 M.2 SSD on Linux.

Minyanville 4 Best ETFs and Stocks to Tap the Tech Boom By Scutify Sep 30, 2016 9:32 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. After a lackluster first half of 2016, the technology sector is on fire in the third quarter on improving fundamentals, investors' drive for cheaper valuation and renewed focus on beaten down growth stocks. In fact, the sector led the market rally in Q3, with the ultra-popular Technology SPDR (XLK) gaining nearly 10.5% versus the gain of 3.4% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). Inside the Tech Surge Impressive growth of the sector largely hinges on Apple Inc.'s(AAPL) solid performance led by robust earnings and the iPhone 7 launch. The flurry of better-than-expected Q2 results from heavyweights such as Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Alphabet Inc(GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), and Facebook Inc (FB) also injected optimism, pushing the sector to new highs. Ongoing consolidation in the semiconductor industry and strong earnings reports from chipmakers Intel Corporation (INTC), Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM), Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN), and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) added further strength (read:Catch Apple's Rally with These Top-Ranked Tech ETFs). In fact, the sector has staged a strong turnaround from the two previous quarters of negative earnings and even surpassed the S&P 500. The trend is likely to continue in the third quarter as the sector's earnings are expected to decline 1.9%, much lower than that of the S&P 500's decline of 3.1%, as per the Earnings Trend report. The expectation of outperformance in Q3 continues to fuel the rally in the sector. Additionally, a strengthening economy and better job prospects gave a nice boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology that typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle. As the world is becoming increasingly digital, demand for novel and advanced technologies such as cloud computing, big data, smartphones, high-speed fiber networks and the Internet of Things is growing by leaps and bounds. This is creating great opportunities for tech companies. And not to forget, most of these tech companies are sitting on a huge pile of cash and are in a position to increase payouts to their shareholders. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google The cash reserves will ensure that these companies are not plagued by financial trouble even in a rising interest rate environment, the chance of which is looming large for later this year (read: Time to Buy These Tech ETFs?). While most of the ETFs and stocks have outperformed in Q3, we have highlighted four from each corner of the space that will continue their outperformance in the coming months as well. Let's take a look at our ETF picks first... Using our database, we have selected those technology ETFs that offer domestic exposure and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Each of these has the potential to move higher in Q4 as well (see: all the Technology ETFs here). PowerShares Dynamic Networking (ETF) (PXQ) - Up 22.6% This product targets the networking segment of the broad U.S. technology sector by tracking the Dynamic Networking Intellidex Index. Holding 30 securities in its basket, the fund is well spread across each component as each security accounts for less than 5.1% share in the basket. From an industrial look, about half of the portfolio is focused on communication equipment followed by 30% in software and programming. The fund is unpopular and illiquid in the broad tech space with AUM of $19.9 million and average daily volume of about 3,000 shares. It charges 63 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 with a High risk outlook. Global X Funds (SOCL) - Up 21.7% This fund provides pure play access to social media companies around the world and follows the Solactive Social Media Total Return Index. It has amassed $132 million in its asset base and charges 0.65% in fees and expenses. The ETF sees a lower trading volumes of roughly 48,000 shares a day. In total, it holds 31 securities in the basket with higher concentration on the top four firms making up for a combined 39% share. U.S. firms take half of the portfolio, closely followed by China (26%), Japan (8%) and Russia (6%). The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3, with a High risk outlook (read: Twitter Acquisition Talks in the Air: Stock & ETFs Gain). PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors (ETF) (PSI)- Up 21.5% This ETF provides exposure to the semiconductor segment of the broader U.S. technology sector by tracking the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index. This benchmark selects stocks on a variety of investment criteria: price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action and value. In total, the fund holds a small basket of 30 securities with none holding more than 5.2% share. The product, with AUM of $92.7 million is often overlooked by investors and hence sees a lower average daily volume of around 23,000 shares. The product charges a fee of 63 bps a year and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1, with a High risk outlook. Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) - Up 18.3% This fund provides exposure to 26 chipmakers by tracking the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. It has a large concentration on the top two firms that collectively make up for 26.1% of assets. The product has managed assets worth $567.4 million and charges 35 bps in annual fees and expenses. It is heavily traded with volume of around 2.7 million shares per day and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 2, with a High risk outlook (read: Profit from the Semiconductor Rally with These ETFs).

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear Analyst Says iPhone SE Was a One-Off for Apple View All Editorials → Evidence is Mounting: Apple Will Convert the Macs to ARM CPUs John Martellaro @jmartellaro Sep 30th, 2016 4:54 PM EST | Particle Debris The time since most of the Macs have been updated can now be described as geologic. Is that because Apple doesn’t care about the Macs? Time Cook says “I Love the Mac.” Or, more likely, could we be in for another major architectural change? Evidence is mounting that Apple really will abandon Intel and take the Mac lineup to ARM. Here’s the assessment. First, let’s look at the latest evidence from iDownloadBlog. macOS Sierra code suggests Apple could replace Intel in Macs with custom ARM chips That article nicely recounts the history of this notion, including this important section. And in 2014, former head of the Macintosh division Jean-Louis Gassée hinted that the first ARM-based Macs could appear in 2017. Gassée explained: If we follow this line of reasoning, the advantages of ARM-based processors vs. x86 devices become even more compelling: lower cost, better power dissipation, natural integration with the rest of the machine. For years, Intel has argued that its superior semiconductor design and manufacturing technology would eventually overcome the complexity downsides of the x86 architecture. But that ‘eventually’ is getting a bit stale. Other than a few showcase design wins that have never amounted to much in the real world, x86 devices continue to lose to ARM-derived SoC (System On a Chip) designs. The Key Issues In addition to what Jean-Louis Gassée explained abive, there are some other nuances to explore. Intel releases its new CPUs on its own timetable that doesn’t rigorously take into account Apple’s technical needs and product development cycle. All iOS devices use ARM. This change will make Xcode and development in general more coherent across platforms. It could lead to better synergies between iOS and macOS. The ARM processors in the latest iOS devices are 64-bit and more than competitive with CPUs from Intel in performance. Apple is the acknowledged expert in taking millions of customers though a major architecture change. The company did it first from Motorola 68K to PowerPC in 1998 and then PowerPC to Intel in 2005. The very long time since we’ve had updates to the Mac Pro, Mac mini, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro suggests (but doesn’t guarantee) that this architecture change has been in the works. Apple is taking its sweet time to do it right. That would include, perhaps, a Rosetta-like mechanism that allows current Intel-based Mac apps to run on the new Macs. Apple’s technical roadmap may well be diverging from Intel’s, one that has to take into account the needs of PC makers, not Apple. Perhaps Apple is done with this. Also, the nicety of installing Windows natively on a Mac with Boot Camp is a notion whose time has come and gone. Virtual Machine hardware in the ARM CPUs and an instruction translator would still allow Mac users to run VMs with Intel-based OSes like Windows and Linux. From what we’ve seen, modern ARM CPUs have the horsepower to do that. A new ARM-based MacPro? Perhaps not the droid we were looking for. Image credit: Apple That said, I strongly suspect that the MacBook Pros, rumored to be announced in October will be the last Macs with an Intel CPU, the Skylake series. The question now is, will Apple simply release the new MacBook Pros without mentioning the transition? This is important because if Apple tips its hand at an October event, too many customers might decide to wait until 2017 to upgrade their MBP. On the other, had, it could make sense to introduce an ARM-based Mac Pro or 5K iMac and suggest that the MacBook Pros will be the last Macs to make the transition in 2017/8. Mac customers would collectively breathe a sigh of relief to finally see what Apple is up to. And if you need a new MBP, buy it now (in October). It will be viable for years. Meanwhile, Apple will deliver a multi-CPU workhorse ARM-based Mac Pro/iMac for developers to get the ball rolling. This is a delicate maneuver for Apple because customers are hungry for new Macs, and the company would have to both plan for and announce these new Macs in the right sequence with the right messaging. Now we wait. Next page: The Tech News Debris for the Week of September 26th. The new Apple Echo chamber. Pages: 1 2 Next Page Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Amazon, ARM, Autonomous cars, Echo, Mac Pro, MacBook Pro 36 Comments Add a comment skipaq September 30, 2016 I do believe your take on Macs with ARM processors is the future of Mac. Unlike what has been going on over the last few years with Intel; Apple’s incessant desire to control everything possible can be better realized in this way. September 30, 2016 at 5:35 EST PM quakerotis September 30, 2016 I don’t think this will happen any time soon. ARM is great in single cores and multicores. It doesn’t have floating point, it doesn’t have multiple execution threads nor the thermal capacity to handle any of this. Benchmarks don’t tell the story. These are different tasks. Maybe someday, but not in the near future. September 30, 2016 at 5:48 EST PM quakerotis September 30, 2016 Additionally, Bootcamp and virtualization are not ideas whose time has come and gone. That is naive. Virtualization will only become more critical in the future, not less. And you’re absolutely wrong if you think Apple will deliver a Mac Pro with ARM. The Mac Pro’s problems are with the nonsensical design and the garbage Video cards they come with. September 30, 2016 at 5:50 EST PM belmikey September 30, 2016 Apple might do this–in fact, I wouldn’t be entirely surprised if they do this–but it would be foolish of them, and their sales would plummet as soon as people realized that nothing actually worked on them any more. Most games for the Mac, for example, are not ports–they run in an environment derived from WINE or its relations, and depend upon an x86 base. ARM CPUs are not yet nearly fast enough to provide decent performance doing instruction translation from x86 to ARM so that these capabilities would remain. Nothing would make me more likely to abandon the Mac platform. I don’t think I’m alone. September 30, 2016 at 6:07 EST PM vpndev September 30, 2016 This will happen but we should expect a lengthy transition. MacBook and MacBook Air are obvious candidates for starting the transition. This is almost in the “low hanging fruit” category. No huge need for big compute capacity or demanding video – so this would be easy. The Mac Pro is at the other end of the spectrum. It needs lots of crunch an that might be hard to do with ARM, especially given the tasks that these machines often do. I’d expect this one to be last in the line. belmikey: you’re right, but many games spend most of their time in code provided by libraries or the kernel, and not in actual application logic. Apple did a study of this back at the time of PPC->x86 transition and found that many apps were about 10% local code and 90% system/kernel/etc. So this hit might not be as bad as you fear. September 30, 2016 at 11:37 EST PM Bregalad October 1, 2016 I believe Apple is certainly moving in the direction or A-series processors in Macs. They want to control the whole widget and likely see improved compatibility with iOS devices as more important than compatibility with Windows. At the same time Apple seems eager to make further inroads in enterprise environments and moving away from the processor architecture and instruction set used in the vast majority of corporate hardware could be a huge mistake. When Macs relied on emulation you hardly ever saw one in a business setting. Once virtualization was possible Macs flooded into fields where they’d never been seen before. Maybe Apple truly doesn’t care about keeping Macs in business. Maybe they expect sales of iOS devices will be able to pick up the slack. Judging by the falling sales figures for iPads, however, that probably isn’t a viable approach. October 1, 2016 at 2:58 EST AM colinddarby October 1, 2016 Makes absolute zero sense for a number of reasons, seems nonsensical, user-hostile and would actually make the Mac’s less attractive, have less software, more expensive and would drive pro-users like me, over to Windows. However it will make them 0.3mm thinner because ARM series chips are slightly smaller than Intel ones, so I expect the transition to start in mid-October. In five new sparkly colours, including jet black. October 1, 2016 at 4:33 EST AM Guy B Serle October 1, 2016 The problem with most of the comments to this story is that you’re looking at it from your point of view and not Apple’s. Many of you have said that it seems like Apple no longer cares that much about the Pro market and this fits right in with a move like this. Other than FCP and Logic, what pro apps are left from Apple? How much money does Apple actually make from the pro market as compared to the consumer side? The answer is…not much. If they can keep 80-90% of their customer base after switching to ARM and still keep their same margins while offering lower prices across their line, the loss of the pro market as compared to new potential consumers is nothing. Remember as well that with iOS Apple is beginning to make inroads to the Enterprise market which has the potential to be huge. Apple is better suited to take a chance like this than they were when they switched from 68xxx to PPC or PPC to Intel. They have a tremendous war chest that can easily weather any financial storm for 5-10 years. They have a strong Mac market that has grown quite a bit since 2005 and there’s still a quiet revolt over the changes made since the release of Windows 8 and 10. People are looking for something different but don’t want to pay the Mac tax. If Apple can lower their prices and still keep their margins this could be a win for nearly everybody. Microsoft and Adobe will release ARM versions of their software for the Mac (assuming it happens natch). They’d be crazy not to. Heck MS is already there with iOS and Android version of Office October 1, 2016 at 10:32 EST AM aka_JYeager October 1, 2016 What will happen to hardware sales after someone figures out how to run that version of macOS on a Raspberry Pi (a $35 ARM based computer)? October 1, 2016 at 12:51 EST PM John Martellaro October 1, 2016 Guy B Serle: That’s a great summary of the situation. October 1, 2016 at 5:24 EST PM brilor October 1, 2016 Evidence is mounting that Apple really will abandon Intel and take the Mac lineup to ARM. I see reasoned guesses, speculation and discussions portraying a parallel to Apple’s PPC to Intel transition but no actual evidence. First, there is no way an A10 can perform the sustained computing that is often done on a Mac. It is good for short ( few seconds ) bursts of intensive usage but more intensive tasks are beyond it right now. Sure, Apple might have longer-term plans to couple ARM and Macs but the A10 isn’t it. Yes, the future of the Mac Pro and anything “Pro” ( and I mean really Pro not just the labels Apple slaps on devices that are borderline to not pro ) is tentative based on extrapolation of current evidence ( i.e. almost three years since a Mac Pro rev and cancellation of their only monitor with suggestions to buy competitor’s monitors ), so if the Mac Pro has been canceled it makes it easier for Apple to wield some future ARM product. Of course a top of the line 27 inch iMac currently can out compute ( and for longer periods ) an A10 and Apple keeps the iMac mostly up-to-date ( so there is no indication of its eminent demise thus giving Apple fewer Macs to address with its ARM ). So, while Apple *may* take the Mac to ARM, the question is when. The answer is when ARM is ready technically plus the other details need to be sorted out( Mac users who like to run Windows in Boot Camp is one, when licensing deals allow it and more ). October 1, 2016 at 8:49 EST PM DudeMac October 1, 2016 I would have to see Macs with ARM inside 🙂 October 1, 2016 at 9:22 EST PM DudeMac October 1, 2016 I would love to see Macs with ARM inside 🙂 October 1, 2016 at 9:23 EST PM BradMacPro October 2, 2016 Apple’s A series processors are approaching the performance of that which is used in the MacBook. So a future MacBook could use ARM, as Apple’s advances in performance are exceeding Intel’s jumps. It will be a few generations and years before we could see a Apple ARM derived design in a iMac and even longer before in a MacPro. All that being the case, more and more people are not seeking faster performance from their computers than what exists now, so Apple A series could catch up to that level. The switch from Intel based macOS based to Apple A series based Macs could be helped along with a system similar to the Rosetta system used up to Snow Leopard. October 2, 2016 at 12:06 EST AM geneking7320 October 2, 2016 How about the Macintosh retain Intel chips (until they are not profitable) and Apple introduces a new line of computers with ARM chips named after a different apple? October 2, 2016 at 12:27 EST AM John Martellaro October 2, 2016 You guys seem focused on a 1:1 replacement. I’m thinking about 8 or 16 modified A10s (16 or 32 high performance ARM cores) in a MacBook. Many more in a desktop. Good-bye quad core MBP, hello 32 cores. October 2, 2016 at 12:49 EST AM brilor October 2, 2016 The switch from Intel based macOS based to Apple A series based Macs could be helped along with a system similar to the Rosetta system used up to Snow Leopard. It will probably easier than that and it’s easy to imagine such a translator won’t be required because Apple already provides several layers of abstraction for AppKit and Foundation frameworks. Plus iOS( ARM ), already uses AppKit/Foundation, so many apps will rebuild with minor Xcode changes unless the developer is writing low-level, non-standard framework code. Even though a Mac ARM strategy is certainly possible, it isn’t clear to me if there is strong motivation to move away Intel. For all their delays, Intel probably offers Apple low prices given the volume of chips they purchase, plus they want to incent Apple’s purchase other Intel chips. Macs are only a small part of Apple’s business, and assuming they plan to keep producing Macs ( else why invest the time/money to change them to ARM ), only Apple knows if Mac ARM is justified at a business ( accounting ) level. I hope Apple starts building more innovative products with features we want but realize a large corporate public company maximizing profits and minimizing expenses ( consolidating CPU platforms is one such strategy along with the other synergies it confers ) is constrained. October 2, 2016 at 1:24 EST AM Paul Goodwin October 2, 2016 Not sure moving to ARM processors in Macs would be any less of a mistake than it was for Apple to move to the PowerPC. In the beginning there were all sorts of charts showing how technically the PPC chip development would far outstrip the Intel ones in speed and functionality. It never happened, and eventually the market was industrial embedded processing and about 1% of the computers sold as the Mac’s market share dwindled because of compatibility issues with the x86 world and limited software choices. There were some great PPC Macs, but eventually it proved to be a bad technical move. October 2, 2016 at 9:20 EST AM Scott B in DC October 2, 2016 To the vast majority, nobody cares what the hardware looks like inside the box. Only the geeks care. Most users only care that their computers work, that I can run their software, and that they won’t get any viruses. Other then the kicks the only community that would care are those with heavy computing needs, like the creative community. However, their needs are being satisfied with multicore high performance graphics cards. If most of the graphics and floating point computations are being handed off to these graphics subsystems, and what difference does it make if an ARM chip has flooding point or not. BTW, this is another back to the future moment. In years gone by, in the time of storage to put terminals which is equivalent to today’s web browser, floating point processors for separate from the CPU. The microprocessor industry championed the integrated processor chip. Now it’s being broken up again. Everything old is now new! October 2, 2016 at 10:33 EST AM GraphicMac October 2, 2016 All the numbered points (save for #1 and #2) made by the author shows a misunderstanding of the subject matter in some cases, assumes a whole lot incorrectly, are wildly speculative or are completely wrong. October 2, 2016 at 10:36 EST AM Wulfkind October 2, 2016 I think this line of thinking that Apple is eventually going to go ARM over Intel has further credence when one realizes that Intel announced this year they are getting out of the phone and tablet CPU business. Their ATOM line of CPU’s were cut down iCoresomething CPUs originally made for desktops and laptops and these CPU’s were being marketed and sold to device manufacturers from NAS designers to phone and table manufacturers. Particularly with the phone manufacturers Intel literally spent BILLIONS of dollars in rebates and cross-marketing in order to entice phone ODMs to start using Intel ATOM CPUs instead of ARM. It was a spectacular failure and Intel bowed out this year. Now Intel is trying to pitch what is left of the ATOM line ( they’ve killed that name BTW ) to ODM’s in the 2in1 Hybrid tablet/laptop space in the Windows world. So….just like the PowerPC alliance began to stagnate, particularly in the mobile space ( think Motorola PowerPC 4 ) and in the desktop space ( think IBM PowerPC 5 series CPUs ) Intel has stagnated and dropped out of the key mobile space where Apple is seeing the most innovation and revenue. Apple HATES not being seen as the most innovative in any aspect of their portfolio particularly when they feel they are being held back by a third party…..so….why not go “in-house” with their own home grown ARM based CPU? So….in my humble opinion…..you will see an ARM base Apple Air in the 2017-18 time frame, an entire mobile portfolio based on ARM in 2018-19 timeframe ( think Macbook, Air, iPad, iPod, Phone and Watch ) and in the 2019-2020 range you will see the first Apple desktop with an ARM cpu. October 2, 2016 at 2:22 EST PM brilor October 2, 2016 Scott B wrote: … the only community that would care are those with heavy computing needs, like the creative community There are lots of folks who purchased a Mac because they can run Windows applications natively ( i.e. without a VM ). They are just normal users and not necessarily the creative community. Apple would potentially lose these customers by switching to ARM. John M. wrote: I’m thinking about 8 or 16 modified A10s (16 or 32 high performance ARM cores) Good point but this would require major software changes( and many developers might be either reluctant or not skilled enough to implement – ( it is difficult even with GCD – Grand Central Dispatch ) because most applications run on a single core ( main queue in GCD ) and use only one core. Even some of Apple’s apps are written for a single ( main queue with the UI ) core. I’m not saying this isn’t solvable but it would be a problem today and it would be a major effort. Moreover, a solution would probably require a major investment by Apple and it’s not clear they have the will to do this.

October 2, 2016 at 4:51 EST PM JustCause October 2, 2016 Those of us that work in corporate jobs that require access to Windows running well (without a crappy Wintel PC) think this is a really, really bad idea. October 2, 2016 at 5:03 EST PM archimedes October 2, 2016 “Apple is the acknowledged expert in taking millions of customers though a major architecture change.” Not again! 🙁 As nice as ARM may be, it’s really convenient to be able to run Windows for games and apps that need it. One great thing about Windows is that customers haven’t had to go through these architectural switches, which are painful. As much as I prefer the Mac, I have to say that Windows definitely has better backward compatibility in terms of both software and hardware. October 2, 2016 at 7:43 EST PM archimedes October 2, 2016 p.s. I note that Microsoft has dabbled in other architectures such as MIPS, itanium, and ARM, but they never abandoned x86 the way Apple abandoned 68K and PPC. October 2, 2016 at 7:44 EST PM archimedes October 2, 2016 That being said, Apple could surprise us all with an A12 processor that had … x86 compatibility. I think it would be a mess, but it would be an interesting one. October 2, 2016 at 7:47 EST PM John C. Welch October 3, 2016 Virtual Machine hardware in the ARM CPUs and an instruction translator would still allow Mac users to run VMs with Intel-based OSes like Windows and Linux. From what we’ve seen, modern ARM CPUs have the horsepower to do that. Well then, you should be able to provide a fine list of real world devices that folks here can buy to test this out for themselves. You know, a nice laptop or desktop.

The likelihood Apple has written ( if they didn’t start it years ago it won’t be ready anytime soon ) and will embed it in an ARM CPU is very unlikely, both technically and at a business level, IMO and there is certainly no evidence to support such an endeavor. Nice fantasy though. October 3, 2016 at 11:14 EST AM Albatrossflyer October 3, 2016 let’s see…. a MacBook with an ARM processor makes it an iPad with a keyboard, which makes its a MS Surface.

Hi there, I’m a Braeburn…and I’m a PC October 3, 2016 at 2:55 EST PM iVoid October 3, 2016 If they get an ARM processor to be anywhere close to the performance of a decent Intel processor (i.e. not the processors in Airs or the MacBook Retina), then I might care. If Apple moves to ARM without getting their ARM processor performance drastically better, it’s not a viable option for me. October 3, 2016 at 3:09 EST PM Old UNIX Guy October 3, 2016 It doesn’t matter what CPU Apple puts in future Macs if they don’t reverse the downhill slide they’re on with the quality of their software. If it’s not iOS or watchOS they clearly don’t care. Switching to ARM CPUs isn’t going to help that. Dumping Craig Federighi and bringing back Betrand Serlet might (along with letting Jony Ive be the CDO for stores, $10K watches, and $100K cars ONLY)… October 3, 2016 at 3:10 EST PM Andrush October 4, 2016 Hey Guys,: Heavy duty hardware vendors are already building devices to put ARM chips into Data Centres: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/04/kaleao_kmax_armbased_server/ It’s only a matter of time. How much time? Who knows? Perhaps Apple? October 4, 2016 at 10:43 EST AM brilor October 4, 2016 @Old UNIX Guy: Agreed. @Andrush: True but Apple is about high profit margins which means squeezing standard vendors ( Intel, TSMC, AMD etc. ) for major price concessions. To secure price concessions, Apple avoids vendors selling items they won’t discount because they aren’t made is mass quantities. Virtually all knowledgeable folks agree it’s technically possible but a lot of factors suggest it won’t happen anytime soon ( read prior posts for some ideas ). Brian October 4, 2016 at 1:28 EST PM Macsee October 12, 2016 iOS is a jailed limited toy. Mac is a full computer. Intel x86 compatibility is a must. Or else, switch to Windows. A shame for all.

ADVERTISEMENT "I have no doubt [this is Russia]," Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffLawmakers introduce bills to ban National Guard bonus clawbacks Priebus defends Trump pick: 'That's not the Steve Bannon I know' Lawmakers, pundits react to Bannon, Priebus White House roles MORE (D-Calif.) said on ABC's "This Week." "And I don't think the administration has any doubt. It's not a question of evidence. It is a question, I think for the administration is, do they do more than name and shame?" Schiff said the Russians respect one thing: strength. "If they see an open door, that's an invitation to do more," Schiff said. "I think we ought to begin naming and shaming them and work with our allies around the world who also have been hacked and interfered with by the Russians." He said he would encourage states to reach out to the Department of Homeland Security to learn about how to protect themselves. "They won't be able to change the outcome," Schiff said, regarding the Russians' hacking attempts. "What really worries me, what keeps me up at night is what they have done in Europe — which is the manipulation of the data." Schiff said manipulating data could be "election altering." He also said the Americans see the meddling, and he appeared to urge the administration to be up-front about what it knows regarding Russia's hacking attempts. "I think it'd be far worse if there is a problem with the election and only after the election does the administration tell the American people: 'Yes, the Russians were doing this and we knew it all along,'" Schiff said. Schiff and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) last week released a statement accusing Russia of trying to influence the presidential election. "At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election — we can see no other rationale for the behavior of the Russians,” they said in statement, citing briefings they have received. Buzzfeed reported that the White House tried to delay the release of the statement.

"It could be Russia, but it could also be China," Trump said during the first presidential debate of 2016. "It could also be lots of other people.

GPUToaster™'s Blog The Technology Box Office!! FAQs 1. What the heck is a GPU? GPU or Graphics Processing Unit (also known as Graphics Card) is a specialized microprocessor that offloads the CPU and accelerates 2D/3D processing. The processor is integrated in a separate package/board which requires a PCI/PCIe slots/expansion slots.  They can be found in various embedded systems, mobile phones, PC’s, workstations and Gaming console. On the contrary current Intel Sandy Bridge/Ivy Bridge/ Haswell and Future Architectures, GPU’s have been integrated in the same CPU package making it a Unique single CPU and GPU microprocessor. But note that even though they are in same package or board, they operate independently. GPU’s are very efficient in processing complex mathematics and manipulating pixels due to their massively parallel architectures. The performance boost of executing a complex algorithm on a GPU is due to the massive number of FPUs or the Floating Point Units (responsible for carrying out operations decimal and fractions of integers, part of ALU) present. Explaining more on this is beyond the scope of FAQs. Please use search engines to know more. 2. Why your alias is GPUToaster and what does it mean? Well, if you separate GPU from Toaster, it means that toasting a GPU.😀 LOLS….It means stressing a GPU so that it becomes so hot that holding its own ground becomes a challenge for it. I do of course take care of my card. The same is achieved by OC’ing (Overclocking). OC is a technique of manipulating hardware clocks to gain extra performance out of it. It involves increasing the chip voltage by minor values which is internally handled by the OC Software and hardware drivers. Do remember that OC’ing may damage your card PERMANENTLY/reduce chipset life-time if not OC’ed properly. I personally do not recommend OC’ing for normal gamers. Please consult or ask an expert before trying it on your system. 3. Ok, You got what an OC is. But why do you OC when you know it decreases the hardware life? That’s a good question. OC does reduce your hardware life. Sometimes I do OC (sometimes playing games) during some R&D based work which demand lots of mathematical calculations per second. Or Sometimes you require to check the power of your present hardware. The configuration I have is now actually outdated. You can imagine how sometimes it is exciting experiencing and achieving performance on low-end hardware’s. OC’ing seems good at certain level. Do take care when OC’ng and don’t say I didn’t warn you.🙂 4. I don’t seem to understand the stuff you blog here. I completely agree that. There are most of the stuffs that will go/would have gone beyond your understanding. The stuff I post here are mostly real-time 3D related and are different from what the most of the visitors expected. If any topic interests you, you are free to explore them more. Gaining knowledge doesn’t harm you see! 5. Why are most of the blog posts related to 3D and graphics? I’ll precede with a disclaimer before answering this question. “Whatever I write hereon shouldn’t be made controversial.” Firstly, working and getting involved in 3D fascinates me a lot. The way the real-life is simulated in a virtual world using hardware technologies is really appreciating and challenging. It also teaches you how in real-life certain effects are reproduced, using some mathematical expressions. Plus the nature and depth of R&D in this particular domain is infinite. Secondly, this particular domain will never die or will never face depreciation though it might face some slow development in future. I’m making this statement on the basis of current trend and statistics. Thirdly, I don’t find web development, designing etc. that challenging because most of the Web process used in industries are service oriented, on the other hand 3D real-time rendering is totally R&D oriented? (No offense!) 6. How often the blog updates? Difficult to answer but you may want to check it once a day for any newer updates. Try hitting the site once in the evening. If you want to keep yourself updated, kindly subscribe to this blog and each time GPUToaster updates will be directly posted to your email account. Optionally, you can use and RSS feed software as mentioned in the later FAQs. 7. I see only posts, so how do I comment, if I want to? When you open the blog, you’ll only notice the updates. After each update you’ll find a link for “Leave comments”. Click on the link and submit your comment by providing your name and email id, optionally your home site. Your credentials are safe with wordpress.com and won’t be exposed to any one unless your consent is taken. 8. What does rating means? Is it necessary to do so? Rating is rating. You can rate a post depending on your taste. The rating system is not sophisticated, self-explanatory and is open to all. If you like the posts then please do consider and take your precious little time and a mouse click to rate them. Your rating will help me improve the stuffs I post. 9. The contact info on the “About” page seems invalid? Nice Catch!! You may notice a peculiar thing that a ‘.’ is written as DOT and @ written as AT. The main reason is to prevent SPAM. There are numerous smart and trendy SPYBOTS floating over the net. These bots scan every page and extract email ids for spamming. This method is preventive and passively reduces bot attacks. Do note that this is not a full proof method. 10. I see fewer tutorials and other contents more! Primarily, I decided to post only tutorials on this blog. I had also planned the topics for them. My aim was to present tutorials that is understood even by an amateur programmer. Designing such tutorials was taking time, rate of blogging had reduced and I finally decided to include some interesting topics. Meanwhile I prepared some tutorials and posted. By the way don’t worry, more tutorials are on their way and will hit the blog soon. The delay has introduced as I have to manage both blogging life and professional life as you see both are equally important. I appreciate your patience. 11. There are many such sites like yours, why should I take RSS feed from you? Again, it comes to personal liking. I do not force but recommend visitors to take the RSS feeds. If you like any other blog then that’s completely fine. The contents you find here are as well readily available on the internet sea. But if you find here something interesting then please do spread the word.[Update]There is a new RSS feed icon, you can use it to take regular feeds from GPUToaster’s blog if you wish to. For new users you can use a free desktop RSS reader at http://www.feeddemon.com/ 12. I have posted a legitimate comment but it requires moderation? Why a comment would need moderation?

Removed from my favorites This Tech Projected Models' Stress Levels At Paris Fashion Week Begin Photo: Courtesy of Intel Corporation. SHARE IT comments See All Slides Oct 2, 2016 12:30 PM Ally Hickson Wearable technology just took a Paris runway by storm. Designer Hussein Chalayan partnered with Intel to bring wearable tech to his spring/summer 2017 fashion week show. Five models walked the runway alongside visual projections that showed their stress levels on the walls. All of it was made possible by vital information sent through the wearable tech they sported on the runway. Intel has previously partnered with Opening Ceremony and Oakley. Chalayan is no stranger to experimenting with how his clothing can engage with technology. In the past, he's created looks that changed shape with the use microchips and animatronics, made dresses embedded with LEDs, and once created a coffee table that turned into a skirt. The goal of the show, according to Intel, was to "illustrate the potential of future integrations of fashion and technology by bringing innovative concepts and aspirations to life."

October Should Be Very Exciting For Linux Enthusiasts Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 2 October 2016 at 10:02 AM EDT. 7 Comments While September was very exciting for Linux users, October is looking to be even more exciting with several open-source/Linux milestones expected before month's end. Among the excitement to look forward to this month includes: Linux 4.8 - This latest stable Linux kernel should be formally released today. Linux 4.9 Merge Window - As soon as Linux 4.8 is out, the two-week merge window for Linux 4.9 will open up. We've already covered some of the changes for some of the Linux 4.9 work while stay tuned to Phoronix for daily coverage of other interesting material for this next kernel version. Next Mesa Release - We should see a big release of Mesa due before month's end. This version will likely be called Mesa 13.0 and features complete OpenGL 4.4 for Intel and the Radeon/NVC0 drivers are also nearly at OpenGL 4.5. The Intel Mesa driver has all OpenGL 4.5 extensions wired in but it doesn't yet officially expose "OpenGL 4.5" until formal compliance is ensured. Potential Merging Of RADV - Related to the Mesa 13.0 release, the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver merging to mainline Mesa may be imminent. There's been a call to get this open-source Radeon Vulkan driver merged in time for this next release. Ubuntu 16.10 - Ubuntu 16.10 is being released in less than two weeks for those interested in the Yakkety Yak. X.Org Server 1.19 - X.Org Server 1.19 is expected to debut this month with threaded input support, better XWayland, improvements to GLAMOR 2D acceleration, and more. Fedora 25 Getting Buttoned Up For Release - Development on Fedora 25 will be finishing up for its debut in mid-November. Fedora 25 may end up being the first tier-one Linux distribution shipping with Wayland by default. GNOME 3.24 Development Heating Up - With GNOME 3.22 out the door, GNOME 3.24 development is heating up. GTK will be merging the GTK Scene Kit this cycle, continued Wayland improvements are expected, and other Linux desktop improvements. KDE Plasma 5.8 - Plasma 5.8 is expected to be released this week with many improvements and will be the first Long-Term Support release of Plasma 5. Anything else to get excited about this month?

The quest turns the very first gun obtained by Guardians into an Exotic Weapon and comes with several poignant moments with the player’s Ghost. The Khvostov 7G-OX is the most configurable weapon yet in Destiny. Players will have the option to choose between the Auto Rifle, Pulse Rifle, and Scout Rifle archetypes while also choosing its rate of fire. Step 1: Obtain the Khvostov 7G-OX Schematic There are two ways to get the Khvostov 7G-OX Schematic. This first is by dismantling the original Khvostov Auto Rifle you received when you first started your character. That may have required some foresight or the willingness to start a new character just to obtain the weapon. The second way is by picking up a Splicer Intel Relay that is dropped by Broodmother Wizards in the Plaguelands Patrol. They spawn regularly in the Lord’s Watch zone where you spawn in Patrol, which make it easy to pick up one. Now head back to the wall breach zone where your character first starts Destiny. Spawn in at Lord’s Watch and go from Foundry 113 to Rocket Yard to The Divide and The Breach. You’ll come across a door barred by lasers as you make your way back toward the outside of the wall. This is where you’ll need to use the Splicer Intel Relay to continue. Use a Splicer Key on this door to get to the Khvostov 7G-OX Schematic. [Image via Destiny] Once the door is opened, continue outside the wall and you’ll see a Fallen Ketch at the top of the hill where your Guardian spawned the very first time. Make your way onto the Ketch and kill everything. Once all the minions are dead, a chest will spawn in the corner containing the Khvostov 7G-OX Schematic. Head to the Fallen Ketch and kill everything. [Image via Destiny] This chest will spawn once all Fallen are killed. [Image via Destiny] Step 2: Take the Khvostov 7G-OX Schematic to Shiro in Felwinter’s Peak Go to the Felwinter’s Peak social area and visit Shiro. He’ll take the schematic from you and give you a new quest to complete. Step 3: Start the ‘We Found a Rifle’ Quest There are two parts to the first half of the “We Found a Rifle” quest. Both involve visiting the Plaguelands Patrol once more. Collect 10 Manual Pages for Khvostov 7G-OX – These are simply collected by killing Fallen and Hive anywhere on the Plaguelands Patrol. It can also be done in the Archon’s Forge for those that want to try to get as much done as once. Alternatively, most if not all can be collected while collecting the other set of items needed. Collect 3 Weapon Parts for Khvostov 7G-OX – While in the Plaguelands Patrol, you’ll want to go almost to the original starting point for the Cosmodrome Patrol. Turn right from when you spawn in the Plaguelands and make your way through the Foundry 113, to the Rocketyards, then the Divide, and finally to Dock 13 as your starting point. Tip: The weapon parts are easily marked by the triangular shaped item icons while roaming around. It will pop up automatically when you are near or you can aim down the sights of your weapon when you are not near but in the same zone. Weapon Part 1 is located underneath the stairs that going the main room in Dock 13 to The Steppes. [Image via Destiny] Weapon Part 2 can be found by going back to the Rocketyards and then following the same path as the Devil’s Lair Strike. Once you reach the Refinery, go through the door that Ghost unlocks during the Strike. This Weapon Part can be found on the wall on the right. [Image via Destiny] Weapon Part 3 is located in the Blast where you fight the Devil Walker tank during the Devil’s Lair Strike. It is located on the side of the building that is immediately ahead of where you enter the zone. [Image via Destiny] Step 4: Complete the mission A Khvostov Rising This is a straightforward mission in the Plaguelands that takes you through familiar ground, but also has a particularly tough boss. Players will need to hunt down and kill the Splicer Captain, Kaviss, to obtain the final part needed for the Khvostov 7G-OX. You’ll first encounter him in The Divide. He’s got a tough Void Shield and will move around quickly. A strong Void Heavy Weapon and/or Special Weapon will greatly help along with using your Guardian’s offensive Super abilities to whittle his health down. He will retreat once his health gets low. The mission will continue to The Breach with the path blocked by SIVA Clouds and Trip Mines that will need to be avoided and destroyed. The final battle will take place inside the broad alley inside the wall. Kaviss will be protected by a pair of Servitors and a host of Fallen Splicers dropping in from Skiffs. Work your way through the minions while avoiding fire from the Skiff and then concentrate on Kaviss when things are clear. This cycle will repeat until his health is completely drained and the Splicer Captain is killed. He will drop an Exotic Engram that grants you the Khvostov 7G-OX. Make sure you have a free spot in your Primary Weapon grid and then go kill more minons with the weapon to complete the mission and get a touching moment with Ghost. Afterwards, go speak with Shiro at Felwinter’s Peak one last time to close out the quest.

We Might Never See A New OpenGL Version, At Least Not For A Long Time Written by Michael Larabel in Standards on 1 October 2016 at 08:58 AM EDT. 39 Comments During past Khronos press briefings about OpenGL/Vulkan and in other communications, while Vulkan is the organization's big graphics API focus, it was implied during these conversations that OpenGL would continue to march to its own beat and evolve as needed. While OpenGL continues to be significantly used by cross-platform graphics application/game developers, it turns out there might not be a new official version for a long time - if ever. OpenGL 4.5 was released in August of 2014 while there was the "OpenGL 2015" updates last year and this summer we just had the 2016 update that just introduced ARB_gl_spirv. There's been nothing definitive about any OpenGL 4.6 or OpenGL 5.0 update while OpenGL continues to be widely-used and is also the basis for OpenGL ES, WebGL, etc. In the discussions about the next Mesa release and what to do about versioning, it was brought up how to handle Mesa version numbers when they reach OpenGL 4.5. Well, Mesa major version bumps will then probably be tied to Vulkan version bumps. But the interesting remark prompting this story was this comment by Intel developer Ian Romanick, "There is a distinct possibility (spoiler alert) that there won't be any new OpenGL version for a long time, if ever." Ian's comments about OpenGL carry a fair amount of weight considering he's one of their main OpenGL Linux driver developers but more importantly is Intel's representative to the Khronos Board. He's long been involved with OpenGL and liaising with Khronos. But do keep in mind this wasn't any official announcement and he wasn't making any official proclamation on the behalf of Intel nor Khronos but rather remarks on a developers' list. Intel developer Jason Ekstrand also commented on the same thread about the likelihood of seeing a new OpenGL or OpenGL ES version, "we just turned on [OpenGL ES] 3.2 and ES is about as likely to get a 3.3 as desktop is to get 4.6." So if it's indeed accurate that there won't be a new OpenGL version for a long time, if ever, that's fairly interesting and somewhat differing from what was implied in past briefings that OpenGL would continue to evolve on its own. Presumably that means then they'll just continue with their routine extension roll-outs when warranted for new GL functionality and not proclaim any new version, but I'll be seeking more information about any new OpenGL master plan during the next Khronos briefing. 39 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 2, 2016 at 3:11PM Many growth investors like tech stocks because they occasionally generate market-crushing gains within just a few years. Over the past decade, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)rallied nearly 2,500%, while Baidu -- the biggest search engine in China -- surged nearly 2,000%. Image source: Pixabay. Those gains look explosive, but many other tech stocks also bombed during those 10 years. Therefore, investors who are interested in this sector should remember five simple tips before buying their first tech stocks. 1. Understand what the company does The tech sector is filled with companies that promote "hot" technologies. However, investors often buy shares of these companies on an analyst recommendation without really understanding what they sell. As Warren Buffett famously said, "Never invest in a business you cannot understand." That's why Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is such a popular tech stock among both mainstream and institutional investors. Its business is easy to understand -- most of its revenue comes from its three hardware product lines (iPhone, iPad, Mac), but it's gradually pivoting toward paid services (Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple Care) to reduce its dependence on hardware. Other companies have hidden strengths. Amazon is generally known as an e-commerce site, but its most profitable business is actually AWS (Amazon Web Services), the largest cloud platform in the world. The profits from that business offset the much lower margins at its marketplace business. 2. Look for market leaders When I invest in tech stocks, I generally look for "best-in-breed" market leaders. These leaders usually have strong pricing power, stable margins, and the ability to exploit economies of scale and bundling strategies to marginalize smaller rivals. Amazon exhibits all these qualities in both the e-commerce and cloud markets. Cisco has the same strengths in the networking equipment market, while Salesforce has similar advantages in the cloud-based customer relationship management market. 3. Always look forward The worst mistake a tech company can make is falling behind the tech curve. Yet larger tech companies often fall behind because they focus more on quarterly growth, dividends, or buybacks than boosting their research and development budgets. Market leaders, their egos boosted by temporary glory, also sometimes prematurely dismiss disruptive threats. Image source: Pixabay. That's precisely what happened to BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY), which controlled a fifth of the smartphone market seven years ago. After its market share plunged to nearly 0%, it decided to stop producing its own smartphones in late September. The same can be said about Intel, which surrendered the mobile chip market to Softbank's ARM Holdings' licensees, and Microsoft, which ceded the mobile OS market to Apple and Alphabet's Google. If a tech company stops innovating and simply follows market trends, its high growth days might be over. That's what might be happening with Apple, which is pursuing "hot" markets like smartwatches and streaming music instead of launching new game-changing devices like the iPod and iPhone. 4. Understand the valuations Investors often pay big premiums for high-growth tech stocks, but these stocks can be solid investments if their valuations are supported by comparable earnings growth. Amazon, for example, trades at 79 times forward earnings, but is expected to deliver earnings growth of 80% next year.  However, these valuations can be tricky if a company posts explosive sales growth with widening losses. In these cases, investors should check the company's cash position and free cash flow to better analyze the health of the business. 5. Don't ignore "old tech" Many investors focus on the sexy high-growth tech stocks, but they should remember that slow growers like Cisco, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM are still great sources of stable income. These companies also buy back lots of stock, regularly raise their dividends, and trade at much lower multiples than higher-flying tech darlings -- making them ideal core holdings for your portfolio. The key takeaway The tech sector might seem overwhelming at first, but it all comes down to buying what you understand, identifying the market leaders and disruptors, and understanding their valuations. Investors who tick off these boxes while doing their due diligence might find some solid tech stocks to hold for the long run.

By Hadlee Simons on 29 September, 2016 It’s tough to find decent Windows laptop/tablet hybrids at the sub-R5000 price point, but TCL’s new Alcatel device might just pack the goods. At a suggested price of R3559, you get a budget-minded Intel Cherry Trail X5 processor (T3 Z8350), 2GB of RAM, 10.1-inch 1280×800 display, dual front speakers and 32GB of expandable storage. In the camera department, we’ve got a 5MP main camera and a 2MP shooter with flash for video calling and selfies. However, TCL has also spiced things up with the addition of a keyboard dock, featuring an extra 2580mAh battery over and above the tablet’s 5830mAh pack. The keyboard dock comes equipped with LTE hotspot capabilities and USB/microUSB/microHDMI ports. The Alcatel Plus 10 offers a decent experience for the price – at least on paper Looking to get your hands on this device? There’s only one outlet stocking them at the moment. “The Alcatel Plus 10, 2-in-1 LTE device is available in silver from Vodacom at the recommended retail price of R3559.00. Alcatel Plus 10 is also available with a free 1 Year Office 365 licence for R329 pm x 36 on 5GB Data Price Plan or R429 pm x 36 on 10GB Data Price Plan,” the company wrote in a press statement. In other words, it won’t hold a candle to high-end convertibles from the likes of Asus and Lenovo. But it’s not supposed to. The Plus 10 is aimed squarely at the sub-R5000 market, going toe-to-toe against the likes of the Nextbook range and other cheap hybrid devices.

Between ever-increasing internet connectivity and the breakdown of the console upgrade cycle, cloud gaming is likely to make it big sooner than we’d expected. Posted By Arjun Krishna Lal | On 01st, Oct. 2016 Under Article, Graphics Analysis Tweet +1 Like Share Reddit "C"loud, the final frontier. Over the past few years, we’ve encountered plenty of innovation and advancement in terms of how we engage with games. While motion controls are still not exactly mainstream, the Wii popularized that concept ten years ago, and today’s Steam Controller features gyro aim that’s far from gimmicky. VR’s finally become something of a mainstream proposition. While we’re yet to see the Rift and Vive go the way of the 90’s VR craze, significant content is being produced for a change. 4K and HDR are taking us a step closer to that somewhat far-off point of time when the monitor reaches its logical endpoint, as a window into the outside that’s indistinguishable from the real thing. Sony and Microsoft’s decision to out the PS4 Pro and Project Scorpio has completely changed the way we look at gaming consoles. The hardware is no longer fixed: as with mobile, the new model centres on iteration. The downside to this is that there is no longer any guarantee against your hardware becoming obsolete: your console no longer becomes that comfortable 5-year investment you’d expected it to be. Games are no longer tied down to platforms because the platforms themselves are no longer fixed. Take Microsoft’s repositioning of the Xbox brand, for example. A decade ago, an Xbox was an Xbox: a (physical) Microsoft-designed home console box that you’d set in your living room and hook up to your TV. There was no talk about phones or Crossplay or Continuum. An Xbox was an Xbox, simple as that. But what does the cloud mean for the Xbox? Today, Xbox is nearly everything it possibly could be apart from the Xbox One, and this leads us to an interesting proposition: What if we were to fully de-tether the brand from the platform? What if Xbox meant games which didn’t have to run on a fixed hardware platform like the Xbox One or Project Scorpio? What if you could play Halo 5 on your phone, on the way to work? Cloud gaming is the logical next step forward. The upsides are obvious: AAA games have always been constrained by the need to run on fixed hardware—namely whatever consoles are current at that point of time. The seventh gen gave us some remarkable titles, but at the end of the day, seventh gen games had to be able to run respectably on GPUs that were within the performance profile of Intel’s HD 4000 iGPU. The infamous spate of “downgrades” in eighth-gen titles, from Watch Dogs to The Witcher 3, to The Division only serves to underline this point: when you’re dealing with fixed hardware you have a (very) limited rendering budget. In the case of the Xbox One, this limitation prevents the console from running most AAA games acceptably at 1080p. Compromise is the only way to make a game that will work on the fixed hardware that most of your customer base will be on. Cloud streaming solutions, on the other hand, augment or get rid of the weakest link—fixed hardware. Instead of individual users with relatively weak local hardware, firms with the capital can invest in massive server grids with virtually unlimited amounts of rendering power on tap and offer games as a subscription service—something they’d make far more money off of in the long term than a fixed hardware purchase every couple of years. This is a market that Nvidia’s been trying to tap into for quite some time now with their Geforce Now service running on Nvidia GRID servers. In the “console” space (although that word starts to lose meaning when the brand’s decoupled from hardware), Sony’s PlayStation Now service is a strong portent of what’s to come next: while, currently, only PS3 titles are on offer, PlayStation Now users have access to over 400 titles at $20 a month. All that’s needed is hardware capable of streaming HD video—anything from a smartphone on up, and this is what’s truly remarkable about the cloud: your laptop becomes a PS3.  Your phone becomes a PS3.  Could this model work for Microsoft? The Xbox 360 has a  great catalogue of exclusives: support for backwards compatibility on the Xbox One goes to show that there is a market for people who want to continue exploring seventh-gen titles. But a cloud-enabled service would mean that any piece of hardware you own–and not just the Xbox One or Scorpio could run a wide selection of titles. While an Xbox cloud-streaming service is pure speculation, the innovative physics implementation in Crackdown 3, leveraging the power of Microsoft’s Azure servers is a strong signal that Redmond isn’t standing idle. Microsoft’s gambit with the Xbox brand, however, seems to be broader in reach than just game streaming. With Xbox Crossplay, UWP (Universal Windows Apps), and Continuum, Microsoft is already offering a consistent, platform-agnostic Windows experience. With Project Scorpio, Microsoft appears to be taking somewhat of a conservative stance: Based on specs, this is a very powerful local system, built from the ground up to power high-quality local experiences. It’s quite likely to be large and noisy. Microsoft’s cageyness about cloud gaming, at least as far as the Scorpio is concerned is understandable: Cloud gaming require access to unlimited,high-bandwidth internet connectivity, and even today, that’s somewhat of a rarity. But considering the maturity of their Azure platform, and the exciting partnership between Nvidia and Microsoft to leverage Nvidia GRID graphics tech, a cloud-enabled Xbox streaming service is something Microsoft could make happen whenever it needs to. Although Crackdown 3 is the only game to do so, any Xbox game can take advantage of Azure to offload graphics, physics, AI, and more. Microsoft’s approach, dubbed Kahawai, uses “collaborative rendering” to split the work between the local hardware and the cloud server. Because some of the rendering is being locally, this drastically cuts down on bandwidth requirements. While Kahawai is currently deployed for mobile, we wouldn’t be surprised to see it in action in Xbox games going ahead. This could have major implications for Xbox titles further down the line. With both Sony and Microsoft moving away from the conventional console cycle, it may well be possible that the Xbox Scorpio is the last or second-to-last Microsoft console. What would a post-Xbox console world look like? We see it as something akin to what Microsoft has done with “Windows as a service.” Windows 10 is iterative, with each build adding or removing features on the basis of feedback. Based on preliminary specs, the Scorpio is reasonably powerful for a 2017 machine. While there may be a further hardware iteration, we think that gradual cloud integration is the path Xbox will take: Crackdown 3 is the first step in that direction, making up for the Xbox One’s CPU deficit by offloading physics calculations to the cloud. As titles start to push the limits of what the Scorpio can do at 4K, upscaling would definitely be an option, but if developers further tap into Azure–graphics rendering may also be progressively offloaded to the cloud, and at a point where it becomes commercially viable, we’d likely see that fabled Xbox cloud streaming service.

Crackdown already looked amazing with the normal XB1. I can’t even imagine how it would explode with Scorpio’s power… efnet I thought it did anyway, man I’m just ready to see what the console looks like … We got to link up someday on Xbox live Jeremiah Locanas My only assumption is it will have an internal power supply and a 4K Blu Ray Player, plus I think it will be closer to the original XB1 in size b/c of the fan to cool the 6TF. The PS4Pro has a huge box also compared to the PS4. My XBL is: jablocanas – what’s yours? I don’t play many online games though, I picked up Battlefield 1 and Titanfall though b/c I’m pretty good at both. I get thrashed at Halo and CoD, lol… efnet Xbl: imsochill osg You already know I got pretty much everything . As far as the Scorpio go though I’m just waiting for them to show it . Jeremiah Locanas Cool, added! Yeah, same here, hopefully it will look nice. Jeremiah Locanas Hey dude, q for ya: do you have an elite controller? Is it worth the price? Got a coupon from Best Buy for rewards and trying to find out if it’s really worth it, or just expensive efnet Yea I do have one. Its worth it if you’re a competitive gamer, the controller give you the options of remapping your crucial buttons and options for taller or shorter thumb sticks which are great for shooters. I woil Jeremiah Locanas I’m not really competitive but I do like to win. I like the idea of triggers being easier to use b/c you’re not pressing all the way down. I also like the quality aspect as I’ve gone through 4 xb1 controllers this gen already :/ luckily the last 3 were all returnable to MSFT via warranty but it’s been borderline ridiculous… Jeremiah Locanas Thanks also! crazy_black_man- The cloud again? Oh gee whiz. The hilariousness continuous at Gamingbolt. kma99 You must hit refresh on your smart phone. I swear you just wait for every article to post crazy_black_man- You must hit the “hard reset” on your Xbox One. I swear you’re an idiot to even come here at all kma99 I swear most people have better things to do in a days time other than troll web sites all dat. You wouldn’t know about that would you? And stop pretending to be a black guy you nutcase. crazy_black_man- I swear most people have better things to do in a days time other than troll web sites complaining about what others post all day. You wouldn’t know about that would you? And stop pretending you’re not an idiot. kma99 White guy pretending to be black. Epitome of idiot. Match.com might help with that loneliness crazy_black_man- How did my race ever become a part of this discussion on the cloud helping to boost the power of Scorpio? You have no way of verifying my ethnicity, or how it affects my criticisms of the content in this article, but I on the other hand, CAN confirm beyond all doubt that it is an indisputable fact that, yes,… https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c577d78e10700095e9b8fd2e0773b685aa9224c761bf5be862c5c1c535bf43f.jpg YOU ARE AN IDIOT. kma99 How did you acting like a clown benefit this article. A smart man would somply ignore something he didnt like or read it and keep it moving if he cant add anything of value to it. Idiots sit on their computer all day and complain like a teenage girl about trivial stuff. That seems to be you moniker so i assume you’re the idiot. P.S. you’re still not black crazy_black_man- LOL. I’m getting you. It’s fairly obvious. “A smart man would somply ignore something he didnt like or read it and keep it moving”. The truth about what I say is getting under your skin. The evidence of that truth? “A smart man would somply ignore something he didnt like or read it and keep it moving”. You’re not a smart man are you? The evidence? You’re sitting continuously crying like a little b i t c h about what an actual smart man is saying about all this “power of the cloud” nonsense. Hilariousness! I love it! kma99 Microsoft is getting to you lol. You’re on here 24/7 complaining. I simply laugh at an idiot who can’t simply walk away. Ps you’re still not black crazy_black_man- LOL. Classic cop out reply. The agony of defeat. I’m sure you’re used to by now. kma99 No cop out. Any Microsoft article you are thr first to post, that’s facts. Ps you’re still not black crazy_black_man- Just out of curiosity. Had you commented on this article before I did, what would you have said? I mean, are you sure you don’t come to these articles just to see me? Would you like me to send you a naked picture of my hairy black a s s so you can wake up first thing in the morning and kiss it everyday? I can do that if you’d like. kma99 I wouldn’t have commented because i dont see the relevance intil we actual get some proof that Microsoft can pull it off. If and when they get proven to be liars or people of their word then i woule feel thr need to comment not complain. You on thr other hand get all in your hemotions anytime Microsoft is mentioned. Ps you’re still not black crazy_black_man- You’re saying they haven’t proven anything to you, so you won’t connent, but yet MY opinion still offends you because I did comment. I may not be able to prove my ethnicity or why it matters in Gamingbolt, but you’re STILL continuously proving how much of an idiot you are, every time you show up here. kma99 Your opinion is simply your opinion and there is nothing wrong with that. The problem is you always assert your negative opinion on anything Microsoft and thats borderline stupidity. You cant seem to leave well enough alone. If this was consistent between sony and Microsoft then i would simply assume u just hated life but u dont u praise one and down the other. I dont hate or love either company i support them both the same even though im partial to sega. crazy_black_man- Dude, I couldn’t give a sh*t about who you love and who you hate, and you should be adult enough to do the same about others. Go to a Sony article for the next six months and show all the Sony hate you want, and watch me NOT b i t c h and complain about your valid opinion as a consumer to feel the way you do, and try to silence that opinion from being heard. These are consumer products just like any other consumer product. Why are you crying like a b i t c h about someone else’s right to state their opinion on a consumer product, fanboy? kma99 What would be the point in doing that? To act as childish as you are now, that’s stupid. Like i said earlier why dont u go find a relationship to occupy your time and stop crying on message boards. Ps you’re still not black crazy_black_man- LOL. Still crying like a b i t c h. What’s stupid and childish is you still crying like a b i t c h. kma99 Nothing to cry over. Im not mad at Microsoft but u r lol. crazy_black_man- Oh, there’s no doubt in anyone’s mind how mad you are. That fact that you’ve just spent the afternoon crying like a b i t c h just proves how mad you are. Its good to know I can control your emotions like this. Thanks for letting me in. Hilariousness! kma99 Believe what you want but your emotional right now. Lol time to change your pads i presume. There is a singer named Carl Thomas who has a song called emotional that might help relax that fragile brain of yours. crazy_black_man- LOL. Wow. That comment was very telling. Is that what you listen to when your this upset? How sad. Listen son, in all seriousness, it’s just videogames. Please don’t hurt yourself today. I really wouldn’t want that for you. Ok? Can you promise me that? kma99 No its telling because im telling you how to resolve this anger issue u have with Microsoft. They have you raging even on holidays lol. crazy_black_man- Ok, we’ll go with that narrative. I’m ok with that. Im more concerned about you right now. I should show more sensitivity and I’ll have to work on that. You kids are under a lot of stress these days, confused about what gender bathroom to use and all that kinda stuff that my generation never had to deal with. I’m sorry little guy. kma99 Dont be concerned with me im mentally stable. Matter of fact i will come back to make you rage later, i have real life stuff to do. You will probably start responding to yourself and upvoting your comments again. crazy_black_man- Ok son. That’s good to hear. I’m so relieved. Please have a fun day today with your two dads. kma99 2 dads, aint you the comedian. Ps they both are still blacker than you. crazy_black_man- LOL. Good return! sazse007 He is probably paid to do this. Learned Handgun I seriously hope he is. Kma999 is right. This guy literally posts negative stuff on every Xbox article, has multiple accounts to do so, and pretends to be different people. It had to be either paid or loneliness turned mental disorder Mike E. LOL… no doubt. I had a good laugh reading this. Anyone interested in a real gaming experience won’t touch streaming services. Can you say input latency? Sheesh… Michael Ponyisms…lol….reminds me of that thing they called cell that sony had to sell…lol bewareofZ You mean the chip that helped the PS3 turn a 10 million sales deficit into a win. lol efnet 1 more year… The wait will be a long one. Riggybro It doesn’t matter PSnow OR MS cloud… both signal the same thing the end of an oversized plastic box under your TV or monitor. By all means, please buy the latest (and future) version of XB and PS. They want your money and are not going to tell you otherwise. But just get ready for a future of streaming and subscription. It’s coming… Mr Xrat Is it 2013 again? “Buy an Xbone to watch movies!” “Power of the cloud will fix the Xbox’s deficiencies!” “Just wait for E3/the holidays!” Sandrasloveland4 Google is paying 97$ per hour!

The Scorpio will be the most powerful computational device on the planet thanks to the cloud. This author is a genius. wombat “The Cloud” lol, you guys. PrideLand I hate subscriptions. If you do the simple math to find out how much you pay per month, it is a horrible cost model for the consumer.

Study finds pizza motivates people more than money!TNN | Oct 2, 2016, 01.00 AM IST Hey boss, how ’bout a pizza? Why Is This Important? Because everyone loves pizza. Long Story Short When given the option of free pizza, a cash bonus or praise from the boss, workers in a factory were most productive when offered the ’za, according to a new study. Long Story Have you ever been motivated to get all your work done as quickly as possible because you know a hot, gooey, slice of pizza is waiting for you at home? Well, you can thank the ’za. Dan Ariely, author of the upcoming book, Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shapes Our Motivations, recounts a study where workers in an Intel semiconductor factory in Israel were offered different awards based on how many computer chips they churned out in a day, as reported by New York Magazine. One group was told they’d get a cash bonus of 100 Israeli shekels (about $30) if they increase their productivity, another said they’d get congratulations from the boss (a ‘Well done!’ text message) and a third group was offered a coupon for a free pizza. One final group wasn’t offered anything – they were the control group. After the first day, one of the groups increased productivity by 6.7% – yep, you guessed it, that was the pizza group. Coming in a close second was the group offered praise. The money group, on the other hand, only increased production by 4.9% on the first day. Still, not bad. But a day later, it was clear which motivator was the best. By the second day, those offered the cash bonus were 13.2% less productive than the group not given any bonuses. Of the entirety of the study, those with the cash bonus ended up being 6.5% worse than those with no bonus at all – thus actually costing the company money rather than boosting productivity in any way. So, what does this mean? Everyone loves pizza. But that we already know. It means that cash isn’t always the best motivator to get people to be productive. Rather, giving them congratulations for their work — and yes, a delicious slice of pizza — can be even better. Ask The Big Question Why did the productivity drop when the cash was offered? Disrupt Your Feed Forget wages, people should just be paid in slices of pizza. After the first day, one of the groups increased productivity by 6.7% – yep, you guessed it, that was the pizza group. Coming in a close second was the group offered praise. The money group, on the other hand, only increased production by 4.9% on the first day By Joel Balsam Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Qatalyst will begin a formal sales process to find a buyer for NXP, said the people, asking not to be identified because the information is private. In addition to Qualcomm, Avago Technologies Ltd, Intel Corp and Samsung Electronics Co are the most likely to be interested, one of the people said. NXP might also hire a coadviser, another person said. While NXP has grown quickly via its purchase of Freescale Semiconductor at the end of last year, it is still relatively small compared with companies such as Qualcomm, Intel and the more rapidly expanding Broadcom Ltd. NXP is projected to have more than US$9 billion in revenue this year. NXP chief executive officer Rich Clemmer and the company’s board, who successfully brought the company back to the public markets in 2010, might be tempted by an offer to become part of a bigger company as industrywide costs of production rise and customer lists shrink. NXP is one of several firms that San Diego, California-based Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips for mobile phones, has been studying as it determines if and how to put its offshore cash to use, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Qualcomm is also considering a handful of other large acquisitions, both domestic and international targets, the people said. Talks between NXP and Qualcomm are still preliminary, people with knowledge of the matter said. This story has been viewed 1293 times. Comments will be moderated.

Intel Xeon E5-2670 Elroy Bethell - October 1, 2016 5:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail Today’s CPUs (Central Processing Units), APUs (Accelerated Processing Units) or processors, as they are sometimes called, boost a variety features that present a daunting task when it comes to choosing the right one for your needs. Whether you are a gamer or more into productivity, your task should be centered around finding the CPU that best supports what UDO. (You D0). I think we covered all the acronyms so far. When choosing a processor, your budget is usually the main deciding factor. The performance you get from a processor is often in direct correlation to the amount of money you spend to purchase it. In order to make the buying process as simple as possible, you can narrow down your selection process by deciding on AMD or Intel, price point, number of cores, and clock speed. While there are many notable chip manufacturers out there, AMD and Intel are more often sitting at the top of the list. Here is a head-to-head comparison of their two shining stars… or chips.   SPECS AMD A8-7670K Photo Source: Amazon Intel Xeon E5-2670 Photo Source: Amazon Price $105.09 $345.26 Processor Speed 3.6 GHz 2.6 GHz Max Turbo Core Speed 3.9 GHz 3.3 GHz Processor Count 4 8 Socket Socket FM2+ LGA 2011 Brand AMD Intel         These two processors are clearly not in the same field to be competing against each other. The point here is that each offers something that is important based on consumer needs. The AMD A8-7670K “Kaveri” with Radeon R7 Graphics is an excellent performer in the graphics department. It features 10 cores with consist of 4 CPU cores and 6 GPU cores.

(SOUNDBITE) (English) U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, SAYING: "Almost there." Marshmallows flew across the room, thanks to Hudy's homemade air cannon. (SOUNDBITE) (English) U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, SAYING: "It came out pretty fast." Now 16 years-old, Hudy has been hired as an intern at Intel, usually reserved for outstanding college students. (SOUNDBITE) (English) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, SAYING: "You shot yourself with the marshmallow?!" (SOUNDBITE) (English) JOE HUDY, SAYING: "At 15 PSI." He's the youngest person to ever secure the role. He'll be working in the "New Devices Group" product development department, according the company. Demonstrating the tools of the trade, Hudy has made Arduino microcontroller boards, and a solar-powered computer for another science fair.

Reilly For The Register-Guard Oct. 1, 2016   Today’s Opinion stories Providing shelter University presidents GOP leaders not on ‘same page’ quite yet Lies in the Guise of News in the Trump Era The Glass Ceiling Holds More Opinion »   Oregon voters have a critical responsibility this election season. So, too, do the federal lawmakers whom we trust to advance our interests nationally. I refer not to the contentious presidential election, but to a pressing pocket­book issue for all Oregonians: the dual imperative of defeating Oregon’s Measure 97, while also urging national comprehensive tax reform that features a lower, universally applied rate across all sectors and avoids excessive taxes on business through new regulations. At the state level, Oregon’s Measure 97 would be a dangerous, business-stifling, job-killing consumption tax (disguised as a gross receipts tax), the effects of which would ripple throughout the state. At the national level, American enterprise currently labors under the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. That rate, at 39 percent, coupled with onerous regulations represents a massive drain on our economy. America’s corporate tax rate also cripples American businesses as they compete with foreign companies that enjoy a lower rate and a less complicated regulatory environment. This high tax burden affects Nike, Columbia Sportswear and Intel — all iconic Oregon companies — just as it affects the small businesses statewide. As our country’s economy continues to struggle, it is hard to fathom why the Obama administration is contemplating additional tax increases and more regulation. A recent public comment period on the U.S. Treasury’s plan to regulate American business under Section 385 of the Internal Revenue Service code revealed opposition from all stakeholders, including individual taxpayers, small and large businesses and business associations across many sectors. These diverse business associations conclude that the new rules “present a severe impediment to the use of intercompany financing for even normal operations and will significantly increase the cost of capital and limit the amount of capital available to invest in the United States.” As a small-business owner and advocate for Oregon’s small businesses, I can attest to the weight of high taxes and increased government regulations. Ore­gon’s unemployment ranks in the top 10 among all states, and it is 43rd (the eighth worst) on the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council’s annual Small Business Policy Index, which ranks the 50 states “according to various major government-imposed or government-related costs that directly or indirectly affect entrepreneurship and business.” In this climate, how could Oregonians contemplate passing Measure 97, which would represent the highest corporate tax in the state’s history? The state’s own analysis is dire, compelling caution against implementation, predicting “major pitfalls for wages, jobs and consumers’ pocketbooks” as well as “about 38,000 private-sector jobs” lost over five years. Oregon voters must reject this tax increase and hold Sen. Ron Wyden to his stated mission of “updating the nation’s tax system with a focus on growth and fairness, and ensuring fiscal policy supports American jobs.” That means comprehensive tax reform with a lower corporate tax rate that doesn’t discriminate across sectors, and a withdrawal of Treasury’s proposed Section 385 regulations. Only then will Oregonians find our state on the road to economic recovery. T.J. Reilly is president of the Oregon Small Business Association.

What is enabling this transformation? RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Agrotech x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By Debjani Ghosh Last month, India ranked 66th in the Global Innovation Rankings , an achievement worth noting when you realize that we moved up by 15 ranks from the previous year. A deeper analysis shows amongst middle-income countries, our quality of innovation was placed at number two, just behind China. So what is enabling this transformation in the Indian ecosystem? Digital India - two words that define the vision for our country, is changing the innovation landscape in our country. Through successful public private collaborations, we have embarked on a journey to establish a local, sustainable innovation ecosystem that is challenging India's challenges. Localized solutions to local problems A steady community of Indian innovators has emerged to accelerate innovation and entrepreneurship in the country, as they take their solutions from mind-to-market. This is a paradigm shift from the beginning of India's start-up gold rush almost a decade ago, when the local start-up ecosystem followed an import-oriented model, where international businesses entered the Indian market by customizing their services for local consumers, such as Uber accepting cash-on-delivery exclusively in India. Now, it is the Indian citizens who are finding localized solutions to local problems. These home-bred thinkers are best suited to develop solutions that address the pressing needs of our population because they see reality at the grassroots level. As India heralds a new era of thinking globally and acting globally, it recognizes that issues such as poverty, health, agriculture, urbanization, sanitation, and climate change are global in nature, but both their challenges and consequences have local effects. Rather than adopting a one-fits-all approach, Indian innovators are using their experience and perspective to understand the niches of the market to develop solutions from the bottom up. Take the example of Jayalaxmi Agrotech, one of the top three winners of last year's Intel & DST Innovate for Digital India Challenge. This end-to-end solution, developed by entrepreneurs who came from farming families, can be accessed even without the internet and delivers information about 20 crops in regional languages and audio-visual content, for the benefit of uneducated farmers. The data is delivered through a local server (Agripole), and the solution is currently being used by 7400 villages, downloaded via 300 Agripoles; till date. It has reduced input costs by 14% and increasing profitability by 17%. And this is the type of impact we must see in sectors such as healthcare, and financial services, amongst others. Doing well? To make innovation accessible and thorough, the Indian government is working with the private player ecosystem to reach out to not just for entrepreneurs in big cities, but also to students across age groups and states. For instance, NITI Aayog, under the Atal Innovation Mission, is setting up 500 Atal Tinkering Laboratories that will provide access to hands-on experience with chips, boards, robots, and machines via school labs, to the young minds. With similar initiatives at the college and PhD level, and beyond, we can be certain of increased enthusiasm by local makers to invent solutions that solve everyday problems faced by our citizens. These programs are in fact creating a unique blend of social entrepreneurship and innovation opportunities in India's non-urban towns. Clearly, India is re-engineering its growth curve by incorporating innovation as a critical factor to establish itself as a self-sufficient, knowledge economy. It's been a commendable start, but there is much more to achieve. If you look at countries that have successfully built a culture of innovation, two names come to mind - the United States, and Israel. There are several learnings from both, but three that we are doing well and should continue to embrace. First, the role of the government. In both countries, innovation is a top priority, and supported by the right plans, processes and most importantly investment. Digital India is already making this possible through multiple bodies such as the Department of Science and Technology, and the Ministry of Human Resource Development, amongst others. As in the US, these organizations are not just investing in creation of new technologies, but in creating new markets that private sector may be reluctant to enter. Second, getting the right policies in place to encourage more R&D in country is imperative. Innovation has to be driven by start-ups and large companies alike, and this is being made possible in our country through initiatives wherein larger companies are identifying entrepreneurs and start-ups with great ideas, and providing them access to mentors and market access. Finally, a strong industry-academia connect, something that Israel excels at. In fact, their government has put up a consortia of university research departments and IT companies to enhance dialogues and connects between academia and industry, which has a strong influence in shaping the research agenda based on real needs and problems. This is perhaps the least developed, and the strongest improvement area for the Indian innovation agenda. In any economy, innovation has a domino effect - it inadvertently fuels further innovation. This can only be ignited with the passion to think the impossible and challenge assumptions. In fact, whoever chooses to tread this path must have the appetite to fail because constant reinvention and mistakes are indispensable to nurture disruptive innovation. Ultimately, innovation is a way to improve our citizens' quality of life, change the way people live, and provide solutions to problems that are a potential hindrance in the social and economic progress of India.

Instead of waxing poetic on her floating dresses, her smart take on the bar jacket, or how damn good Jennifer Lawrence looked in the front row, we’ll cut to the chase: Chiuri triumphed with flying colors. She remained reverent to Monsieur Dior. She worked his love of tarot cards into embroidered finale gowns and breathed modernity into his signature shapes, while still offering plenty of options for modern women (kitten heels and suiting) and young girls in love with the idea of Dior (J’adior chokers). The biggest hit, however, was the T-shirt emblazoned with “We Should All Be Feminists.” Outside of Dior, however, there was plenty else going on in the City of Light. Here, the day’s biggest headlines for reading while you sink into a Friday night of Netflix, chilling, and catching up on Vogue Runway shows.   Expand Christian Dior Spring 2017 Photo: Indigital.tv Maria Grazia Chiuri Makes a Feminist Statement at Dior A lot of designers speak about strong women and femininity as inspirations, but few come at the ideas directly. For her debut at Dior, Maria Grazia Chiuri presented a thoroughly feminist collection of fencer’s jackets and tulle skirts—as well as a T-shirt that read “We Should All Be Feminists.” We agree with her sentiment—and with her revival of Dior’s “J’adore Dior” catchphrase, here transformed on heels and straps as “J’adior.”   Expand Loewe Spring 2017 Photo: Alessandro Garofalo / Indigital.tv Loewe Hits the Beach Jonathan Anderson set his Spring 2017 collection for Loewe against screens showing a video of two men at a beach. But it wasn’t a sultry proposition, this being Loewe. Instead, the men spent the video trying to lug oil barrels ashore. Brood over the message of that while you brood over Anderson’s crafty collection of flared linen, cotton, and burlap dresses and skirts that added a cerebral spin to beach dressing.   Expand Chalayan Spring 2017 Photo: Kim Weston Arnold / Indigital.tv Chalayan Blows Up Hussein Chalayan is known for innovation. Today, the designer showed a collection created partially in collaboration with Intel. Five outfits registered the behavior of the models wearing them. Among the emotions on full display were anxiety and fear—and the wearer’s levels were projected the on a wall by the runway. For those looking to hide away from oversharing, Chalayan also sent out inflated puff dresses and tops that seemed to have the opposite intension.   Expand Undercover Spring 2017 Photo: Kim Weston Arnold / Indigital.tv It’s a Picasso Party at Undercover What would the fashion lovechild of Coco Chanel and Pablo Picasso look like? We now know, thanks to Jun Takahashi’s Spring 2017 Undercover collection. The show started out with Coco-esque boater hats and Breton stripes and ended with violin F hole markings in harlequin colors. In between there were trompe l’oeil saxophones, slouchy cargo pants, and cherry red espadrilles—all essentials for an arty lady en route from Rue Cambon to the Cote d’Azur.   Expand Alexandre Vauthier Spring 2017 Photo: Courtesy of David Bellemere The ’80s Are Officially Back at Ungaro and Alexandre Vauthier Glamour girls rejoice! Alexandre Vauthier and Emanuel Ungaro are bringing the ’80s back full throttle with their reworked takes on Reagan-era style. At the former, Vauthier softened his broad shouldered jackets and shrunk his tuxedo-inspired minidresses, turning model Taylor Hill into a modern-day Cindy Crawford. (Kaia Gerber and her generation will be glad to see Vauthier also offering logo waistband underwear and sheer tops.) At Ungaro, designer Fausto Puglisi turned to the dramatic ruffles of the ’80s for inspiration, sending out models in pastel colors and voluminous shapes. No Crawford vamping there: Puglisi’s minis are more for a contemporary Sloane Ranger on a night out.   Expand Photographed by Phil Oh Photographed by Phil Oh The Chicest Woman in Paris is in Reeboks and Jeans Sometimes you can’t beat the classics. The proof is in this understated yet oh-so-effective outfit spotted by Phil Oh at Paris Fashion Week. This woman—in medium wash jeans, white Reebok sneakers, and an undone white button-down—had that French je ne sais quoi down pat. See more of her similarly well-clad peers in our street style slideshow here.   Expand Photo: Getty Images Photo: Getty Images Balmain Parties All Night Long Take Olivier Rousteing, Kim Kardashian West, and a bevy of models clad in Balmain’s glittering frocks and you have the perfect recipe for an all-night rager. Such was the case at the Parisian brand’s after-party at Loulou, where the Balmain Army shimmied until the sun came up.   Expand Loewe Spring 2017 Photographed by Driely S The View Behind-the-Scenes Our backstage photographers Kevin Tachman and Driely S. capture moments that are easily missed on the runway. Case in point: the sheer number of accessories packed into this single look at Loewe.

There were no injuries or arrests reported.Some demonstrators climbed a front gate reinforced from inside by fire trucks and other vehicles, but they were not able to get in, Hoa said. Others entered from a back gate and smashed some windows and cameras.Formosa in Taiwan could not be reached for comment and an official responsible for external relations at its Ha Tinh unit said he was not aware of the situation and would respond later. Police and the provincial authority, the Ha Tinh's People Committee, could not be reached for comments.The Vietnamese government has offered favorable conditions to attract foreign investment, with companies such as Samsung Electronics and Intel key drivers of the economy and sources of jobs.Formosa is one of its biggest investors and protests against the firm took place in Vietnam's biggest cities over several weekends since April. In some cases, police used excessive force to thwart them, rights groups say. Another witness said people were angry because they encountered resistance from police while trying to peacefully assemble."People were irritated because they just want to meet Formosa directly and negotiate," said the witness, who declined to be named. Demonstrators were demanding Formosa close the steel plant and give more compensation and do a better environmental cleanup. They wanted the government to stop an alternative plan of discharging the waste into a local river instead of into the sea for better monitoring, the witness said.Taiwan's Foreign Ministry in a statement said its representatives in Vietnam had contacted the steel plant, which police had shut down temporarily. "The representative office has asked Vietnamese authorities to send more police to protect the plant, its employees, and the lives and property of all Taiwanese businessmen in Ha Tinh province," it said.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 2, 2016 at 11:30AM Image source: NVIDIA.  On Sept. 28, graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) unveiled an interesting new chip code-named Xavier at its GPU Technology Conference event in Europe. The new chip, the company says, is "designed for use in self-driving cars." The chip itself integrates eight NVIDIA-designed 64-bit ARM cores, a 512-core graphics processor based on the company's upcoming Volta graphics architecture, two video processors capable of handling 8K video, and a specialized computer vision accelerator. It's manufactured in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's 16-nanometer technology and is made up of a whopping seven billion transistors. more than twice as many as what Apple's A9X processor includes. The company says it will begin sampling to customers in the fourth quarter of 2017 with "automakers, tier 1 suppliers, start-ups, and research institutions who are developing self-driving cars." This chip is a big deal for NVIDIA -- here's why. Drive PX 2 performance at a fraction of the power (and probably cost) Earlier this year, NVIDIA announced a platform dubbed the Drive PX 2 targeted at self-driving cars. Drive PX 2 includes two of NVIDIA's recently announced processor code-named Parker, as well as two standalone graphics processors based on the company's Pascal architecture. Drive PX 2 is quite powerful, but it also consumes 250 watts and needs to be liquid-cooled. According to NVIDIA, the upcoming Xavier chip "will be able to replace today's DRIVE PX 2 configured with dual mobile SoCs and dual discrete [graphics processing units] -- at a fraction of the power consumption." Image source: NVIDIA.  The much-improved power efficiency of this single-chip solution is, in itself, a big deal. Putting what required multiple large, liquid-cooled chips mounted on a fairly large logic board onto a single chip should enable future DRIVE PX platforms to be delivered in much more compact form factors. Perhaps what's even more interesting, though, is that NVIDIA should be able to realize a significant cost reduction from this solution as well. The current DRIVE PX 2 platform requires no fewer than four large NVIDIA chips -- two Tegra and two standalone graphics processors. That's a lot of chip content, which probably means the DRIVE PX 2 is fairly expensive to produce. By consolidating all of that functionality into a single chip, the manufacturing cost of the silicon that NVIDIA includes in future DRIVE PX platforms should come down substantially. I suspect that NVIDIA will use the reduced production costs to lower prices somewhat, making the solution more accessible and potentially driving more volume, but at the same time, I don't think it will pass all of those savings on to potential customers. This approach should allow NVIDIA to boost the gross profit margins that it enjoys from future DRIVE PX platforms. NVIDIA is quite serious about self-driving cars NVIDIA's initial efforts in the automotive space were largely targeted at in-vehicle infotainment applications. Those applications generally don't carry high gross profit margins as there are a lot of companies out there (essentially any major mobile system-on-chip players) that could conceivably repurpose their chips as in-vehicle infotainment chips. Indeed, many of them -- including Qualcomm, Intel,  Texas Instruments, and others -- already do just that. However, what NVIDIA seems to be doing here is unique. The company's automotive efforts are transforming from an attempt to repurpose mobile processors and gaming-oriented graphics processors for self-driving cars to a full-on effort to produce platforms, both hardware and software, tailored specifically for the nascent market. To be clear, though, this is a gamble. If the market for self-driving cars really takes off, then the platform investments NVIDIA is making here could have a very large payoff. If it ultimately fizzles out, then NVIDIA will have invested a lot of research and development dollars for naught. That said, given that NVIDIA's business is currently doing extremely well, it makes sense for the graphics specialist to strike while the iron is hot and go after some of these opportunities, particularly as products targeted toward those segments can leverage so much of the work that is done for its core businesses anyway.

bit-tech.net Home News Reviews Hardware Modding Gaming Blog Forums Search All Hardware Gaming Industry Other Nvidia announces Volta-based Xavier SoC Published on 29th September 2016 by Gareth Halfacree 3 Comments News Nvidia's Xavier SoC design packs an eight-core ARM processor, 512-core Volta GPU, and a special accelerator block for visual computing tasks. Nvidia is continuing its heavy push into the automotive market with the announcement of Xavier, a Volta-based system-on-chip (SoC) design the company hopes will be driving the autonomous vehicles of the future. Nvidia first announced that it was serious about making an impact in the automotive sector with the opening of a dedicated technology centre in Michigan in 2013. Two years later the company announced the Tegra X1, a spin of its previously mobile-centric ARM-based system-on-chip (SoC) designs which it claimed would be perfect for running the artificial intelligence system needed of a self-driving car. Now, the company is once again doubling down on automotive technology with Xavier, a new SoC design featuring an eight-core ARM central processor and a 512-core graphics processor based on the company's new Volta architecture. In short: it promises to be a bit of a beast, at least according to Nvidia's chief executive Jen-Hsun Huang. 'This is the greatest SoC endeavour I have ever known,' Huang told attendees at the company's GPU Technology Conference Europe, where Xavier was unveiled, 'and we have been building chips for a very long time.' The chip itself, built on a 16nm FinFET process, includes the aforementioned CPU and GPU blocks as well as a visual processor capable of 8K resolution with a high dynamic range (HDR) and a 'computer vision accelerator.' This block, Nvidia explains, works much like the Movidius visual processing unit (VPU) technology recently acquired by rival Intel, and is designed to accelerate tasks revolving around depth-sensing and image recognition from connected camera systems. As far as power goes, Nvidia claims that a single Xavier SoC is capable of offering 20 TOPS (trillion operations per second, a seemingly different metric than the company's usual measurement of floating-point operations per second) in a 20W power envelope. With that performance, the company claims, manufacturers can replace an existing Nvidia Drive PX 2 in-car computer system and its dual discrete graphics processing units with a single Xavier chip for equal performance at a significantly lower power draw. Nvidia has indicated that Xavier samples will ship in limited quantities for research purposes at the tail end of 2017, with no firm launch date yet provided for commercial availability and implementation. The remainder of the company's announcement can be found on the official website.

Automotive will never use a consumer chip as they have specialist requirements inline with embedded: > Extensive validation + ISO certs. You complete the project, which is normally "yay sell time" then it's another 9+ months of testing. > Environmentally hardened - temp + packaging. > Unique IOs. This is becoming less the case as automated vehicles standardize around 'regular' IO > Auto is loooooong tail, like embedded. New car is 2-3 years design + 7 years of sales + 3 years of aftercare. You are contractually obligated to guarantee the chip will be around for at least 10 years. Core 2 Duo would just be seeing EOL in other words. > Customized designs to meet specific needs - you don't just slap as much as you can in one central processor. It's actually better to have certain fusions of parts around the vehicle with their own local, low power processing. That's more risk averse + uniform low temp + low power + small size to fit into nooks and crannies around the vehicle. This is why your usual $5 chip is now 5-10x as much.

 What you should know about the ending of a US contract some say amounts to 'giving away the internet' Allan Smith Oct. 1, 2016, 4:37 PM 20,863 facebook linkedin twitter email print Ted Cruz. AP Photo/Evan Vucci A historic transfer of internet power was scheduled to occur at midnight Saturday. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers became an autonomous nonprofit after a contract with the US Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration expired. Now ICANN will perform the duties of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority without direct oversight of the US government.  Instead, ICANN is now accountable to international stakeholders that include a governmental advisory committee, a technical committee, an industry committee, internet users, and other telecommunications experts. The organization, based out of Los Angeles, coordinates the Domain Name System that matches internet addresses with their actual numerical computer addresses. IANA functions include maintaining the registry of IP addresses and the allocation of internet-numbering resources. The entire ordeal sounds extremely complicated — and it did not come without its fair share of controversy. That contract, which is now officially expired, had been in place since 1998. Both businesses and members of the international community had been pressuring the US to cede control over IANA functions, deemed by some as a very minor ordeal — likening it to printing the phone book. But others, such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, likened it to "giving away the internet." Cruz originally wanted a provision in the recent stopgap spending bill in Congress to prevent this transfer from occurring, but that did not happen. Late this week, the attorney generals of four states filed a lawsuit in federal court looking to block the midnight Saturday transfer, but it was thrown out by a federal judge in the Southern District of Texas on Friday. "This transition was envisioned 18 years ago, yet it was the tireless work of the global internet community, which drafted the final proposal, that made this a reality,” ICANN Board Chair Stephen D. Crocker said in a statement. "This community validated the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance." Speaking to Business Insider Friday, before the Texas judge's decision, aides to Cruz called the issue — which amounts to control over the internet address book — a ground zero of protecting free speech online. They also criticized the White House for claiming that, in his fight against the transfer, Cruz didn't understand how the internet works and wanted to keep government involved in the process. "I love it when big-government liberals try and lecture conservatives about limited government," an aide said. Chief among Cruz's concerns is that a government advisory council is part of ICANN. He believes that the foreign governments who have a voice in that part of the group will begin to have a much bigger sway in how it operates going forward. His aides likened it to a form of the UN, where each country involved will be on equal footing. The problem with that, Cruz believes, is that countries such as Russia and China, both of which maintain strict internet control in their own countries, will be able to exert it on a global stage, possibly even impacting internet freedom within the US. But Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware told Business Insider in a Friday interview that the way the Texas Republican is characterizing the issue "is exactly wrong." "This is not a handover of control of the internet to some UN body, as much as he tries to make it sound like ICANN, which is an American corporation registered in California, is some international body," the Delaware Democrat said. "It isn't the UN or anything like it." "The way that China or Russia could have greater influence over the naming function of the internet is if we delay this transition," he continued. "Lose our credibility internationally that we do intend to privatize this function, and give them the leverage to make stronger arguments at the United Nations that the UN ... should begin preparing to set up their own DNS function. I think there is a very small risk that this transition will lead to any increased role for any country, including those that censor the internet in their own country." Cruz's team insisted that, although ICANN has not censored content in the past as a part of their duties, the senator believes they could have that ability moving forward. The group performs only a clerical function, but Cruz believes that could change. Using the example of "Free Tibet" groups in China, which have their web content blocked within that country while it can still be viewed elsewhere, a Cruz aide said China could begin to dictate whether that content makes it outside of the country. Chris Coons. Cliff Owen/AP Photo Coons used the phone-book analogy to try and disprove what Cruz has argued. He said that, when he was a kid, the Yellow Pages and White Pages essentially had a monopoly. But by the 1990s, dozens of publishers printed competing phone books. "The fact that there is a company that publishes the Yellow Pages that says if you want to purchase from a hardware store in your city, you know, here they all are, here are all of their names, that doesn't restrict what you can say on the phone to the hardware store," he said in his analogy. "It has nothing to do with the content of your conversations with the hardware store. All it does is assign pages to certain names and numbers. That's pretty similar to what the IANA does." "The IANA maintains the directory for when a string of numbers comes through your computer — it translates it into a bunch of numbers and then connects you to the right computer," he continued. "One of the things that was clearly eluding the critics of this transition was the idea that there could ever be a second Yellow Pages or a third Yellow Pages. Right now, the internet, which is a network of networks, is not owned or controlled by anyone. That's why it's the internet." Coons called the government-controlled contract that just expired a deal for "one version of the phone book." "And for 20 years, they've said 'America, at some point, will you turn over this minor role you have in this organization that is printing the Yellow Pages," he said. "And we said in both Democratic and Republican administrations, 'Sure, we'll get around to it. Sure, we're about to do that.'" He said that, with many in the international community growing leery that the US would ever end up actually doing it, there was increasing support for a "competing phone book" run by a sub-unit of the UN. That sounds a lot like exactly what Cruz does not want. "And the entity that would resolve disputes between who owns which domain or which website will be resolved by this UN agency," Coons said. "That is a structure where countries like China and Iran and Russia would have a bigger role. Instead, we have focused on the last four years pretty aggressively, and in the last two in a heightened way, on privatizing a very minimal US government role in overseeing how this phone-book contract is administered." "Here's the true irony: Sen. Cruz is a tireless advocate for personal liberty and an opponent of federal-government control in just about every subject matter area except this one," the senator continued. "What he's opposing is privatization. By opposing it, he's actually putting at risk the possibility that it will instead be taken over by a competing effort led by countries that do not favor free speech in the UN. Does that make any sense?" The Delaware senator said the transfer should make "no real difference" for everyday Americans, as there should be no perceivable change in how the internet works, explaining that it has to do with the "wires, plumbing, and piping" of the internet, not its content. Coons asked why tech giants would be in favor of the transfer if it posed a legitimate threat to internet freedom. "Why would companies like Dell and Cisco and Microsoft and Intel — who rely on a robust and open global internet for their businesses — why would they be so invested and concerned about this?" he said. "Because they need predictability." "Because ICANN, this large company in California that is largely run by the internet community, which is largely run by American companies, why would they want that group in control of this internet naming function rather than the UN," he continued. "I think you just got the answer." At the UN, countries such as Russia or Iran would have that equal footing to the US, while ICANN, because it is based out of California, is still subject to California law, he said. And it will be mostly under the purview of the private sector, which has a business interest in the internet being open and free. AP Photo/Tim Hales, File "If I got to choose between having the phone book published by the UN or by an American nonprofit company that is headquartered in California and subject to California law, I know which one I want," he said. "I want the latter." The senator called the reason Cruz wanted to stop the transfer a "fringe conspiracy theory," adding that many such theories have gained plenty of traction during the 2016 campaign season. "One of the things that has made this campaign season particularly interesting is the number of fringe conspiracy theories that have somehow made their way into the mainstream," he said. "This issue is no exception to that unfortunate trend." On Friday, after aligning himself with Cruz's position on the issue, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ripped the "disastrous" IANA transfer during a rally. "Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interested trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation," he said. "She even supports the disastrous surrender of America's control of the internet — let it be given to the world. What a bunch of people we have representing us. What a bunch of people." Coons said Trump's statement shows, "unfortunately," that Trump "is not well informed on internet-governance matters." "This particular issue was seized upon by a few in order to score some points, by misleadingly suggesting that President [Barack] Obama is giving away the internet," the senator said. "The United States does not own a set of keys to the internet. It's not a physical thing. It's not as if we're taking our dad's Oldsmobile and giving it away at a flea market. It is a network of networks. And that is a hard thing to grasp and an easy thing to mislead people about."

The company is preparing to respond within weeks to three separate charges of EU competition rule breaches in its online shopping service, Android smartphone software and advertising business. Google’s counter is the latest salvo in the European Commissions’s six-year investigation into the company. It comes at a critical point as tensions simmer between the US and Brussels. In August, the Commission said Apple should pay billions in unpaid taxes to the Irish state, provoking fury from Washington, while the US Department of Justice has recently demanded that Deutsche Bank pay a $14bn (£11bn) mis-selling fine. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner Credit: EPA A response from Google to all three of the charges could now come as early as mid October after the company recently requested that the EU extend legal deadlines to answer the charges. The Commission confirmed that it had given the company extra time to answer. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, hit Google with formal antitrust charges last year, claiming it exploits the monopoly enjoyed by its web search engine to prioritise its own price comparison shopping service. She followed that with two more charges this year, claiming that the company uses its Android software’s overwhelming share of the smartphone market to force its other services onto smartphones and that it restricted competitors to its AdSense for Search advertising service by signing exclusivity agreements with websites. The Commission has the power to fine Google up to 10pc of its annual revenues if it finds it guilty of anti-competitive practices, which could mean a penalty of up to $7.5bn (£5.8bn). This would eclipse the biggest fine to date, the €1.1bn (£950m) the Commission levied on Intel in 2009. The history of Google Play! 02:31 While a response is expected in mid-to-late October, it could be delayed further as Google puts the finishing touches to its answers. The company may still offer concessions in a last-ditch attempt to seek a deal with the Commission that would lead to a reduced fine, but after several failed attempts in the past, the prospect of a truce appears unlikely. Both sides are now believed to be prepared for a long-running battle, and any EU fine may be appealed at the European Court of Justice, a process that could take years and extend beyond Ms Vestager’s 2019 term. The Commission’s combative stance has irritated the US government, which cleared Google of any search bias after its own investigation in 2013. Barack Obama has accused the EU of attempting to protect its own companies by reining in Silicon Valley giants. When it responds, Google is likely to argue that it needs to place restrictions on Android to ensure the consistency of the software and that many price comparison services have benefited, not suffered, from the search engine. A Commission spokesman confirmed that Google’s deadlines for responding had been extended. It now has until October  13 to respond to the charge related to online shopping, October 26 for advertising and October 31 for the Android claim. Google did not comment.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 1 October 2016 | MYT 10:00 AM Car industry shows off cooperation as way to rival technology firms Future challenges: Can carmakers charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free? — Reuters PARIS/FRANKFURT:  Alarmed by the threat posed by Silicon Valley firms developing autonomous driving systems, carmakers at this week's Paris Motor Show showed signs they are ready to hit back by cooperating in areas where they might have been expected to compete. "This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple and particularly Google represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. BMW, Daimler and VW's Audi announced this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions miles ahead. They are based on video data collected from sensors in other cars and fed to the three carmakers' jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm HERE. Separately HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV on Thursday announced traffic data deals with truckmaker Volvo and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Also General Motors, Nissan and VW are experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars. However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply data to Google-owned crowd-sourced traffic and navigation service Waze will help drivers find parking spots on smartphones using the free app. And Renault said on Thursday it was showing a prototype of a Waze system built into its car dashboards which run Android Auto, Google's operating system for carmakers. Meanwhile connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks. With that aim, Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020. Careful driving At the same time carmakers are now racing to plot their courses to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years, a dramatic acceleration in pace from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla. "We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform," Daimler chairman Dieter Zetsche told reporters in Paris. Among the car companies there have been two camps, those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it, but that division is looking set to become less clear-cut due to the need for cooperation in some areas at least. "Gradually all of the car manufacturers will have to get more and more involved in managing data. It's natural. We're going to have to work much more collaboratively," Stewart Callegari, a Nissan product planning executive for driverless cars told reporters at the Paris show. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise. Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of vehicle makers who want to go it alone but still sees some need for collaboration. "We need to think whether we work together analysing the data or whether we do this on our own. This depends on the use case," Zetsche said, adding that it made sense to work together in areas where potential cost savings resulted but did not blur the distinctions between brands. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely's Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies, and General Motor's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are also seen as hybrid approaches. "The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways," Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Growth of 'gig' economy may change US labour market: Fed's Brainard Merkel says old must learn from tech-savvy young in digital age Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Guardiola defends Rooney over late-night socialising Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Hotlink Fast: Get 17GB of data with the new Internet pass Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Airbnb, San Francisco must work harder to resolve lawsuit: judge Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 2, 2016 at 3:11PM Many growth investors like tech stocks because they occasionally generate market-crushing gains within just a few years. Over the past decade, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)rallied nearly 2,500%, while Baidu -- the biggest search engine in China -- surged nearly 2,000%. Image source: Pixabay. Those gains look explosive, but many other tech stocks also bombed during those 10 years. Therefore, investors who are interested in this sector should remember five simple tips before buying their first tech stocks. 1. Understand what the company does The tech sector is filled with companies that promote "hot" technologies. However, investors often buy shares of these companies on an analyst recommendation without really understanding what they sell. As Warren Buffett famously said, "Never invest in a business you cannot understand." That's why Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is such a popular tech stock among both mainstream and institutional investors. Its business is easy to understand -- most of its revenue comes from its three hardware product lines (iPhone, iPad, Mac), but it's gradually pivoting toward paid services (Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple Care) to reduce its dependence on hardware. Other companies have hidden strengths. Amazon is generally known as an e-commerce site, but its most profitable business is actually AWS (Amazon Web Services), the largest cloud platform in the world. The profits from that business offset the much lower margins at its marketplace business. 2. Look for market leaders When I invest in tech stocks, I generally look for "best-in-breed" market leaders. These leaders usually have strong pricing power, stable margins, and the ability to exploit economies of scale and bundling strategies to marginalize smaller rivals. Amazon exhibits all these qualities in both the e-commerce and cloud markets. Cisco has the same strengths in the networking equipment market, while Salesforce has similar advantages in the cloud-based customer relationship management market. 3. Always look forward The worst mistake a tech company can make is falling behind the tech curve. Yet larger tech companies often fall behind because they focus more on quarterly growth, dividends, or buybacks than boosting their research and development budgets. Market leaders, their egos boosted by temporary glory, also sometimes prematurely dismiss disruptive threats. Image source: Pixabay. That's precisely what happened to BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY), which controlled a fifth of the smartphone market seven years ago. After its market share plunged to nearly 0%, it decided to stop producing its own smartphones in late September. The same can be said about Intel, which surrendered the mobile chip market to Softbank's ARM Holdings' licensees, and Microsoft, which ceded the mobile OS market to Apple and Alphabet's Google. If a tech company stops innovating and simply follows market trends, its high growth days might be over. That's what might be happening with Apple, which is pursuing "hot" markets like smartwatches and streaming music instead of launching new game-changing devices like the iPod and iPhone. 4. Understand the valuations Investors often pay big premiums for high-growth tech stocks, but these stocks can be solid investments if their valuations are supported by comparable earnings growth. Amazon, for example, trades at 79 times forward earnings, but is expected to deliver earnings growth of 80% next year.  However, these valuations can be tricky if a company posts explosive sales growth with widening losses. In these cases, investors should check the company's cash position and free cash flow to better analyze the health of the business. 5. Don't ignore "old tech" Many investors focus on the sexy high-growth tech stocks, but they should remember that slow growers like Cisco, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM are still great sources of stable income. These companies also buy back lots of stock, regularly raise their dividends, and trade at much lower multiples than higher-flying tech darlings -- making them ideal core holdings for your portfolio. The key takeaway The tech sector might seem overwhelming at first, but it all comes down to buying what you understand, identifying the market leaders and disruptors, and understanding their valuations. Investors who tick off these boxes while doing their due diligence might find some solid tech stocks to hold for the long run.

But, the increasingly more amusing part of this new found accuracy is emulating game crashes. When using MMU Enabled + Single Core, it should be impossible for a game to crash Dolphin, but, much more likely to emulate a game crashing in situations where it would on console. As such, booting all games is old news, Dolphin is now onto emulating crashes in all games. One infamous one that didn't work in Dolphin is known as the Gotcha Force "Force 20" game glitch. Gotcha Force "Force 20" Crash Though not specially highlighted this month, our applause has to go to aldelero5 for continuing to work on and renovate Dolphin's debugger. With Dolphin's increasingly accurate MMU emulation, it's actually become even more useful to poke at and prod games. They are making it so much easier to research and prod bugs like this to delve even deeper into the game logic! While that was merged near the beginning of the month, we had another major change merged at the end of the month. Two hours before the progress report was originally scheduled. Dolphin now has another experimental backend, this time using the Vulkan API. Much like D3D12, it should be considered experimental, with a few features still missing from the backend, and many drivers having their own issues with Vulkan. With that out of the way, let's get onto this month's notable changes! Notable Changes¶ 5.0-540 - Dynamic BATs by magumagu¶ Click here for the full article. If you couldn't tell by the introduction, this is still a pretty big deal. Dolphin is capable of booting every single GameCube game now, and the only two games that don't get in-game are Phantasy Star Online 1&2 Trial Edition and the Game Boy Player. Both require emulating new hardware addons for Dolphin to boot them, and the Game Boy Player is an entirely different system! Fortunately there is already a great emulator out there which may take up the task. Because we already had an absolutely huge article on it, there isn't much else to say. In summary, better Memory Management Unit emulation gets Star Wars: The Clone Wars to boot while fixing a gaggle of other bugs. Instead, let's focus on the impact and reports we've gotten from users, as well as some trends we've noticed over the past four weeks since it's been merged. Reports of Broken Games: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was reported as broken by this change. We investigated and found that this game is a bit of a special case. It only runs in Dolphin's JIT! The seemingly more accurate Interpreter, Cached interpreter and less accurate JITIL all immediately crash on boot! We tested the game before and after Dynamic BATs. There is no regression. Performance Issues: Some users have reported anywhere from a 16% to 33% slowdown on certain configurations, but when it comes to reproducing these slowdowns, no one on the staff can actually see a major slowdown in non-MMU titles. If you're seeing slowdowns since Dynamic BATs in non-MMU titles, try to hang in there; there's still more optimization that can be done on CPU emulation and any slow down should be possible to counteract. It's just identifying what (if anything,) is slower right now. JITIL Issues: We broke JITIL again. There is no reason to be concerned, this is par for the course. We break JITIL all the time. Anyway, enable MMU + JITIL will cause Dolphin to lockup on game boot. We recommend you do not do this. Unless you really need to see that we're not joking. The question is whether we do the work to fix JITIL or simply remove it. With JIT issues becoming less and less common, JITIL is becoming less and less useful to keep around. Also Cached Interpreter replaces some of its usefulness as a comparison to the JIT that isn't super slow. 5.0-546 - [IPC HLE] Implement /dev/usb/ven with very basic functionality by Jhonn¶ While Dolphin still doesn't support USB Microphones, there are actually a couple of games that check for the USB Microphone without actually requiring it, such as the newer Just Dance titles. Since Dolphin didn't even have basic USB emulation, when the game checked for a USB microphone, it would just crash before it even finished booting. So in order to get the non-Microphone portions of the game to work, some very basic functionality of USB Microphone detection needed to be added. Dolphin now properly fails the game's USB check, allowing the game to boot. This fix allows the Just Dance 2014, 2015, 2016, and likely the upcoming Just Dance 2017 to boot. At this point we wouldn't surprised to see a Just Dance 2018 announced. 5.0-560 - Remove instant ARAM DMA hack by phire¶ A while ago on the Progress Report, we alluded to the fact that Dolphin's Auxilliary RAM Direct Access Memory (ARAM-DMA) timings suddenly become different when Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 3 are being played. At the time, we said we were ~99% sure that the GameCube's DMA timings wouldn't become instant when playing Resident Evil 2 or 3, and now we are 100% sure. The last known full GameCube "game" that wasn't reaching gameplay in Dolphin after Dynamic BATs was Army Men: Sarge's War. When doing more research into why Army Men was broken, phire realized it was hitting the ARAM-DMA hack that was designed to fix Resident Evil 2 and 3. See, the ARAM-DMA hack wasn't just activating in Resident Evil 2 and 3. Instead, Dolphin looked for cases where L1/L2 cache invalidation was happening during a Direct Memory Access transfer. When this happened, Dolphin went into instant ARAM-DMA mode to try and curb any issues caused not emulating the L1/L2 CPU cache. In the cases of Resident Evil 2 and 3, they use their own custom streaming audio setup. Developers currently disagree with what is actually going wrong at the current state; but, L1/L2 cache emulation is likely needed for things to work properly. The music never correctly loads in areas with two "music" tracks. Instead of leaving a big ARAM-DMA hack just for Resident Evil 2 and 3, we decided to break the music in the games and remove the hack altogether. The games are still fully playable, but areas with multiple music tracks will have issues with the music cutting in and out as they constantly fight to play each area. Often, ambience and other reoccuring sound effects are used as a second "music" track, so don't be surprised if the music is missing in a lot of areas. This change fixes Army Men: Sarge's War and likely other games inadvertently activating the ARAM-DMA hack. Before anyone asks, yes, Dolphin could have activated the hack only for Resident Evil 2 and 3. The reason that was not done was because we really want to fix this properly. So many times in the past, a developer has left a hack in Dolphin that has come back to cause issues when accuracy is increased. Sarge's War is just one of those casualties, but there have actually been dozens of titles broken by assumptions made by old hacks; some of which extended the feature freeze before 5.0 by quite some time as regressions from finally removing them were sorted out. We will fix Resident Evil 2 and 3 eventually, and this time it won't be with a hack. 5.0-568 - PixelShaderGen: Always divide the texture coordinates by q by Armada¶ This one fixes one of our favorite bugs in all of Dolphin. There's a bug in Fishing Resort, where the player pulls out the map, but, for some reason, the map is actually upside down. Among developers, we've joked quite a bit about the character being an idiot and simply holding the map upside down! Yet, we knew there was a real issue, and a lot of attempts to fix it have already failed. Finally, Armada pulled off the seemingly impossible when looking at ornox's Texture Coordinates Q == 0 fix featured in last month's Progress Report. He realized there were other cases where texture coordinates weren't being divided by q. Fishing Resort Map Bug 2009 - 2016 The laughter you gave us will never be forgotten. Also this fixes Find Mii's dark stages, but, that's not nearly as amusing. Now that's one way to make the game harder. Ahh that's better. Note: this was discovered by fifoci, hence the missing faces. Fifologs don't record EFB Copies generated before the fifolog. Note: An earlier version of this entry referenced a different change. The writer responsible has been flogged. 5.0-643, 5.0-647, and 5.0-726 - Android UI Improvements by SeannyM¶ Well, it's been a while. Dolphin Android hasn't been seeing many unique updates since outside of a few components, it's internally the same thing as the PC versions. But SeannyM has stepped up to the plate and has committed a ton of fixes for Android! These are all well needed fixes, so let's ignore the specific commits and just go through the fixes one at a time. Scale buttons based on screen dimension¶ Dolphin now scales the on-screen buttons based on your screen dimensions. This helps smaller phones and of course, portrait mode! As if the GameCube controller's A button wasn't big enough already... Now that's much more sensible. Improved Button Scaling¶ This little change scales all of the buttons relative to each other based on real world measurements. There are some differences from world sizes here and there for usability, but it makes the on-screen controls much more familiar. For a before shot, just compare this to the scale buttons images above. C-Stick and Dpad Support¶ Dolphin now has on-screen controls for the GameCube Dpad and C-stick! You can finally spam downsmash as Peach in Melee and then taunt after yet another kill! Android: fix save and load state menus on non-TV devices¶ This fix restores a very important bit of functionality that is especially important for mobile users - the ability to save and load savestates on demand. Previously, the save and load state menus would try to load the Android TV UI fragments regardless of the device it was currently running on. On non-Android TV devices, such as phones, this resulted in a crash because the layout doesn't exist on that device. With this addressed, manually saving and loading savestates works properly once again! Toggleable buttons UI¶ Next up, there is now a configuration menu that allows you to toggle on-screen buttons as you please. This very simple change makes it simpler to use what you need for a game; for much cleaner, easier to use on-screen controls. The toggle menu lets you select which controls you want on-screen. If you are playing a game that uses next to no buttons, you can just use what it needs! Wait wait, those weren't GameCube controls in the toggle menu! Wiimote on-screen buttons¶ That's right, Dolphin on Android now has Wiimote touch controls! For the first time you can control a Wii game with nothing but your screen. It's still limited though, as only the Wiimote and Nunchuk are available, and there are no motion controls or pointer, but this is a big step toward Android compatibility for on-screen users. Oh yea, time for some Xenoblade on the road! ...at 4fps... With all of these changes, on-screen controls for Android have taken a huge leap forward! However, there are still considerable issues left. The buttons do not indicate when they are pressed, joysticks do not slide about in their range, the classic controller pro has not been implemented, and motion controls will be a nightmare. But thanks to SeannyM, we're slowly moving toward a complete touch control interface. 5.0-730 - LogicOp/DestinationAlpha Hack for OpenGL by stenzek¶ OpenGL cannot emulate Kirby's Return to Dream Land's shadows without this hack. For quite a while Dolphin has been attempting to move on from the two pass method it uses when dual-source blending is not supported, and things were getting close with most graphics cards now supporting it as a basic feature. Destination alpha is emulated by writing two colors from the fragment shader. The first contains the alpha value that is written to the framebuffer, and the second contains the value passed into the blending equation to determine the final color of the pixel. Unfortunately logical operations cannot be combined with blending, and cannot be applied on a per-channel basis, meaning that the two-pass fallback was needed to write the constant alpha value to the framebuffer. The only known case where this causes an issue is Kirby's Return to Dream Land. This is far from a perfect solution, due to it not being accurate in all cases, but it does make Kirby's shadow only appear on the ground as expected. Why did we finally cave and add the hack? Vulkan, D3D12 and Metal, the three new APIs, all lack the functionality Dolphin needs. So, instead of waiting any longer, stenzek implemented the hack and degasus approved it. After realizing help was not on the way, it was either leave it broken forever or implement a hackfix. Oh no, Kirby is being eaten by a black ink blob! It's Vietnam all over again! Thankfully Kirby will suffer no more war flashbacks with this fix. For those of you on D3D11/12... this fix isn't coming your way. Now, you probably are thinking, "Hey, Kirby's Return to Dreamland's shadows already works on D3D," and you'd be correct. It does work. The output of the broken implementation there lines up with what appears on console. On the other hand, lack of LogicOp support altogether does cause other issues. The most well known example is F-Zero GX in Story Mission 2. The shadows of these boulders don't appear on D3D. But they appear perfectly fine in OpenGL. With D3D12, there is the possibility of supporting F-Zero GX's boulder shadows in the future. On the other hand, D3D11 completely lacks any functionality toward it. 5.0-748 - Vulkan Backend by stenzek¶ Stenzek implemented a backend that uses some weird graphics API a few people seem to like. There's actually a lot to say, but this got merged the night of the progress report (literally two hours before October 1st.) So in honor of the devs who have absolutely no regard for the blog staff, prepare for the ultimate technique for blog article writing: winging it. Vulkan for AMD Users¶ The biggest news for us with Vulkan is that they will finally bring AMD graphics cards up to speed on a non-D3D backend. Linux users with AMD graphics have had it pretty rough in Dolphin, seeing much, much worse performance compared to similar hardware from other vendors. Vulkan finally levels the playing field, giving absolutely huge boosts to AMD users. AMD users on Linux can finally celebrate reasonable performance! Once Vulkan is feature complete, there won't be much purpose for AMD graphics users to ever go back to OpenGL in Dolphin. With an AMD APU, Vulkan shows that it can stand toe to toe with D3D11/12 in performance. This means our Linux AMD GPU users... well, before this point there was no point in trying Dolphin on that configuration. Now those users can get comparable performance to D3D11/12 on Windows without having to install Windows. Unfortunately for our Mac OS users, to our best knowledge they do not plan to support Vulkan. Vulkan for NVIDIA Users¶ NVIDIA users have the opposite problem. The OpenGL drivers are so fast that it's fairly difficult to find games that perform all that differently inVulkan than OpenGL. Twilight Princess is one of those exceptions. Much like D3D12, Vulkan greatly outperforms D3D11 and OpenGL when taking away the Twilight Princess speedhack provided by the emulator. NVIDIA users really have no reason to use Vulkan outside of the few rare cases where its efficiency really shines. Once it's feature complete and has some optimizations, this can change very fast. Note: NVIDIA's drivers are broken on Vulkan for Dualsource Blend. Dolphin uses this quite a bit, so, if you're planning on using the Vulkan backend on your NVIDIA cards, you'll need 368.81 or older on Windows or 367.44 or older on Linux. We'll plan on sending in some test cases so the drivers can be fixed. Again, OpenGL performs fairly similar for these users, so it shouldn't be considered too urgent. EDIT: This issue was fixed by 375.63. Vulkan on Android¶ Mobile users have been itching for Vulkan to give sweet sweet performance gains! Yeah, not happening yet. Mali crashes immediately on start, and it doesn't give any reason why. Adreno at least renders something, but it's completely wrong even on many test programs and Dolphin isn't close to playable. We haven't tested all the other mobile drivers yet, but so far it appears they have similar problems. On Android, Vulkan driver support just isn't ready yet. Vulkan on Intel using Mesa¶ For right now, Vulkan is slower than OpenGL on Intel Mesa due to several hardware features being left unimplemented. This should change in the near future as it's brought closer to completion. General Information about Vulkan Support¶ Vulkan support is finally here! So, what does it mean? Well, both Vulkan and D3D12's greatest strengths simply don't apply to most emulators. That means that we aren't going to see world changing performance boosts simply by implementing the API. Instead, we'll be looking at various optimizations that use Vulkan's unique abilities to help emulate games with quirks that are particularly demanding. Where Vulkan does shine, it really is great. Being able to play Twilight Princess without a specialized speedhack is a result of the newer APIs simply being more efficient, and there will likely be more cases where we can gain added accuracy without a cost to speed. But, that will come with time. On that note, while the Vulkan backend is very stable, it's not quite complete. The most notable missing feature is External FrameBuffer (XFB) support, which is because we're currently in the process of rewriting support. It felt a bit wasteful to greatly complicate the Vulkan backend for something that was going to get renovated soon anyway. Also, Vulkan lacking XFB support just means we can bug the developer behind it (phire) to work harder because our AMD Linux users are suffering greatly while he does things that aren't HybridXFB. The other missing feature is actually missing from Vulkan altogether: exclusive fullscreen. We're hopeful that extensions in the near future will rectify that, but, it's something to keep in mind for now. Unlike D3D12, we don't consider Vulkan to be quite as "experimental." It shouldn't randomly crash, it doesn't have any egregious hacks in the backend, and we have stenzek here to maintain it. There may still be occassional bugs, and, do remember titles that require XFB will not work for now. Other than that, have fun with it and see how it stacks up with our other backends. It should be a solid alternative to D3D12 for AMD users, and definitely has the potential to go further than OpenGL longterm! If you find any issues with the Vulkan Backend, please report them, we currently have a developer actively working on it so it's likely there will be a quick turn-around on issues!

They look the same, and offer similar (but not necessarily compatible) products, but they have in essence been in competition, to put it mildly. Arduino Srl represents Arduino co-founder Gianluca Martino's unilateral break from the original group of five founders, while the LLC is the primary licensor of the Arduino brand. It's been an ugly rift, but according to an announcement posted yesterday at Arduino.cc (the website of Arduino, LLC) and delivered in-person at the New York Maker Faire, it should now be behind us. A new unified entity called Arduino Holding will handle physical products, while another new entity, the Arduino Foundation, will continue to develop the open-source Arduino IDE. Some background: For many, Arduino is synonymous with DIY hardware hacking. It's not unearned: Hobbyists have been tinkering with microcontrollers forever, but the Arduino platform offered (and still offers) tools that allow pretty much anyone to start programming LEDs, robots, and lots and lots of backyard weather stations just out of the box. For some, it's a jumping off point into the deeper world of embedded and real-time systems, while for others it's an end in itself. As such, it mirrors the ethos of the Processing language, which is both a programming learning tool (as originally intended) and a digital art platform and community unto itself. The Arduino world is based on both Arduino boards—small, simple computers wired into user-friendly systems offering programmable input-output pins, timers, and other features, depending on the board—and the Arduino integrated-development environment (IDE), a piece of free software used for writing and uploading the code that governs an Arduino board. Said code is based on what can seem like its own programming language, but is really a user-friendly subset of C, which is the default language for programming small embedded systems and can be pretty tricky. So, unlike pretty much every other open-source project ever, Arduino has always had the peculiarity of having a physical product that costs money: the boards. What does it even mean to be open-source hardware? This has caused problems. In the beginning, Arduino, LLC was formed to license the Arduino name to hardware manufacturers. These manufacturers would (and still do) build Arduino boards to spec and then sell them. The manufacturer responsible for making the boards in Italy was Smart Projects Srl, which was founded by Martino, one of the original five. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, in 2008 Martino trademarked the Arduino name in Italy. In a retelling by Massimo Banzi, another of the original five founders, Martino kept this news to himself for almost two years. It was only discovered when lawyers with Arduino, LLC began the process of extending the Arduino trademark beyond the United States. Surprisingly, in Italy it was already registered. For several years, the two Arduinos cooperated, but this changed in 2014. In 2015, Banzi wrote the following in Make magazine: A year ago without explanation, Gianluca’s manufacturing company stopped cooperating with us and unilaterally stopped paying royalties. So if people bought an Arduino board made in Italy in the last year thinking they were supporting the project they should know that we didn’t receive any money for it despite the fact that we designed, documented, maintained and supported those products. (The other manufacturers are still by our side.) Last November, SmartProjects appointed a new CEO, Mr. Musto, who renamed the company to Arduino Srl and created a website called “Arduino” copying our graphics and layout, claiming to have invented Arduino with no mention of us four. They even started printing this new URL on all the new boards. Which all sounds pretty sketchy. But there are also a lot of straight-up Arduino imitators, and, besides that, the DIY hardware universe has naturally expanded and extended otherwise. Nowadays, we have Raspberry Pi, the Texas Instruments Energia platform, Teensyduino, Intel Edison, and others. It's pretty cool. Anyhow, the point is that it makes less and less sense for the Arduino world to remain fractured in a landscape decreasingly dominated by Arduino anyhow. That's my own interpretation of the reconciliation. Here's what Banzi had to say at Maker Faire: "Today is one of the best days in Arduino history. This allows us to start a new course for Arduino made of constructive dialogue and disruptive innovation in the Education, Makers and IoT fields. The Arduino Foundation will allow us to champion the core values of the Arduino Community within the open source ecosystem and to make our commitment to open source stronger than ever. This is really a new beginning for Arduino!" Topics: Makers, trademark, arduino, arduino srl, maker faire, hardware, machines, Disputes Contact the author by email or Twitter.

October 2, 2016 WSP Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to invest big on the cloud computing segment. The Redmond, Wa.-based tech giant has introduced a new type of programmable microchip – called field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in its data centers. The move was meant to make its cloud computing service even more competitive than its rivals. The chips are faster, cheaper, energy-efficient, and they can be programmed to power up new services. FPGAs are also able to take on new problems in the changing technologies and business models. They have the ability to execute various orders faster than an ordinary chip. Using FPGAs is not new for Microsoft. The chips are actually being used on Bing, Microsoft’s search engine to drive new search algorithms. They utilize artificial intelligence [AI] that mimics how the human brain works. An interesting fact here is that the chips have an AI executing capability which is “several orders of magnitude faster than ordinary chips could. As in, 23 milliseconds instead of four seconds of nothing on your screen.” FPGAs are also used to drive Azure, the company’s cloud computing business. In an interview by Wired, computer chip researcher Doug Burger said the chips give Microsoft “massive capacity and enormous flexibility, and the economics work.” He added that the FPGAs are set to become Microsoft’s standard, worldwide. Programmable chips are not exactly new and they have been around for decades. In fact, it was in 2009 when Burger, along with researcher Andrew Putnam, started thinking about using the chips online to provide new services. However, since FPGAs were not widely used then, it was not easy integrating them into Microsoft’s system. According to Burger, it took a while for former CEO Steve Ballmer to warm up to the idea of using FPGAs to develop new online services for its then-growing cloud computing business, pitching the idea in 2012. It was Microsoft executive Qi Lu who believed in the project and in the idea that the chips would transform the world, thus giving the green light to use FPGAs in the company’s search engine. Burger and Putnam worked on several prototypes under Project Catapult. The prototypes were meant to be used on Azure and Office 365 business productivity suite. According to a source that Wired did not name, the FPGAs will be used to “deliver encryption, compression, and machine learning to all of its users” on Office 365. CEO Satya Nadella announced Monday that Project Catapult is no longer a research-based project. The executive said the chips are now part of the company’s top priority, pouring $5 to $6 billion to fund the project. Using FPGAs may have an effect on the global chip market, particularly on Microsoft’s partner Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR), which is owned by Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). At the moment, the Redmond tech conglomerate is purchasing chips from Altera. The introduction of Microsoft’s own chips could affect Altera’s business. According to an Intel executive, she expects FPGAs to become one of the most widely used chips by major cloud computing companies by 2020.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Microsoft Surface Phone News and Updates: Upcoming Lineup to Come with Three Variants? Other Details and Possible Release Date Revealed [RUMORS] By Christian Ver Marcelo Oct 2, 2016 | 12:12 AM One of the most anticipated phones is Microsoft's new Surface Phone lineup. With a seemingly close release date, what features are to be expected with this premium device offering? Microsoft Surface Phone Various rumors point out the key features of the upcoming Microsoft Surface Phone. The device lineup first garnered attention when news broke out that it will be replacing the tech company's Lumia smartphone range. Microsoft also still has not confirmed the existence of the device yet, other than a possible accidental post on social media. Three Variants Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Although this rumor has been running in the mill for quite some time now, it is only fairly recent that it got validated. The Microsoft Surface Phone is said to be coming in three variants. These variations, expectedly, will be met with different price points and device specifications. As of now, the only detail available is that there will be a variant coming with 5.5 inches of display and another one with 6 inches. There is no word as of yet on whether there would be another display size. Inside the device, there will be a variant sporting 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The next tier will then tout 6GB of RAM and 128GB of memory. The most premium model will then come with an immense 8GB of RAM coupled with 512GB of internal storage. Microsoft Pen and Keyboard As previously reported, the Microsoft Surface Phone will emphasize productivity as its strongest suit. Following this vision, the tech giant made sure that people using the smartphone would be equipped with everything they need to turn the device into a fully pledged workstation. With this in mind, the Microsoft Surface Phone will then natively integrate with a pen and a keyboard. It is no secret that Microsoft's Surface line always had hybrid features, and this would continue with the Surface Phone. The Surface Pen will be compatible with the new smartphone lineup for a more precise and accurate input method. A detachable keyboard accessory would also be available for all the long typing sessions abound for the user. However, it is still unclear if these two peripherals would be included in the retail package or sold separately. Other Details and Release Date Other premium technologies have been rumored to grace the device. Microsoft was reportedly working on a new form of fingerprint scanning technology. Under the hood, the Surface Phones may pack the Snapdragon 821 or 830. There are also news of the Intel Kaby Lake chipset powering the device. Of course, Windows 10 Redstone will run the smartphone, as is with every Microsoft product. There are no set details for the release date of the Surface Phones as of yet. However, there are two rumors suggesting that the new device range will be launched either this October or in mid-2017.
