Microsoft announced the new Surface Pro for 2017 at an event in Shanghai, and the product is already up for pre-orders in the US and other countries. On the India site for Microsoft, Surface Pro (2017) is still listed as ‘coming soon’, and its India price has not been announced. Microsoft’s new Surface Pro is squarely aimed at the iPad Pro, so let’s compare the two devices. Surface Pro (2017) vs iPad Pro: Display, Dimensions and Design The Apple iPad Pro was launched in 2015, this is for the 12.9 inch version, which is a closer competitor of the new Surface Pro if you’re going just by the size. Apple did launch a smaller version of the iPad Pro in March 2016, which has a smaller 9.7-inch display. In terms of design, the new Surface Pro continues with the same look that we’ve come to expect from the series. Microsoft claims they have added over “800 new custom parts and used 99% of the space inside the device”. The company also claims to have improved the Surface Pro hinge that now has full 165-degree range of motion, and lets users go into a special ‘Studio Mode’ which has inspired the company’s Surface Studio desktop. Microsoft’s new Surface Pro has a 165-degree hinge, meaning it can be almost flat on the table. The new Surface Pro’s dimensions are 292 mm x 201 mm x 8.5 mm, and it weighs starting at 768 g for Intel m3 version going up all the way to 784 g for the Intel Core i7 processor version. Apple’s iPad Pro with 12.9-inch has the following dimensions: 305.7 mm x 220.6 mm x 6.9 mm, so yeah the iPad is a shade thinner than the new Surface Pro. But remember this one doesn’t have any hinge on the back. Apple expects you to rely on their custom covers for the same. Apple’s iPad Pro is also lighter at 713 grams for the WiFi-only version and 723 grams for WiFi + Cellular model. On the design front, Apple iPad Pro sticks with the design that we’ve come to expect of the iPad. It has the round home button with Touch ID on the front, and a metal chassis. The iPad colour scheme remains at Space Grey, Rose Gold and Gold. You’re getting Surface Pro 2017 in Platinum colour but Microsoft is introducing new colours later.  A new Surface Keyboard has also been launched, which is covered in the company’s next-generation Alcantara material. Microsoft calls this Surface Keyboard as “its most luxurious ever,” though this cover will add another 310 grams to the Surface Pro device. Apple’s Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro adds around 337 grams in weight to your device. Apple’s iPad Pro comes with support for Apple Pen. There are two display sizes in the iPad Pro series: 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch. On the Display front, Apple’s iPad Pro has a 12.9-inch screen which is LED-backlit with 2732 x 2048 pixels resolution, which comes to 264 pixels per inch (ppi). Apple has added fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating, anti-reflective coating and this is a fully laminated display. Apple iPad Pro has support for the Apple Pen on the display as well. With the new Surface Pro, Microsoft has kept the display size at 12.3-inch and calls it the PixelSense Display with a resolution of 2736 x 1824 pixels, which comes to 267 ppi. Microsoft’s Display comes with support for Microsoft’s new Surface Pen as well as the Studio Dial. With the new Display, Microsoft says it has 50 per cent more pixels than a 12-inch MacBook, and that they have provided a colour-switcher, so users can go from SRGB format to an enhanced colour format. Apple’s iPad Pro has a 12.9-inch screen which is LED-backlit with 2732 x 2048 pixels resolution, which comes to 264 pixels per inch (ppi). Processor, RAM, Storage The Apple iPad Pro 12.9-inch comes with 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage options. Apple’s iPad Pro comes with A9X chip with 64‑bit architecture, and there’s an embedded M9 co-processor as well. The device reportedly comes with 4GB RAM of RAM, but this is something Apple never confirms officially. With the new Surface Pro, Microsoft is introducing three processor variants, which are all 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake processors. The Intel Core M3, Intel i5 and i7 processor variants will be available with the Surface Pro.  It also comes TPM chip for enterprise security. RAM offered on the new Surface Pro is 4GB RAM, 8GB RAM or 16GB RAM. For graphics, Microsoft has will be using Intel HD Graphics 615 (m3), Intel HD Graphics 620 (i5) or Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 (i7) depending on the processor. Microsoft has also introduced a new Surface cover. The new Intel i5 processor on the Surface Pro come with a fanless architecture, says the company. On the storage side, Microsoft is giving users the following SSD options 128GB, 256GB, 512GB or 1TB. Ports, Connectivity Now with Apple’s iPad Pro you’re only getting the Lightning Connector port, and a headphone jack. So you can’t really plug in a USB stick or whatever else. Apple’s iPad Pro comes with WiFi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac; dual band (2.4GHz and 5GHz); HT80 with MIMO and Bluetooth 4.2. There’s also Cellular LTE version of the Apple iPad Pro. Sensors on the Apple iPad Pro are Touch ID (Fingerprint), Three‐axis gyro, Accelerometer, Barometer and Ambient light sensor.

Microsoft Surface Pro, you’re getting an 8MP rear camera and the front camera is 5MP with 1080p Skype HD video supported. Camera, Microphones Apple’s iPad Pro has a 8MP rear camera and 1.2MP front camera, which is a little outdated. The newer 9.7-inch iPad Pro has a 12MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera, for those who consider this important in their tablet. Apple’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro can record 1080p videos, but the newer one has capability for 4K recording as well. With the new Microsoft Surface Pro, you’re getting an 8MP rear camera and the front camera is 5MP with 1080p Skype HD video supported. The rear camera can also record and shoot 1080p Full HD video. There’s also support for Microsoft Windows Hello face authentication with the front camera. Battery life  Now battery is where Microsoft is promising the new Surface Pro is ahead of the rivals. Microsoft claims Surface Pro will last up to 13.5 hours of battery life. Now this is claimed for video playback and the testing was done with a “preproduction” device with Intel Core i5 processor, 256GB storage and 8 GB RAM. Even then, 13 and a half hours puts the Surface Pro ahead of the rivals. Apple’s iPad Pro has a built‐in 38.5‐watt‐hour lithium‐polymer battery with up to 10 hours of surfing the web on Wi‐Fi, watching video, or listening to music. This goes to nine hours for surfing the web on cellular data network. Apple’s iPad Pro starts in India at a price of Rs 65,900 officially for the 32GB version. (Source: AP) According to Microsoft, the new Surface Pro’s battery will last 50 per cent more than Surface Pro 4, and and 35 per cent more battery life than an iPad Pro.

By: Tyler Bernath | Editorials in Storage | Posted: 15 hours, 36 mins ago Comment () | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA   At the end of 2016, I knew time was running short for our beloved MacBook Pro. We purchased that MacBook in early 2014 to take on Thunderbolt 2 reviews since Windows support wasn't quite ready. Three years later the battery life was getting abysmal, to the point I had to keep it on AC power most of the day, the original 128GB SSD had died and was replaced and Thunderbolt 2 was no longer the hot new technology.   With that, discussion and research ensued to find a replacement, and at first, I was 100% set on getting the new Kaby Lake MacBook Pro. At launch, Apple had some issues with the touch bar, and the specs for the model I was looking at just weren't that great for the money, so I considered the current Thunderbolt 3 storage solutions and wouldn't you know, Windows has full-fledged support from nearly all vendors.     With vendor support for Windows, our options grew to include the Alienware 15 R3. After doing some research, I found the Kaby Lake models were fixed to take care of heat issues found in the Skylake models of 2016, and so I ordered our new test system and thanks to Corsair upgraded the memory, the system is spec'd out as below.   Intel Core i5 7300HQ 16GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4 3000 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB MyDigitalSSD BPX 480GB SSD Samsung 960 EVO 250GB SSD   This article will look at the storage performance of the Alienware 15 R3, internal and external. The drives we are using for this purpose include the BPX NVMe SSD from MyDigitalSSD in m.2 Slot 0 and the Samsung 960 EVO NVMe in m.2 Slot 1. The Intel 730 480GB SATA SSD will test the 2.5" drive performance along with USB-C and USB 3.0 while the LaCie Bolt3 will take on Thunderbolt 3.   Benchmarks handle performance differently as well. Anvils has long been a storage performance staple when it comes to storage, so we will pair that with CrystalDiskMark and one of my new favorites, Flash Bench to test the overall performance of each storage medium.     First, we dive in to get an overview of all the connectivity options of the Alienware 15 R3. Unboxing this unit, it's quite a bit heavier than our old MacBook Pro. It has a black and gunmetal gray color scheme, with the Alienware logo on the top. The edges of the panel and base have LED bars with full RGB support.     Starting on the left side of the notebook, we find USB 3.0 along with the USB-C port.     The backside houses gigabit LAN to the far left with DisplayPort and HDMI functionality next to it. The Thunderbolt 3 port is centered and followed by the Graphics Amplifier port and power input.     The right side houses a single USB 3.0 port.     Internally, the system has three m.2 slots. Two are 2280 capable while the third is 2240. The bottom right is where the 2.5" drive caddy resides.     Above, we are ready to install our BPX in SSD-3. The Samsung 960 EVO is in SSD-2 above the BPX.     Of course, no system would be complete without a killer set of memory. Thanks to Corsair we were able to outfit this system with a 16GB kit of Vengeance DDR4 3000 sticks.     NVMe Storage Performance     Starting off our performance tests, we take a look at the NVMe BPX from MyDigitalSSD. Anvils gives it a score of 9267 as a secondary drive reaching 1926 MB/s read and 1170 MB/s write.     Scooting over to CDM, we find the BPX reaching 2719 MB/s read and 1407 MB/s write in sequential QD32 while 4K QD1 sits at 37.2 MB/s or roughly 9500 read IOPS. Write came in at 160 MB/s or around 41K IOPS.     Over to flash bench, performance starts out at 2075 MB/s at 16M holds through 8M and then starts to taper off. Write performance, on the other hand, starts at 1245 MB/s and holds through 512K before it slowly tapers.     Starting over with the Samsung 960 EVO, Anvils gives it a score of 10449 with the Samsung NVMe driver installed. The sequential performance hit 1956 MB/s read and 1024 MB/s write, about the same as the BPX.     CDM showed much higher sequential performance on our EVO. 3145 MB/s read and 1293 MB/s write. 4KQD1 was near 40 MB/s read and 187 MB/s write.     Above, we have two runs through flash bench for the EVO. As you can see, sequential started near 2175 MB/s read and tapered quickly. Write performance is more linear starting around 1100 MB/s and holding that through 1M.     Thunderbolt 3 Storage Performance     Thunderbolt 3 performance can be summed up with just one image. I used the LaCie Bolt 3 before I sent it back to Seagate for this and as you can see I was reaching 2400 MB/s read and a touch over 1000 Mb/s write. Theoretically, Thunderbolt 3 should be able to reach ~4.6GB/s, so we will certainly be on the lookout for which vendor goes after the performance crown first.     SATA 6Gb/s Storage Performance     Back at it, the Alienware 15 R3 uses the CM236 chipset, so things like USB 3.0 and SATA 6Gb/s are native in the chipset. Using the Intel 730, we look at SATA performance for the AW15 and notice it's certainly on par. 496 MB/s read and 455 MB/s write and a score of 4413 in Anvils.     CDM gives slightly higher results of 546 MB/s read and 498 MB/s write. 4KQD1 comes in at 32 MB/s read and 86 MB/s write or 8000 read IOPS and 22K write IOPS.     Flash bench shows strong performance for our 730 holding steady at 505 MB/s read and 496 MB/s write.     USB Storage Performance   USB performance for the AW15 lets us use the USB-C port on the left side. Internally, this isn't a 10Gbps port but rather a gen 1 with a fancy connector. Often newer USB-C devices, even if they use the same drive, will have higher performance due to the better enclosure chipset. For this test, I used the Plugable USB-C Dock that's coming up for review very soon. This dock utilizes the ASMedia 1351 USB 3.1 to SATA bridge.     Performance starts off with Anvils giving our Intel 730 a score of 3083, 1200 points lower than SATA 6Gbps.     CDM performance was higher over USB-C in Sequential read and write. 4KQD1 suffered slightly compared to SATA, bringing in about half the performance.     Flash bench showed smooth performance both read and write. We start high at 490 - 500MB/s and cost slowly down to 400 MB/s at 256K.     Final Thoughts   All in I paid around $1100 for this notebook thanks to sales and reward points I had saved. The base configuration for this model comes in at $1199.99, that's with a 180GB SATA m.2 and a single 8GB stick of DDR4 and GTX 1050 Ti, boosting to the GTX 1060 6GB, brings the MSRP to $1349.99. I should mention this does come stock with an NVIDIA G-Sync display, Tobii eye tracking, and a full array of RGB lighting.   As far as I/O is concerned, I find it lacking, to be honest. I use this mainly on my couch with a LapDesk XXL and Logitech G403. That leaves me with the mouse plugged in on the left side in the Type-C port, leaving the USB-C on the left side and a secondary Type-C on the right. The secondary Type-C is too close to the mouse and its movement to use with any full-size device, especially flash drives or devices with long cords. The ideal application would be to find a wireless mouse with a low-profile USB adapter, or optionally find a Thunderbolt 3 dock suitable to your needs.   Getting down to the performance, the AW15 is stacked. With a possible three m.2 and one SATA, there is potential for high capacity / very quick storage. In my tests, I had both the m.2 2280 slots filled and found no performance loss in this configuration. As you saw from the benchmarks above, the AW15 allowed the BPX to push 2700 MB/s read and 1400 MB/s write and 33K Write IOPS. One thing of note and a few of you have asked me about this, utilities like CDI and other smart monitors will show the BPX having temps sometimes over 60c, and in my case, ran at 63c for a long period.   I talked to MyDigitalSSD and came away with this quote: "Not to worry, our drive definitely runs hot, but the main reason for that is because we put the heat sensor on the controller itself whereas our competition put the sensor further away on the PCB. You will not need to worry unless the drive breaks the 120c mark." The 960 EVO performed remarkably well too, reaching 3100 MB/s read and 1300 MB/s write in sequential tests. 4K performance was near 10K IOPOs read and 37K write QD1.   USB 3.1 and SATA were both up to the task with SATA providing 560 MB/s read and 500 MB/s write with our Intel 730. That same SSD carried its performance over to USB 3.1 in the Alienware 15 R3 reaching 561 MB/s read and 500 MB/s write. 4KQD1 was a bit lower over USB 3.1 than SATA but both performed quite well.   The Alienware 15 R3 offers a solid amount of value in its base configuration. I find the three m.2 slots and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity the most useful for my purposes and you can certainly look forward to Thunderbolt 3 reviews coming to you very soon using this notebook.

This is perhaps why other companies look at Apple as a measure to which they can make their products to look good. The latest addition to the ever increasing number of companies following Apple’s footsteps is Huawei. The company just announced its very first laptop in the market; the Huawei MateBook X. Huawei is known for its high-end smartphones as well as tablets and hybrid devices. Now, the company has dipped its toe into the mainstream electronics market by introducing the MateBook X. Apart from taking the look of the MacBook, the MateBook X does have a few tricks up its sleeve. Starting with an Intel Kaby Lake processor The one thing that a MacBook does not have is a good processor. Right now, the most that one can have on the laptop is an m7 chip. Not to say that the Intel m7 processor is a bad one but it does not compare to a full-fledged Intel processor. The Huawei MateBook X, while sharing some design styles, sports the latest Intel Kaby Lake chip. Not only that, the laptop can have as much as an i7 under its hood. In addition to the new processor, it also packs an 8GB RAM as well as 512GB of flash storage. Bigger display Another spec of the MacBook that users have much gripe on is its 12-inch display. While this is more than enough for most applications, it is still rather easy to run out of space. The good thing is, the MateBook X does offer a bit more headroom with its 13-inch panel. Apple MacBook (via apple.com) The 2160×1440 IPS panel has an aspect ration of 3:2, similar to a Surface Pro, and has a brightness of 350 nits. In terms of color space, it can recreate 100 percent of sRGB color. More ports to connect with MacBook users all know how it is to live a dongle life. It is not a secret that the laptop only has one USB Type-C port that doubles as its charging port. Therefore, anyone who uses the said port for charging will not be able to use it for other purposes. The good news is, the Huawei MateBook X has two USB Type-C ports. On top of that, it comes with its own MateDock that splits one of the USB 3.0 ports to two USB Type-A and an HDMI port as well as a VGA port. Enough juice to last a day of use All of these impressive hardware specs will be for naught if there is not enough juice to power them all. Nowadays, most users choose devices that last at least eight hours as a matter of convenience. And this is where a MacBook flourishes. The good news is, the Huawei MateBook X is not the one to be left behind. Packing a big enough 41.4Wh lithium-ion battery, the Huawei laptop can last for up to ten hours of video playback. Huawei MateBook X (via huawei.com) MacBook-esque features For users who are very concerned about security, the MateBook X does have fingerprint scanner embedded underneath the power button. This feature not only prevents non-registered users from gaining access to the device, it can also identify who the user is. Price and release date For anyone looking to buy the Huawei MateBook X can do so starting at $1,399. It comes with an Intel i5, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of flash storage. For those looking for more, there an i7 option for $1,899. Unfortunately, Huawei is yet to announce the official release of the laptop. Nevertheless. Consumers can expect the laptop to become available anything before the end of this year. For more updates on the Huawei MateBook X, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 was announced in Shanghai at Microsoft's event on 23 May 2017. Starting from $1199 in Australia, the new Surface will be available on 15 June 2017, the same day as the new Surface Laptop. The new 2017 Surface Pro remains largely unchanged from the Pro 4, but has one significant change - Microsoft no longer considers it a 2-in-1 device, but rather a laptop, as the company believes it provides everything you'd need on a laptop.  The new device is named as the 'new Surface Pro', it doesn't follow the numeric sequence many thought it would follow. So no, it isn't called the 'Microsoft Surface Pro 5'. Microsoft Surface Pro: Features and specs The new Surface Pro looks identical to the Pro 4, but has several fundamental differences. The biggest news is the inclusion of new Intel Kaby Lake processors. This time around, the new Surface Pro will start shipping with the Intel Core m processors too, which sits aside the Core i5 and Core i7 processors. This also means that its internal graphics have received a cyclical update, with the Intel HD 615 and 620 in the Core m3 and Core i5 models respectively. The Core i7 model comes with the more powerful Iris Plus 640 iGPU. Memory configurations haven't changed, with 4-, 6- and 16GB models available. Its internal memory has received a healthy boost with PCIe NVMe technology now used throughout its internal SSDs, with a choice of 128-, 256-, 512GB and 1TB are available. Another notable change is its quoted battery life. It's now 13.5hrs, up from 9hrs on the Pro 4. This sizable increase in battery life will be good news for those looking to use the laptop without the sight of a power plug. If you like listening to music directly from your Surface Pro, you'll be pleased to know that the 2017 version focuses on delivering better sound. A front-facing 5-megapixel camera and microphone are also used to access Skype and Windows Hello features, which are both fundamental parts Windows 10. There's also an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera for taking pictures of scenery. USB Type-C is still missing from the new Surface Pro, with Microsoft opting to maintain its proprietary connector for charging. On the plus side, there's still an SD card slot, mini-DisplayPort, a standard USB Type-A 3.0 port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Wireless connectivity options include Wi-Fi 802.11ac and Bluetooth v4.1. Unfortunately, the rumours of a stunning 4K display aren't true. The same 2,736 x 1,824 (267ppi) resolution is utilised with a PixelSense display, which allows multitouch and a visually accurate display. The Surface's accessories have also received an update, with both the keyboard and pen receiving healthy updates. The Type Cover keyboard now has slightly more travel distance, allowing you to type more naturally. The pen has double a number of supported pressure levels, allowing you to more accurately draw or write on your new Surface Pro. The Type Cover is available from $169 and the Surface Pen is set to cost $US99. You'll be pleased to know that you can use the $US99 Surface Dial with thew new Surface Pro. This allows designers greater freedom and allows them to replicate a Microsoft Surface Studio. Finally, you can look forward to LTE variants of the new Surface Pro, with Microsoft announcing that in Fall 2017 there will be devices that can independently from an access point.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Two pros enter, one pro leaves: Microsoft’s… Two pros enter, one pro leaves: Microsoft’s Surface Pro takes on Apple’s MacBook Pro 13 By Jayce Wagner — Updated May 23, 2017 4:57 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Now more than ever, ultra-portable tablets and laptops allow us to get work done from anywhere, without sacrificing power for portability. These two features are no longer mutually exclusive, which means the market is chock-full of nimble, lightweight solutions that will appeal to consumers of all demographics. Capitalizing on the burgeoning trend, Microsoft has doubled-down on its popular Surface Pro 2-in-1, by refreshing the internal components with the latest Intel Core i5 and i7 chips, refining the internal design, and iterating on a winning form factor. But it’s still just a tablet, right? Well, yes and no. Between the Type Cover and a full version of Windows 10, the new Surface Pro continues to provide a decent mobile computing experience in a lightweight package. Unlike the iPad Pro, which uses a modified version of Apple’s iOS, the Surface Pro is a fully-functional laptop (when you want it to be). With that in mind, let’s see how the new Surface Pro stacks up against a portable, premium laptop: Apple’s latest MacBook Pro 13. Specs MacBook Pro 13 Surface Pro (2017) Dimensions 13.75 x 9.48 x .61 (in) 11.50 x 7.9 x 0.33 (in) Weight  4.02 pounds 1.69 – 1.73 pounds Processor  6th-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 7th-generation Intel Core m3, i5, or i7 RAM 8GB, 16GB 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB Display 13.3-inch Retina display 12.3-in PixelSense Display Resolution 2,560 × 1,600 2,736 x 1,824 Storage 256GB, 512GB, 1TB SSD 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB SSD Networking 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, optional LTE Ports 2x or 4x USB-C (Thunderbolt 3), any can charge; 3.5mm headset 1x USB Type-A, Surface Connect, 3.5mm headphone jack, Mini DisplayPort, microSDXC card reader Webcam 720p FaceTime HD Windows Hello face sign-in camera, 5.0MP 1080p front-facing camera, 8.0MP 1080p rear-facing autofocus camera Operating System MacOS Sierra Windows 10 Battery Up to 10 hours Up to 13.5 hours Price $1,500+ $800+ Availability Available now Available June 15, 2017 Review 6 out of 10 Hands-on Design: Magnesium vs. aluminum The MacBook Pro 13, for all its faults, is a remarkably well-designed product. Apple’s industrial design is iconic, simple, and high-quality in a way most competitors have yet to match. That said, Microsoft has come closer than ever before with its latest Surface lineup, including the new Surface Pro. The Surface Pro’s magnesium-alloy chassis feels every bit as nice as the MacBook Pro 13’s aluminum unibody. They’re both rock-solid, and nearly seamless. Metal-and-glass construction makes both a joy to use, and they’re robust enough that tossing them in a bag never feels like a dangerous proposition. In everyday use, the MacBook Pro is just present enough — it does an excellent job of getting out of your way. The keyboard has short travel, but a welcome tactile feel, and the trackpad is large and spacious. Conversely, the Surface Pro offers a uniquely intuitive user experience with its touchscreen and Surface Pen integration. The MacBook Pro 13 is a great laptop, but the Surface Pro is a great tablet, with some laptop functionality. The keyboard cover, upholstered with that super-soft and luxurious Alcantara fabric, gets the job done and looks good doing it — but more often than not you might find yourself foregoing it entirely to interact with the Surface Pro’s gorgeous and responsive touchscreen. Both products exemplify different design sensibilities, delivering near-perfect craftsmanship in their own unique ways. They’re both at the top of their respective games, using clever, elegant design to elevate what could otherwise be typical and pedestrian user experiences. Bottom line, which one has the better overall design? Considering nothing else but product design, the MacBook Pro 13 is hard to beat as a laptop, and the Surface Pro is hard to beat as a tablet. That’s really it. This is the one area where there these two products are too different to really compare. Declaring a winner here would be a disservice to both products, both achieve and execute their design goals near-perfectly. Winner: Tie Power: 6th-generation Iris vs. 7th-generation HD If you just looked at the spec sheet, it might be hard to determine which one of these products was which. Both feature similar processor options, both have similar RAM and storage options, and both have a conspicuous lack of ports. Plus, neither the MacBook Pro 13 or the Surface Pro feature discrete graphics cards, instead relying on Intel HD or Intel Iris graphics. When it comes to memory and storage, both products have a decent range of choices available. The Surface Pro dips a little deeper into the low-end with its lowest RAM and storage options than the MacBook Pro 13 does, but otherwise the mid and high-end versions of both products can be scaled up to the same maximums — 1TB of storage space, and 16GB of RAM. In everyday use, both products provided more than enough horsepower to get through a typical workday. Neither one is going to be good for games beyond maybe Hearthstone, but neither is going to hold you back while doing some serious multi-tasking, either. It’s worth mentioning that the Surface Pro is running the latest 7th-generation “Kaby Lake” processors from Intel, so even though they’re comparable to what’s under the hood of the MacBook Pro 13, they’re going to have a little bit of a leg up when it comes to raw performance and energy efficiency. Also, the MacBook Pro features Intel Iris graphics up and down the line, which is a bit of a step up from the Intel HD graphics featured on the Core m3 and Core i5 versions of the Surface Pro. However, you can enjoy Intel Iris graphics if you opt for the Core i7 model of Surface Pro. Overall, the systems are very similar in performance. The MacBook Pro is more powerful in its base configuration, but also more expensive. They’re about equal in top-tier trim; however, the Surface Pro uses the latest Intel processors, so it obtains the win. Winner: Surface Pro Form factor: Tablet vs. laptop This is a battle between two ultra-portable computers, after all, so portability is of critical importance. Which one has the greater work-from-anywhere factor? Well for that answer, we’ll need to carefully weigh our options. Seriously, weight is an important aspect here. The MacBook Pro 13 is remarkably small; it’s svelte and slim, and at just four pounds, it fits in almost any messenger bag or backpack with ease. The Surface Pro is also thin and light, weighing in at just under two pounds. You could stuff two Surface Pros into a bag and it would still be lighter than a single MacBook Pro 13. It’s almost cheating, though. The Surface Pro’s keyboard doesn’t house any hardware — it’s just a keyboard — and it’s partially made of fabric. Still, the Surface Pro is far lighter than the lightweight MacBook Pro 13, and it has a few other advantages worth mentioning. Namely, it’s a 2-in-1. Need to type up a paper from a coffee shop? No problem, just pop the keyboard on there and get started. Need a tablet to read before bed? Sure thing, Surface Pro has you covered… just snap the keyboard off. These are two things that the MacBook Pro 13, as a traditional laptop, just can’t do. Add on top of that the Surface Pro’s superior battery life, and we have a clear winner here. The Surface Pro lasts around 13 hours on a single charge, while the MacBook Pro 13 only made it about nine hours on our internal tests. While the MacBook Pro 13 is one of the most portable laptops on the market today, the Surface Pro has it beat because of its versatility — it is by its very nature more portable. Winner: Surface Pro Price: A lot of money vs. even more money Well, this one’s pretty straightforward, right? Just point out which one costs more, full stop. Unfortunately, it’s actually a little tricky to tease out which one is the better value. Sure, the MacBook Pro 13 starts at $1,500, and the Surface Pro starts at $800 — that’s a pretty clear-cut difference — but that’s for the barebones versions of both products, and the prices only go up from there. For $1,500, you can get a decent MacBook Pro. For $800, however, you’d get a very underpowered Surface Pro running an Intel Core m3 processor that has pretty low headroom when it comes to real computing tasks — like running more than a handful of applications at a time. Moving on up the spectrum, the MacBook Pro 13 tops out at $2,900 for the fully tricked-out version, while the Surface Pro tops out at $2,700. At those prices, that’s a pretty narrow margin, and both products net you nearly identical specs. It’s also worth mentioning that no matter how much you spend on the Surface Pro, it doesn’t come bundled with any of the above-pictured accessories. That’s right, no Type Cover, Surface Pen, or Surface Dial will be in the box — even if you invest in the fully-loaded version. It’s an odd choice, given that the Surface Pro isn’t a 2-in-1 without the keyboard component, and you’ll have to spend an extra $130 for the privilege. Add on to that another $60 for the Surface Pen, and the grand total comes out to $2,890. That only puts it at ten bucks cheaper than a fully maxed-out MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar. Add the keyboard cover and pen to the low-end version of the Surface Pro and you’re looking at $990, which is an awful lot to spend on a “laptop” with an underpowered Intel m3 processor and the bare minimum amount of RAM and storage space. Winner: Tie Innovative design gives Surface Pro the win Which one should you buy? Well, there are plenty of great laptops, tablets, and hybrid 2-in-1s on the market today, and some of them might even require less compromise than one of these two products. The Surface Pro suffers from unfortunate up-charging, and the MacBook Pro 13 is a little too expensive for what you end up getting, and the Touch Bar is only available on the mid and high-end models. Still, the Surface Pro gains the nod. It’s slightly less expensive and more versatile than the MacBook Pro 13, yet also takes a minor edge in hardware. Apple’s MacBook Pro 13 is no slouch, but it feels a bit old-fashioned compared to Microsoft’s latest.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation's 2018 Ice Lake Challenge This chip giant will have to tighten up its execution in manufacturing to meet its goal of a product refresh next year. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 23, 2017 at 6:30PM Later this year, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to release its eighth-generation Core processor family for personal computers. These chips, which should initially roll out for mainstream notebook computers as well as for enthusiast gaming desktops, are expected to be manufactured using the chipmaker's new 14nm++ manufacturing technology. As the company disclosed back at its Technology and Manufacturing Day earlier this year, its 14nm++ delivers roughly a 10% performance increase over its 14nm+ technology (used to manufacture its seventh-generation Core processors) that Intel said offered a 12% performance boost over its initial 14nm technology, which was used to manufacture both its fifth- and sixth-generation Core processors. Image source: Intel. Since Intel has made it plain that it aspires to launch new personal computer processors at an annual clip, it's going to need to follow up those eighth-generation Core chips with new products in roughly the third quarter of 2018. Let's go over what those products are likely to be and what challenges Intel may face in bringing them to market. The 10nm+ question In the second half of this year, Intel is expected to go into production on its first-generation 10nm manufacturing technology, known simply as 10nm. Per Intel's disclosures at its Technology and Manufacturing Day, the 10nm technology will offer lower performance than its 14nm++ technology, but it promises to offer power consumption and chip area benefits. Those products, which are based on the company's Cannon Lake processor architecture, are expected to begin shipping either by the end of 2017 or in early 2018. Now, Intel does not plan to roll Cannon Lake out broadly across its personal computer product portfolio; it's going to be limited to thin-and-light notebooks. Desktop personal computers and higher-performance notebooks will be serviced by Intel's eighth-generation Core products. What this means, then, is that in the second half of 2018, Intel is going to need to begin rolling out products based on its Ice Lake processor architecture for the desktop and high-performance notebook segments. It would also probably be in Intel's best interests to replace the Cannon Lake chips for thin-and-light notebooks with Ice Lake based ones in that time frame, too. Intel hasn't disclosed much about Ice Lake, but there is evidence to suggest that it will represent a substantial architectural overhaul relative to the eighth-generation Core processors, as well as even the Cannon Lake chips (which Intel is apparently still trying to figure out how to brand). I think it's likely that Ice Lake will be manufactured using technology that Intel dubs 10nm+, a performance-enhanced version of the original 10nm technology. Here's what gives me pause, though: If Intel has struggled mightily to get its original 10nm technology into high-volume manufacturing (production start is nearly two years late from its original schedule telegraphed all the way back in 2013), the company's ability to deliver on a 10nm+ technology in time for product launches in the third quarter of 2018 is certainly questionable. Foolish takeaway Right now, I'm watching for signs that Intel's execution in both chip manufacturing technology and product development will continue to improve. The company's recent pull-ins of Skylake-X for high-end desktops and Coffee Lake-S for mainstream desktops are certainly encouraging, but these products are manufactured on derivatives of the company's mature 14nm technology. I want to see how Intel handles the transition to its first-generation 10nm technology (given the delays thus far, I'm not encouraged) and how quickly it can push out products based on performance-enhanced versions of that technology. If Intel shows obvious signs of improved execution over the next couple of product cycles, then my confidence in the company's manufacturing arm will improve.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Adam Schiff says the House intelligence committee also plans to subpoena Michael Flynn for documents https://t.co/mUpSIIdPng— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 23, 2017 The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said Tuesday the panel may join its Senate counterpart in subpoenaing two businesses associated with former national security adviser Michael Flynn for documents related to its ongoing Russia probe. Flynn declined to cooperate with both the House and Senate intelligence committees’ subpoenas, leading the Senate panel to issue subpoenas of Flynn's businesses, lawmakers announced earlier Tuesday. Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffHouse Intel panel likely to also subpoena Flynn businesses, Dem says Ex-CIA head: Intel showed contacts between Russians and Trump team Trump asked intel chiefs to speak out against FBI's Russia probe: report MORE (D-Calif.) said the House panel is considering similar measures. “We have also been turned down in our request by Mr. Flynn to come and testify and provide documents,” Schiff said on CNN’s “The Situation Room,” referring to the Senate Intelligence Committee’s response. ADVERTISEMENT “So we are going to be entertaining the same options in terms of our subpoenas, which I hope will go out shortly to obtain these documents.” Schiff said he doesn’t believe the Fifth Amendment, which protects an individual against self-incrimination, extends to an individual's businesses. “There are court decisions, that provide there may be a limited Fifth Amendment right in terms of document production but it is only limited. I don’t think it extends to businesses,” the California lawmaker said. Schiff added that if Flynn as the person in question is in possession of the documents, they still may not be protected. “And with respect to the person Michael Flynn, if these are documents that are — that the person, the target, is known to possess, then their testimonial character is a lot less — and even those documents may not be covered by an invocation of the Fifth Amendment so we need to pursue these documents aggressively,” he continued. The retired general left his top White House post in February after misleading Vice President Pence about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. regarding sanctions targeting Moscow. Flynn invoked his Fifth Amendment right in declining to comply with a Senate Intelligence Committee subpoena, citing an “escalating public frenzy” surrounding Russia investigation request. The New York Times broke the news last week that Trump reportedly asked then-FBI Director James Comey to let “go” of his investigation into Flynn. The president has publicly called the Russia probe a “witch hunt.”  Tags Adam Schiff   View the discussion thread. Most Popular Most Popular Discussed Past: 1 day 1 Here are the 66 programs...

(Bebeto Matthews/AP) By Matt Day, The Seattle Times Published: May 23, 2017, 4:16 PM A   A Microsoft is updating its Surface tablet line, introducing a device that drops the numeral branding from the tablet and adds battery life and horsepower. The Surface Pro, introduced at a media event in China on Tuesday, looks much like the Surface Pro 4 that Microsoft released in October 2015. But inside are updated Intel processors and, Microsoft says, battery life that lasts as much as 50 percent longer than the previous iteration. The cost of the new device will range from $799 for a version powered by Intel’s Core M processor, to $2,699 for one outfitted with a more powerful seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor and 16 gigabytes of RAM. Those prices don’t include the Surface’s type cover ($129), essentially a requirement for the tablet to function as a laptop replacement as Microsoft touts in advertisements. The 12.3-inch touch screen is built for interaction with the Surface Pen. Microsoft’s Surface line launched with a thud in 2012, but a recent run of polished devices have earned better reviews and made the company’s venture into computer hardware a viable line of business. Surface devices, including the Surface Studio desktop PC and the Surface Book laptop, brought in more than $4 billion in revenue during the 12 months that ended in March. A new offering, the Surface Laptop, was introduced earlier this month. The devices have also helped fuel the growth in demand for more-portable laptops, and spurred other computer makers to spice up their offerings in the competitive, and shrinking, market for PCs. The Surface Pro, available for pre-order Tuesday, is expected to be available June 15 in 27 markets, including the United States, Canada and much of Western Europe. The device also will launch then in China – a market where Microsoft’s computers have tended to arrive on a delayed basis, if at all. The country has historically been a tough market for Microsoft, with widespread software piracy and state-mandated skepticism of foreign-built software hampering sales of Windows and Office software. The event to unveil the Surface Pro, held in Shanghai, is intended to signal a push to grab a slice of the country’s fast-growing market for computing devices, said Yusuf Mehdi, who leads marketing for Microsoft’s Windows and Devices unit. Microsoft is “really entering China in a more significant way with devices,” he said. In addition to the new Surface Pro, the Surface Studio and Surface Laptop will also be available in China in June.

The Huawei MateBook E is the successor to the original MateBook 2-in-1. This comes with a 12-inch 2,160x1,440 IPS touchscreen, 4 or 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM, and 128, 256, or 512GB of storage (on SSD). To power it you get a choice of 7th Generation Intel Core m3 or i5 processors (both Y-series), along with Intel HD615 graphics. It's kept running by a 4,430 mAh battery which should provide up to 9 hours of battery life. Huawei MateBook E The MateBook E will be offered in Titanium Grey and Champagne Gold, starting at 999 and going up to 1,299. It comes with a revamped folio keyboard and weighs 640g without it and 1.1 kg with it. The MateBook X is essentially Huawei's own interpretation of Apple's MacBook. The MateBook X bears a striking resemblance to that device, but improves upon it in a lot of aspects. First off, the display. The X has a 13-inch 2,160x1,440 IPS panel, with incredibly thin bezels. In fact, it has an 88% screen-to-body ratio. Huawei MateBook X It's fanless and ships with a 41.4 Wh battery that's apparently good for up to 10 hours of use on one charge. You can configure the MateBook X with a 7th Gen Intel Core i5 or i7 (both U-series and with Intel HD620 graphics), 4 or 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM, and a 256 or 512GB SSD. The X weighs just 1.05kg and is 12.5mm thick. It will start at 1,399 and go up to 1,699. Color options are Prestige Gold, Rose Gold, and Space Grey. Finally, the MateBook D is a more traditional laptop with a 15.6" 1080p screen, i5 or i7 CPU, optional Nvidia graphics, 4/8/16GB of RAM, a 128 or 256GB SSD or a 512GB or 1TB HDD, and a 1.9kg footprint. It will start at 799 and go up to 999 depending on which configuration you pick. It will be out in Champagne Gold, Space Grey, and Aurora Blue.

The Euclid dev kit is basically a small Linux-powered computer with a series of sensors and cameras that allow it to work as the brains of a robot (or as just its eyes if you want to send data to a more powerful machine for processing). Intel is taking pre-orders for the new kit for $399 and plans to begin shipping it May 31st.   In addition to the Cherry Trail processor, the Intel Euclid Development Kit features 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, 802..11n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, and GPS, USB 3.0, micro USB, and micro HDMI ports, and a 2,000 mAh battery. It also has an Intel RealSense ZR300 camera system for sensing depth and tracking motion, as well as ambient light, proximity, and motion sensors including an accelerometer, digital compass, and gyroscope. There are also environmental sensors for things like altitude, humidity, and temperature. In other words, while the Intel Euclid Development Kit looks a bit like an Intel Compute Stick, the difference is that this little standalone computer is aware of its surroundings. It also has a 1 watt mono speaker and a noise-canceling mic, which could come in handy for applications that require voice control and audio feedback. It ships with Ubuntu 16.04 software with a “Robotics Operating System.” You can find more details at Intel’s new Euclid Community site. via LinuxGizmos Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 2 Comments on "Intel launches Euclid Developers Kit for robot makers for $399" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest riddick Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Lime Microsystems has gone to Crowd Supply to launch three fully open source LimeNET computers for software defined radio (SDR) applications. The systems run Ubuntu “Snappy” Core Linux on Intel’s Core processors, enabling access to an open, community-based LimeSDR App Store using the Ubuntu Core snap packaging and update technology. The SDR processing is handled by three variations on last year’s open source LimeSDR board, which run Intel’s (Altera) Cyclone IV FPGA. LimeNET Mini, LimeNET Enterprise, and LimeNET Base Station (left to right, not scaled to size) (click image to enlarge) While the LimeNET Mini and mid-range LimeNET Enterprise are based on two versions of the original USB-interfaced LimeSDR boards (using micro Type-B and Type-A USB ports, respectively), the LimeNET Core, which can be extended into the LimeNET Base Station with the addition of a LimeNET Amplifier Chassis, uses a newer, more advanced “LimeNET QPCIe” board. The boards support SDR applications including residential network cellular base stations, IoT gateways, media streaming, test & measurement, radio astronomy, radar, drone control, and more. SDR technology lets you program, augment, and experiment with wireless communications without swapping hardware. It enables the development of highly complex networks across a range of standards and frequencies, and supports OTA updating, a feature that is handled on LimeSDR systems using Ubuntu Core’s snap mechanism. LimeSDR board with antennas (click image to enlarge) All the LimeSDR boards support cellular protocols like 2G, 3G, and 4G, as well as 5G prototypes, along with general wireless protocols such as WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, RFID, and digital broadcasting standards. They also support IoT-oriented protocols like LoRa, Sigfox, NB-IoT, LTE-M, and Weightless. All the systems have a 15-meter transmission range for LTE, although the Base Station model’s range can be greatly extended with the Amplifier. The LimeNET Crowd Supply campaign runs through July 13, with shipments ranging from the end of Oct. 2017 to the end of Feb. 2018. The three pre-qualified LimeNET systems (four including the Base Station bundle) and separately available LimeNET peripherals are as follows: LimeNET Mini — $1,899 (early bird), $2,199 (campaign), $2,399 (pre-order), $2,599 (retail); ships Oct. 31 LimeNET Enterprise — $2,699 (campaign), $2,899 (pre-order), $2,999 (retail); ships Oct. 31 LimeNET Core — $7,699 (campaign), $8,099 (pre-order), $8,499 (retail); ships Nov. 30 LimeNET Base Station — $17,250 (includes Core plus LimeNET Amplifier Chassis); ships Feb. 28 LimeNET Amplifier Chassis (alone) — $13,199; ships Feb. 28 LimeNET QPCIe Board (alone) — $2,599; ships Nov. 30 For those who paid $300 for a LimeSDR board, these prices might come as something of a shock. However, they’re really quite reasonable compared to the pricing of proprietary SDR systems, especially when you factor in the cost of the dedicated PC needed to run the LimeSDR board in the first place. The LimeNET Base Station bundle, meanwhile, saves you about $3,650.   LimeNET Mini The 112 x 120 x 52mm LimeNET Mini runs Ubuntu Core on a dual-core, 2.7GHz/3.5GHz Intel Core i7-7500U of the Kaby Lake generation with 15W TDP. The system provides 32GB of DDR4-2133 RAM and a 512GB SSD. The LimeNET Mini is pre-loaded with WiFi-ac and Bluetooth, as well as the shielded, USB micro Type-B based LimeSDR board for SDR. LimeNET Mini (left) and embedded SBC details (click images to enlarge) The LimeNET Mini is further equipped with a GbE port, 2x USB 3.0 ports, and 2x USB 3.1 ports, one of which uses a Type-C interface. You get an HDMI 2.0 port for up to 4096 x 2160 @ 60Hz resolution and a mini-DisplayPort 1.2 for up to 3840 x 2160 @ 60Hz. A Realtek ALC255 audio based mic and headset jack is also available. The LimeNET Mini offers 5x antennas, one of which is dedicated to HR reception, a feature lacking in the other LimeNET models. There’s also a debug connector, a fan, a 19 VDC input (3.42A, 65W), and an injection molded plastic and stainless steel case.   LimeNET Enterprise The LimeNET Enterprise ships with a shielded, LimeSDR board version with a USB Type-A host interface, that is very close to the original. In fact, those who ordered the aluminum case option for the original LimeSDR board campaign can get a discounted or $1,899 Enterprise model that requires that they supply their own LimeSDR board. The Enterprise model is larger than the Mini at 165 x 190 x 43mm, and offers a quad-core 3.4GHz/4.0GHz Core i7-6700 processor (65W TDP) that is more powerful despite its foundation in the earlier 6th Generation Skylake family. LimeNET Enterprise (left) and embedded SBC details (click images to enlarge) Like the Mini, the Enterprise supplies 32GB DDR4-2133. You also get a 1TB HDD for storage, 2x USB 3.0 ports, and 6x USB 2.0 ports. Other features include 4K-ready DP and HDMI ports, an SD slot, dual M.2 slots, audio jacks, a debug connector, and a GbE port (but no onboard WiFi). There’s a 19 V (4.73A, 90W) power supply, custom heat pipe cooling with dual fans, and 4x antennas for the LimeSDR.   LimeNet Core and LimeNET Base Station The LimeNet Core, which transforms into the LimeNET Base Station with the addition of a LimeNET Amplifier Chassis, ships with the new “LimeNET QPCIe” board. The 265 x 270 x 260mm LimeNet Core, is essentially a gaming PC built around a state-of-the-art Asus X99-M WS micro-ATX mainboard. The board features a 5th Gen “Broadwell E” Core i7-6950X — a 10-core, 2.00/3.50GHz processor with a 140W TDP. LimeNET Core (left) and selected internal components including Asus X99-M WS (click images to enlarge) The LimeNET Core ships with 64GB DDR4-2133, plus an M.2 connected 1TB SATA 3.0 SSD and 8x SATA 3.0 interfaces. The system is further equipped with 2x USB 3.1 ports, 4x USB 3.0 ports, and 2x USB 2.0 ports. For communications, you get dual GbE ports, 3×3 802.11ac WiFi, and Bluetooth 4.0. LimeNET Base Station from two angles (click images to enlarge) The integrated, shielded LimeNET QPCIe board, which is supported with 4x antennas, can also be used in other computers, and can be purchased separately. This new board appears to run the same Cyclone IV FPGA, but offers two LMS7002 transceiver chips instead of one, which allows for a 4×4 MIMO instead of 2×2 MIMO wireless communications. LimeNET QPCIe board details (click images to enlarge) The separately available LimeNET Amplifier Chassis extends the Core computer with long range connectivity. The aluminum clad add-on encases the Core computer like a glove, adding dual MIMO units on each side. Each comprises a 10W RF output power amplifier, a duplexer, and a set of antennas, and offers a choice of 700MHz, 1.8GHz, 2.6GHz, and 3.5GHz frequencies. The open source LimeNET software stack is built around Ubuntu Core, and includes Lime Suite, GNU Octave, GNURadio, LuaRadio, Pothosware, and pyLMS7002M. Back in February, Canonical said that over 3,600 developers were building Snaps — Snap packaged Ubuntu applications — for LimeSDR. Currently, however, there are only seven apps posted on the LimeNET store. All the APIs, drivers, and hardware will be open source as well.   Further information The LimeNET systems are available now starting at $1,899 (see prices listed farther above). More information may be found at the LimeNET Crowd Supply page and the Lime Microsystems website.   Related posts: Ubuntu Core ported to an i.MX6 COM, a Dell IoT gateway, and… Open source SDR board teams up with Snappy Ubuntu Ubuntu snaps expand to Orange Pi SBCs and a QorIQ SoC Ubuntu Core 16 gets smaller and snappier Ubuntu convergence implodes Canonical pushes "snap" as a universal Linux… Open source ResinOS adds Docker to ARM/Linux boards Open source smart home platform gains Ubuntu snap packages Can Linux containers save IoT from a security meltdown?

Announced at an event in Shanghai, the device has been overhauled to feature a 13.5-hour battery life, 7th generation Intel processors and a whole host of behind-the-scenes improvements. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The Surface Pro is back, and this time it's being positioned as a laptop rather than a tablet. Photo: Microsoft It's been almost two years since the last iteration of the Surface Pro was made available, and in the meantime Microsoft's expanded its devices line to include the more powerful Surface Book hybrid, the Surface Studio desktop machine and the recently announced Surface Laptop. Microsoft says it's brought all its experience making these devices to bear on the new Surface Pro, and after a quick look at the machine in action it's an easy claim to believe. Related Content Have Apple and Microsoft traded places? The Pro's hinge can now prop the device up as normal or open to 165 degrees to lay it down in a slanted "studio mode", making for a miniature version of the Surface Studio's drafting table shape for writing or drawing. Microsoft says in this mode the device is stable enough to lean on. The Type Cover that transforms the Surface Pro into something resembling a traditional laptop has also seen an upgrade, although disappointingly it is still a sold-separately accessory. The cover packs LED-backlit scissor mechanism keys and a full-sized glass trackpad for multi-touch gestures, and it's covered in the same warm-looking suede-like Alcantara fabric seen on the Surface Laptop. Advertisement Also compatible with the redesigned Surface Pen — which Microsoft says is twice as fast as the Apple Pencil with only 21ms of latency — and the design-focused Surface Dial, the new Pro might be incredibly light (at less than 800 grams) but could be a hefty investment if you need all the various bits and pieces. Launching in Australia in June, the Surface Pro will be available at a number of different price-points depending on the amount of grunt you'd like the laptop to have.

Power users that want one of the i7-powered beasts with Iris Plus graphics and 16GB RAM will need to part with at least $3299. Microsoft says it plans to release additional models that include 4G LTE functionality later in the year.

"It will feel very familiar … but in fact it's a complete redesign. We have, inside and out, over 800 custom new parts that we've built for the Surface Pro", Gavin said. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The machine still features the full-length hinge and magnetic keyboard design. Photo: Microsoft "This is not your father's Surface Pro 4. This is a new Surface Pro, dramatically improved". Many of those new parts offer improvements on existing functionality. For example there's still the biometric Windows Hello camera to log you in to the machine by scanning your face, but it's now fast enough to do it "within half a beat". The design of the machine is also now heat efficient enough that the m3 and i5 models are completely fan-free and silent, while the i7 models will only have their fans kick in when they're really working hard. While the chassis has undergone some subtle softening and slight tweaks, many aspects of the exterior machine, including the 2736x1824 display, the cameras and the array of ports — USB 3.0, Mini DisplayPort, MicroSD — appear identical to 2015's Pro 4. For better or worse, this stands in contrast to many competitor devices which have made the switch, at least partially, to the new USB-C standard. Upgraded, versatile, and exceptionally powerful, with iconic Surface design. Meet the new Microsoft #SurfacePro. #MicrosoftEvent pic.twitter.com/o1RQjzlySE— Microsoft Surface (@surface) May 23, 2017 The return of the Pro and its reclassification as a laptop means Microsoft's portable lineup now consists of three similar Surface machines, but Gavin says each offers a distinct experience. "This isn't about one replacing the other, this is about having a full range of laptops now from Surface that will match where our customers are", he said. The beefy Surface Book "is the ultimate performance machine. When you want to be powering multiple monitors, to be putting it through the ultimate paces, that's our Book experience. Then we've got Surface Laptop with Windows S, which really is our take on the traditional laptop experience but we've streamlined it for performance and security". The new Pro, then, is designed to be a mobile creative studio that packs in as much power and functionality possible, while still lasting all day and being "lighter than the bag that you're putting it in". 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

How to make sense of Michael Flynn's contradictions? He was one of the most distinguished military intelligence officers in a generation. Now he’s the shortest-lived national security adviser in American history after loose-lipped talk with the Russian ambassador to the United States. It's too soon to know how history will judge Flynn, an accomplished soldier under the microscope for ties to Russian and Turkish interests. What's certain is before his foray into politics, Flynn had a distinguished 33-year Army career that included top-level intelligence posts and promotion to the rank of three-star general. Perhaps his greatest achievement in uniform was helping transform Special Operations forces into what's been described as "history's most lethal terrorist-hunting network." Flynn was considered a maverick who sometimes pursued unworkable proposals, and whose chaotic management style and blunt talk rubbed some the wrong way. He retired forcibly at age 55 after President Barack Obama ousted him as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon’s CIA. After Flynn left the military he gained the attention of several Republican candidates who sought his counsel — including Donald Trump, who tapped Flynn as his national security adviser over warnings from the previous administration. Twenty-four days later, Flynn resigned. With at least a half-dozen criss-crossing investigations into possible collusion between Trump associates and Russia around the 2016 election, financial crimes and obstruction of justice, Flynn’s name will remain in the news. The following timeline, based on news reports, aims to help make sense of the swirling events that precipitated Flynn’s fall, and what’s emerged since. June 2013: Flynn travels to Moscow, visits Russian military intelligence headquarters Flynn, then-director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, traveled to Moscow on a trip coordinated in part by Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. (Washington Post). In a rare move for a DIA director, Flynn visited the headquarters of Russia’s military intelligence directorate, the GRU. Aug. 7, 2014: Flynn leaves military after being forced out as head of Pentagon intelligence agency Flynn retires a year ahead of schedule at the DIA. Flynn said he dissented against the Obama administration's passivity on terrorism. He believed intelligence reports were being watered down and chafed when Obama dismissed ISIS as a "JV team." In an ironic twist, one day after Flynn’s involuntary retirement in fall 2014, Obama announced the United States had begun a bombing campaign against ISIS that would prove to extend beyond his presidency.   Some members of the Washington national security coterie speculate Flynn’s anger over what he sees as an unjust end to his military career explains why he would later fall in line behind Trump and his iconoclastic national security approach. (Washington Post, Politico) Oct. 8, 2014: DIA lawyers send memo to Flynn outlining legal obligations as retired Army officer At Flynn’s request, lawyers at DIA sent a legal memo outlining legal and ethical restrictions applying to Flynn in retirement, including his disclosure requirements.

Sept. 19, 2016: Flynn meets with Turkish officials to discuss possibly abducting the Turkish president’s political enemy Flynn meets with Turkish officials, including Turkey’s foreign minister and the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Erdogan, to discuss the possibility of abducting an Erdogan political enemy living in Pennsylvania, and delivering him to Turkey, according to an ex-CIA Director who attended the meeting. (Wall Street Journal) Former CIA chief James Woolsey was later quoted in a March 2017 Wall Street Journal article saying he was startled upon hearing discussion of possibly kidnapping cleric Fethullah Gulen.

(Daily Caller) Nov. 8, 2016: Flynn writes op-ed about Turkey On Election Day, Flynn published an op-ed in The Hill arguing the United States should back Erdogan’s government — an apparent contradiction to Flynn’s earlier support for the coup attempt. In his piece, Flynn also compares Gulen to Osama Bin Laden.

Announced at an event in Shanghai, the device has been overhauled to feature a 13.5-hour battery life, 7th generation Intel processors and a whole host of behind-the-scenes improvements. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The Surface Pro is back, and this time it's being positioned as a laptop rather than a tablet. Photo: Microsoft It's been almost two years since the last iteration of the Surface Pro was made available, and in the meantime Microsoft's expanded its devices line to include the more powerful Surface Book hybrid, the Surface Studio desktop machine and the recently announced Surface Laptop. Microsoft says it's brought all its experience making these devices to bear on the new Surface Pro, and after a quick look at the machine in action it's an easy claim to believe. Related Content Have Apple and Microsoft traded places? The Pro's hinge can now prop the device up as normal or open to 165 degrees to lay it down in a slanted "studio mode", making for a miniature version of the Surface Studio's drafting table shape for writing or drawing. Microsoft says in this mode the device is stable enough to lean on. The Type Cover that transforms the Surface Pro into something resembling a traditional laptop has also seen an upgrade, although disappointingly it is still a sold-separately accessory. The cover packs LED-backlit scissor mechanism keys and a full-sized glass trackpad for multi-touch gestures, and it's covered in the same warm-looking suede-like Alcantara fabric seen on the Surface Laptop. Advertisement Also compatible with the redesigned Surface Pen — which Microsoft says is twice as fast as the Apple Pencil with only 21ms of latency — and the design-focused Surface Dial, the new Pro might be incredibly light (at less than 800 grams) but could be a hefty investment if you need all the various bits and pieces. Launching in Australia in June, the Surface Pro will be available at a number of different price-points depending on the amount of grunt you'd like the laptop to have. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The Pro is compatible with a redesigned Surface Pen, which can be colour-matched to the Type Cover. Photo: Microsoft $1199 will get you a model with one of Intel's mobility-focused m3 chipsets, a 128GB drive and a meagre 4GB of RAM, while the models with the more powerful i5 processors will start at $1499. Power users that want one of the i7-powered beasts with Iris Plus graphics and 16GB RAM will need to part with at least $3299. Microsoft says it plans to release additional models that include 4G LTE functionality later in the year. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The new Pro can fold down to a low angle for drawing or writing in 'studio mode'.  Speaking to Fairfax Media ahead of the Shanghai event, Microsoft's GM for commercial devices Ryan Gavin said the device is a new start for the two-in-one form factor the company helped pioneer. "It will feel very familiar … but in fact it's a complete redesign. We have, inside and out, over 800 custom new parts that we've built for the Surface Pro", Gavin said. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The machine still features the full-length hinge and magnetic keyboard design. Photo: Microsoft "This is not your father's Surface Pro 4. This is a new Surface Pro, dramatically improved". Many of those new parts offer improvements on existing functionality. For example there's still the biometric Windows Hello camera to log you in to the machine by scanning your face, but it's now fast enough to do it "within half a beat". The design of the machine is also now heat efficient enough that the m3 and i5 models are completely fan-free and silent, while the i7 models will only have their fans kick in when they're really working hard. While the chassis has undergone some subtle softening and slight tweaks, many aspects of the exterior machine, including the 2736x1824 display, the cameras and the array of ports — USB 3.0, Mini DisplayPort, MicroSD — appear identical to 2015's Pro 4. For better or worse, this stands in contrast to many competitor devices which have made the switch, at least partially, to the new USB-C standard. Upgraded, versatile, and exceptionally powerful, with iconic Surface design. Meet the new Microsoft #SurfacePro. #MicrosoftEvent pic.twitter.com/o1RQjzlySE— Microsoft Surface (@surface) May 23, 2017 The return of the Pro and its reclassification as a laptop means Microsoft's portable lineup now consists of three similar Surface machines, but Gavin says each offers a distinct experience. "This isn't about one replacing the other, this is about having a full range of laptops now from Surface that will match where our customers are", he said. The beefy Surface Book "is the ultimate performance machine. When you want to be powering multiple monitors, to be putting it through the ultimate paces, that's our Book experience. Then we've got Surface Laptop with Windows S, which really is our take on the traditional laptop experience but we've streamlined it for performance and security". The new Pro, then, is designed to be a mobile creative studio that packs in as much power and functionality possible, while still lasting all day and being "lighter than the bag that you're putting it in".

Huawei and Microsoft aren’t the only ones participating, though, as Samsung has also entered the ring with its new Galaxy Book 12. Make no mistake, these three devices certainly have a lot in common, but more importantly, there are a few key differences between them. Here’s everything you need to know. Hardware Though all three device can have similar hardware, the differences here pretty much come down to the level of customization each one offers. For instance, in the MateBook E, you’ll have your choice of an Intel m3-7Y30 processor or a Core i5-7Y54. Aside from the processor, you get your choice of 4GB or 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of SSD storage. With the Surface Pro, on the other hand, your configuration choices expand a bit. There are six configurations in all, ranging from the basic model with an Intel Core m3, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage all the way up to an Intel Core i7 model with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. In all, there’s one configuration with a Core m3, two with a Core i5, and three with a Core i7, so you have plenty of options as far as the Surface Pro is concerned. If you’re buying the LTE-enabled Galaxy Book 12, your hardware options are limited to one configuration: an Intel Core i5 CPU with 4GB of RAM and 128GB SSD. If you opt for the WiFi only version, your options open up a little bit, as there are two models on offer. One of these comes with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, while the other comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. As an added little bonus, both the Surface Pro and the Galaxy Book 12 come with a microSD slot that allows you to add even more storage to your device. Display While the Surface Pro rises above the other two in terms of hardware options, we’d expect the competition over displays to be much closer. Indeed, it sounds like all three of these devices will offer excellent displays to complement the laptop-quality hardware running within. READ MORE: Samsung Galaxy Book 12 ReviewOn the Huawei MateBook E, we’re working with a 12-inch display at 2160 x 1440 resolution, resulting in 216 pixels-per-inch. On the Galaxy Book 12, we see a similar display with the same 12-inch size and 2166 x 1440 resolution, but the key difference is that the display on the Galaxy Book 12 is a Super AMOLED one. This comes as little surprise, considering that Samsung is known for its excellent displays. The Surface Pro slightly edges out its competition here, offering a 12.3-inch PixelSense display that sports 2736 x 1824 resolution, which translates to 267 pixels-per-inch. Expect images to be slightly sharper on the Surface Pro because of that, but don’t count out Samsung’s own Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy Book 12 – that will certainly be able to hold its own in this area, even if the Surface Pro offers a higher resolution. Operating System Though there may have been some worry that Microsoft would outfit the new Surface Pro with Windows 10 S, it didn’t. Instead, the Surface Pro will be running Windows 10 Pro out of the box, meaning that you won’t be restricted to apps from the Windows Store. Huawei actually hasn’t specified whether the MateBook E will be running Windows 10 proper or Windows 10 S, but it seems relatively safe to assume that it’s the former. Just the same, the Galaxy Book 12 is running Windows 10 Pro as well, so it’s pretty much a dead heat between the three in terms of operating systems. It should be noted, however, that Microsoft offers a free 30-day trial of Office 365 with your Surface Pro purchase, but we can’t really see that being a deciding factor for anyone. Battery Here’s where things begin to get a little muddy, simply because a manufacturer’s battery life estimates are rarely what we see in real-world scenarios. The battery within the MateBook E clocks in at 33.7Wh, which the company says is good for approximately 9 hours of local video playback. Huawei arrived at this number by testing the MateBook E at 50% brightness and with automatic backlight turned on. Unfortunately for us, Microsoft and Samsung weren’t quite so forthcoming with their own battery details. Microsoft says that the battery in the Surface Pro is good for up to 13.5 hours of video playback with all settings at defaults except for Wi-Fi, which was connected to a network, and auto-brightness, which was turned off. Samsung leaves us even more in the dark by simply stating that the Galaxy Book 12’s 39.04Wh battery will last up to 11 hours, declining to say anything about its own testing method. In our review, however, we found that the battery more often lasts 6 to 7 hours before needing a recharge. Accessories 2-in-1 machines generally serve as good vehicles to sell some accessories, and these three are no different. There will no doubt be a lot of accessories made for each of these, so we’ll only concern ourselves with what ships in the box. Unfortunately, here’s where prospective Surface Pro buyers get the short end of the stick. The Surface Pro won’t ship with any accessories in the box, unless you feel like throwing Microsoft a bone and counting the power supply and quick start guide. The MateBook 3, on the other hand, at least includes the folio keyboard, and in some markets, you’ll get the MateDock 2 to go along with it. Samsung is the clear winner when it comes to accessories that ship with the device. Samsung is shipping both the keyboard and the S-Pen with the Galaxy Book 12 – for the Surface Pro and the MateBook 3, you’ll need to buy the pen separately. That’s rather disappointing when you consider that all three companies are pushing their pens as must-have accessories for their devices. Price At the end of the day, price is what matters most. With its most basic Surface Pro model, Microsoft significantly undercuts the competition. The Surface Pro that comes with a Core m3 only costs $799, while a more mid-range model like the Core i5/8GB RAM/256GB one will set you back $1,299. If you want the best Surface Pro Microsoft has to offer – 1TB of SSD storage, 16GB of RAM, and a Core i7 – you’ll need to shell out a sobering $2,699. €999 ($1119) is what it’ll cost to take home Huawei’s most basic MateBook E. When we ditch the Core m3 in favor of a Core i5 with 4GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, that price climbs to €1199 ($1343). Finally, the top-of-the-line MateBook E, which offers a Core i5, 256GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM will cost €1299 ($1455). As for the Galaxy Book 12, you’re looking at a price tag of $1429. Wrap-Up By this point, you should be pretty well acquainted with the similarities and differences between all three devices. If you’re in the market for a 2-in-1, all three should prove to be fairly solid devices, but each one is also quite expensive. Of course, we’ll have move coverage on each of these in the coming weeks and months, so keep it here at SlashGear for more.

Samsung Galaxy Book Review by Adam Z. LeinMay 23, 2017 9:00 am Contents Overview Full Article Rating Comments Advertisement Overview Processor 7th Gen Intel Core i5 7200U dual core 3.1Ghz Screen Size 12" Super AMOLED (2160x1440 pixels) Memory 8GB Storage 256GB SSD + optional MicroSD expansion Camera/s 13MP AF rear, 5MP front Battery 39.04W fast charging Weight 754g Materials Aluminum, plastic, glass, rubber, vinyl Operating System Windows 10 Home The Samsung Galaxy Book seems to be this year’s successor to Samsung’s Galaxy TabPro S that we reviewed last year. Instead of calling this the Galaxy TabPro S2, Samsung decided to give it a new name, and I kind of like it. Samsung’s Galaxy Book name goes along with Microsoft’s Surface Book and Huawei’s Matebook and that is probably the product category that it really belongs in. The Galaxy Tab name probably resonates more as an Android tablet category for many people. But there’s not much in a name… The Galaxy Book is Samsung’s latest foray into the 2-in-1 full Windows 10 capable tablet PC market, and it has some huge improvements over the TabPro S Samsung released last year. Practically every negative aspect of the Galaxy TabPro S has been addressed and improved upon. Incidentally, this review is going to be about the 12″ version of the Galaxy Book, but there will also be a smaller, less-expensive version with a 10″ screen. Keep reading to learn more about Samsungs latest “tablet that can replace your laptop.” Hands-on Video Specs The Samsung Book is available in a few different versions. The one we’re reviewing is a fairly high-end model. First of all it’s got a 12″ Super AMOLED full HD+ (2160 x 1440 pixel) screen and a 7th generation Intel Core i5 7200U dual core 3.1Ghz processor. We’ve also got 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD storage, a 13 megapixel rear camera, and a 5 megapixel front camera. By the way, 203GB of free space is available on the 256GB SSD at first boot. We’ve also got the usual WiFi, Bluetooth radios, and it comes with a keyboard cover/case and the S-Pen. We’ve also got 2 USB-C ports so you can charge the battery and connect something else at the same time. It’s too bad USB-C wasn’t designed to be as forward-thinking as it should have been. The 12″ models have a 39.04W battery with Fast Charging support which lasts about 11hrs. The dimensions are 291.3 x 19.8 x 7.4mm and it weighs 754 grams. The 12″ version is also available in a version with an LTE radio plus 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD, as well as another WiFi version with 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD. There’s also a smaller version of the Samsung Galaxy Book with a 10.6″ TFT 1920 x 1280 pixel screen and a 7th Gen Intel Core m3 dual core 2.6Ghz processor. That version is available with 4GB of RAM and either 64GB or 128GB eMMC storage. It also only has a 5 megapixel front facing camera (no rear), and only 1 USB-C port. It’s also naturally smaller and lighter. Note that both versions are slightly thicker than the 6.3mm thick Galaxy TabPro S from last year. Hardware The Galaxy Book does away with the super flat back that the Galaxy TabPro S had (with its big camera bump) and instead features a single metal backing with very smooth, comfortable, rouded edges. It’s a very nice change. That Super AMOLED screen is gorgeous. The blacks are so so black that it totally blends in with the bezels of the tablet. Cranking up the screen brightness doesn’t change the blacks either. It’s all completely smooth black all the time. The Galaxy TabPro S had the same type of screen and there’s nothing new about it here, but it’s still great to have. The screen is also very shiny so there’s going to be a lot of fingerprint smudges as well as a lot of glare if you’re trying to use it in a well-lit area. The included keyboard cover is a huge improvement over what was included with the Galaxy TabPro S. This keyboard feels much more professional. The keys are nicely spaced, they have great vertical movement, and even a nice click to them. The trackpad is much larger than what we had on the TabPro S, too. It’s much easier to use if you’re stll using a trackpad instead of the touch screen or S-Pen stylus. The track-pad works well enough. It supports the Windows 10 gestures for quickly accessing task view (three fingers swipe upwards), scrolling/panning (two fingers moving parallel in any direction), and zoom (pinch or expand two fingers). On the inside of the keyboard cover there is a little illustration showing the 4 different ways you can fold it into a stand for different screen display angles. The most upright display angle is the most stable on a desk or table. The flap folders under the back and keeps everything standing up nicely. Two of the display angles use magnets to adhere the stand flap to the back of the tablet. If you remember, this is similar to how the Galaxy TabPro S’s stand worked, except that had much weaker magnets and a folding design that could easily cause the tablet to fall over while touching the screen. These magnets are much stronger and the folding design is made to transfer the pressure on the touch screen more directly into the table. It’s a very welcome change and much improved over Samsung’s previous design. The keyboard cover nicely protects the front and back of the tablet, but the edges are prone to gettnig banged up and the flexible material is a bit slippery. The keyboard attaches to the tablet via magnets and the above 5 pin connector. It’s a different connector than the Galaxy TabPro S, so don’t think that you’ll be able to get the new Galaxy Book keyboard and use it with the Galaxy TabPro S. We now have two USB-C ports on the 12″ Galaxy Book! This is a great addition since now you can plug in a charger and something else like a secondary display, external drive, port expander, or whatever. Personally I’m still not sold on USB-C as many things are still not universal. I would have rather seen a USB-A port as that’s still more widely used (and the USB-C to USB-A adapters I have sometimes don’t work). Oh, and there’s a 3.5mm TRS audio jack here too. The top edge has the power button and volume toggle button. There’s no longer a Windows/Start key on the device like there was on the TabPro S. On the left edge there’s a little drawer where you can install a Micro SD card for expanding storage. The drawer is opened by pushing a small (included) pin into the hole to pop it out. This is another huge improvement over last year’s Galaxy TabPro S. On the LTE version of the Samsung Galaxy Book, there would also be a SIM card tray area in here. The camera bump is much reduced and the quality has been increased, but it’s still not great. Really you shouldn’t be using a tablet to take photographs anyway, so don’t worry about it. The 10″ version nicely does away with the rear facing camera completely. S-Pen The Samsung Galaxy Book is the first Windows 10 tablet to include Samsung’s “S-Pen” technology that’s been widely used on the Note series of phablets. Actually, the S-Pen technology partly belongs to Wacom as Samsung licenses some of Wacom’s digitizer tech to use in S-Pen compatible screens. The Microsoft Surface Pro 1 and 2 also used Wacom technology as have many other Windows tablet PCs of the past. What’s different with the S-Pen is that Samsung has done a lot on the software side and Wacom’s control panel software is nowhere to be seen. You get a pen-loop thing in the box with the Galaxy Book that you can stick to the back of the keyboard cover. It’s nice that this is optional since some users may not really care about using the pen or carrying it around all the time. It’s not a super elegant or attractive method of attaching the S-Pen, but it works as long as you insert the S-Pen in the right direction and use the clip to keep it in place. Otherwise it will be loose and probably fall out. Personally, I wish the tablet had an S-Pen silo where it could be hidden inside the edge of the tablet. Above is the safest way to keep the S-Pen attached to the Galaxy Book. It’s not easy to insert and remove the stylus in this configuration though. The Surface Pro’s magnetic edge is a little better, but I really like the Wacom Mobile Studio‘s little pen holder clip that holds it upright for quick access. The S-Pen is plastic, but the clip at the end is metal, so if you want you can actually stick it to the back of the tablet or on the front bezel where the magnets are, but this isn’t terrible secure as the S-Pen will spin and dangle. Still, sticking it to the bezel makes for pretty easy access while set up on a desk or table. The S-Pen has one button that you can configure in Samsung’s Settings app. Unfortunately there are very few customization options. You can set the button to launch Samsung’s “Air Command” software or Microsoft’s Ink Workspace, or nothing. None of those options are terribly useful really. I’d like at least a “right click” option to be configurable too. I miss having an eraser on the other end too. Incidentally, the palm rejection for the S-Pen on the screen takes some getting used to. Many times I’ve rested my hand against the screen to find that pressing buttons with the pen tip doesn’t work. Having the pen within range of the screen’s digitizer does not automatically reject the touch interface if the touch interface is currently active (you’re touching the screen). So you really have to get the pen tip close to the screen first before you rest your hand on the screen to write or draw. Wacom’s tablets, pen displays, and pen computers generally give the stylus priority when it’s within range, but that’s not the case with the Samsung Book. Software The Samsung Galaxy Book comes with Windows 10 Home pre-installed. Oddly, it did not come pre-installed with the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update. Windows 10 is probably the most feature-rich operating system especially for tablet PC convertibles (AKA 2-in-1’s). It can easily switch between an interface designed mainly for touch that uses gestures and large active areas for controlling programs and snapping them side by side… and the more conventional desktop Windows style interface that gives you a small start menu in the corner along with infinitely resizable overlapping application windows like you’ve been used to since 1995. This is also one of the most mature tablet operating systems out there since Microsoft unveiled the first Windows tablets in 2002 running Windows XP Tablet PC Edition. The Galaxy Book now gets Samsung driver and firmware updates through Windows Update where as the Galaxy TabPro S had a separate background program for getting those types of updates directly from Samsung. Having the updates integrated with Windows Update and the Microsoft Store is certainly a better experience. Samsung also includes some special software integrated with Windows 10 on the Galaxy Book. First up is Samsung Flow. This is an app that hooks into the “Windows Hello” biometric log-in system to use a Bluetooth-connected Samsung Galaxy S6 (or newer) smartphone fingerprint reader to log-in. If you don’t have a Samsung Galaxy S6 or newer smartphone, you’ll have to use a PIN, password, or picture password to log in. Samsung Flow also has some other great features though. It can load all of your phone’s notifications into a window on the Galaxy Book, and Samsung has enabled reply capabilities for some of them like SMS and WhatsApp. The software also enables you to use a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone as a hotspot without having to turn it on through the phone. So there’s some really nice integration there. There’s also a “Book Settings” app that controls certain special features. It’s too bad this couldn’t have been integrated with the normal Windows 10 Settings app. There are other Samsung customizations integrated with Windows 10 on the Galaxy Book. Seen above is a Battery Life Extender option that shows up in the “Extras” section of the native Windows 10 Settings window. You’ll also see a “Pattern Log-in” option and AMOLED settings here. The AMOLED settings area lets you customize the color balance, saturation, and sharpness of your display. There’s also a new “Smart dimming” feature that turns on the camera to attempt to detect your face before dimming to save battery. If it does detect your face and understands that you’re currently looking at the screen, it won’t dim. We mentioned Samsung “Air Command” earlier and above is what that looks like. It’s a few extra S-Pen stylus features that you can access with the button on the S-Pen. Smart select is a type of screen capture utility that also does animated GIF recording and lets you record or capture only a specific part of the screen. Screen write is another screen capture utility that also lets you write on the image with a number of pen tools. The “Create Note” and “View all Notes” buttons go to the “Samsung Notes” app, which is a very basic note taking app. It doesn’t seem to syncronize with anything, so really you’re better off using the much more powerful, free, and platform agnostic Microsoft OneNote. Office 2016 Home & Student Edition is pre-installed as a trial. If you already have an Office 365 subscription, of course you can simply log-in to activate Office instead of using the trial. All of those programs run beautifully and have no match in terms of functionality on Android or iOS platforms. There are also a few games pre-installed on the Start screen. Candy Crush Soda Saga, Asphault 8, Fallout Shelter, March of Empires, Royal Revolt 2, and Microsoft Solitaire Collection are all there. It’s easy to uninstall them with a tap-and-hold to the context sensitive menu. Adobe Creative Suite 2017 runs beautifully with the 7th generation Intel Core i5 CPU, and Photoshop does support the tilt sensitivity in the S-Pen stylus. Interestingly, it only recognizes the tilt angle when the pen tip is touching the screen. That’s different from Wacom tablets, pen computers, and pen displays which normally recognize the pen tilt angle when the pen is hovering over the screen. I don’t think that’s an actual problem, just something different from what I expected. An actual problem would be that the tilt direction is not quite recognized correctly. Incidentally, Corel Painter 2017 also supports the tilt sensitivity, but not by default. You’ll have to go into the Preferences and change the tablet preference to “RTS-compatible device” and “Windows Multi-touch”. It would seem Samsung has not included Wintab drivers to support older pressure sensitive drawing programs, but the newer APIs seem to be working well at least for pressure sensitivity. Tilt sensitivity direction is way off in Painter 2017 and doesn’t work at all in Adobe Illustrator 2017. Camera The 12″ Samsung Galaxy Book now has an improved 13 megapixel rear camera along with a 5 megapixel front facing camera. The resolution is plenty for high-definition Skype video calls or capturing something that you want to save in OneNote, but taking photos or videos with this tablet out in public is not recommended. The image quality is not so great, plus it’s a giant faux pas to hold up a big tablet in front of you to take a photo. Regardless, here’s a few sample images from both the front-facing and rear-facing cameras on the Samsung Galaxy Book. Compared to Galaxy TabPro S The Galaxy Book’s screen looks exactly the same as the Galaxy TabPro S’s screen and that’s a good thing. They’re both gorgeous. You can see that the Galaxy Book’s keyboard has much better spacing between the keys. It feels a lot better to type on as well. Also note the much larger track pad. On the left above you see the Galaxy TabPro S’s keyboard stand which adhears via magnets at the top edge. On the right you see the redesigned keyboard stand for the Galaxy Book which is much more stable and much more secure. The Galaxy TabPro S on top is slightly thinner than the Galaxy Book though the new keyboard cover is a bit thinner on the Galaxy Book versus the older TabPro S’s keyboard. Battery Life As always battery life is a relative term depending on what kind of CPU intensive programming you’re going to do along with your screen brightness, but Samsung says you should get about 11 hours of constant video watching on one full charge. Obviously if you do a lot of editing HD video, or batch processing hundreds of RAW photographs, the battery life is going to suffer a bit, but in using the Samsung Galaxy Book, we have found no need to carry the charger around during the day. And if you do find the battery running low, Samsung’s USB-C fast charging will get you fully charged up after only 3 hours of charging. Pricing The 12″ Samsung Galaxy Book is available with 4GB RAM & 128GB SSD for $1129.99, or 8GB RAM & 256GB SSD for $1329.99. There’s also a Verizon LTE version of the 12″ Galaxy Book with 4GB RAM & 128GB SSD for $1299.99. The 10.6″ Samsung Galaxy Book is available with 4GB RAM & 64GB storage for $629.99 or 4Gb RAM and 128Gb storage for $729.99. Remember, the 10.6″ model has a TFT LCD screen instead of Super AMOLED. It also has an Intel Core m3 processor and only a front-facing camera, too. Conclusion In all aspects, the Samsung Galaxy Book is an improvement over last year’s Galaxy TabPro S. The keyboard is much better, the stylus is much better, the trackpad is much better, the stand is much better, 2 USB-C ports is much better, having a MicroSD card slot is much better… the Super AMOLED screen is about the same, but much better than most other Windows 10 tablet screens. Pricing wise, the Galaxy Book is about on par with other comparable 2-in-1 Windows 10 tablet PCs like the Surface Pro 4 once you factor in the price of a clip on keyboard. Samsung even smartened up about the range of models they’re making available, too. The Galaxy TabPro S was only available in one configuration. With the Galaxy Book, you’ve got 5 options with prices between $629.99 and $1329.99 to fit your budget. It’s great to see Samsung stepping up their Windows 10 tablet game this year and the Galaxy Book is a worthy competitor.

It gained traction with an anonymously-sourced "confirmation" on a PC enthusiast web site last week. But despite the occasional boosts, the rumor that Advanced Micro Devices is about to strike a licensing deal with arch rival Intel just doesn't add up. At least for AMD. AMD CEO Lisa Su just spent the last four years betting the company on radical new designs for both central processing chips that power PCs and servers as well as graphics chips aimed at gamers and machine learning tasks. Now that the goods have finally arrived, in the form of Ryzen chips for PCs and Vega chips for graphics, it's about the last moment when she'd like to lend a helping hand to her fierce competitor. Intel, the dominant maker of PC and server processor chips, doesn't have much in-house expertise in graphics chips. And a deal to incorporate Nvidia's (nvda) graphics technology has reportedly expired. So Intel could likely use a new deal with AMD to help its stay on the cutting edge for selling chip sets that incorporate both central processors and graphics features. That doesn't mean Su has any interest, however. Speaking at an investor conference in Boston on Monday, the AMD CEO wouldn't address the Intel licensing rumor head on, saying that her company doesn't comment on rumors or deals that might be in the works. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. But she made very clear that she wasn't in the mood to aid Intel, even if she didn't mention the company by name. Although AMD will consider "selectively" licensing its intellectual property, "we're really trying to look for those areas that can grow our market share," Su said. "It's about how do we sell more products, or how do we have our IP in markets where we're not currently selling products. We're not looking at enabling a competitor to compete against our products." AMD competes head-to-head with Intel selling processor chip sets with integrated graphics for PCs. So that wouldn't qualify as a market where AMD isn't currently selling its products. A multi-year Intel licensing deal could bring in billions of dollars, a prospect which has ignited Wall Street's interest in the rumors. But Su also said at the conference that the company's adjusted earnings per share forecast of 75 cents for the year assumes no new, unannounced licensing agreements will contribute. Beyond Monday's statements, Su's entire strategy to revive AMD rests on attracting customers top-performing chip products and abandoning AMD's old ways of milking every dollar from mediocrity. As the only one of the major chip vendors that can compete with its own line of high-end central processing chips and high-end graphics chips, a licensing deal with Intel would surrender AMD's unique advantage in the market. Still, the rumors have buffeted AMD's already buffeted stock price. After rising from the depths of under $2 per share in February 2016 to a high of $15.55 at the end of this February, AMD's share price has dropped on fears that Su's big bets won't pay off soon enough. After AMD reported first quarter results on May 1 that didn't indicate profit margins were about to jump thanks to all the new products, the stock fell as low as $9.85 before recovering a bit to the range of about $11 a share. But the revived Intel (intc) deal rumor, carried on the site Fudzilla on May 17, pushed the shares back up as high as $12.77. Su's failure to confirm—along with a carefully-worded, present tense denial from Intel—put AMD's share price back on the down spin. It was trading at $10.79 in midday trading on Tuesday. There's plenty more to come from Su's super chip strategy, with the revived Vega line of graphics chips hitting the market next month. But investors should not count on AMD (amd) coming to the aid of any arch rivals, even if it would give the stock price a boost.

We take a look. Weeks after unveiling its new Surface Laptop, Microsoft has just taken the wraps of a new hybrid which it's calling the "new Surface Pro". The company has had great success with its line of 2-in-1s, and it looks like it's made some significant improvements this time around. With the Surface Pro 4 already an impressive machine, what has Microsoft done here to up its game, and will it be worth upgrading for those who've already shelled out for the Pro 4? It's early days, and with spec information still coming in, we're unable to say for sure. But we do know quite a bit about the new device, so here's an early comparison: Related: Best tablet New Surface Pro vs Surface Pro 4 – Design The new Surface Pro borrows some features from other Microsoft Surface devices, such as the new Alcantara-skinned Type Cover – which basically means Microsoft has covered the keys in a fuzzy fabric in the same way as the Surface Laptop's keyboard. The company is also claiming the newest version of the device is lighter than the existing one, and that seems to be somewhat true, with the new Surface Pro weighing 768g to 784g, depending on configuration. The Surface Pro 4 weighs 766g to 786g, so the "lighter" claim appears to refer to the higher configuration. The former Surface Pro also has 292 x 201 x 8.4mm dimensions and the newer iteration the same, so the lighter weight seems to have been achieved internally. Related: Surface Studio The new Surface Pro Microsoft has opted for the same metallic-grey magnesium finish as the Pro 4 on the latest version, but it comes with what the company is calling a "next generation hinge". We're not entirely sure what that means, but according to a promotional video the device can be put into Studio mode, much like the recently announced Surface Studio. That basically means it'll lay almost flat for when you want to doodle on it with the Surface Pen. The Pro 4, on the other hand, won't allow for this feature. Ports and connectivity look to have been left the same, too, in order to allow owners to attach the same keyboards (or Type Covers) and peripherals. On the Pro 4, you'll find a USB 3.0, mini-DisplayPort, and microSD slot, and it looks like that remains the case on the new model. New Surface Pro vs Surface Pro 4 – Hardware and features Microsoft has made a lot of non-specific claims about the new Surface Pro, claiming it to be the "best sounding" version of its hybrid device, while also pointing to an "enhanced colour PixelSense display". What we know for certain is that the Redmond-based company has upgraded the internals by adding seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors to the mix, while the Pro 4 comes with sixth-generation Intel Core M, Core i5 and Core i7 options. The new fanless Intel processors mean you'll get more power and longer battery life on the newer model, and when combined with Intel HD graphics 620 or Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 (depending on your processor choice), and up to 16GB of RAM, you're getting a significant spec bump over the Pro 4. The previous-generation Surface Pro also comes with Intel HD graphics 540 and up to 16GB RAM, but the new-generation fanless chips really will make all the difference. Surface Pro 4 You'll also be able to load the new Surface Pro with either a 128GB, 256GB or 512GB solid state drive, while the Pro 4 can be loaded with the same storage as well as a 1TB option. Camera-wise, you'll find the same 8-megapixel autofocus rear camera with 1080p HD video and 5-megapixel front camera with 1080p HD video on the new Pro as on the Pro 4. With Windows Hello face-authentication, you can unlock the device using facial recognition. The next-gen Surface Pen that comes with the new Pro is more sensitive and it looks like you'll be able to use the Surface Dial that originally debuted with the Surface Studio. It'll allow creative types to select different tools and manipulate their on-screen masterpieces with ease, and has now been brought to the hybrid range with the new Surface Pro. Microsoft is promising 13.5 hours of battery life from the new machine, which would be an improvement over the nine-hour mixed-use battery life on the Pro 4. Obviously, we're yet to test the claim, but we're sure the new Kaby lake processors will allow the device to live up to the hype. And finally, that "enhanced colour PixelSense display" on the latest model refers to a 12.3-inch multi-touch screen with a 2736 x 1824 resolution. That's exactly the same as the Pro 4, and makes for the same 267ppi (pixels per inch) density. Having the same specs is no bad thing, as the Surface Pro 4's screen is fantastic. However, we're wondering just what Microsoft has done here to "enhance" things display-wise. We'll have more once we've reveiwed the new model. Here's a breakdown of how the specs compare for the basic configuration: Surface Pro 4 New Surface Pro Processors 6th-gen Core m3, i5, or i7 7th-gen Core m3, i5, or i7 Graphics Intel HD graphics 515, 520, or Iris Intel HD 620 or 640 Memory 4-16GB 4-16GB Storage 128-1TB SSD 128-512GB SSD Weight 766g to 786g 768g to 784g Thickness 8.45 mm 8.5mm Screen 12.3-inch 2736 x 1824 PixelSense screen 12.3-inch 2736 x 1824 PixelSense screen Ports USB 3.0, mini-DisplayPort, and microSD slot USB 3.0, mini-DisplayPort, and microSD slot Price £749-£2359 £799-?? New Surface Pro vs Surface Pro 4 – Price and availability You can get your hands on the Surface Pro 4 right now, starting at £749. Prices go all the way up to £2359 if you go for the top-end model, though Microsoft is currently offering discounts on all the prices. The £749 configuration is currently availalble for £674.10 on the Microsoft Store, and there are similar discounts for all other configurations. If you want to go for the new Surface Pro, you'll have to wait until June 15, with prices starting at £799. Pre-orders have gone live, however, so you can get your order in from right now. The new model will be available in the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. New Surface Pro vs Surface Pro 4 – Summary At this point, it's very difficult to say which is the better machine. On paper, the new model is obviously an improvement, but we're yet to review it, so we'll reserve judgement for the time being. The Surface Pro 4 is one of our favourite tablet hybrids, and might be the best 2-in-1 available right now. We've no doubt Microsoft has managed to outdo itself with the new model, and will update you once we've tested that for ourselves.

Anyone thinking of building a robot needs to figure out exactly what components will be required to achieve the desired functionality. Some of those functions remain the same across all robots though, including a compute module to run software, a way for communication to happen, and the ability for the robot to see. Intel intends to offer all that functionality in one neat little package later this month. Liliputing brought to our attention the fact pre-orders for the Intel Euclid Development Kit are now open, with the kit shipping on May 31 if you have the required $399. In return for your cash, you get what is essentially a stick computer running Ubuntu 16.04. The spec is as follows: Intel Atom x7-8700 Quad-Core processor 4GB memory, 32GB storage Intel RealSense ZR300 Depth Camera Wi-Fi and Bluetooth USB 3.0, Micro HDMI, and USB OTG/Charging ports Environmental sensors including inertial measurement unit, barometric pressure sensor, GPS, and proximity sensor Battery and Power Adapter USB and HDMI cable As well as Ubuntu, Euclid ships with the ROS (Robotics Operating System) wrapper pre-installed allowing for easy use of the RealSense camera and associated middleware. Developers can control the system using a web interface and remote desktop application, which also ship as standard.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Microsoft unveils new Surface Pro with more power, bigger battery Listen | Print By James Walker     15 hours ago in Technology Microsoft has officially unveiled its new Surface Pro, the latest incarnation of the popular convertible device. The company has focused on incremental improvements to refine the existing experience, adding new processors and subtle design changes. The launch comes just a few weeks after Microsoft launched Surface Laptop, the newest addition to the family. Today, it returned to the stage at an event in Shanghai, unveiling the "Surface Pro." The company seems to have followed Apple's lead and dropped its numerical branding, explaining Surface head Panos Panay's earlier statement of there being no Surface Pro 5. Microsoft has deliberately kept the design virtually unchanged from the Pro 4. The overall look and feel remains the same but there have been several discrete alterations. Most significantly, the Surface's iconic kickstand has been modified to mirror the support on the Surface Studio. It now features 165 degrees of rotation so the tablet can lie virtually flat against a desk. It's designed for creatives who want to draw and write on the screen at a natural elevation. Internally, Microsoft claims to have installed over 800 new custom parts to make the Surface Pro the thinnest, lightest and fastest Surface ever. It's also the densest with 99 percent of its chassis volume occupied by components. Microsoft Surface Pro [2017] Microsoft To free up more space for hardware, the cooling fan has been removed on all but the most powerful Intel Core i7 models. This enables silent operation, eliminating the occasional fan noise in meeting rooms or while working that could creep in with the Pro 4. This configuration will be available with Intel Core m3 and i5 processors. All the silicon options available are 7th-generation Intel Kaby Lake chips, the most powerful the company has released to date. They'll be accompanied by several configurable RAM and storage options to let you tailor your Surface to your needs and wallet. Regardless of the processor you pick, the display will be Microsoft's 12.3-inch PixelSense unit, upgraded from the Pro 4 with custom hardware to improve colour reproduction. Battery life will vary with model but is rated at up to 13.5 hours, 50 percent more than the outgoing Surface Pro 4 and 35 percent more than an iPad Pro. Microsoft Surface Pro [2017] Microsoft Microsoft has also revamped Surface's signature accessories. The new Type Cover keyboard features 1.3mm of key travel and is covered in Alcantara material. Microsoft has been emphasising Alcantara across the Surface range, claiming its soft-touch fabric creates a more personal connection to the device. Although this could reduce durability, issues are reportedly a rare occurrence. The Surface Pen team has delivered a significant upgrade too. The pen that will come in the box with the new device has 4,096 levels of pressure, up from 1,024 on the Pro 4. It's also the fastest digital stylus to date as Microsoft has created more custom hardware to directly bridge the gap between the pen and display. The result is that ink appears on the screen almost before the host app can react. Microsoft has suggested that the Surface Pro represents the culmination of everything learned from past Surface products. All four previous generations have been combined into a new namesake device. Microsoft Surface Pro [2017] Microsoft Although it's not a radical reinventing, Microsoft has made it clear that dramatic changes won't be introduced until they can make a significant impact. The Surface Pro is meant to affirm Microsoft's presence in the premium convertibles market as the Pro 4 ages, giving customers the new processors and enhanced battery life they've been asking for. "We know that customers love the flexibility and versatility of the Surface Pro. In fact, Surface Pro 4 users are more likely to recommend their device than iPad and MacBook users," said Panay in a blog post. "But we’re not complacent – we know in order to live up to the expectations of our customers, we must continue to improve and better deliver on our promise on performance, mobility, and versatility – while improving what people already love about the iconic Surface Pro line." The Surface Pro is available to pre-order in many regions worldwide from today. Pricing starts at $799.99 and shipments will begin on June 15th. The Surface Pro Signature Type Cover is also available to pre-order today with the Surface Pen following in the coming weeks. As with previous accessory upgrades, both will be backwards compatible with the Surface Pro 3 and 4.

Despite the confusing name, it is a successor to last year's Surface Pro 4. The new model comes with a new design, new display, new hardware, some new software, and new accessories, making it one of the more comprehensive overhauls in the series so far. The new Surface Pro is completely redesigned and is the thinnest (8.5mm) and lightest (1.7lb) Surface yet. On the back is a new hinge that allows 165-degree of movement for a near flat angle, ideal for writing or drawing. The new Surface Pro has a 12.3-inch, 2736x1824, PixelSense Display with 267ppi and 3:2 aspect ratio. Like with the Surface Studio, the new Surface Pro will have color switcher profiles that are Microsoft's poor substitute for system wide color management. The new Surface Pro will be available in a choice of 7th generation Intel "Kaby Lake" Core m3, Core i5, and Core i7 variants. The Core m3 and Core i5 variants are completely fanless, a first for a Core i5 system. However, Intel doesn't market its mobile chipsets separately so it's likely the Core i5 featured here is a mobile version (Microsoft doesn't mention the exact CPU models). The Core m3 model comes in one configuration with 4GB RAM, 128GB flash storage, and Intel HD Graphics 615. The Core i5 model comes in two configurations, with a choice or 4GB RAM and 128GB storage or 8GB RAM and 256GB storage with Intel HD Graphics 620. The Core i7 model comes in three configurations, with a choice of 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, 16GB RAM and 512GB storage, and 16GB RAM and 1TB storage, all with Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640. Other specs include 1x USB 3.0 connector, 1x Mini DisplayPort, microSDXC card reader and headphone jack. Microsoft left out a USB-C connector or Thunderbolt in favor of its own proprietary Surface Connect. On the back is an 8 megapixel camera and on the front is 5 megapixel camera, both with 1080p video. There are also dual microphones and new 1.6W stereo speakers with Dolby Audio Premium. Microsoft also designed a new Surface Pen to go with the new Surface Pro. it has 4096 pressure points, reduced 21 milliseconds latency and tilt functionality. This time, however, the Surface Pen will not be provided with the new Surface Pro and will be sold separately, much like the Apple Pencil. It is priced at $99. Microsoft also announced new Signature Type Covers, with a scissor mechanism and 1.3mm key travel and wrapped in Alcantara like the Surface Laptop. It will be available in Platinum, Burgundy, and Cobalt Blue. It is priced at $129. There is also a new Surface Dock with support for two 4K displays and four USB ports. It plugs via the proprietary Microsoft Surface Connect port. You can also use the Surface Dial with the new Surface Pro, also sold separately for $99. Microsoft also updated its Office 365 apps with new inking features to take advantage of the new Surface Pen. These changes will be available across all platforms the Office 365 is available on. Microsoft also announced Whiteboard, an app available exclusively for Surface users to do simultaneous collaborative multi-device inking on. The new Surface Pro pricing starts at $799.99 for the base model. It's available for pre-order starting today.

Britta O'Boyle23 May 2017Tablets Microsoft / Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Microsoft has updated its Surface Pro line, with the introduction of the new Surface Pro. The latest model, which would be the Surface Pro 5 if Microsoft had kept the numbers, packs in more power and a better battery than its Surface Pro 4 predecessor, but what else has changed? Here's how the new Surface Pro (2017) compares to the Surface Pro 4. Microsoft Surface Pro (2017) vs Surface Pro 4: Design New Surface Pro said to be lightest Pro ever at 768g Expected to have similar footprint to Pro 4 at 292.1mm x 201.4mm New hinge system on new Surface Pro The new Microsoft Surface Pro looks similar to its predecessor, but it has a new hinge system on the kickstand which allows it to be used in Surface Studio mode. That means it lays flat to work directly with the new Surface Pen. Its also lost a bit of weight, touting itself as the lightest Surface Pro ever created at 768g. Presumably this is the case for the more powerful models too as otherwise the Pro 4 is actually lighter by a couple of grams, not that we are counting. The Pro 4 weighs 766g, or 786g for the more powerful models. This is for the tablet only with no Type Cover included, making it marginally lighter than the older 794g Pro 3. Measurements have yet to be revealed for the new Surface Pro but we suspect they won't be too far off the Pro 4's front-on footprint of 292.1mm x 201.4mm. The Pro 4 features a magnesium chassis measuring 8.4mm thick, which was 0.6mm thinner than the Pro 3. It could have been slimmer still, Microsoft claimed when it launched, but for the sake of keeping the full-size USB 3.0 port in tact that's about as slim as it could be, which is likely to be the same for the new Surface Pro. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review Microsoft Surface Pro (2017) vs Surface Pro 4: Display New Surface Pro and Pro 4 have same 12.3-inch screens Same 2736 x 1824 pixel resolution on new Surface Pro and Pro 4, 267ppi Pro 3 had 12-inch screen, 2160 x 1440 resolution  The new Surface Pro has the same size screen as the Surface Pro 4, measuring 12.3-inches diagonally, which is larger than the 12-inch panel in the Pro 3 so if you're considering upgrading from the Surface Pro 3, you'll get a slightly larger screen in a similar footprint. The resolution of the new model is 2736 x 1824 pixels, which results in a pixel density of 267ppi. This is also the same as the Surface Pro 4 but slightly sharper than the 2160 x 1440 resolution of the older Pro 3. There are no varying resolution options available for any of the models. Microsoft Surface Pro (2017) vs Surface Pro 4: Hardware New Surface Pro has Intel Core 7th-gen rather than Pro 4's 6th-gen RAM options between 4GB and 16GB on both Pro models, SSD between 128GB to 1TB New Surface Pro has 50 per cent more battery life The new Surface Pro features Intel Core 7th-generation processors, while the Surface Pro 4 features Intel Core 6th-gen Skylake processors, which was said at the time of launch to offer 30 per cent more power than the Pro 3. The base model of the new Surface Pro features the Core m3 Intel 7th-gen processor, configurable to a faster-yet Core i7 option. The base model of the Surface Pro 4 features the Core m3 Intel 6th-gen processor, also configurable up to a Core i7 version. RAM options come in abundance too: the entry-level new Surface Pro and Pro 4 both feature 4GB RAM, expandable up to 16GB. This wasn't a possible option for the Pro 3 as the memory was part of the main board, so couldn't even be done manually. The new Surface Pro and Pro 4 storage options start at 128GB SSD, through 256GB, 512GB and even a maximum 1TB option. There is also a microSD card slot on both the new Surface Pro and the Surface Pro 4, however, so paying the extra for the 1TB option might not be worthwhile for many. In terms of battery, the new Surface Pro is claimed to offer 50 per cent more, at 13.5 hours. The Surface Pro 4 by comparison offers 9 hours and it was one of the things that let it down. There is an 8-megapixel rear camera and 5-megapixel front camera on both the new Surface Pro and the Surface Pro 4, both of which are capable of 1080p video recording. Microsoft Surface Pro (2017) vs Surface Pro 4: Accessories New Surface Pen New Type Cover Old Type Cover still available, though not clear if compatible with new Surface Pro The new Surface Pro has the option of several accessories, all of which cost extra with none included in the box. There is a new Type Cover called the Surface Pro Signature Type Cover, which is made from Microsoft's Alcantara material. It has a magnetic interface, doubles up as a protective cover, comes in three colours and it is compatible with the new Surface Pro, as well as the Pro 4 and Pro 3. The Type Cover that launched alongside the Surface Pro 4 is also still available. This keyboard also clips onto a magnetic port and doubles-up as a protective cover too. It will also work with the Pro 3 and Pro 4 models, but it is not clear if it will work with the new Surface Pro as yet. There is also a new Surface Pen, which comes in four colours and offers four times the sensitivity of its predecessor. The new pen is said to be better than ever, offering precision ink on one end and a rubber eraser on the other, as well as tilt for shading, greater sensitivity and "virtually no lag". The new Surface Pro also offers on-screen support for the Surface Dial. Microsoft Surface Pro (2017) vs Surface Pro 4: Software Windows 10 Pro software on both The new Surface Pro and the Surface Pro 4 are up to date and therefore come with the latest Windows 10 Pro operating system. That means the full bevvy of software: from Office to Cortana and beyond so one isn't better than the other in the case of software. Microsoft Surface Pro (2017) vs Surface Pro 4: Price The new Surface Pro (2017) will start at £799 and will ship on 15 June. The Surface Pro 4, by comparison, did start at £749 in the UK and $899 in the US, but it has seen a price drop since the recent announcement, now starting at £675. Both are still more expensive than the Pro 3 however, which started at £639. Incremental upgrades will each add additional cost, although to what degree it's not yet known - the official Microsoft Surface Pro page is live, but it was not accepting pre-orders at the time of writing. Microsoft Surface Pro (2017) vs Surface Pro 4: Conclusion The new Microsoft Surface Pro is said to be rethought from the inside out. It offers a similar design to its predecessor but it delivers more power and a better battery life, while also being lighter in build.  It is more expensive though and the Surface Pro 4 has also seen a reduction in price so for some, the older model might be the better option for budget.

But if the latest leak is accurate, Intel's next-generation silicon is likely to be out of most people's budget. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | May 23, 2017 -- 15:03 GMT (08:03 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Ben Fox Rubin/CNET A leaked slide suggests that Intel is gearing up to release a 12-core desktop processor as part of a new Core i9 release. But does anyone really need 12 cores on the desktop? Or, more importantly, will people pay for 12 cores? See also: Microsoft should have left Windows XP to rot and die Here's what the leaked line-up is rumored to look like: CPU i9-7800X i9-7820X i9-7900X i9-7920X Cores/Threads 6/12 8/16 10/20 12/24 Base clock (GHz) 3.5 3.6 3.3 n/a Boost clock (GHz) 4.0 4.5 4.5 n/a L3 cache (MB) 8.25 11 13.75 16.5 TDP (watts) 140 140 160 160 Cyberwar and the Future of Cybersecurity A spotter's guide to the groups that are out to get you Ransomware attack: How a nuisance became a global threat Devastating attacks to public infrastructure 'a matter of when' in the US The Internet of Insecure Things, and why we're still in denial As you can probably tell, we're looking at high-end chips here, aimed at workstations, and gamers who have crazy budgets. We're also seeing what is likely to be the first shot across the bow of AMD's newly-released Ryzen chips. Now the geek in me wants to start comparing AMD's current processor line-up to the information in this leak and start extrapolating and making wild conclusions. But the analytical part of me is putting the breaks on that. After all, comparing silicon that's out and in PCs to a slide made in PowerPoint. There's a big difference there, and we know that AMD has plans that go beyond the current Ryzen line-up because the company has already made that clear. But we can ask a serious question, and that's whether we actually need 12-core processors in desktops? After all, modern operating systems and applications don't do a particularly good job of leveraging much above four cores. Don't get me wrong, there are situations where "more cores means better," but you have to know when you're spending money on cores wisely, and when you're just throwing money at silicon that you're not really going to leverage. So if Intel can push 12-core i9 processors out the door before the end of the year -- the leak suggests they could land as early as August -- then we have a great chip for workstations and gamers who have deep pockets. Sure, it's niche, but still an important market to cater for. And the leaked slide suggests that the Core i9 will have more going for it that just more cores and more speed. The 44 PCIe lanes on the higher-end i9s opens up the way for systems to have more flexibility by including more M.2 slots for high-performance storage and more lanes for PCIe slots (and expansion to three and four graphics cards). 44 lanes is a huge increase over the 16 lanes offered by the Intel i7-7700K, and even the 40 lanes provided by Intel's monster $1,650 i7-6590X (AMD's Ryzen chips have 24 PCIe lanes). More robotics Watch this 3D-printed robot walk on sand This is the first soft robot that can walk on rough surfaces. Read More Those extra lanes will make a difference, but only those pushing the limits of the current envelope -- and spending serious money -- will see the benefit. Another point of note is TDP (Thermal Design Power), which is a measure of the amount of heat generated by the chip that the cooling system will have to deal with. 140 watts is a lot of heat to get rid of, especially compared to the 95 watts generated by the high-end Ryzen. But the watts per core generated by the rumored Intel 12-core i9 doesn't seem too bad when you consider that the top Ryzen is an 8-core chip. But it still leaves the subject of pricing, and the inescapable fact that Intel chips are expensive. Intel's 10-core i7-6590X is an eye-watering $1,650, and no matter how you cut it, that's a lot of money. That's where the i9 might hit a speed bump. After all, PCs aren't really flying off the shelves, and buyers are more price sensitive than ever. While we'd all love to have 12 cores at our disposal, not many will be willing to spend over a thousand dollars on just the silicon. And that's the edge that AMD currently has over Intel -- silicon at a price point that people are willing to pay.

Starting from £799, the new Surface will be available on 15 June 2017, the same day as the new Surface Laptop. The new 2017 Surface Pro remains largely unchanged from the Pro 4, but has one significant change - Microsoft no longer considers it a 2-in-1 device, but rather a laptop, as the company believes it provides everything you'd need on a laptop.  The new device is named as the 'new Surface Pro', it doesn't follow the numeric sequence many thought it would follow. So no, it isn't called the 'Microsoft Surface Pro 5'. Microsoft Surface Pro: UK release date and price The new Surface Pro will be available on 15 June 2017, in 26 different markets including the UK. Starting from $799/£799, it isn't cheap. The Surface Pro 4 (128GB with an Intel Core m3 and no Pen) can now be found for £674.10 and $699 in the US. Controversially, Microsoft isn't including a Surface Pen with any new Surface Pro device. It's claimed that Microsoft sees many upgrading from the Pro 4, but to me that seems like a sneaky tactic to make people purchase the accessory. Microsoft Surface Pro: Features and specs The new Surface Pro looks identical to the Pro 4, but has several fundamental differences. The biggest news is the inclusion of new Intel Kaby Lake processors. This time around, the new Surface Pro will start shipping with the Intel Core m processors too, which sits aside the Core i5 and Core i7 processors. This also means that its internal graphics have received a cyclical update, with the Intel HD 615 and 620 in the Core m3 and Core i5 models respectively. The Core i7 model comes with the more powerful Iris Plus 640 iGPU. Memory configurations haven't changed, with 4-, 6- and 16GB models available. Its internal memory has received a healthy boost with PCIe NVMe technology now used throughout its internal SSDs, with a choice of 128-, 256-, 512GB and 1TB are available. Another notable change is its quoted battery life. It's now 13.5hrs, up from 9hrs on the Pro 4. This sizable increase in battery life will be good news for those looking to use the laptop without the sight of a power plug.

A front-facing 5-megapixel camera and microphone are also used to access Skype and Windows Hello features, which are both fundamental parts Windows 10. There's also an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera for taking pictures of scenery. USB Type-C is still missing from the new Surface Pro, with Microsoft opting to maintain its proprietary connector for charging. On the plus side, there's still an SD card slot, mini-DisplayPort, a standard USB Type-A 3.0 port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Wireless connectivity options include Wi-Fi 802.11ac and Bluetooth v4.1. Unfortunately, the rumours of a stunning 4K display aren't true. The same 2,736 x 1,824 (267ppi) resolution is utilised with a PixelSense display, which allows multitouch and a visually accurate display. The Surface's accessories have also received an update, with both the keyboard and pen receiving healthy updates. The Type Cover keyboard now has slightly more travel distance, allowing you to type more naturally. The pen has double a number of supported pressure levels, allowing you to more accurately draw or write on your new Surface Pro. The Type Cover is available from £150 and the Surface Pen is set to cost £100. You'll be pleased to know that you can use the £90 Surface Dial with thew new Surface Pro. This allows designers greater freedom and allows them to replicate a Microsoft Surface Studio. Finally, you can look forward to LTE variants of the new Surface Pro, with Microsoft announcing that in Fall 2017 there will be devices that can independently from an access point.

Surface Laptop vs. Spectre x360 vs. XPS 13 By Daniel Rubino Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:30 pm EDT 31 Comments Daniel Rubino is executive editor of Windows Central. He has been covering Microsoft since 2009 back when this site was called WMExperts (and later Windows Phone Central). His interests include Windows, Surface, HoloLens, Xbox, and future computing visions. Follow him on Twitter: @daniel_rubino. We pit the Surface Laptop up against the best-in-class HP Spectre x360 and Dell XPS 13 in terms of raw specifications and features. Which is the best value? Let's find out! Choosing a laptop in 2017 in the Ultra class – that is very thin, light, yet still utilizing a full dual-core Intel Core processor – is becoming increasingly difficult, which is a good problem to have. In fact, knowing what's coming from other manufacturers, we know it's only going to get harder. Three Ultrabooks – HP Spectre x360, Dell XPS 13 (9360) and the soon to be released Microsoft Surface Laptop – offer some very desirable traits in a modern, compact Ultrabook. Which is the best? They all are, which means no matter which you choose you will be quite happy. Nonetheless, there are some significant differences between the three that will help guide your decision. HP Spectre x360 13t with a 4K display. Here is how all three compare in direct specifications and features. Note: Dell and HP both offer different screen types whereas Surface Laptop is more limited. Category XPS 13 Spectre x360 Surface Laptop Processor 7th gen Intel Core i3, i5, i7 U-Series 7th gen Intel Core i5, i7 U-Series 7th gen Intel Core i5 or i7 U-Series Display size 13.3 inches 13.3 inches 13.5 inches Display resolution 1,920 x 1,080 (166 ppi) 3,840 x 2,160 (331 ppi) 1,920 x 1,080 (166 ppi) 3,200 x 1,800 (276 ppi) 2,256 x 1,504 (201 ppi) Display type InfinityEdge touch or non-touch BrightView LED / IPS LED PixelSense touchscreen RAM 4/8/16GB LPDDR3 1866MHz 8/16GB LPDDR3 1866MHz 4/8/16GB LPDDR3 1866MHz Graphics Intel HD 620 Intel Iris Plus 640 Intel HD 620 Intel Iris Plus 640 Intel HD 620 Intel Iris Plus 640 Storage 128/256/512GB, 1TB SSD 128/256/512GB SSD 128GB, 256GB, 512GB SSD Battery 60WHr 46WHr Unknown Wireless Killer 1535 802.11ac Bluetooth 4.1 Intel 8265 802.11ac Bluetooth 4.1 Marvell AVASTAR Dimensions 11.98 x 7.8 x 0.33-0.60 in (304 x 235 x 9 to 15 mm) 12.8 x 9.03 x 0.41 inches (325.12 x 229.36 x 10.41 mm) 12.13 inches x 8.78 in x 0.57 inches (308.1 x 223.27 x 14.48 mm) Weight 2.7lbs (1.2kg) non-touch 2.9lbs (1.29kg) touch 2.7lbs (1.24kg) 2.76lbs (1.25kg) Ports 2x USB 3.0 SD card 1x USB-C Thunderbolt 3 3.5mm jack 1x USB-A 2x USB-C Thunderbolt 3 3.5mm jack 1x USB 3.0 Mini DisplayPort Headset jack Surface Connect Pen No Yes (4K option only) Yes (not included) Price from $799 from $989 from $999 Pricing matters If you are on a strict budget, you will have to make some compromises. The Dell XPS 13 (9360). Dell has a much lower starting point at just $799 for the XPS 13. Granted, that's just 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and a non-touch 1080p display with a Core i3 processor. What's neat though is you are getting that premium build quality and Infinity Edge display making that $799 model look like a $2,000 version. It's also easy to upgrade the RAM and storage later if you need it. Dell XPS 13 (9360) review HP has the best all-around value but with a higher starting point. For $1,089 (often on sale at $989) you can grab a Spectre x360 13t with a faster Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. That display is also a full-touch 1080p (but no pen support) and the device is a real 2-in-1 offering much more versatility in the long run. Microsoft's Surface Laptop is priced the highest starting at $999 but that only gets you 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. While you can use a pen with the Surface Laptop, the device does not act as a 2-in-1 convertible. The ideal starting point is the 8GB/256GB variant that starts at $1,299, which is about $300 more than the more versatile HP Spectre x360. All three have outstanding build quality with a combination of metal, carbon fiber, or Alcantara fabric. Performance should be the same The HP Spectre x360t, Dell XPS 13 (9360) and Surface Laptop all utilize Intel's 7th generation Core U processors. Those are dual-core and vary in speeds. In theory, all three devices should perform the same, and in our benchmarks, Dell and HP are usually tied. It's not known what the clock-rate is for the Surface Laptop, so we'll have to compare when our review unit arrives. HP Spectre x360 review One interesting change starting in May is the availability of Iris Plus 640 graphics. All three manufactures – HP, Dell, Microsoft – are offering the faster Intel GPU in its Core i7 versions. We haven't tested those GPUs just yet, but they should all bring similar performance. None of the choices offer discrete NVIDIA graphics, however, due to thermal constraints. The only consideration here is that HP and Dell offer lower resolution options with Full HD 1080p display. Processors and GPUs pushing fewer pixels results in a zippier experience whereas HP's full 4K option can be a bit slower especially for gaming (but it sure looks good!). Amazing displays but only one is 4K When it comes to screens HP, Dell and Microsoft put its best into these devices. That goes even for HP and Dell's lower resolution Full HD displays, which still look outstanding. If you prefer anti-glare (matte) Dell is your only option at the Full HD 1080p level. It's also the only non-touch option. All the rest are glossy with touch. All three high-resolution displays (HP's 4K, Dell's QHD+ and Microsoft's PixelSense) offer actual resolutions with non-PenTile designs for those who are concerned. Pen support If you are into digital inking or thinking about using it someday, your options are limited. Dell is completely out as none of the XPS 13's offer inking support. If you want that from Dell, you'll need to go to its XPS 13 2-in-1 and grab the Dell Active Pen. Only the Spectre x360 4K offers a true Windows Ink experience. The Surface Laptop does not come with a Surface Pen, but you can buy and use one with it. The experience, however, is expected to be mediocre only because you cannot tilt the display back very far or use it as a tablet. Only HP's Spectre x360 13t at 4K offers an authentic digital inking experience. That device turns into a tablet and comes with an excellent N-Trig pen (you can even use the Microsoft Surface Pen if you wish). Odds and ends There are some other important distinctions between the devices that could sway your decision. If you use a web camera often then HP's Spectre x360 is your best bet. That device not only has an appropriately placed web camera (top display bezel) but one that is Full HD 1080p. The Surface Laptop sticks to a decent but lower resolution 720p one. Dell still places the camera on the lower display bezel and is off-center due to the restrictions of the Infinity Edge display. It too is just 720p. For Windows Hello and bio-metric authentication, all three laptops have options, but only HP and Microsoft use facial recognition via infrared, which is the most convenient. Dell offers an optional fingerprint reader, which works quite well. Battery life is harder to determine as it will partially depend on what display type you get. HP's 4K display will surely be the least efficient whereas Dell's non-touch Full HD option will likely be the best, especially when paired with its larger battery. Microsoft is claiming a bonkers 14.5 hours even with its high-resolution screen, but without an evaluation, it is just a manufacturer estimate now. For ports, it's a bit clearer. HP is the most future-proofed with two USB Type-C including Thunderbolt 3, which supports external GPUs (eGPU) like the Razer Core. Luckily, the Spectre x360 keeps a single USB Type-A for legacy devices. Dell is the opposite with just one USB Type-C with Thunderbolt 3 (but no eGPU support) and two USB Type-A. The Surface Laptop is the worst with just a single USB Type-A and a mini DisplayPort. Only the XPS 13 offers a full SD card slot while Surface Laptop and the Spectre x360 don't have any media card abilities without an external reader. Conclusion: HP is still the best value There is no clear winner here as each of these laptops are outstanding. The Dell XPS 13 is near legend and one of the smallest devices in this category. It also has the lowest starting price and likely the best battery life of all three. The Microsoft Surface Laptop brings its unique 3x2 display aspect ratio, Alcantara keyboard deck, and that beautiful Surface design aesthetic. It's also the most expensive with the fewest features. HP Spectre x360 with 4K display review The HP Spectre x360 13t, however, brings the most for the least. Of all three, it is the only one that is also a 2-in-1 convertible offering many more usage scenarios including tablet mode. The Spectre also is the only one with a 4K display option with the highest concentration of pixels at 331 ppi, and it puts an N-Trig pen in the box. Finally, the Spectre x360 is the only one that supports eGPUs through its full-powered Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C port. See at Best Buy In the end, all three offerings are fantastic, but choose which makes the most send for your budget and needs. Reader comments Which is the best?

So? Not everyone needs or wants that. Shoot, most of you can even explain to me what the TB3 port spec is. Either way, a single port is no reason to ignore the Surface Laptop. XPS 13 can't do pen either, so fair is fair. 2 1 day ago Reply jcrus To his point though, the x360 seems to be the most future proof and versatile of the 3. I really wanted to like the surface laptop as it was cheaper and newer specs than the surface book, but in the end the TB3 and and ink support sealed the deal for me. Even USB-C would've been a good choice to have. I get the market is in transition, but that's exactly the reason to have it. 6 1 day ago Reply Daniel Rubino There is no "to his point". I clearly state throughout the article the HP Spectre is the best bet and value. The very point of this article is to COMPARE what is out there to point out the pros and cons of each. The lack of features does not mean it should not be included, the differentiating features is exactly the point here. Saying the Surface Laptop "shouldn't even be in this comparison" defeats the purpose of this article, which his to educate people on exactly WHAT those differences are. Finally, the notion that TB3 alone is the sole reason to buy - or not buy - a laptop is not a universal conclusion. Even for my needs TB3 is nice to have, but not a must. 2 1 day ago Reply ddn123 I believe Microsoft consiously "limits" the Surface to specific design capabilities.  I think Microsft wants to make money with Surface, but they are not going to chase market share.  Microsoft clearly adds a premium to the device.  Any OEM can design and build a competitive device and make plenty of money at a 10% lower price than a comparable Surface device. Why only one port?  Surface Laptop is not trying to be "future" proof or be a jack of all trades.  They want to sell a high end device with excellant build quality and excellant engineering that will last the customer 5 years of useful life.  My laptops are good for about 3 years.  Last fall, I bought (for $750) a HP envy with a 15.6" 1080p touch screen, i7-7500, 256 SSD, 8 gb RAM, device with lots of ports.  I only use the USB typw A port.  I have a donggle to hook up my internet.  No need to use Wifi at the office.  This laptop replaced a Haswell powered Dell.  I also use a SP4 especially when I travel.  Why the 15.6" Envy?  I need the full number key pad to enter all the numbers running my business.  My son went to college last fall and bought the Dell XPS 13.  We bought a portable DVD/CD drive.  He use an Apple in highschool.   Why did Microsft wait 7 months or so to introduce the 7th gen iCore?  To give the OEMs a headstart. My origianl point stands.  Microsoft does not want to step on any OEM toes.  So the make a hig end device, limit its use cases and charges more than a comparable high end OEM device.  Why?  Microsoft wants to lead the WinTel ecosystem beyound the desktop.  Sure wish they would have kept the Lumia around.  I use my Lumia 950 and it is great.  Better than Android. Did something happen to Microsoft Wallet?  I have been using it for tap and play.  Today, my bankcard was not in Wallet.  Then I tried to add it back, which has happend before after an update I assume.  But the app does not even have an option to add debit cards.   Also I wonder why my laptops seem to degrade over time.  Maybe the Windows S is the solution. 1 1 day ago Reply MrElectrifyer Touch and pen is half-assed gimmick on the Surface Laptop as it can't be converted to Tablet form. There's a major difference between having something practical and merely having it for the sake of having it... Thunderbolt 3 port enables you to connect to an external GPU when docked at a desk, and every "high-end" device should have at least 1 in 2017. 5 1 day ago Reply Daniel Rubino eGPUs are currently niche and overpriced for many users. Don't pretend even for a second such tech is going mainstream any time soon. Again, you folks need to ground yourself in the real world and not the power-user nerd'dom we have here. Regardless, the point here was for me to - dun dun dun - spell out exactly what the differences between the Spectre x360 and Surface Laptop are so that people can make, you know, informed decisions. What we have here is just a lot of griping. 5 1 day ago Reply MrElectrifyer And you think in the "real world" many would be looking at $1000+ computers in the first place if they wanted merely the basics? At such high price point, the hardware should be future proof, and having such port aids in that. 1 1 day ago Reply Matt Dargis A ton of people buy $1000 dollar laptops. Go walk into a MS Store or Apple store when new hardware comes out. People eat these things up. 0 22 hours ago Reply GraniteStateColin @MrElectrifyer, yes, there is a brisk market for $1,000+ laptops. That's why Apple sells the MacBook Pro, and sells it well. In contrast, there is not a brisk market for eGPU solutions. That's extremely niche. It's only needed for very specific applications, and many who use those applications either go with a desktop or a gaming laptop. It's a wonderful feature, but it's very niche. Just to use myself as an example, I care much more about the ability to flip the screen around and use it as a tablet. That rules out the Surface Laptop for me. I also have no interest in FHD resolution -- too low for my tastes. So this article is perfect for teaching me which systems match my needs.  0 15 hours ago Reply ttsoldier I was really waiting to see his TB3 justification. Thought he would have had some compelling arguments.Oh well. :( 1 1 day ago Reply actionresult How about Lenovo Yoga 910? 0 1 day ago Reply Clinton Block I thought that all of the Spectre x360s now come with a pen, is it just a different technology from N-Trig? 0 1 day ago Reply jedah I'm fairly certain this is true.  The FHD 13" 2017 version I have from Best Buy works w/ my old Surface 3 pen. Dan:  You might want to revise this line "Only HP's Spectre x360 13t at 4K offers an authentic digital inking experience" as it kind of sounds like only the 4K model supports the pen. 1 23 hours ago Reply MrElectrifyer WTF, no seamless storage expansion on the Spectre x360? Fail. No reason why something bigger than my Surface Pro 2 shouldn't be future proof with storage expansion. -3 1 day ago Reply Aaron M The 15 inch Spectre does have one if your willing to go bigger screen size. 0 1 day ago Reply L0n3N1nja The HP is the only one I would consider, I prefer a 2 in 1 with inking support. 0 1 day ago Reply JaimitoFrog Dan, if you get a second SL to test, please compare Win10S and W10Pro head to head.

And that's the Surface Laptop. 0 1 day ago Reply Ahy Nonimous loser 0 13 hours ago Reply ddn123 I don't think Microsft believes people will be heavly using inking on the Surface laptop.  But inking is a core capabiity distinctly absent from Macs.  I think Apple and Microsoft signed a never ending cross licensing agreemnet back during Apple's (near?) bankruptcy when Microsft paid Apple $100s of millions in the late 90's (I believe).  Did they force Apple to forgo touch on Mac'S?  Why in the world in 2017 does a Mac remain touchless?  Is it something OSX simply cannot be made to do without breaking alot of the code? iOS is a good mobile OS but not as powerful as Windows.  Hence the iPad sales decline. So Microsft will promote inking on every Surface device.  Expect a whole lot of inking demonstrations on the Surface Pro tomorrow.  Here is Microsofts brand Surface Hub Surface Studio Surface Pro Surface Laptop Lumia (not) Surface Phone (someday) 0 1 day ago Reply ddn123 Duh, I forgot the Surface Book 0 1 day ago Reply GraniteStateColin Yes, Jobs went to MS and got a $150M investment in the late '90s, if memory serves. I think MS got Apple to agree to make IE the default browser on Macs. MS also wanted some goodwill on the monopoly cases they were facing, so by supporting a competitor, this helped that argument both in courts and in public opinion, which had already begun to turn against Microsoft (and that MS still struggles with today, even though now, I would say is the most customer friendly of all the big tech companies). It has become an Apple marketing theme to dismiss the value of touch on a computer. Touch is for phones and tablets. No one wants to touch a computer screen. Or so they have argued over the years. Apple is therefore in a tough situation with touch. I suspect they will eventually add full touch support, with the TouchBar being the start. As an aside, I think the notion of monopoly control of an industry through natural successful growth has been fully demonstrated to be a myth. Entrerpreneurs will always find a way to leapfrog the dinosaur. The dinosaur must evolve and stay relevant, or it will fail. Historically, the only monopolies that have survived have been government supported, where legislation made it impossible for competitors to come along (think AT&T, trains, or power companies -- all enabled and protected by legislation, that's crony capitalism enabled by governments that are too big, not capitalism and free enterprise). So there is an irony in governments attacking successful companies to break them up in the name of stopping monopolies. 0 15 hours ago Reply SnipingNinjaX1 Nice artical but why do all these laptops use lpddr3 instead of lpddr4? 1 1 day ago Reply vladi The greatest issue since the beggining of time of utlrabooks is the desktop UI that doesn't belong on anything less than 15" screens. Its pixel hunting experience from the get go honestly. All notebook OS providers fail in this field right on their noses. Spending a lot fo time in front of 13" or smaller working in desktop environment strains your eyes seriously. It's a troture you never feel until your eyesight goes to crap but then it's too late. 0 17 hours ago Reply Miti 1982 I am thinking of getting the 15.6 inch Spectre, but Amazon reviews are not really good...

For this second generation, Huawei has on offer a 13-inch clamshell aimed at premium users, a 15.6-inch device for education and office use, and their next generation 2-in-1 called the MateBook E, aimed squarely at improving the design on their first attempt back in 2016. Perhaps somewhat ironically, because I left my main laptop charger at home, I’m writing this news on that 2016 model which I carry as my backup work device. The MateBook E: Surface Says Whaaaaat? When Huawei launched the 2016 MateBook, for a first attempt, it hit the market where it needed to. Much like other vendors when making their 2-in-1s, there was some design choices that seemed a little strange but Huawei had at least nailed the quintessential Huawei look, transferring the design ID from their top of the line Mate series smartphones, into a portable PC device. It was also Huawei’s first venture using Intel CPUs in a consumer device. What the MateBook E does, as the second-generation product, is fix those questionable points and bring everything up to the latest hardware. That means using the latest Kaby Lake-Y processors, adjusting what configurations sold the best, and giving a keyboard and hinge that users actually want. It’s a good step up from the 2016 MateBook for sure. Huawei Matebook E Size 12-inch Display 2160 x 1440 160-degree viewing angles 85% NTSC 1000:1 Contrast Ratio 400 nits CPUs Intel Core m3-7Y30 Intel Core i5-7Y54 GPU Intel HD Graphics 615 DRAM 4 GB / 8 GB LPDDR3 Storage 128 GB / 256 GB / 512 GBPCIe Dimensions 278.8 x 194.1 x 6.9 mm 640g (without keyboard)  1100g (with keyboard) Connectivity 802.11ac with 2x2 MIMO (Intel AC 8165?) with BT4.1 Battery 33.7 Wh (4430 mAh at 7.6 V) Additional Features One USB 3.0 Type-C Port 3.5mm audio jack Fingerprint Scanner Dolby Audio Premium MateDock 2 Included 5MP Front Camera Colors Titanium Grey (with Blue folio) Champagne Gold (with Brown or Pink folio) Pricing Core m3 + 4GB + 128GB SSD: 999 Euro Core i5 + 4GB + 256GB SSD: 1199 Euro Core i5 + 8GB + 256GB SSD: 1299 Euro At the heart of the MateBook E is Kaby Lake Y, the 4.5W processors from Intel. Along with Intel’s new naming scheme, here the MateBook E gets either the Core m3-7Y30 or the Core i5-7Y54, matching the similar CPUs to the last gen but on the latest microarchitecture using updated features like Speed Shift 2. These processors come with Intel’s HD 615 graphics, and will be supplied with either 4GB or 8GB of LPDDR3 and then 128GB, 256GB or 512GB of PCIe storage. As with the MateBook 2016, this isn’t expandable. Aside from the processor update, the biggest change is in the keyboard folio. The keyboard folio now comes with the device rather than being an add-on, and the hinge is updated to allow for a full 160 degree of tilt. Unlike the Surface which integrates the hinge into the device, the hinge is part of the folio, and stays with the keyboard but aligns flush when not in use. The hinge mechanism isn’t anything special like we’ve seen with fancy designs before, but with a few minutes use it was clear that the design was sturdy for what it needed to be. The folio uses a new 3-pin connector to the MateBook E, rather than the 7-pin used in the older device (which means no backwards compatibility), and the keyboard has now changed into a spill-resistant chiclet design. I spent a few minutes with the new keyboard, and due to the reduced key travel compared to the older model, it felt a little different and perhaps not as free flowing. It will be interesting to see what others think about it. The folio no longer goes all around the device, which means the power button should hopefully no longer be accidentally activated when closing the folio. Along with the power button is the fingerprint reader, carrying over from the 2016 model, as well as a single Type-C connector. This is used for power as well as connecting to the new MateDock 2, which also comes bundled with the MateBook E in some regions. As with the MateBook X, the MateDock 2 is updated this year as well: it exchanges the ethernet port for an HDMI output and a VGA output, making the device thinner and arguably more applicable to presentational style workflows. The new MateBook E is thinner, coming in at 6.9mm, and houses a 33.7 Wh battery (up from 32.7 Wh) which Huawei claims is good for 9 hours of video playback at 50% brightness. The speaker system is carried over from the 2016 model too, although with Dolby Audio Premium certification. Gallery: Huawei Launches the MateBook E 2-in-1: The Next Generation Huawei revealed pricing for a few models, with the low configuration of m3, 4GB DRAM and 128GB SSD coming in at 999 Euro. The high configuration of Core i5-Y, 8GB of DRAM and 256GB SSD will be 1299 Euro. Colors for the MateBook E will be region dependent, but you’ll see at least one of Titanium Grey (with Blue folio) of Champagne Gold (with a Brown Leather folio or a Pink folio).

Reply Ian Cutress - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link No - the new folio is a 3-pin connector, the old one is 7-pin. The design of the folio is different to in how it rests on the thing. Reply ToTTenTranz - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link At these prices, why would anyone choose this over a Surface Pro? Reply okashira - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link Wacom and Intel Wi-Fi. Two most important features Ms cheaps out on. Reply okashira - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link I had a surface pro 4 i7. The pen was terrible for me. Accuracy is good but dynamic tracking is crap. Not good for someone with fast / small handwriting. The sp1 and sp2 perform way better. The crappy wifi also sucked but I could deal with it. The handwriting was deal breaker for me Reply North01 - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link Talk about a bad day to announce this thing. The new Surface Pro really puts this to shame. Reply okashira - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link It's lighter , thinner , has wacom aes pen, and Intel wifi. Worth considering if any of those are important.

Democrats have panned the plan, which would slash safety net programs that some of Trump's most die-hard supporters rely on to survive. And moderate Republicans, too, are expected to distance themselves from the controversial proposal. “There’s a certain philosophy wrapped up in the budget and that is — we are no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs,” OMB Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Monday, depicting the budget as "welfare reform." The devil is in the details: “The president’s budget plan calls for more than $1 trillion in cuts to a wide range of social programs with millions of beneficiaries … That includes a $600 billion cut to Medicaid over 10 years, despite Trump’s repeated promises on the campaign trail not to cut the program. The budget also takes an ax to the federal food stamp program and Social Security Disability Insurance,” Andrew Restuccia, Matthew Nussbaum and Sarah Ferris report. Reality check: This budget has no chance of becoming law and is mostly just a White House messaging document (Remember, Trump isn't even in the U.S. for today's roll out!). But Democrats will likely try to use the proposal as a cudgel against vulnerable Republicans, forcing them to go on record either denouncing or defending Trump’s proposed cuts to programs that serve the neediest Americans. Much more on the budget details and the potential pushback here: http://politi.co/2qRuaZc FLYNN TO PLEAD THE FIFTH — Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn will plead the fifth, his attorney told the Senate Intel panel Monday, refusing to comply with requests to turn over a list of his communications with Russia ahead of last year’s election. Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said Flynn could be held in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate. “All I’ve asked him for is documents. I don’t know how you can plead the Fifth on a document request,” Burr said Monday night. The Senate threats came after Rep. Elijah Cummings (Md.), top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said he received documents indicating Flynn lied to investigators who interviewed him for his 2016 security clearance renewal. But the question of how far to pursue Flynn is dividing Senate Republicans, several of whom are loath to trigger a potential fight with Trump, who still speaks highly of his former adviser. Oh, okay: And some Republicans who took hard-line stances against Obama-era officials who refused to comply with requests for testimony and documents say this time is different. “Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, who called for [Attorney General Eric] Holder to resign in part for stonewalling Congress, said he could not find fault with Flynn’s decision because ‘you can’t criticize anybody for invoking a constitutional right.’” Austin and Burgess with more: http://politi.co/2qRGoRH What the Hill is reading: "Trump asked intelligence chiefs to push back against FBI collusion probe," from the Washington Post's Adam Entous and Ellen Nakashima. Read more: http://wapo.st/2rcGEOl TURNING THINGS AROUND, LITTLE BY LITTLE — Six weeks ago the House Intel Committee’s Russia investigation was at a standstill, marred in a partisan mess. Then, Rep. Mike Conaway was tapped to take over the probe and now the Texas Republican is getting high praise from Democratic counterpart, Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), for his “devotion to the task.” “What makes [Conaway] rare in this charged moment is that Democrat after Democrat interviewed for this story used the same word to describe him: fair,” Abby Livingston reports for the Texas Tribune. Democrats say the way Conaway runs the Russia probe – he doesn’t always heed Democratic requests but hears them out – is a world away from the partisan sniping that devolved under House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes’ leadership. Today that goodwill will be put to the test as Conaway leads his first public hearing in the probe with former CIA Director John Brennan testifying at 10 a.m. More: http://bit.ly/2qRcvRB WELCOME TO TUESDAY, MAY 23, and thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. Programming note: Your Huddle host is (temporarily) handing off the keys to the mothership while I take some time off to go get married! Yes! Elana Schor and Kyle Cheney will guide you through the daily Hill happenings in my absence. Be nice to them (this means you, trivia players). And don’t worry, I’ll be back in early June. See y’all soon! MONDAY’S MOST CLICKED: House Oversight ranking member Elijah Cumming’s weekend comments on the Russia probe, reported by the Hill, was the winner. WON’T BACK DOWN — Speaker Paul Ryan and the White House are on a collision course over a key tenet of the GOP leader’s tax reform plan, an idea Ryan keeps pushing despite being rejected by Trump officials. Ryan says the border adjustment tax (effectively a tax on imports) is a necessary component to a major tax overhaul. But Senate Republicans have by and large rejected the plan in public (and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said privately it’s dead on arrival). Behind closed doors, top administration officials including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and NEC Director Gary Cohn have indicated they don’t like the idea either. What’s next: The battle will be on full display during a Ways and Means hearing on border adjustment this morning, which is expected to last up to four hours. Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) began circulating talking points over the weekend encouraging panel members to sell the plan. Rachael and Josh Dawsey with more: http://politi.co/2qRLu0x RULES? WHO NEEDS ‘EM — First it was the nuclear option for Supreme Court nominees. Then the House rushed through its Obamacare repeal without waiting on a final CBO score. Now, Republicans are looking at other ways to buck the rules and traditions on Capitol Hill to more quickly push through their agenda, Seung Min reports. “It is a growing sense among Republican senators, and I’m one of them, that we’ve got to make the Senate functional again,” said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.). ** A message from Americans for Affordable Products: Yesterday’s House Ways and Means Committee hearing showed the Border Adjustment Tax is based on academic theory, not real-world reality. Watch ** Some options being batted about: Ignoring the so-called blue slip rule, which is a back-end way for senators to block judicial nominees from their home state; overruling the parliamentarian to repeal more of Obamacare; cutting down the number of hours spent debating a nominee before a confirmation vote; and nixing the procedural vote to begin floor debate on spending bills. SMK brings ya the deets: http://politi.co/2qRrBGz ON SECOND THOUGHT… House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz has postponed a hearing scheduled for Wednesday with former FBI Director James Comey. The move was widely expected after Comey late last week accepted an offer to testify publicly before the Senate Intel Committee sometime after Memorial Day. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will no longer testify before House and Senate appropriators this week on DOJ’s budget request. A DOJ spokeswoman said the cancellation was due to a “scheduling conflict” but it's likely Sessions didn’t want to face the inevitable barrage of questions about the federal probe into Russia. The Senate hearing was rescheduled to June 13, Seung Min reports. POLICE INVESTIGATING THREATS AGAINST GREEN — Investigators are looking into deadly threats made against Rep. Al Green after he called for Trump’s impeachment last week. “You have to confront hate,” Green said on CNN of the lynching threats he's received in recent days. “It's unfortunate many African-Americans have to live knowing they can be threatened with lynching." The Texas Democrat said he hopes “there will be prosecution.” CNN: http://cnn.it/2q527bQ NEW THIS MORNING: BIG SPENDING — American Action Network is launching a $2 million ad blitz today defending the House GOP’s Obamacare repeal, just one day before the CBO will release its score of the bill. With the new buy, AAN has spent $5.6 million boosting supporters of the repeal since it passed out of the House last month. The ads will air in 21 districts nationwide and on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe.' Republicans have outspent Democrats on advertising surrounding the GOP effort to replace Obamacare by a massive margin. Watch the ad here, and watch a member-specific version here. WRITE THIS DOWN Y’ALL! National Seersucker Day is officially coming to Capitol Hill June 8, Sen. Bill Cassidy’s office announced Monday. Cassidy (R-La.) and his returning co-host, Sen.

This year’s Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) has proven to be a successful one for Irish students on both sides of the border, as all three participants walked away with a prize. SciFest 2016 winner Caolann Brady was expected to do well with her project that focuses on the natural treatment of asthma through humming and breathing techniques, as opposed to using inhalers and nebulisers. Sure enough, the Kildare native took the second award spot in the Biomedical and Health Sciences strand of ISEF, winning a prize of $1,500. Winning streak But the biggest winner at the event, from an Irish perspective, has been Cork student Cormac Larkin, who is travelling back to Ireland with not only two awards, but a special honour as well. The Coláiste An Spioraid Naoimh student began his winning streak by picking up the Priscilla and Bart Bok First Award and $1,000 for his project entitled: ‘Case study of Data Mining in Observational Astronomy: The search for new OB stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud’. This was followed by the grand event where Larkin celebrated a second place finish in the Physics and Astrophysics category, along with another $1,500 in prize money. Now, in honour of his recent contribution to the field, Larkin will have an asteroid named after him and an opportunity to present his research early next year at the American Astronomical Society winter meeting. Star researchers Larkin’s research led to the development of a new approach to identify massive stars rapidly, even in the midst of a heavily populated part of the universe known as the Small Magellanic Cloud. These large stars are eight times bigger than our sun and, although they are very bright in ultraviolet light, this light is readily blocked off by interstellar dust and our own atmosphere. Meanwhile, Grosvenor Grammar School student Gareth Reid from Belfast walked away with a prize of $1,000 for his project, ‘Can Machines Learn to Design Better than Humans?’.

Michael Flynn during the closing months of the 2016 presidential election refused to say whether he had been questioned or received a subpoena in connection with the ongoing investigation into the dealings of Trump associates during the campaign. “I cannot comment on that,” Ekim Alptekin told ABC News in an interview on Monday. Alptekin, who was in Washington, D.C. attending a Turkish-American business conference at the Trump International Hotel, founded a Dutch-based company called Inovo that paid the Flynn Intel Group more than $500,000 during the presidential campaign, according to papers Flynn filed with the Department of Justice. Flynn had previously registered as a lobbyist for the firm, but Flynn’s attorneys advised that he file additional documents with the Justice Department identifying himself as an agent for a foreign government. The attorneys believed the work could be construed as principally benefitting the Turkish government, a finding that would trigger the need for registration. “Because of the subject matter of Flynn Intel Group’s work for Inovo BV, which focused on Mr. Fethullah Gulen, whose extradition is sought by the Government of Turkey, the engagement could be construed to have principally benefitted the Republic of Turkey,” wrote a lawyer for the Flynn Intel Group in a letter to the Department of Justice. “To eliminate any potential doubt, the Flynn Intel Group therefore is electing to file a registration under FARA, in lieu of its prior LDA registration.” Alptekin disputed that assessment. “I’ve never represented the government of Turkey,” he said. “All of the reports that implicated or imply that I was in any way representing the government are simply not true.” Gulen is a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania who has been blamed by the Turkish government for orchestrating a failed military coup in July. In November, The Hill published an op-ed written by Flynn comparing Gulen to Osama bin Laden and urging the U.S. to “adjust our foreign policy to recognize Turkey as a priority.” “The forces of radical Islam derive their ideology from radical clerics like Gülen, who is running a scam,” Flynn wrote. “We should not provide him safe haven. In this crisis, it is imperative that we remember who our real friends are.” Flynn has long been a controversial figure. He served in the Obama administration but left government service in 2014 after being reportedly forced out of his position as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn later took a prominent role in the Trump campaign, paving the way to his appointment as Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser. He was forced to resign, however, shortly after the inauguration, after the administration learned he misled Vice President Mike Pence about private discussions he had with the Russian ambassador. At the same time, Flynn’s private work for and speech fees from foreign sources also began attracting scrutiny. Alptekin said in an interview that it was unnerving to see his name and that of his company surface in connection with the unfolding scandal. “I think unfortunately there’s a highly politicized situation in the United States in which a lot of facts are being distorted — there’s a lot of misunderstanding and misperceptions,” Alptekin said. “I don’t think this is a very healthy environment unfortunately. I hope the United States will overcome this period as soon as possible so we can all move forward.” Earlier this month, sources told ABC News that associates of Flynn Intel Group received grand jury subpoenas in recent weeks, stemming from the FBI investigation being led out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office at the Eastern District of Virginia. Those associates have not been identified publicly. Flynn, meanwhile, has refused to honor a Senate committee’s subpoena request for documents relating to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. “He will not be producing the documents they sought,” a source close to Flynn told ABC News. “He is entitled to decline, pursuant to the Fifth Amendment.” Copyright © 2017, ABC Radio.

One of the original purposes of the Surface line was likely to provoke other Windows PC builders to explore novel form factors. If that was the goal, HP's refreshed line of portable PCs makes it look like Microsoft's push was successful. The Envy x360 is built around a 15.6" touchscreen display compatible with Microsoft's Ink pen input technology. The panel is surrounded by a thin bezel that's part of a mission to keep the exterior dimensions small. The 360° hinge allows the machine to be used as a conventional laptop, a tent-style content-consumption screen, or as a tablet in a pinch. A grab-bag of internals specifications is available, with everything from AMD APUs to combinations of Intel Core i7 CPUs and Nvidia GeForce 940MX graphics cards in the mix. At least some models will be capable of supporting dual 4K screens through an HDMI 2.0 port and a USB 3.1 Type-C connector, though we suspect this capability is reserved for only the higher-spec versions. We must note that the AMD APUs on offer are last-generation FX affairs, and that HP calls the Intel chips "next-generation" units. HP's more conventional Envy laptops are available in 13.3" and 17.3" sizes. Either way, the machines sport Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processors with the same vague "next generation" description. Older Envy 13 machines were limited to members of Intel's substantially slower Core m CPU lineup. The 13.3" model is only 0.55" (14 mm) thick, and the Envy 17 is only a little thicker at 0.91" (23 mm). Both models have a lifted hinge design that uses the back of the laptop display panel as a foot to raise the rear of the machine for a higher angle for typing. The machine comes with Type-A USB ports and a Type-C connector that can be used for charging. Like the Envy x360, high-spec models with a Nvidia GeForce 940MX card can drive two 4K displays. The most Surface-like PC in HP's refresh roundup is the Spectre x2. The Spectre x2 has a tablet form factor with a keyboard and touchpad assembly that attaches with magnets for the times when touch input and the included pen are not enough. The 12.3" Ink-compatible touchscreen has a Surface-like 3:2 aspect ratio. HP doesn't say what's the resolution but mentions that the display has six megapixels—simple math says the resolution should be around 3000x2000. Intel seventh-generation Core i5 and i7 CPUs with Iris IGPs are on offer. A fast charge feature allows users to charge the battery for 30 minutes to net eight hours of cord-free use. All storage options are solid-state offerings, with a 1 TB PCIe SSD sitting atop the pile. The rest of the details are pretty thin, but we know that a pair of USB Type-C ports will be included. All four new machines are expected to start shipping in June, with starting prices ranging between $900 and $1050. Getting some of the fancier upgrades like large SSDs and discrete graphics cards will certainly add substantial bulk to the bottom line.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 23 May 2017 | MYT 9:30 AM Smart bangle delivers pregnancy tips to Asian wrists Coel (right), which is designed to withstand the rough and tumble of daily chores, delivers two wellness messages a week in the local language, including what to eat and when to see the doctor. — Grameen Intel MUMBAI: A high-tech bangle that alerts pregnant women to toxic fumes and issues audio tips promises to boost maternal health in South Asia, as smart devices deliver ever more services to remote communities.  The colourful, lightweight bangle also bypasses phone-owning men – feeding information directly to expectant mothers – and is built to withstand the rigours of village life.  "In rural areas, mobile connectivity – and mobile access for women – is an issue, as phones are controlled by men," said Pavel Hoq, chief operating officer at Grameen Intel Social Business, which developed the new device.  "While we had also developed mobile apps for maternal health, we realised a wearable device solely for women, something she would likely wear all the time, would be better to connect with women in rural areas," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Made of durable plastic, the bangle is water-resistant and has a long-lasting battery that does not require charging throughout the duration of a pregnancy.  Nor does it not need an internet connection to work.  Coel, or carbon monoxide exposure limiter, was created by Grameen Intel Social Business Ltd, a joint venture of Intel Corporation, and Bangladesh non-profit Grameen Trust.  The device can be recharged and reused many times, Hoq said.  New jewels  It will join a woman's regular array of bracelets, with most married women in South Asia wearing bangles made of glass, plastic or gold. The decorative finish differentiates the bangle from many other wrist-worn fitness devices or smart watches.  Coel, which is designed to withstand the rough and tumble of daily chores, delivers two wellness messages a week in the local language, including what to eat and when to see the doctor.  An alarm also sounds if high levels of carbon monoxide fumes are generated when cooking with firewood, charcoal or dung, warning the wearer to move away.  Every day, about 830 women worldwide die from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications, according to the World Health Organisation. Nearly a third of these deaths are in South Asia.  Maternal mortality is higher among women living in rural areas and poorer communities, where access to healthcare is often forbidden or curtailed due to a lack of female medics.  In Bangladesh, where more than 70% of babies are born at home, about 5,000 maternal deaths and nearly 77,000 neonatal deaths are reported annually, according to WHO.  In neighbouring India, where Coel has been tested in Uttar Pradesh – among the poorest states in the country – maternal and neonatal deaths are nearly 10 times higher.  At the same time, wearable devices including smart watches, shoes and glasses, are increasingly used for remote healthcare, such as to monitor a patient's cholesterol or insulin levels.  It is a growing market: about 2.5 million such wearable devices were sold in India last year, most priced under US$50 (RM215), according to research firm International Data Corporation.  Coel, which will be priced initially at about US$12-US$15 (RM51-RM65), will be sold in India and Bangladesh first, then in Nepal, said Hoq.  "Easy access to knowledge is crucial in these countries, particularly for first-time mothers," he said.  "We want this device to be a tool of empowerment for women." — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Sony needs fresh hit as PlayStation fans face middle age Ukrainian hacker gets prison in US insider trading case Uber inadvertently underpaid NY City drivers for over two years Brazil appeals court rules Uber driver not entitled to benefits Samsung to reveal stretchable display Are omniscient computers on the way?

By TheresePoletti Columnist Advanced Micro Devices Inc. stock continued on a volatile path Monday, as Chief Executive Lisa Su did her best to shoot down a rumor that just won’t seem to die. Su pretty much quashed any further chatter that AMD AMD, -1.36% would license some of its graphics chip designs to longtime rival Intel Corp. INTC, +0.25%  Monday at a tech conference hosted by J.P. Morgan. "We're not looking at enabling a competitor to compete with our products," $AMD CEO Lisa Su says at JPMorgan tech conference. #NotIntel— Aaron Pressman (@ampressman) May 22, 2017 Su’s comments were read as an emphatic statement that the company is not licensing any graphics designs to the world’s largest chip maker, and caused the stock to tumble about 4% on Monday after Su’s comments. It is just another in a series of swings related to expectations for a licensing deal between the two companies, which began even before Intel’s graphics deal with Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -1.35%  ended this past March. Shares originally jumped on speculation about a deal in February, then enjoyed another large leap after the chip-focused tech blog Fudzilla reported that the two companies had a deal. When AMD quietly shot down those rumors at its Financial Analysts Day later that same day, the stock plunged in response. Along with Su’s statements Monday, Intel has denied the rumors. And analysts say the entire episode was based on nothing, as Intel is under no pressure to license graphics technology after the end of its deal with Nvidia. Read also: Don’t expect AMD to get acquired, thanks to Intel deal “They don’t need a deal to do integrated graphics. They never had to have a license,” said Hans Mosesmann, managing director at Robenblatt Securities Inc., who has a buy rating on AMD. “The deal with Nvidia was basically a settlement on unrelated issues. This Intel/AMD license thing is fake news.” The licensing deal between Intel and Nvidia, in which Intel paid $1.5 billion over six years, provided a permanent license for patents filed before the deal concluded. Intel will need a license for any new graphics technology developed after March, but the chip giant has its own graphics IP and plenty of time to see if competitors come up with new approaches before striking any other deal. The volatility in AMD stock related to a silly rumor is another reminder of the tenuous nature of AMD’s investor equation, which helped its shares soar more than 300% in 2016 but has left them open to extreme volatility. AMD stock has now fallen 2.7% in 2017, while the S&P 500 index has gained 6.9% so far this year. As company executives noted last week at its analyst day, AMD has nothing to lose with its strategy of focusing on new markets such as the corporate server market and high-end personal computer segments, where its market share has dwindled to nearly nothing in those high-margin sectors in recent years. AMD will be competing with Intel in those markets, and the two companies have always enjoyed a fraught relationship, to put it mildly, which includes a previous licensing deal that does not exactly make life easy for AMD. Investors with a sense of the history between AMD and Intel would have known not to put much stock in the recent rumors, but it appears they are in for the same volatility as everyone else until we know for sure that the new product categories will help AMD rebound. If they don’t, expect another gigantic fall, this time due to actual news. AMD shares have fallen 2.7% in 2017, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.18%  has gained 7%.

Cormac Larkin whose original research has won two awards at the Intel International Science & Engineering Fair. Picture: Denis Minihane The honour is being bestowed on Cork Leaving Certificate student Cormac Larkin, who picked up the top astronomy prize at last week’s Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) in Los Angeles. He has developed a new method to discover rare OB stars, the biggest and brightest types of star, in a galaxy over 50,000 light years from Earth. Their very bright ultraviolet light is blocked by our atmosphere, but his research combines observational and computational aspects of astronomy with data science to find new ones. The project won him the most prestigious award in his field, the $1,000 (around €900) joint award from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and the American Astronomical Society. But it also scooped a $1,500 second prize in the ISEF physics and astronomy category, an accolade for which recipients also have an asteroid named in their honour. “It’s a fairly exclusive thing, there are hundreds of thousands of asteroids, but only 12,000 have been named after people,” said a delighted Cormac after he was honoured on his return to school at Coláiste an Spioraid Naoimh in Bishopstown. “My work is really a mix of observational and computational work, but there’s also a lot of computer science involved,” he explained. Cormac plans to publish his research in academic journals, but he is looking forward in the meantime to finishing his Leaving Certificate. He hopes to study astrophysics at third level after he gets his results in August. His will not be the only Irish name being added to the list of asteroids, however, as another Leaving Certificate student also won a second prize in her category at ISEF. Caolann Brady from St Wolstan’s Community College in Celbridge, Co Kildare, was honoured in the biomedical and health science category for her project which identified humming and breathing techniques to help treat asthma. She was at the event in LA, where 1,800 young scientists from 75 countries showcased their research after winning the top prize at Ireland’s SciFest last November. Cormac won first prize in the chemical, physical and mathematical science category at the BT Young Scientist & Technology Exhibition. His work has identified 26 candidate OB stars, a 10% increase in the known population in the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy. Using a two-metre diameter telescope in Australia, all seven of those surveyed to date to within the instrument’s accuracy have been confirmed. His research will be furthered over the next year through work on the southern hemisphere’s largest telescope, after he was recently awarded time on the 10m Southern African Large Telescope.

Supplier Metabox www.metabox.com.au Price $2166 AUD > Pricing info Specs 15.6-inch FHD 1920 x 1080 WVA Matte 120Hz LED with G-Sync • NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB • Intel Core i7-7700HQ Processor (quad-core, HyperThreaded, Turbo 3.80 GHz) • 16GB DDR4 2400MHZ Memory • Intel 540S 240GB SATA 3 M.2 SSD Tweet Email this Print this Feedback We’d RTFM… if one was included. While the other laptops this issue focus on portability, battery life, sexiness and convertibility, the Metabox Prime P650HP-G is an entirely different creature. This chunky hunk of plastic forgoes artisan-crafted aluminium shells, or a chassis so thin that it can barely be seen side on. No, this laptop focuses on cramming in as much performance into a relatively simple chassis for a competitive price, delivering a gaming machine that won’t blow the bank yet is also just portable enough to be able to take on the road on a regular basis.  Ok, when we say portable, we may be stretching things a little bit. At 2.6kg it’s a long shot from the 1.2kg we’re used to with the other laptops we tested this month, but that’s to be expected when you’re packing real firepower into a gaming machine. It’s also considerably larger thanks to the 15.6-inch screen. The entire chassis is made of plastic to help keep the costs and weight down, but feels rugged enough to handle a rough night out at a long LAN. It’s also rather large, measuring 38.5 cm (w) x 27.1 cm (d) x 2.5cm (h); again though, for a gaming machine this isn’t exorbitant.  Unfortunately we had some confusion with the G-sync support of this machine. While the specs claim it has a 120Hz 1080p G-Synch enabled monitor, we could find no mention of G-sync in the Nvidia control panel. It was only after doing a bit of Internet investigating that we discovered that MSHybrid (another name for Nvidia’s Optimus technology) had to be disabled via the BIOS to allow G-Sync to work. Users simply shouldn’t have to deal with this kind of issue. We also had severe performance issues before running the Windows update – it would take around ten seconds to simply open a program such as 3DMark. Yet given the Intel 540S 240GB SATA 3 M.2 SSD and Intel Core i7 7700HQ Processor, these results simply shouldn’t happen – we implore suppliers of hardware to ensure their machines are up to date when they send them out.  Speaking of the CPU, it’ll cut the mustard for any of today’s games, with its four HyperThreaded cores peaking out at 3.8GHz under load. To our delight, the Prime was barely audible under load, even during the most demanding tests, so we couldn’t use our sound meter as it was below the ambient noise level. On the GPU side, we have Nvidia’s capable, albeit entry-level, GTX 1060. This is a fine, affordable part if you’re playing relatively basic games or high-end games on low-to-medium level; just don’t expect to laud it through Ghost Recon: Wildlands on the highest detail settings. As our benchmarks show though, it’ll give most modern games a good run for their money, though we do feel the 120Hz display will probably be a waste for most, as they’ll never come close to these framerates. Said display is surprisingly an IPS panel, and it delivers a very wide viewing angle as well as solid contrast and colour performance. It’s not in the same league as some of the other displays in this issue, but at this price it does well enough.  Given the added padding of this machine, it’s no surprise to see a veritable smorgasbord of I/O options. On the right-hand side we have three 3.5 mm stereo minijacks – one for headphones, one for S/PDIF and one for a microphone. There’s a total of five USB ports on both sides, with twin USB 3.1 Gen 2 port (Type-C), as well as 3 USB 3.0 ports (USB3.1 Gen1, 1 x powered USB port, AC/DC). Nvidia’s GTX 1060 also delivers excellent video output capabilities, in the form of one HDMI output port (with HDCP) and two Mini DisplayPort 1.3 output Ports, though we’re not sure which are powered by the CPU’s integrated GPU, and which are powered by the Nvidia discrete GPU. Networking is supplied via Intel 8265 AC Dual Band WIFI/BT chipset, along with a single Gigabit Ethernet port.  If there was one issue we had with this machine it’s the number of applications set to automatically start when this machine boots up. There’s no explanation of what they actually do, though their vague names do suggest it – GPU overclock, CPU/Mem overclock, etc. Instructions or manuals for said apps simply weren’t included. And that’s our biggest problem with this machine – combine the lack of any information regarding enabling G-Sync, along with a numerous overclocking apps that don’t include manuals, and Metabox really needs to lift its game when it comes to supplying technical documentation with this machine. Despite this, it’s still great value for the performance, but needs a little tinkering to get the most out of it.  Related Reviews Review: MSI GT83VR 7RF Titan SLI gaming laptop Review: Asus GL502VS with GeForce GTX 1070 Review: Asus ROG Strix GL502 Gaming Laptop Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority.

The company has announced two new laptops, the Matebook X and Matebook D, as well as a refresh to last year's Windows 10 tablet, the Matebook E. The MateBook X is a 13-inch ultraportable clamshell device made of a "microencapsulated phase change material" that looks and feels like metal. It also looks quite a lot like Apple’s MacBook Air but has better specs overall — that includes a Core i5-7200U or i7-7500U processor with Intel HD Graphics 620, 4GB or 8GB of RAM, 256GB or 512GB of solid-state storage, and a 2160 x 1440 IPS display with a 4.4mm bezel, wide viewing angles, 100% sRGB color coverage, and 350 nits, 1000:1 contrast. In terms of ports and connectivity Huawei included only two USB 3.0 Type-C ports — one for charging, and one for data transfer — and a 3.5mm headphone jack. There are no USB Type-A ports or any other kind of ports, however the company includes MateDock 2.0 with the laptop, which offers one USB Type-A, DVI, and HDMI each as well as a second USB-C port for pass-through charging. Other features of this stylish, 12.5mm thick laptop include a power button that doubles as a Windows Hello-compatible fingerprint reader, a Dolby Atmos-enhanced surround sound system, and battery life good for up to 10 hours while watching 1080p video on a single charge at 50% screen brightness. Pricing for the MateBook X starts at at €1,399 (about $1,569) and it will come to the US in two colors: space gray and a warm, bronze-like gold called "prestige gold." The MateBook D is a 15-inch laptop targeted at a wider audience with prices starting at €799. It features an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, 4GB to 16GB of RAM, storage option from a single 500GB HDD to a combined 1TB hard drive and 128GB SSD, and optional GeForce 940MX discreet graphics. Its 15.6-inch display offers a Full HD 1920x1080 resolution and uses an IPS panel with wide viewing angles and 800:1 contrast. Like the MateBook X, the MateBook D also offers a narrow bezel design. Ports include USB 3.0 Type-A, one USB 2.0 Type-A for some reason, full-size HDMI and 3.5mm audio jack. Its bulkier than the X but not terribly so at 16.9mm thick and but only appears to include a 43.3 Wh battery which is on the low side for laptops of this size. It’ll come in Space Gray, Champagne Gold and Aurora Blue. Lastly, the MateBook E is the company’s second generation 2-in-1, featuring an upgraded display (2K instead of 1080p) as well as a much improved battery that reportedly holds up for up to 9 hours. The 10-inch Windows 10 tablet now comes with the leather keyboard accessory included instead of it being a separate accessory, and there’s an optional upgrade to an Intel i5 processor up from an Intel M3. The tablet starts at €999 and has either 4GB or 8GB of RAM, 128GB to 512GB internal storage options, one USB Type-C port and will be available in gray or gold colors.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Senate issues two more subpoenas for Michael Flynn’s documents posted at 7:21 pm on May 23, 2017 by John Sexton Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES As Ed noted yesterday, Gen. Michael Flynn said he would plead the 5th Amendment rather than testify or deliver documents to the Senate Intelligence Committee. But the Intel Committee isn’t taking no for an answer and today it issued two more subpoenas to Flynn’s businesses. Politico reports: President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser has invoked his Fifth Amendment rights in response to the committee’s previous subpoena attempt. Committee leaders are directing the new subpoenas at his businesses, believing they can’t plead the Fifth. “While we disagree with Gen. Flynn’s lawyer’s interpretation of taking the Fifth, it is even more clear that a business does not have a right to take the Fifth if it’s a corporation,” said top committee Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia. Before becoming Trump’s national security adviser, Flynn ran a consulting firm called the Flynn Intel Group. Sen. Chuck Schumer is pushing to force Flynn to appear before congress and plead the 5th Amendment, at which point he could be held in contempt. “He should comply and there will be consequences if he doesn’t,” Schumer said Tuesday. It’s fair to assume Schumer is primarily interested in creating a TV spectacle which might benefit Democrats in 2018, but it sounds as if Republican Chairman Richard Burr isn’t ruling out the possibility of holding Flynn in contempt if he doesn’t respond to the latest subpoenas. “At the end of that option is a contempt charge, and I’ve said that everything is on the table,” Burr said during a press briefing today. But Burr made clear he wasn’t there yet. “We would like to hear from General Flynn. We’d like to see his documents. We’d like him to tell his story because he publicly said ‘I’ve got a story to tell.’ We’re allowing him that opportunity to do it,” Burr said. Here’s the full statement to the press by Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Warner: Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES Tags: House Intelligence Committee, Michael Flynn, subpoenas Related Posts: Rep.

However, this time the company is insisting that the Pro is no longer a tablet that can act as a laptop, but is instead "the most versatile laptop we've ever built". Announced at an event in Shanghai, the device has been overhauled to feature a 13.5-hour battery life, 7th generation Intel processors and a whole host of behind-the-scenes improvements. It's been almost two years since the last iteration of the Surface Pro was made available, and in the meantime Microsoft's expanded its devices line to include the more powerful Surface Book hybrid, the Surface Studio desktop machine and the recently announced Surface Laptop. Microsoft says it's brought all its experience making these devices to bear on the new Surface Pro, and after a quick look at the machine in action it's an easy claim to believe. The Pro's hinge can now prop the device up as normal or open to 165 degrees to lay it down in a slanted "studio mode", making for a miniature version of the Surface Studio's drafting table shape for writing or drawing. Microsoft says in this mode the device is stable enough to lean on. The Type Cover that transforms the Surface Pro into something resembling a traditional laptop has also seen an upgrade, although disappointingly it is still a sold-separately accessory. The cover packs LED-backlit scissor mechanism keys and a full-sized glass trackpad for multi-touch gestures, and it's covered in the same warm-looking suede-like Alcantara fabric seen on the Surface Laptop. Also compatible with the redesigned Surface Pen — which Microsoft says is twice as fast as the Apple Pencil with only 21ms of latency — and the design-focused Surface Dial, the new Pro might be incredibly light (at less than 800 grams) but could be a hefty investment if you need all the various bits and pieces. Launching in Australia in June, the Surface Pro will be available at a number of different price-points depending on the amount of grunt you'd like the laptop to have. $1199 will get you a model with one of Intel's mobility-focused m3 chipsets, a 128GB drive and a meagre 4GB of RAM, while the models with the more powerful i5 processors will start at $1499. Power users that want one of the i7-powered beasts with Iris Plus graphics and 16GB RAM will need to part with at least $3299. Microsoft says it plans to release additional models that include 4G LTE functionality later in the year. Speaking to Fairfax Media ahead of the Shanghai event, Microsoft's GM for commercial devices Ryan Gavin said the device is a new start for the two-in-one form factor the company helped pioneer. "It will feel very familiar … but in fact it's a complete redesign. We have, inside and out, over 800 custom new parts that we've built for the Surface Pro", Gavin said. "This is not your father's Surface Pro 4. This is a new Surface Pro, dramatically improved". Many of those new parts offer improvements on existing functionality. For example there's still the biometric Windows Hello camera to log you in to the machine by scanning your face, but it's now fast enough to do it "within half a beat". The design of the machine is also now heat efficient enough that the m3 and i5 models are completely fan-free and silent, while the i7 models will only have their fans kick in when they're really working hard. While the chassis has undergone some subtle softening and slight tweaks, many aspects of the exterior machine, including the 2736x1824 display, the cameras and the array of ports — USB 3.0, Mini DisplayPort, MicroSD — appear identical to 2015's Pro 4. For better or worse, this stands in contrast to many competitor devices which have made the switch, at least partially, to the new USB-C standard. Upgraded, versatile, and exceptionally powerful, with iconic Surface design. Meet the new Microsoft #SurfacePro. #MicrosoftEvent pic.twitter.com/o1RQjzlySE — Microsoft Surface (@surface) May 23, 2017 The return of the Pro and its reclassification as a laptop means Microsoft's portable lineup now consists of three similar Surface machines, but Gavin says each offers a distinct experience. "This isn't about one replacing the other, this is about having a full range of laptops now from Surface that will match where our customers are", he said. The beefy Surface Book "is the ultimate performance machine. When you want to be powering multiple monitors, to be putting it through the ultimate paces, that's our Book experience. Then we've got Surface Laptop with Windows S, which really is our take on the traditional laptop experience but we've streamlined it for performance and security". The new Pro, then, is designed to be a mobile creative studio that packs in as much power and functionality possible, while still lasting all day and being "lighter than the bag that you're putting it in".

NATION Intelligence showed contacts between Moscow and Trump campaign last summer, former CIA chief says Former CIA Director John Brennan tells a Congressional panel investigating Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election that he was concerned about Trump campaign officials interactions "because of known Russian efforts to suborn such individuals." Former CIA Director John Brennan tells a Congressional panel investigating Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election that he was concerned about Trump campaign officials interactions "because of known Russian efforts to suborn such individuals." David S. CloudContact Reporter The CIA received intelligence last summer indicating Donald Trump’s campaign aides were in contact with Russian government officials, information that was worrisome enough to pass to the FBI for investigation, former CIA Director John Brennan said Tuesday. Brennan said it wasn’t clear at the time if the Trump aides were acting as Russian agents or if the “contacts and interactions” were routine and unconnected to a larger effort by Russian intelligence agencies to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. Brennan’s first public accounting since he stepped down in January shed new light on the political scandal that has dogged President Trump since before he took office and that now has spawned separate investigations by the FBI, four congressional committees, the Pentagon and a Virginia grand jury. “I encountered and am aware of information and intelligence that revealed contacts and interactions between Russian officials and U.S. persons involved in the Trump campaign that I was concerned about,” Brennan told the House Intelligence Committee. He said the intelligence “raised questions in my mind whether the Russians were able to gain the cooperation of those individuals.” Brennan revealed that the U.S. government concerns about possible collusion were deeper than previously known and involved multiple contacts. He also made clear that the unease began long before the intelligence community publicly disclosed a joint conclusion in January, shortly before Trump’s inauguration, that Moscow had sought to help Trump win. His testimony could intensify the clash between the CIA and Trump, who has repeatedly and angrily denied any personal dealings with Russia during the campaign. The rift has widened since the president disclosed highly classified intelligence, reportedly from Israel, to senior Russian diplomats during a May 10 meeting in the Oval Office. At a separate Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats refused to confirm or deny a Washington Post report that the president asked him in March to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. "On this topic, as well as other topics, I don't feel it's appropriate to characterize discussions and conversations with the president," Coats said. Trump reportedly made the same request to Adm. Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency. Both intelligence chiefs, the report said, refused to comply with Trump’s request, which they both deemed inappropriate. The White House has declined comment. Trump last week denied reports that he had asked then-FBI Director James B. Comey to back off an investigation of Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security advisor. Trump fired Comey on May 9. The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee said Tuesday they were sending subpoenas to Flynn’s businesses, the Flynn Intel LLC and Flynn Intel Inc., seeking documents related to dealings with Russia before the election. The move comes a day after Flynn’s lawyers refused to comply with a previous committee subpoena sent directly the retired three-star Army general, citing his constitutional protection against self-incrimination. Sen. Richard M. Burr (R-N.C.), the committee chairman, and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), the vice chairman, said they were issuing new subpoenas because companies can’t invoke the 5th Amendment. Burr said the committee could recommend Flynn be charged with contempt of Congress for his refusal to comply with the original subpoena. “I’ve said before everything is on the table,” Burr told reporters. “That’s not our preference today. We would like to hear from General Flynn. We’d like to see his documents. We’d like him to tell his story because he publicly said, I’ve got a story to tell.” Brennan said he personally warned Russia to stop meddling in the U.S. campaign in an Aug. 4 telephone conversation with Gen. Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the Federal Security Service, Russia’s primary spy service. Brennan said he told Bortnikov that the Russian operation, which involved hacking and leaking thousands of Democratic Party emails, “would be certain to backfire” because its disclosure would outrage Americans. "It should be clear to everyone Russia brazenly interfered in our 2016 presidential election process and that they undertook these activities despite our strong protests and explicit warning that they do not do so," Brennan said. In addition to alerting the FBI last summer, which is responsible for counterintelligence investigations, Brennan said he created a special unit in the CIA to monitor and analyze intelligence about Russian’s interference in the election, inviting the FBI and the NSA to participate. He said he also briefed senior members of Congress in August and September on the Russian meddling. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C) pressed Brennan on whether there was “evidence of collusion” between Moscow and the Trump campaign. “I don’t know whether or not such collusion — and that’s your term — such collusion existed,” Brennan answered. “I don’t know. But I know that there was a sufficient basis of information and intelligence that required further investigation by the [FBI] to determine whether or not U.S. persons were actively conspiring, colluding with Russian officials.” In a statement issued from Rome, where Trump arrived Tuesday on the third leg of his overseas trip, a White House spokesman said the day’s hearings offered no evidence of campaign wrongdoing. "This morning's hearings back up what we've been saying all along: that despite a year of investigation, there is still no evidence of any Russia-Trump campaign collusion, that the President never jeopardized intelligence sources or sharing, and that even Obama's CIA Director believes the leaks of classified information are 'appalling' and the culprits must be 'tracked down,'" it said. Brennan declined to name who the CIA believed was in contact with Russian authorities during the campaign last year. But he said the individuals may not have realized they were a target of Russian intelligence services. “Frequently, individuals who go along a treasonous path do not even realize they are along that path until it gets a bit too late,” he said. Comey told Congress in March that the FBI opened its counterintelligence investigation last July into whether Trump’s campaign associates deliberately coordinated with Moscow in what U.S. officials called an influence operation. The Justice Department handed the FBI inquiry over to a special counsel, Robert Mueller III, last week to ensure its independence. The probe has broadened to include a criminal investigation into whether Flynn improperly accepted payments from entities associated with the Russian and Turkish governments. Trump ordered Flynn to resign in February, barely three weeks into the new administration, after news reports disclosed he had lied to White House colleagues, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his communications with Sergey Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States.

By Rene Ritchie Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 1:01 pm EDT 9 Comments Rene Ritchie has been covering the personal technology industry for almost a decade. Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Should you buy a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, MacBook... or Surface Laptop? Now that Microsoft is in the notebook business, you have more options to consider than ever! At first glance, Surface Pro looks like a MacBook Air with a Retina display and is priced like one too. Start adding options, though, and you quickly reach MacBook Pro pricing. But with only one port, like a MacBook, but USB-A rather than the newer USB-C. So, depending on how you look at it, Surface Laptop might be the best of all the MacBook worlds. Or the worst. Which is it? TL;DR: Do you need to run macOS? If you know you want to run macOS, you have to get a Mac. If you want to run Windows, you can get a Surface Laptop or a Mac — the latter lets you run both. Keep reading the rest for more details, but if running Mac software, including developing for iOS, are key to you, your decision tree is already done. Surface Laptop vs. 13-inch MacBook Air Microsoft's Surface Laptop looks like a MacBook Air, is as light and portable as an Air, and is priced like an Air, so that's the easiest comparison to get started with. There are several important differences, though. Surface Laptop comes in Burgundy, platinum, cobalt blue, and graphite gold, while MacBook Air only comes in aluminum. It also has a high-density, multi-touch capable display, something Apple has never gotten around to adding to the Air. Plus, Surface Laptop has current-generation Intel Kaby Lake processors while MacBook Air hasn't had a spec bump in years. On the down side, Surface Laptop has only a single USB-A port + DisplayPort (and a proprietary Surface Connect port) while the MacBook Air has two USB-A ports and a Thunderbolt 2 port. It also has a faux-fabric finish around the keyboard and trackpad which… may not hold up to dirt and grime the way MacBook Air aluminum will. If you need to run macOS on as inexpensive a laptop as possible, you need to get a MacBook Air. Otherwise, unless and until Apple updates it's entry level, Surface Laptop is the better bang for your buck. See 13-inch MacBook Air at Apple See Surface Laptop at Microsoft Surface Laptop vs. 12-inch MacBook Because the Surface Laptop has only one USB port, it's easy to draw comparisons to similarly single-ported 12-inch MacBook. There are, however, differences. MacBook has a USB-C port, the modern standard that the entire industry is moving towards. Surface Laptop has USB-A, the legacy standard the entire industry is moving away from. Both will require dongles or docks, though MacBook will require them less as time goes on and Surface Laptop will require them more. Both have high-density displays, though MacBook lacks the multi-touch functionality of the Surface Laptop. It also lacks the faux-fabric finish around the keyboard and trackpad which…may not hold up to dirt and grime the way Apple's aluminum will. Surface Laptop comes in Burgundy, platinum, cobalt blue, and graphite gold, while MacBook comes in silver, space gray, gold, and rose gold. Surface Laptop, however, has an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor which, while requiring a fan and increasingly noise, is more powerful than the virtually silent Intel coreM series in the MacBook. If having the absolute smallest, lightest, and quietest — and potentially pinkest! — computer is imperative to you, get the MacBook. If you want more power, a multi-touch display, and a cobalt blue color option, get the Surface Laptop. See 12-inch MacBook at Apple See Surface Laptop at Microsoft Surface Laptop vs. 13-inch MacBook Pro Surface Laptop might look like and be priced like a MacBook Air, but start upgrading it and you quickly reach MacBook Pro price points. With a few differences, of course. No matter how much you pay for a Surface Laptop, you still only get the one, legacy USB-A port that sounds like a good idea today but will become more and more of a constraint over the next few years. MacBook Pro, on the other hands, comes with the option for two or four USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports that may need a dongle now but will become table stakes in a year or two. Surface Laptop comes in Burgundy, platinum, cobalt blue, and graphite gold, while MacBook Pro only comes in silver and space gray. MacBook Pro lacks the faux-fabric finish around the keyboard and trackpad which… may not hold up to dirt and grime the way Apple's aluminum will. Both have high-density displays, though MacBook lacks the multi-touch functionality of the Surface Laptop. MacBook Pro does have the option for Touch Bar, a multi-touch strip that replaces the function keys with something more dynamic, though arguably not much more useful. Better, though, Touch ID, which lets you use your fingerprint to log in and authenticate for apps and purchases, including Apple Pay. Surface Laptop is a generation ahead when it comes to Intel processors but it's arguable how much, if at all, that helps with graphics. Apple stayed on Skylake, in part, for Iris Pro options that didn't yet exist on Kaby Lake. If graphics are more important to you than central processing, you may be better off with MacBook Pro. If a multi-touch display or brighter color options are a must, go with Surface Laptop. If Touch ID and more numerous, advanced ports are what you need, go with MacBook Pro.

I'd wager the decision tree starts with the OS, and goes from there. If you like macOS and have invested in software and workflow habits (and I'll assume that most readers of iMore fall into that camp) then you simply aren't going to buy a Surface, no matter how "nice" it is. It's the wrong machine with the wrong OS for you. Ditto for Windows users. If one is happy with Windows, then buying any Mac is a hassle with additional costs for software, learning, etc. Switching can be complex for many, and the hardware is only part of that equation. 0 12 hours ago Reply DannyJJK You missed the part where you can install Windows on a Mac, so if one is happy with Windows, they can certainly buy a Mac without hesitation 0 11 hours ago Reply bradpdx Yes, you can install Windows on a Mac. But I'd wager that Windows users who buy Macs for hardware only (and run Windows on them) are not a large demographic, and it is a more expensive route to take. If that is one's primary use case, then perhaps the Surface is the better choice. I don't think Apple is very worried about that group of customers. One might argue that a Mac is a better deal because it lets you use both Windows *and* MacOS, but that is only true for people who truly "need" both in one machine. Most people don't, and live in a single OS all day long. In that case, you should have a computer that is best suited to and capable of running that OS. 0 10 hours ago Reply quakerotis I noticed the Microsoft laptop has no Mac OS option. Why would anyone want to buy that? 0 12 hours ago Reply bradpdx Exactly ;-) 0 10 hours ago Reply VAVA Mk2 You can likely Hackintosh it 0 6 hours ago Reply VAVA Mk2 Surface Laptop 0 6 hours ago Reply johnathanblade IMO, A desktop O/S is Chrome and a file system to take advantage of the Sh-load of storage that you've filled with your personal media and documents (unless you are a gamer.) I would wager that that is true for most users. Hardware and brand cache are the draws here, and the premium lead is Apple's to lose. The real question for iMore users is, why would you ever consider an expensive MacBook clone when you have the resources to have what it is that you actually want? 0 2 hours ago Reply Joe Belkin PAY real money to run WINDOWS? Uh, no,. NEVER. Should I live in a house or a tent? Do you really need to ask that question? It's a NON STARTER. Would you like a cookie or a kick in the nads? Would like you like a hug from Heidi Klum or be stuck under a naked unconscious Steve Ballmer? What else will you ask - dialup or fiber? There's no point in comparing any WINDOWS OS product to an Apple OS product if I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. If you buy me use a Surface, sure, I'll be a corporate drone but recommend one? No. ask for one? No. Why would pay money to lie naked under a unconscious Steve Ballmer? 0 0 sec ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the chairman and vice chairman of the committee, made the announcement Tuesday afternoon, a day after Flynn’s attorney said that the retired lieutenant general was refusing a subpoena and would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. They also told reporters that a contempt charge “is on the table” for Flynn if he refuses to turn over the subpoenaed records, which are being sought as part of the committee’s counterintelligence investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential campaign. Warner, a Democrat, said that the subpoenas were issued Tuesday afternoon for Flynn Intel, LLC. and Flynn Intel, Inc., two Alexandria, Va.-based consulting firms that Flynn started after he left the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. Warner said that Flynn’s businesses are being subpoenaed because it is believed that “a business does not have the right to take the Fifth if it’s a corporation.” In his remarks, Burr said that the committee would still like to hear from Flynn and to review his business documents related to the Russia investigation. Flynn received payments from several foreign entities through Flynn Intel. He was paid $45,000 by RT, the Russia-owned media outlet, to appear at a gala in Moscow in Dec. 2015. And in August, Flynn signed a $600,000 lobbying contract with a Dutch shell company closely linked to the Turkish government. Records regarding that relationship are reportedly the subject of a federal grand jury subpoena issued out of the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. “If in fact there’s not a response we’ll seek additional counsel advice on how to proceed forward. At the end of that option is a contempt charge,” Burr told reporters. And asked whether the committee is considering granting Flynn immunity, Burr ruled out the idea. “We don’t believe that it’s our place today to offer him immunity,” he said.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the committee, identified the businesses as Flynn Intel Group LLC and Flynn Intel Group Inc., both based in Alexandria, Va. The committee's action comes a day after Flynn’s lawyer notified the committee that his client will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and not comply with the committee’s subpoena seeking documents related to its investigation. "A business does not have the right to take the fifth," Warner told reporters. The investigation focuses on whether Flynn and other Trump associates colluded with Russia to boost the Republican candidate in the 2016 elections. Trump fired Flynn in February because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with Russia’s ambassador about potentially easing economic sanctions. Flynn is also being investigated over whether he was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. Intelligence committee chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said Tuesday that the panel also sent a letter to Flynn’s lawyer questioning whether his client can indeed invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid turning over documents.  Burr added that if there is no response from Flynn, the committee may consider pursuing a contempt of Congress charge. "Everything is on the table," Burr said. Everything but immunity, he added. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

First spotted by Liliputing, it's full of last year’s specs, like a RealSense ZR300 depth camera, an Atom x7-8700 quad-core processor, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of built-in storage. In addition to the camera, the system includes the whole suite of motion and location sensors you'd expect on a modern smartphone, plus ambient light detection, a barometer, a thermal sensor, a noise-canceling microphone, and a mono speaker. There's also Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built in. A Micro HDMI plug means you can use it as a computer while you’re setting it up, but a 2,000mAh battery makes it portable. Out of the box, the system runs Ubuntu 16.04, with ROS (Robot Operating System) and RealSense support preinstalled. Hardware-wise, you can probably cobble together something similarly powerful for $399, but it's nice to have all these features in one tidy package. ROS is the standard for robotics tinkerers, and Euclid has most of the brains and sensors you'd need for a robot — you just need to bring a body. Euclid is up for preorder now. It will start shipping on May 31st.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Intel Unveils Strategy for State-of-the-Art Artificial Intelligence iCrowdNewswire – May 23, 2017 Intel Offers Broad Portfolio Spanning Data Center to IoT Devices and Software to Make AI Foundational to Business and Society NEWS HIGHLIGHTS Intel announces AI strategy to drive breakthrough performance, democratize access and maximize societal benefits. Intel introduces industry’s most comprehensive data center compute portfolio for AI: the new Intel® Nervana™ platform. Intel aims to deliver up to 100x reduction in the time to train a deep learning model over the next three years compared to GPU solutions. Intel reinforces commitment to an open AI ecosystem through an array of developer tools built for ease of use and cross-compatibility, laying the foundation for greater innovation. SAN FRANCISCO –  Intel Corporation today announced a range of new products, technologies and investments from the edge to the data center to help expand and accelerate the growth of artificial intelligence (AI). Intel sees AI transforming the way businesses operate and how people engage with the world. Intel is assembling the broadest set of technology options to drive AI capabilities in everything from smart factories and drones to sports, fraud detection and autonomous cars. At an industry gathering led by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Intel shared how both the promise and complexities of AI require an extensive set of leading technologies to choose from and an ecosystem that can scale beyond early adopters. As algorithms become complex and required data sets grow, Krzanich said Intel has the assets and know-how required to drive this computing transformation. In a blog Krzanich said: “Intel is uniquely capable of enabling and accelerating the promise of AI. Intel is committed to AI and is making major investments in technology and developer resources to advance AI for business and society.” Intel’s Robust AI Platform Intel announced plans to usher in the industry’s most comprehensive portfolio for AI – the Intel® Nervana™ platform. Built for speed and ease of use, the Intel Nervana portfolio is the foundation for highly optimized AI solutions, enabling more data professionals to solve the world’s biggest challenges on industry standard technology. Today, Intel powers 97 percent of data center servers running AI workloads and offers the most flexible, yet performance-optimized, portfolio of solutions. This includes Intel® Xeon® processors and Intel® Xeon Phi™ processors to more workload-optimized accelerators, including FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) and the technology innovations acquired from Nervana. Press kit: Intel Artificial Intelligence: Unleashing the Next Wave Intel also provided details of where the breakthrough technology from Nervana will be integrated into the product roadmap. Intel will test first silicon (code-named “Lake Crest”) in the first half of 2017 and will make it available to key customers later in the year. In addition, Intel announced a new product (code-named “Knights Crest”) on the roadmap that tightly integrates best-in-class Intel Xeon processors with the technology from Nervana. Lake Crest is optimized specifically for neural networks to deliver the highest performance for deep learning and offers unprecedented compute density with a high-bandwidth interconnect. “We expect the Intel Nervana platform to produce breakthrough performance and dramatic reductions in the time to train complex neural networks,” said Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group at Intel. “Before the end of the decade, Intel will deliver a 100-fold increase in performance that will turbocharge the pace of innovation in the emerging deep learning space.” Bryant also announced that Intel expects the next generation of Intel Xeon Phi processors (code-named “Knights Mill”) will deliver up to 4x better performance1 than the previous generation for deep learning and will be available in 2017. In addition, Intel announced it is shipping a preliminary version of the next generation of Intel Xeon processors (code-named “Skylake”) to select cloud service providers. With AVX-512, an integrated acceleration advancement, these Intel Xeon processors will significantly boost the performance of inference for machine learning workloads. Additional capabilities and configurations will be available when the platform family launches in mid-2017 to meet the full breadth of customer segments and requirements. Enabling AI Everywhere and Cloud Alliance with Google* Aside from silicon, Intel highlighted other AI assets, including Intel Saffron Technology™, a leading solution for customers looking for business insights. The Saffron Technology platform leverages memory-based reasoning techniques and transparent analysis of heterogeneous data. This technology is also particularly well-suited to small devices, making intelligent local analytics possible across IoT and helping advance state-of the-art collaborative AI. To simplify deployment everywhere, Intel also delivers common, intelligent APIs that extend across Intel’s distributed portfolio of processors from edge to cloud, as well as embedded technologies such as Intel® RealSense™ cameras and Movidius* vision processing units (VPUs). Intel and Google announced a strategic alliance to help enterprise IT deliver an open, flexible and secure multi-cloud infrastructure for their businesses. The collaboration includes technology integrations focused on Kubernetes* (containers), machine learning, security and IoT. To further AI research and strategy, Intel announced the formation of the Intel Nervana AI board, which will feature leading industry and academic thought leaders. Intel announced four founding members: Yoshua Bengio (University of Montreal), Bruno Olshausen (UC Berkeley), Jan Rabaey (UC Berkeley) and Ron Dror (Stanford University). Additionally, Intel is working to make AI truly accessible. To help accomplish this, Intel has introduced the Intel Nervana AI Academy for broad developer access to training and tools. Intel also introduced the Intel Nervana Graph Compiler to accelerate deep learning frameworks on Intel silicon. In conjunction with the AI Academy, Intel announced a partnership with global leading education provider Coursera* to provide a series of AI online courses to the academic community. Intel also launched a Kaggle Competition (coming in January) jointly with Mobile ODT* where the academic community can put their AI skills to the test to solve real-world socioeconomic problems, such as early detection for cervical cancer in developing countries through the use of AI for soft tissue imaging. “Intel can offer crucial technologies to drive the AI revolution, but ultimately we must work together as an industry – and as a society – to achieve the ultimate potential of AI,” said Doug Fisher, senior vice president and general manager of the Software and Services Group at Intel. With the addition of the new edge and data center products, as well as the enablement programs, Intel has the full complement of technologies and ecosystem reach required to deliver the scale and promise of AI for everyone. AI for the Betterment of Society Lastly, Intel showcased some of the initiatives the company is investing in and partnering with to help maximize the positive impact of AI on the world. They include: Intel is committing $25 million to the Broad Institute* to drive high-performance computing for genomics analytics. Through a five-year collaboration, researchers and software engineers at the Intel-Broad Center for Genomic Data Engineering will build, optimize and widely share new tools and infrastructure that will help scientists integrate and process genomic data. The project aims to optimize best practices in hardware and software for genome analytics to make it possible to access and use research data sets that reside on private, public and hybrid clouds. Intel is a founding partner of Hack Harassment*, a cooperative effort with the mission of reducing the prevalence and severity of online harassment. The initiative is evaluating AI technology as a tool in this effort and is working to develop an intelligent algorithm to detect and deter online harassment. Over time, this capability will be released as an open source API that can be used in a variety of applications. Intel is also a key partner of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children* (NCMEC), a nonprofit whose mission is to help find missing children, reduce child sexual exploitation and prevent child victimization. Intel is providing AI technology and advising the center with the goal of accelerating the critical work of NCMEC’s analysts to respond to reports of child sexual exploitation. 1For more complete information about performance and benchmark results, visit www.intel.com/benchmarks.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)    Intel Chief: Russians May Have Held Back Clinton Bombs For Her Presidency Ryan Pickrell China/Asia Pacific Reporter 1:17 PM 05/23/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP The Russians may have had more damning information bombs held in reserve for an anticipated Hillary Clinton presidency, former CIA Director John Brennan said in a congressional hearing Tuesday. “There was a traditional animus between [Vladimir Putin] and Secretary Clinton,” Brennan told a House intelligence hearing exploring Russian involvement in the democratic process, as well as the Trump administration’s ties to Russia. The former intelligence chief hinted that the Russians may have obtained additional information through hacking that they did not release prior to the election. (RELATED: Anyone Who Reads About Russian Hacks And Donald Trump Should Read This First) “If they did collect more information about her that they did not release, I think they were probably husbanding it for another day,” Brennan explained. South Carolina Representative Trey Gowdy asked the former CIA director whether he thought Russia had information in reserve. When Brennan refused to answer in an open session, Gowdy again pushed for a yes or no answer. Brennan did not publicly confirm or deny whether U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russia has additional information on Clinton to disseminate. “The efforts to further hurt her if she became president, that information or any derogatory information on her, could have been husbanded for a post-election period,” Brennan further revealed. Brennan emphasized that Russia’s primary goal was to weaken Clinton’s candidacy. The former intelligence chief said that the Russians may have tried to boost Trump’s prospects, even though they likely believed his prospects were low. The main aspiration was to hurt Clinton’s candidacy. (RELATED: CONFIRMED: Putin’s Election Hacking Was About Hurting Clinton, Not Helping Trump) “I think that they anticipated that Secretary Clinton was going to win the election,” Brennan said, commenting on Russian meddling in the election. “I believe that they tried to damage and bloody her before the election, but also I would have anticipated that had she been elected their efforts to denigrate her and hurt her would have continued during her presidency.” Follow Ryan on Twitter Send tips to ryan@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.

Peter Bright - May 23, 2017 5:11 pm UTC Enlarge / The new Surface Pro looks very similar to the Pro 4 and Pro 3. Microsoft reader comments 127 Share this story Further ReadingSurface Pro updated at last: Kaby Lake gives longer battery life, but still no modern portsThe new Kaby Lake-equipped Surface Pro is an incremental update on the Surface Pro 4. It has Intel's latest processor and a healthy improvement to battery life, but it doesn't include USB Type-C or Thunderbolt 3 connectivity. But Type-C connectivity may be coming later in the year. Panos Panay, vice president of Surface, told the Verge that the company was working on a dongle for the Surface Pro and the Surface Laptop to add Type-C connectivity. The dongle will connect to the Surface Connect port—the magnetic port used to connect to the charger and to the Surface Dock—and will support both charging from Type-C chargers and connecting to Type-C peripherals. The Surface Connect port also supports display output—Microsoft's own Surface Dock includes display connectivity, as well as Ethernet, USB, and power—so in principle this dongle could also support USB Type-C's Alternate Modes, allowing the use of Type-C cables to connect to Type-C monitors. There's no release date, price, or even pictures of what this dongle will look like, with Panay saying only that it will come later in the year. Panay took pains to make clear that he's not a Type-C hater, telling the Verge "I love the technology in Type-C, I believe in Type-C." So why isn't the technology included in the Laptop or the new Pro? He offered a range of reasons: there's still some confusion over different chargers and cables, he didn't want to remove the still ubiquitous Type-A, and he also said that when chargers are mutually compatible people tend to lose them. When the charger is specific to a device, apparently they don't. These feel like reasonable arguments against abandoning the older ports entirely, though they seem a bit less convincing when it comes to adding a Type-C port or two in addition to the Type-A and mini-DisplayPort ports already on the machine.

I met more new people this year than in previous years. The quantity and quality of people there was better than I have ever seen it.” With over 100 exhibitors (16 percent of them new to the event), more than 100 sessions and a sold-out event spread over several hotels, PSA made the decision to move the event to a bigger venue next year, said Bill Bozeman, president and CEO of PSA Security Network. TEC 2018 will take place March 11-15, 2018 at the Downtown Denver Sheraton. As usual, TEC officially opened with a Monday evening cocktail reception. One of the things integrators most enjoy about events like this is the networking opportunity, said Bert Bongard, president of LVC Companies Inc. “[TEC] is one of the most valuable events we have because it is a captured environment,” he said. “It is a selected group of people, even though they may be competitors. Relationships where we help each other and learn from each other in a non-combative setting are very worthwhile.” This year’s keynote presentation followed on Tuesday morning and featured a topic PSA has been at the forefront of pushing out to the industry — cybersecurity. Matthew Rosenquist, cybersecurity strategist for Intel Corp., spoke on “Cybersecurity Risks and Recommendations — Where Your Focus Needs to Be.” Bozeman said he was pleased this year that cybersecurity is not only accepted by the industry and PSA members, but that they are also starting to see opportunities as well. “Everyone now understands the whole cybersecurity issue,” Bozeman reported. “The big international meltdown we had when TEC was winding down reinforced that. Everyone gets it. We don’t have to spend time saying, ‘You need to know about this.’ Now we are taking it to the next stage about what exactly we should be doing, what services they can provide. We had zero pushback from our community on cyber this year.” Always one of the more popular sessions, this year TEC decided to shake things up a bit when it came to the State of the Industry to better represent the trends and direction the security industry is headed. In past years this session has been either broken out by manufacturers and integrators or combined a selection of the two. This year’s panel featured Chuck Wilson, executive director of NSCA, which includes ProAV members; David Silvester, founder and president of 3SE, an M&A-focused business; Gunvir Baveja, CEO of eVigilant Security, a cyber and physical security integrator; and Matthew Rosenquist, the Intel cybersecurity strategist and keynote speaker. “I thought the State of the Industry session went very well,” Bozeman said. “It was standing room only.” Taylor Carr, executive vice president for Securadyne Systems (SDM’s 2016 Systems Integrator of the Year) appreciated the panel-makeup. “I enjoyed the State of the Industry session. The trends and advancements discussed by the diverse panel were quite insightful,” he said. Keith Kranz, sales manager for LVC Companies said the key takeaway for him at this session was “cyber, cyber and cyber.” Danko added, “You either walked out thinking ‘I have to buy [or partner with] a cybersecurity company or it will be the end of my company. You have to be thinking cybersecurity one way or the other.” Beyond cybersecurity, probably the hottest topic of discussion was the recent announcement by PSA of the acquisition of the ProAV organization, USAV. “PSA owners had questions about why the move into ProAV,” Bozeman said. “We were very pleased that the vast majority understood and were happy when the strategy was explained.” With its extensive investments in resources and a solid internal infrastructure, PSA felt its capabilities were being underutilized and sought a way to expand, Bozeman said of the move. “We decided to diversify our efforts and determined the best fit for PSA was ProAV. What is interesting to me is the original plan is not what happened. The plan was for us to grow our AV business slowly and organically. We were in the end of a search process for a management team. During that time we were approached by USAV, who told us, ‘We are at a spot where we need to invest big time like you did and we don’t have the resources to do that. We would consider selling if we can come to an agreement.’ It ended up changing our business plan.” The biggest benefit, Bozeman said, is that the deal made sense even if no AV integrators were selling security or vice versa. “Will there be crossover? Yes. Do I see this being some industry changing thing for PSA? No.” Instead, Bozeman foresees lots of partnering. “We do a lot of command and control centers and inevitably our integrator either gets stuck at the video wall or they partner with someone. These partnerships will be solidified and locked down now.” Bongard agrees. “I was impressed with the discussion on the acquisition and how well Bill and the team laid that out,” he said. “I thought the acquisition was a very good move on PSA’s part. We do some AV already and this will open up some more doors for us and give us an opportunity to become of more of a partner with those products and expand our revenue and buying power through PSA.” Tom Hruby, executive vice president of Security Equipment Inc. (SEi), said the acquisition was a popular topic among the attendees. “I plan on researching where security and AV cross over and what the opportunities might be for a traditional security integrator,” he said. At Tuesday’s Vendor Awards luncheon, recognition was given not only to the traditional customer service and vendor award winners, but also to the National Deployment Program (NDP) March Madness — an event where each region competed as a team to score the most points for specific plays. Each team was coached by a member of the PSA staff and was supported by an NDP vendor partner. Seneca Dunk Squad (featuring A2 Systems, Audio Video Corp., Casco Security Systems, Communication Resources Inc., Dallmann Systems, eVigilant, iS2 Tech Services, LVC Companies Inc., Northland Controls, Photo Scan of Los Angeles, SecurAlarm Systems and Security Centres International) took top honors as the March Madness Team winner. In addition, Matthew Ladd of the Protection Bureau was named NDP March Madness MVP and Seneca was awarded the first ever NDP Vendor Partner of the Year award. According to PSA, Seneca was first vendor to reward NDP members with an immediate, additional discount for all their products with a valuable rewards points program and a multitude of other benefits based solely on NDP membership. For the complete list of winners see 2017 PSA Security Network Award Winners. All in all, TEC 2017 was a hugely successful event according to the integrators who attended. “One thing I am very happy and impressed with being a PSA owner is the philosophy PSA has taken,” Bongard said “If you are not growing you are dying. They are looking to better the organization and themselves. That is one thing I took away from TEC. PSA is not standing still. That is what I like to see and what we need to see — a willingness to grow and push themselves outside of the box.” Hruby added, “PSA TEC was very upbeat this year from the opening reception through the last day. Everyone was optimistic about the upcoming business and the show was very well attended.” This was Carr’s first time attending PSA TEC, he said. “I was very impressed with the event. It was well organized, and all the sessions were top-notch. TEC has the right balance of technical training, through leadership events and networking.” That assessment was echoed by J. Matthew Ladd, president, The Protection Bureau. “Overall TEC was a big success…. With the sessions I attended I saw two major themes. One was evaluating your company and growing RMR to make your company more valuable. And the other was cybersecurity. Cyber is something every integrator needs to become experts on not only for internal security but for their clients as well. Additionally, some integrators will be able to add cybersecurity as a service, which will also generate revenue.” Did you enjoy this article?

The Good The Samsung Galaxy Book has an excellent screen, strong performance and long battery life. For a 12-inch tablet, it's compact. A keyboard cover and stylus are both included. The Bad It can get hot if multitasking for a long time. The keyboard case is wobbly if not sitting on a sturdy surface. The kickstand situation isn't as solid as the Surface's. The Bottom Line The Samsung Galaxy book beats the Surface on value by including a keyboard cover and stylus in the box, but the Surface's design is still much more refined. 8.3 Overall Design 9.0 Features 8.0 Performance 8.0 Battery 8.0 Review Sections Review Prices User Reviews CNET Mobile Tablets Samsung Galaxy Book (12-inch) The Samsung Galaxy Book rightfully belongs on the quickly growing list of impressive Microsoft Surface Pro contenders. It's a Windows 10 tablet with a stunning 12-inch Super AMOLED display, Intel's latest processors and detachable keyboard cover with stylus. It starts at $1,130 for the Wi-Fi-only version and $1,300 for the LTE model, sold via Verizon, which was the configuration we reviewed. Samsung offers a 10-inch variant that runs for $630, but this review is on the 12-inch model. Though it's seemingly more expensive than the latest Surface Pro's entry-level $799 starting price, that price doesn't include the $129-to-$169 keyboard cover or the $99 stylus pen. (Microsoft requires you to buy the must-have keyboard for the Surface line separately.) Samsung bundles the Galaxy Pro with a keyboard and stylus. Josh Miller/CNET The Galaxy Book makes no bones about its price tag -- it's expensive but still roughly comparable in price to the Surface Pro with keyboard and stylus. The bad news is that the Galaxy Book's design falls short of the Microsoft tablet. The Surface tablet and its accompanying keyboard's physical design are among the best. Its perfectly adjustable kickstand and slim magnetic keyboard cover are excellent. Samsung's large and floppy keyboard stand just doesn't stand a chance in comparison. If it wasn't placed on a completely flat surface, it bent easily, and using it on my lap required careful balancing, otherwise it would topple over. The S-Pen stylus also comes with the Galaxy Tab S3. Josh Miller/CNET Body like an Android Unlike other two-in-one Windows 10 tablets, the Galaxy Book's svelte dimensions make it look and feel more like an Android tablet than a Windows 10 PC. Removed from its cover, the Galaxy Book is slightly more svelte than the Surface Pro 4. It's 7.36mm thick and weighs 1.66 pounds (754 grams), versus 8.5mm and 1.69 pounds (766 grams) for the Surface Pro. Smooth, rounded edges help convey the visage of its seemingly slimmer facade. Rounded edges make it appear slimmer. Josh Miller/CNET While its chassis is more iPad-like than Surface-esque, it's still a big device. As a standalone tablet, it's too big and heavy to hold in your hands and watch a half-hour of "The Office," let alone an entire movie. The fanless tablet also got rather hot when used for a long period of time, making it uncomfortable to hold. It all makes the included keyboard case accessory, which doubles as a stand, an even more important addition. Accessories included One of the Samsung Galaxy Book's biggest advantages over the Surface Pro line is that it comes with a keyboard case and stylus. The keyboard case protects the screen without adding too much bulk. Josh Miller/CNET The tablet magnetically docks into the folio case, and the back flap can fold back into a stand. There are few different configurations, but thanks to the awesome screen quality, viewing angles are great no matter how it's set up.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides iPhone 8 Samsung Galaxy S8 HTC U11 Project Scorpio Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Hands on: Huawei MateBook X review A better MacBook Pro for Windows Ultrabook fans Not yet rated By Gabe Carey Laptops & portable PCs  Shares What is a hands on review? Our Early Verdict If the latest MacBook Pro disappointed you, the MateBook X delivers with a fingerprint scanner, function keys and a keyboard with better travel. Priced right, it could be a force to be reckoned with. For Full-size Core “i” processors Thin bezels Roomy keyboard Included USB-C adapters Against Copycat concept Unexceptional Dolby Atmos sound No Rose Gold in US/UK Sleek and stylish, Huawei’s first non-touch Ultrabook is replete with a handful of record-breaking characteristics. For starters, it’s the smallest 13-inch laptop in the world measuring in at 28.6 x 21.1 x 1.25cm (11.26 x 8.31 x 0.49 inches; W x H x D) and packs the thinnest bezel, too, at 0.17 inches (4.4 mm).  Even with a full-size chiclet keyboard, the MateBook X keeps its weight low and its profile even lower at 2.31 pounds (1.05kg), making it considerably lighter than the 3.02-pound (1.37kg) MacBook Pro.  Design Still, it’s hard not to be skeptical of Huawei’s admittedly derivative pursuits. While their aspect ratios differ, MateBook X looks all too much like the 12-inch MacBook with Retina Display. Likewise, the “Prestige Gold” and the even more blatantly “inspired” Space Gray color variants of its all-aluminum shell are eyeroll-inducing, if only because of how unimaginative the naming conventions are. Even so, you can’t fault Huawei for going after a market full of Windows users chomping at the bit for MacBook styled machine but dislike macOS.  Starting at €1,399 (about $1,570, £1,210, AU$2,090) with an i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD its also notably more affordable than the €1,699 ($1,499, £1,449, AU$2,199) MacBook Pro. For one, it has a full-size keyboard uninhibited by the low travel of the MacBook Pro’s butterfly keys. It’s comfortable and, despite the MateBook X’s size, somehow feels more spacious than some 15-inch laptop keyboards.  X gon’ give it to ya The MateBook X takes after Microsoft’s Surface devices and comes with an 3:2 display. Sadly, it isn’t the highest resolution panel around and with only 2,160 x 1,440 pixels across the screen, it’s just a step behind the MacBook Pro’s 2,560 x 1,600 Retina Display as well as the Surface Laptop’s 2,256 x 1,504 PixelSense Display. It also takes advantage of the U-series Intel Core i5-7200U and Core i7-7500U processors depending on your configuration. Not only are these chips a step up from the Skylake processors you’ll find in the MacBook Pro, Huawei has implemented a fanless cooling system using an Microencapsulated Phase Change Materials.  If that sounds like some space age tech, that’s because it’s actually used into the aerospace field to absorb heat without the hassle of fan noise or having to worry about dust building up. It sounds like a novel system, but we’ll have to see how well it really works in our full review. As part of Intel’s more energy efficient CPU line, Huawei claims a 9-hour battery life for the MateBook X. That is, of course, the amount of time it would take for the Huawei MateBook X’s battery to deplete entirely from full health while playing 1080p video on continuous loop.  If a battery life of 10 hours is more than a declaration, Huawei could have a success on its hands, easily besting the its Matebook released last year. Then there are the ports which, to be fair, don’t differ drastically from a lower-tier MacBook Pro. The Huawei MateBook X is similarly equipped with two USB Type-C ports (one of which is used for charging) and a headphone jack. The main difference is that Apple expects you to pay $69 (£69, AU$109) for its AV multiport adapter. Meanwhile, the comparable MateDock 2.0 is bundled in with the MateBook X in addition to a USB-C to USB-A cable. The former gives you access to HDMI, VGA and USB Type-C for power, which can all be used simultaneously through a single cable. Speaking of power, the MateBook X even comes with a smart charger, able to dynamically change its voltage depending on the device it’s connected to, suiting it just as well for your MateBook as for your smartphone or Nintendo Switch. One of the coolest aspects of the Huawei MateBook X, however, lies in the onboard fingerprint scanner-power button combo. Unlike other fingerprint scanners out there, the MateBook X’s can tell who is using the computer, automatically booting up the device and logging into each user’s respective account with one simple touch.  Contrarily, in our hands-on demo with the MateBook X, Huawei was dead set on showing off the Dolby Atmos sound system, which in all honesty sounded okay at best. In an intro snippet we saw of Mad Max: Fury Road playing on the MateBook X, it was clear that Huawei wanted to prove that Dolby’s involvement in engineering the audio hardware was worthwhile.  The result was a middling series of sound effects and music that desperately wanted to emulate a cinema-quality surround sound experience. That’s not to say the sound on the MateBook X is insufferable, but bearing the Dolby Atmos name, it does leave something to be desired. It has range, but alas, audio from the laptop isn't particularly loud or crisp enough to justify it as a central selling point for the MateBook X. Lastly, the storage and memory options are pretty run-of-the-mill. As for storage, you can opt for either 256GB or 512GB of storage. That comes short of the MacBook Pro’s 1TB max of SSD storage, but we don’t suspect anyone will bat an eye with the money they’re sure to save. The 4GB and 8GB RAM options seem pretty light too, but you shouldn’t have any qualms if you go for the latter.  Early verdict The Huawei MateBook X is like the new kid in school who jacks your style then somehow manages to pull it off better than you did. From the full-size punchy keyboard to the fairly sizeable wide-angle trackpad, the MateBook X takes everything we love about the 13-inch MacBook Pro and soups it up to make it even more compelling.  For Touch Bar skeptics, there’s a fingerprint scanner built into the power button, negating the need to buy an OLED strip add-on just for the added security protocol. And for everyone else, there’s a ton of promise here.  This machine is nearly as lightweight and silent, but with full-size 7th-generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors instead of the performance-deficient Core M CPUs worn by the MacBook or the last generation CPUs in the MacBook Pro.  Plus, Huawei doesn’t kid itself. Although it’s a trend we’ve seen before from the likes of HP and Acer, any laptop that uses USB-C ports exclusively should come with the necessary adapters for USB-A, HDMI and the lot. We applaud the company for its bundling practices, though it was admittedly disappointing to hear that the Rose Gold-coated MateBook X is exclusive to Saudi Arabia. With a significantly lower price, the MateBook X could really overshadow the MacBook.  What is a hands on review? 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

Anna Irrera NEW YORK — Reuters Published Tuesday, May 23, 2017 8:57AM EDT Last updated Tuesday, May 23, 2017 8:57AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Financial and technology companies led by Bank of America Corp, SBI Holdings Inc , HSBC Holdings Plc, Intel Corp and Temasek Holdings have invested $107-million in R3 CEV, a startup which runs a big bank consortium seeking to develop blockchain technology, it said on Tuesday. Over 40 institutions from more than 15 countries participated in the first two tranches of the New York company’s fundraising round, making it one of the largest investments in a blockchain company to date, R3 said in a statement. The third and final tranche will open later this year. Other major investors and companies leading the deal include ING Groep NV, Banco Bradesco SA, Itaú Unibanco SA, Natixis SA, Barclays Plc , UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo & Co, R3 said. R3 launched in September 2015 with the backing of nine of the world’s largest investment banks seeking to make their operations more efficient with new technology, and its membership has rapidly grown to about 80 financial institutions. It aims to raise $150-million from members and strategic investors, and give them a 60 per cent stake. An R3 spokesman declined to disclose the company’s valuation. Blockchain, best known as the system underpinning digital currency bitcoin, is a public online ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet. Financial firms hope that the nascent technology can reduce the cost and complexity of burdensome processes such as international payments and securities settlement. The completion of the first two tranches follows the departure of several large banks from R3 over the past few months, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc Banco Santander SA and Morgan Stanley The banks have internal blockchain projects or investments in other similar startups. State Street Corp has also left the group, the R3 spokesman added. “This year we will have pilot projects and early production phase products in the market,” R3 Chief Executive David Rutter said in an interview. But “we are a couple of years away until we see massively impactful products,” he added. Skeptics have warned that it might take many years for the financial industry to reap significant benefits from blockchain. “Distributed ledger technology is well suited for some uses case but it will not be the answer for everything,” Kaushalya Somasundaram, head of fintech partnerships and strategy at HSBC, said in an interview.

On the sidelines of Windows 10 China Government Edition release, Microsoft also announced a new Surface two-in-one laptop. The latest addition to company's hybrid computing line up, the "new Surface Pro" sports an improved design, and houses a newer processor from Intel. From an article: The new Surface Pro features the same 3:2 12.3-inch PixelSense display as its predecessor, providing a resolution of 2736 x 1824 (267 ppi) and 10 point multi-touch capabilities. Surface Pro is based on faster and more reliable Intel "Kaby Lake" chipsets in Core m3-7Y30 with HD Graphics 615, Core i5-7300U with HD Graphics 620, and Core i7-7660U with Iris Plus Graphics 640 variants, which should make for a better experience. As with the previous version, the Core m3 version of the new Surface Pro is fanless and thus silent. But this is new: The Core i5 versions of the new Surface Pro are also fanless and silent. And a new thermal design helps Microsoft claim that the i7 versions are quieter than ever, too. The new Surface Pro is rated at 13.5 hours of battery life (for video playback), compared to just 9 hours for Surface Pro 4. That's a 50 percent improvement. urface Pro can be had with 4, 8, or 16 GB of 1866Mhz LPDDR3 RAM. The new Surface Pro is built around the USB 3-based Surface Connect connector and features one full-sized USB 3 port and one miniDisplayPort port. Microsoft also announced a new Surface Pen (sold separately), and claims that the new pen is twice as accurate (compared to the previous version). No word on the pricing but it will be available in all major global markets in the "coming weeks." The new Surface ships with Windows 10 Pro. (Side note: Earlier Microsoft used to market the Surface Pro devices as tablets that could also serve as laptops. The company is now calling the Surface Pro laptops that are also tablets.) hardware surface windows ← Related Links → Microsoft Announces 'Windows 10 China Government Edition', Lets Country Use Its Own Encryption Microsoft Announces 'Windows 10 China Government Edition', Lets Country Use Its Own Encryption Chinese Giant Huawei Gets Serious About PC Business, Announces Plans For Global Expansion Google's AlphaGo AI Defeats the World's Best Human Go Player Microsoft's New Surface Pro Features Faster Intel Kaby Lake Processor, 13.5 Hours of Battery Life More | Reply Login Microsoft's New Surface Pro Features Faster Intel Kaby Lake Processor, 13.5 Hours of Battery Life Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

Sadly, it's simply a Surface Pro 3 v3 (and the Surface Pro 4 was the v2). Talking about this, scapping the numbering is dumb and now I will have a lot of trouble to find support for my "old" Surface Pro (the first). Well, not as dumb that Surface Pro One at least. Better battery and CPU/GPU are to be expected, nothing amazing there. New LTE support (only for latter model) are interesting, but data over LTE cost a little too much here to be useful (I something create a Wifi with my cellphone and and, after a quick web browsing while drinking my coffee, I had over 50mb used because of the habits of MS and it's program to automatically use the internet for anything. Not including the pen anymore is a bad decision imho because it's the killer feature this product. If you're not using the pen, then buying this over another Ultrabook with similar spect at almost half the price doesn't make much sense. Also, the pen is too easy to lose (it took me about a year to lose mine) so I do think that MS should find a way to "dock" the pen on the tablet more firmly. The magnet that I saw on the Surface Pro 4 isn't enough. Oh yeah, and since the pen is quite pricey (50$-60$) + the keyboard at 130$, it's also a subtle way to make the Surface Pro a little more expensive that the labeled 799$. In reality, the real cost of the most basic Surface Pro (new) is really 1000$. Still only one USB 3 port. MS seriously need to step down and add USB-C to their Surface product. Since it's pretty clear that the USB-C will become the new standard, I don't want my brand new Surface Pro to be obsolete in 2-3 years. The i5 version is now fanless....well I don't particularly care about this and I usually prefer a laptop that blow hot air instead of a laptop that become hot itself. Kudos to MS for calling them "Laptop" now. Compared to "real" tablet, the Surface Pro is doing a very bad job for, well, "tablet" uses. Hardware is good, but the Apps availability difference is just too big. So, yeah, an "ok" upgrade but I'll kept my Surface Pro (the first) for now.

I regularly fly through SEA, native habitat of the traveling microsoftie, where one can observe both variations of the species -- salesdroids and geeks -- going through all sorts of contortions to compensate for the flaccid member protruding from the front of the surface. In the boarding area you can see the surface balanced on one thigh with front edge of keyboard pressed against bellybutton while the kickstand still sloooooowly slides back over the knee. On the plane, you can see the kickstand retracted or dangling in empty air as the tablet leans against the seat in front, while the softie hugs the keyboard ever closer. On Alaska Air's first class side-mounted tables, the whole thing collapses front and back, unless the silverback of the softie species places it atop a firm leather pad cover from a recent Ignite or TechEd, turned at an angle for a little extra space. Only in the comfort of its home conference room or spacious ergonomic standing desk can the Surface both recline its torso and flop out its full flaccid glory to be appreciated for... the normal functionality of other laptops. In all seriousness, the surface line is a nice showpiece, but the OS makes it a mediocre tablet, and the floppy+kickstand mess makes it a profoundly handicapped laptop that takes up more room front-to-back than a typical 17in laptop. And they don't seem to be promoting the version that does have a good hinge system. FFS, it doesn't matter how much battery life the damn thing has if the ergonomics are so infuriating that I'd rather use a chromebook -- which iirc still connects to gogo internet for free.

The project received a considerable amount of attention when it was announced and went on to raise over half a million dollars through its Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. The first production units started shipping out to the nearly 3,000 backers in November 2016, and today is the first day the GNARBOX is available to the general public. We got our hands on a pre-release unit of the GNARBOX to put it through its paces and see whether it’s a worthy companion for traveling photographers. The GNARBOX is about the size of a standard cell phone in your hand, except it’s more than twice as thick. Found inside its thick plastic shell, which feels slightly rubbery, are 128GB of solid state storage, 4GB of RAM, an Intel Quad Core 1.92GHz CPU, a dedicated Intel 4 Core HD Graphics GPU, and a battery that lasts 7 hours. Once you take the GNARBOX unit out of its cardboard packaging — the simple setup instructions are found inside the cover — you’ll need to first charge the unit for a while using the MicroUSB 3.0 port, which is found on the side of the device under a door along with a USB 2.0 port and a USB 3.0 port. (As a minor note: this door is extremely difficult to pry open on our unit.) A second door hides two memory card slots: a SD one and a MicroSD one. If you’d like to connect a CompactFlash card, you’ll need to bring along a separate card reader and plug it in via USB. (This door didn’t require the sacrifice of a thumbnail to open.) The Quick Reference guide that comes in the box doesn’t tell you much beyond the few basic introductory steps. You’ll need to read the online user guide for a more complete understanding of how to use the device. After powering the GNARBOX on, you’ll find a new Wi-Fi network being beamed from it called “MyGNARBOX.” Join this network with your phone and enter the password found inside the box (e.g. “gnarbox!”). Once connected, download and open up the GNARBOX app to get started. For now, GNARBOX is designed for dedicated cameras — things like DSLRs and GoPros and drones. The process of transferring data to GNARBOX revolves around the memory card slots and USB ports, so you can’t easily beam your iPhone photos to it… yet (the ability to grab photos from your phone may be coming in the next update). When you plug a memory card or device into GNARBOX, you’ll see it immediately appear in the Connected Devices page of the app. Tapping the new entry brings up a gallery view of all your photos and videos on the device. Thumbnails are displayed even for RAW files. You can select some or all of the photos, and then press “Copy Files” to have them backed up onto GNARBOX. Despite having quad-core processors and a dedicated GPU, working with RAW files does come with some lag time. Thumbnails take a little while to fully generate, and a full screen preview takes a few moments to go from pixelated to sharp. Once previews are generated, though, working with the files is a breeze. The photo editing screen features a number of adjustments you can make to JPEG or RAW photos: Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Punch, Whitepoint, Midpoint, Blackpoint, Saturation, Temperature, Tint, Intensity, and Crop. Tapping the photo lets you compare your in-progress edit with the original, and there’s an option for undoing your changes as well. The video editing screen allows you to Trim, export frames, and add clips to a Highlight Reel — all while working with 4K files. While these tools won’t replace more powerful editing apps out there, they’re definitely an easy way to spruce up your content a little for simple sharing while you’re on the go. And since everything is done within the GNARBOX app, you don’t need to worry about moving files from device to device and app to app for editing and sharing. If you’re a photographer who’s looking for a single solution for backing up your photos, editing them, and sharing them while you’re traveling, GNARBOX is worth looking into. You’ll be able to easily back up your camera’s photos, do some simple post-processing, and share them with the world using only your phone and leaving your laptop out of the equation. Also, once a future update opens up the system to your phone’s photos, it’ll also serve as a quick way to free up space on your phone during long trips if you’re constantly low on storage. GNARBOX is now available for $299 from B&H, Adorama, and Amazon. Full disclosure: GNARBOX provided the pre-release unit tested for the purpose of this review.

Anna Irrera R3 launched in September 2015 with the backing of nine of the world’s largest investment banks. Photo: Bloomberg New York: Financial and technology companies led by Bank of America Corp, SBI Holdings Inc , HSBC Holdings Plc, Intel Corp and Temasek Holdings have invested $107 million in R3 CEV, a startup which runs a big bank consortium seeking to develop blockchain technology, it said on Tuesday. Over 40 institutions from more than 15 countries participated in the first two tranches of the New York company’s fundraising round, making it one of the largest investments in a blockchain company to date, R3 said in a statement. The third and final tranche will open later this year. Other major investors and companies leading the deal include ING Groep NV, Banco Bradesco SA, Itaú Unibanco SA, Natixis SA, Barclays Plc , UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo & Co, R3 said. R3 launched in September 2015 with the backing of nine of the world’s largest investment banks seeking to make their operations more efficient with new technology, and its membership has rapidly grown to about 80 financial institutions. It aims to raise $150 million from members and strategic investors, and give them a 60% stake. An R3 spokesman declined to disclose the company’s valuation. Blockchain, best known as the system underpinning digital currency bitcoin, is a public online ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet. Financial firms hope that the nascent technology can reduce the cost and complexity of burdensome processes such as international payments and securities settlement. The completion of the first two tranches follows the departure of several large banks from R3 over the past few months, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Banco Santander SA and Morgan Stanley. The banks have internal blockchain projects or investments in other similar startups. State Street Corp has also left the group, the R3 spokesman added. “This year we will have pilot projects and early production phase products in the market,” R3 chief executive David Rutter said in an interview. “But we are a couple of years away until we see massively impactful products,” he added. Skeptics have warned that it might take many years for the financial industry to reap significant benefits from blockchain. “Distributed ledger technology is well suited for some uses case but it will not be the answer for everything,” Kaushalya Somasundaram, head of fintech partnerships and strategy at HSBC, said in an interview.

Speaking at an annual conference co-hosted by the American Turkish Council (ATC) and Turkey-U.S. Business Council (TAIK), Ekim Alptekin criticized the U.S. for allying with the Kurdish rebel group YPG in the fight against ISIS in Syria. He also called on the U.S. to “stop tolerating” Fethullah Gulen, the Turkish Muslim cleric living in exile in Pennsylvania. Turkey considers both YPG and Gulen’s network of followers to be terrorist organizations. The U.S. has supplied some small arms to YPG, which American forces consider to be one of the most efficient groups fighting ISIS. (RELATED: Trump Hotel To Host Conference For Michael Flynn’s Lobbying Client) Gulen has been living in the U.S. as a legal permanent resident since 1999, much to the chagrin of Turkey’s president and former Gulen ally, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “If the United States is sincere then it needs to stop tolerating Fethullah Gulen’s presence in the United States. It needs to stop accepting it, stop excusing it, and stop ignoring it,” Alptekin seethed in his speech, which he gave as chairman of TAIK. Ekim Alptekin (Youtube screen grab) “Today, the United States has chosen the YPG, a Marxist terrorist group, over a NATO ally to help defend the very values the YPG opposes,” he also said. Alptekin addressed the elephant in the room in his remarks: his controversial association with Flynn and his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group. Alptekin and Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, signed a $600,000 contract in August that called for Flynn Intel Group to research and investigate Gulen to help aid the Turkish government’s effort to gain his extradition. (RELATED: As Foreign Agent For Turkey, Flynn Agreed To Form ‘Investigative Lab,’ Make ‘Criminal Referrals’) In the contract, Flynn agreed to use an “investigative laboratory” consisting of former FBI agents to potentially make criminal referrals against Gulen. The relationship, which was first reported by The Daily Caller on Nov. 11 after Flynn wrote an anti-Gulen op-ed in The Hill, is the subject of federal grand jury subpoenas for Flynn and Alptekin, according to The New York Times. Flynn retroactively disclosed details of the contract in a March 7 filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The retired lieutenant general disclosed that Alptekin arranged a Sept. 19 meeting with two Turkish government officials. Flynn was advising the Trump campaign at that time. Alptekin, a former U.S. congressional staffer, said that his goal in hiring Flynn “was to commission independent research and to establish objective facts” regarding Gulen in order to help the Turkish-American business relationship. Fethullah Gulen is pictured at his residence in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania September 26, 2013. REUTERS “One of these problems is religious extremism. And Fethullah Gulen and his followers represent one of the most dangerous forms that it takes,” Alptekin asserted.

While the Turkish government has accused Gulen of engaging in terrorism, including masterminding a failed coup attempt last July, the U.S. government appears to not have accepted that assessment. Alptekin has made numerous conflicting claims to reporters about his contract with Flynn. He’s downplayed how much he paid Flynn and has also claimed that he hired Flynn on behalf of an Israeli oil company. That firm has told an Israeli news outlet that it did not commission any lobbying work through Alptekin. Alptekin’s admonition of the U.S. government was not matched with a similar scolding of Turkish government policy by his counterpart on the American Turkish Council, retired Gen. James Jones. Jones, the chairman of ATC and President Obama’s first national security adviser, offered no critique of the Turkish government, though there is certainly much to scrutinize. Instead, he meekly thanked Alptekin for his “thought provoking remarks,” which, he told the conference attendees, “we all should pay a great deal of attention to.” Jones, a Democrat, ignored an incident from last week in which bodyguards working for Erdogan attacked a group of peaceful protesters outside of the Turkish embassy in Washington, D.C. Video emerged appearing to show Erdogan ordering his thugs to attack the protesters. Dozens of Erdogan supporters and bodyguards were seen descending upon the protesters as Erdogan watched calmly from his Mercedes-Benz. Jones also made no mention of Erdogan’s increasingly authoritarian policies at home. The Islamist leader has arrested tens of thousands of political opponents. And last month he grabbed more executive power through a referendum that has been flagged by international watchdogs for widespread voting irregularities.

The panel will get two cracks at Brennan -- the first in public at 10 a.m. ET and the second behind closed doors -- almost two months after his first appearance was dramatically canceled amid the chaos sparked by House intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes' clandestine White House trip. House investigators are particularly interested in finding out more about how Russia conducted its election attacks inside the U.S. and who Russian spies attempted to recruit to their side, said a House intelligence committee source. Intelligence sources have previously told CNN that Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page was being cultivated as a source for a Russian spy -- whether he knew it or not. Page has flatly and continually denied that charge. But Brennan's isn't the only high-profile hearing Tuesday. The latest news most likely to hold the Capitol captive is word that Trump asked his own intelligence chiefs -- Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers -- to rebut Comey's then-public statement that the FBI had opened a criminal probe into Russia's meddling in July of last year. Coats and Rogers are both scheduled to testify, respectively, before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees on budget issues, but the blockbuster news of Trump's attempt to curtail a federal probe, first reported by The Washington Post, will likely come up. Meanwhile, Brennan is also likely to face questions about a split among intelligence leaders last summer over the purpose of Russia's meddling in the US election -- whether it was designed to support Trump or merely spur chaos and confusion in the election. Brennan told senior lawmakers as early as last summer that the Russian operation was squarely designed to support Trump. Brennan's appearance comes as the Russia probes have escalated greatly since Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey and subsequently the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Trump and Russia. On Monday, Mark Warner, the ranking Democratic member of the Senate intelligence committee left open the threat of holding former national security adviser Michael Flynn in contempt if he continues to withhold documents in response to a congressional subpoena.

By John Seiler Former Editorial Writer at the Orange County Register Tuesday, May 23rd, 2017 In politics, it’s better to be lucky than good. That sure fits Jerry Brown. Taking office in 1975, he proclaimed an “era of limits,” cutting investments in roads, dams and other infrastructure. Californians weren’t listening, as the population since then doubled, to 40 million. Yet despite the bumpy roads and droughts (from lack of reservoirs), this also happened: in 1974, Intel released its 8080 microprocessor, sparking the microcomputer revolution. On March 5, 1975, two months after Brown became governor, Steve Wozniak attended the first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club. In 1976, Woz designed the Apple I, the first of the legendary company’s products. The computer revolution accelerated from there, then was boosted into orbit by the Internet revolution of the 1990s and since, bringing to some areas of the state wealth beyond the dreams of avarice. Coming back into office in 2011, Brown is credited with a “California miracle,” but really is riding the national economic recovery. Once again, lucky. But what happens after Brown? It’s the two things listed above that now are mangling the state. First, the “era of limits” mania, which includes tight restrictions on constructing housing, in particular the California Coastal Commission. Although first imposed by voters in 1972, who had no idea they were freezing their grandchildren out of decent housing, the CCC was made permanent in 1976 with Brown’s signature on the California Coastal Act. Second, the high-tech boom that distorts everything. The Silicon Barons have become the most powerful power brokers in the state. But unlike previous Captains of Industry, who generally were conservative, the Silicon Barons were marinated in the campus radicalism that began in the 1960s. The immense wealth of Silicon Valley and San Francisco also has driven up housing costs so high in the Bay Area that median home prices are well over $1 million. The rest of Coastal California, which also sports many high-tech companies, is only marginally better. So, what’s next? After Brown signs the 2017-18 state budget on June 15, his power quickly will evanesce. He will craft one more budget, for fiscal 2018-19, but as he does so next year, the election for his replacement will be upon us. The primary election will be June 5, 2018. And his successor, beginning January 2019, will preside over spending the last half of the budget. Republicans are going to have a hard time no matter what. They might even end up with no candidate surviving the Top Two primary, as happened with last year’s U.S. Senate race between Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez, both Democrats. But even if a Republican makes the final cut, he or she will be running in the continuing economic prosperity – which, although continued by the Trump Boom, will be credited to Brown and the Democratic Legislature. As JFK said, “Life isn’t fair.” Republicans’ only future chance for the governorship, or any other state office, is if the economy tanks during a statewide election. That’s how Schwarzenegger snuck in back in 2003, amid massive state deficits (and the now ridiculous recall). Yet the ongoing demographic shifts probably preclude a Republican winner even should Great Depression Two hit. Which brings us to the Democrats. The Los Angeles Times ran a pretty good portrait of the front runner, “Trump presidency eases Gavin Newsom’s path in his second run for California governor.” It wrote, “Newsom, 49, has deftly used his office as a platform to call for tighter gun control, legalized marijuana, a ban on new offshore oil drilling and rollbacks of university tuition hikes. Next up: universal healthcare. “His agenda carries broad appeal in a Democratic state that has been drifting leftward for more than two decades. With much of California seething over President Trump, the climate could hardly be better for the unabashed liberal politics of a former San Francisco mayor still best known for his trailblazing 2004 decree legalizing same-sex marriage.” But a couple of troubling things come out. He spoke before       Bay Area plumbers and steamfitters and asked, “You want resistance to Donald Trump? Boy, bring it on, Donald.” Plumbers and steamfitters are among the few private-sector, working-class Democrats left in the state. Which means they’re really more akin to the Democrats who put Trump over Hillary in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the first GOP victories in those states since 1988. Such folks are different from the dominant forces in today’s Democratic Party, especially in California: tech oligarchs, public-union bosses, government functionaries and university leftists. The Times again: “Newsom, who calls the widening gap between rich and poor ‘the biggest challenge of our time,’ is still fine-tuning his agenda. He said it would include wider access to prenatal care and preschool, expansion of an income-tax credit for the poor, bail reform and a universal healthcare plan modeled on the one he pioneered in San Francisco. “‘The work’s been done; the question is how we scale it,’ he said. “At the same time, Newsom promises fiscal restraint and economic growth.” So, vast new government spending, paid for inevitably with higher taxes, will lead to “fiscal restraint and economic growth”! And the new taxes would be on top of all the new taxes just imposed the past six months: on income, cigarettes, gas and plastic bags. As to “the work’s been done” on health care for all, San Francisco is an incredibly wealthy city, with an average household income of $104,879 and an average household net worth of $1,086,439. In Imperial County, average household income is just above half that, $55,493; and Average Household Worth is one third SF’s, $353,693. California’s poor counties just can’t afford what its rich counties can. And if the rich counties are forced to pay for everything, then that’s yet another tax burden pushing companies and jobs to lower-tax states. Newsom also is touting his acumen as a businessman – a kinder and gentler Donald Trump. But Newsom’s company runs high-end restaurants that can pass on higher taxes and the state’s ever-rising minimum wage to millionaire clients. That won’t work at McDonald’s, Taco Bell and Marie Callender’s, where the higher minimum wage will push up prices, drive away customers and kill jobs. Newsom seems to be ahead right now, but I would guess the more likely next governor is John Chiang, the treasurer and former controller. Although the budget system won’t be collapsing next year, in his May Revise press conference, even Brown acknowledged the fiscal cracks and sprains are starting to tell. Voters, including Democrats, I think, will seek someone with a reputation for fiscal common sense, instead of Newsom’s flights of psychedelic fancy derived from 50thanniversary parties of Haight-Ashbury’s 1967 Summer of Love.

 Microsoft just introduced a new $800 MacBook Air competitor with 13.5 hours of battery life Matt Weinberger May 23, 2017, 8:15 AM 26,291 facebook linkedin twitter email print The new Surface Pro. It looks a lot like the older model.Matt Weinberger/Business Insider Microsoft has taken the wraps off the new Surface Pro, a long-awaited upgrade to 2015's well-received Surface Pro 4 tablet/laptop hybrid. It's the company's Windows 10-powered rival to the Apple MacBook Air. This new Surface Pro — Microsoft has officially ditched the numbering of new models — is available for preorder today starting at $799, ahead of its official release on June 15. That's the same day the new Surface Laptop goes on sale, too. While the Surface Pro's specs have been upgraded across the board, including the newest 7th-generation Intel processors, the biggest single upgrade is the battery life. Microsoft claims the new Surface Pro can get 13.5 hours of battery life on a single charge, depending how you use it. By Microsoft's calculations, that's 50% more than the Surface Pro 4. Furthermore, for an upcharge, you'll be able to buy a version of the new Surface Pro with LTE cellular wireless connectivity — a first for any model of Surface Pro.  Otherwise, the look and feel of the new Surface Pro is pretty much the same as the previous model, apart from a few tweaks, as you can see in the photos. It's a little thinner and lighter, at 8.5 millimeters of thickness and weight starting at 1.69 pounds, with a 12.3-inch screen. The new Surface Pro sports a kickstand that can go very low —15 degrees low, to be exact.Matt Weinberger/Business Insider The biggest change on the design front is some changes to the venting around the edges: With the exception of the Surface Pro models powered by Intel's i7 chips, all other models will ship without a computer fan to keep the devices cool, making them run more quietly. Also, the kickstand hinge on the back can now go all the way down to about 15 degrees, ideal for sketching and note-taking, kind of like how Microsoft's Surface Studio desktop PC dips down. So here's the catch... Like previous iterations of the Surface Pro, the $799 starting price comes with some caveats: You'll need to buy the Type Cover keyboard, sold separately starting at $130, to make it into a full laptop. And unlike previous Surface devices, it won't come with the Surface Pen stylus. That's another $99, if you want to use the device to sketch.   But both accessories have gotten an upgrade: Microsoft promises that the new keyboard is better and more responsive than ever, while the Surface Pen is more pressure-sensitive, and lets you put it flat on its side to shade like a pencil. Microsoft is making both accessories available in a set of new and complementary colors. The new colors of Surface Pro Signature Type Cover. These high-end models are covered in alcantara fabric and go for $159 a pop — but they turn the Surface Pro into a proper laptop.Matt Weinberger/Business Insider The good news is that if you're an existing Surface Pro 4 owner, your existing Type Cover and Surface Pen will work with the new Surface Pro with no problems. On a final note, and despite a reliance on those accessories, Microsoft is actually moving away from the Surface's long-time marketing tagline, "the tablet that can replace your laptop." Instead, the new Surface Pro is being marketed as "the most versatile laptop on the planet," signaling a move away from labeling it a "tablet" at all. Get the latest Microsoft stock price here.

Over 40 institutions from more than 15 countries participated in the first two tranches of the New York company's fundraising round, making it one of the largest investments in a blockchain company to date, R3 said in a statement. The third and final tranche will open later this year. Other major investors and companies leading the deal include ING Groep NV (INGA.AS), Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4.SA), Itaú Unibanco SA (ITUB4.SA), Natixis SA (CNAT.PA), Barclays Plc (BARC.L), UBS Group AG (UBSG.S) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), R3 said. R3 launched in September 2015 with the backing of nine of the world's largest investment banks seeking to make their operations more efficient with new technology, and its membership has rapidly grown to about 80 financial institutions. It aims to raise $150 million from members and strategic investors, and give them a 60 percent stake. An R3 spokesman declined to disclose the company's valuation. Blockchain, best known as the system underpinning digital currency bitcoin, is a public online ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet. Financial firms hope that the nascent technology can reduce the cost and complexity of burdensome processes such as international payments and securities settlement. The completion of the first two tranches follows the departure of several large banks from R3 over the past few months, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Banco Santander SA (SAN.MC) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) The banks have internal blockchain projects or investments in other similar startups. State Street Corp (STT.N) has also left the group, the R3 spokesman added. "This year we will have pilot projects and early production phase products in the market," R3 Chief Executive David Rutter said in an interview. But "we are a couple of years away until we see massively impactful products," he added. Skeptics have warned that it might take many years for the financial industry to reap significant benefits from blockchain. "Distributed ledger technology is well suited for some uses case but it will not be the answer for everything," Kaushalya Somasundaram, head of fintech partnerships and strategy at HSBC, said in an interview.

The MateBook X is a 13-inch ultraportable clamshell with a focus on style, thin bezels, and packing enough hardware underneath to go deep into the market. The MateBook E is the second generation 2-in-1, following on from the MateBook launched in 2016, with improvements all round, such as an adjustable hinge, a spill-proof keyboard, and bundled accessories. The third element is the MateBook D, a 15.6-inch clamshell aimed squarely at the student and business markets, featuring dual storage options and a discrete NVIDIA GPU but also going with the narrow bezel design similar to the MateBook X. Primarily seen as a smartphone company for most of us, last year we saw the launch of the MateBook: a 12-inch 2-in-1 device with Huawei’s design ID in a thin and light form factor, but crucially a mark into the PC space. At the time, it was exciting to see a new entrant, especially one with the potential clout of Huawei: if you sell 106m+ smartphones a year, then putting some resources into a mobile PC should be something really interesting to watch. The 2016 MateBook was a good start – the visual aspect of the unit fit in neatly with the market, although there were a few hiccups for a first-generation product, such as the limited stand options, the tendency for the magnetic cover to put the device to sleep when in tablet mode, and the fact that the peak configurations were over $2000. Feedback was sought, about how Huawei should improve the products and how it should tackle this market better, and here are the results. This news covers the two laptops: the MateBook X and the MateBook D. MateBook X: The Premium Clamshell A common feature for technology journalists in this space, especially when discussing products with Chinese companies, is how the discussion usually comes to Apple’s success in the laptop market. They are in awe of the design, the utility, and the avid fanboyism that follows their products. As a result, some of the Chinese companies aim to compete in the same space – having a small slice of a large pie is still a large amount, even if it is a carrot cake. So when a user spots the MateBook X, thoughts instantly turn to if it is a Macbook Air/Macbook clone. Not quite, but it arguably looks like a premium competitor for users who want the Macbook form factor but in a Windows/PC environment. The start of it is the aluminium clamshell, tapering to an almost point, with both the screen and the keyboard designed to try and take as much space as possible. One of the things Huawei wanted to emulate here is the thin bezel strategy, similar to the Dell XPS range, and coming in at 88% screen-to-body ratio is rather nice. There’s still a camera at the top, negating one of the issues with the XPS where the camera is pointing at your chin. The display is a 2160x1440 IPS panel (manufacturer not specified), with a 3:2 aspect ratio, wide viewing angles, and rated up to 1000:1 and 350 nits. Huawei also adds in 100% sRGB for good measure. Huawei Matebook X Size 13-inch Display 2160 x 1440 IPS 178-degree viewing angles 100% sRGB 1000:1 Contrast Ratio 350 nits CPUs Intel Core i5-7200U Intel Core i7-7500U (likely in cTDP Down mode) GPU Intel HD Graphics 620 DRAM 4 GB LPDDR3 8 GB LPDDR3 Storage 256 GB PCIe 512 GB PCIe Dimensions 286 x 211 x 12.5 mm 1.05 kg (2.31 lbs) Connectivity 802.11ac with 2x2 MIMO (Intel AC 8165?) with BT4.1 Battery 41.4 Wh (5449 mAh at 7.6 V) Additional Features Two USB 3.0 Type-C Ports 3.5mm audio jack Dolby Atmos Sound System MateDock 2 Included 1MP Front Camera Colors Space Gray Prestige Gold Rose Gold Pricing Core i5 + 8 GB LPDDR3 + 256GB SSD: 1399 Euro Core i5 + 8 GB LPDDR3 + 512GB SSD: 1599 Euro Core i7 + 8 GB LPDDR3 + 512GB SSD: 1699 Euro The heart of the MateBook X is Intel’s latest Kaby-Lake based 7th Generation CPUs, and Huawei likes to point out that while their competitors fit in the Kaby Lake-Y based processors (running at 4.5W), here Huawei is using the U based processors: the i7-7500U and i5-7200U. Technically these CPUs come out of the factory as 15W parts, but OEMs can configure the base clock in cTDP down mode for 7.5W/9.5W, which is what we suspect Huawei is doing here (awaiting confirmation). Using a U processors means getting HD 620 graphics, rather than HD 615, which should make the unit better for light graphical work. Nonetheless, users might be able to feel a base performance uplift compared to the 4.5W parts. Storage comes via an integrated PCIe SSD, and depending on the configuration will either be 256GB or 512GB. We were unable to prize the details on who the supplier is for these drives, but we might get some hands-on time later to go through the system specifications on a demo unit. Memory is, unfortunately, a downside on the X: Huawei has decided to use LPDDR3 rather than DDR4, which means that the top spec unit hits 8GB (4GB also offered, we assume 2x2GB for dual channel) rather than 16GB which would make this device high up on a prosumer list. The debate about LPDDR3 and DDR4 at this level of device gets interesting – if one is in better supply than the other, power consumption (arguably DDR4 is much better, even though LPDDR3 has ‘low power’ in the name), power profiling, etc. It’s a discussion that I need to have with Huawei’s design teams, really – at 16GB it becomes an easy replacement for my Zenbook. Going around the device, Huawei has supplied two USB Type-C ports, one of which can be used as a charging port for the supplied 40W power adaptor but both can be used for data. We’re told that the ports are USB 3.0 (5 Gbps), and both will work with the new MateDock 2, which is this time being supplied with the device rather than being sold separately. The MateDock 2 is like the MateDock, except it exchanges the ethernet port for a HDMI and VGA ports (with two USB Type-A as well). Also on the clamshell is a fingerprint reader for login, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. For connectivity, the MateBook X has an 802.11ac solution capable of 2x2 MIMO (we assume it’s the Intel 8265) and BT4.1, although no modem for 4G. For the audio, Huawei is promoting Dolby Atmos certification, along with Huawei’s Sound System technology. As part of our briefing, Huawei stated that they’ve been in the audio business over 10 years, but only really as a software solution. The MateBook X brings together the hardware (a Realtek codec, probably the ALC892 which would be high end for a clamshell device, though disappointing if it’s the ALC662) and software for Atmos certification. This includes dual speakers with custom drivers, as well as a dual microphone setup. The battery is listed as 41.4 Wh, which is exactly the same as the Macbook, and Huawei rates this as good for 10 hours of local 1080p video playback at 50% screen brightness (imagine me asking ‘what about 100 nits?’ to a confused Huawei rep). Gallery: MateBook X Pricing and availability was announced at the press event, starting at $1399 for the i5/8GB/256GB model and $1699 for the 8GB/512GB model. Colors will be region dependent, but expect to see one or all of Space Gray, Prestige Gold and Rose Gold. MateBook D: The Edumacation Device Two of the more stable elements to the laptop space is the education sector and the office markets. These are usually reasonably decent products sold at low margins but in good volumes along with potential support packages. OEMs like ASUS, Lenovo and HP play in this space, so it is rather competitive. Huawei’s MateBook D is the first crack at taking on the established players, in a 15.6-inch narrow bezel design. A quick look at the MateBook D and you might be forgiven for thinking it isn’t a Huawei device. If you sit around Huawei devices all day, you always get a feeling of premium, and the MateBook D doesn’t necessarily give that because it’s built to a price point. That being said, a few minutes with the unit and it does actually feel quite polished from a design perspective, with the positive idiosyncrasies that as an editor I seem to notice on Huawei devices, such as the feel and the unified image. It’s bulkier than any previous Huawei device for sure, and Huawei uses that extra space for ports, fo the screen, for the touchpad, for the sound, and for battery. At 15.6-inches, the display comes in as a Full-HD 1920x1080 and uses an IPS panel for better viewing angles. Huawei lists the panel as supporting 250 nits, 800:1 contrast, and a rather low 45% NTSC support – that would be a strangely low color support for even a basic panel (perhaps someone on the spec sheet pressed the wrong number?). Like the MateBook X, the panel aims to take up as much room as possible, with an 83% screen-to-body ratio. Huawei Matebook D Size 15.6-inch Display 1920 x 1080 IPS 178-degree viewing angles 45% NTSC 800:1 Contrast Ratio 350 nits CPU Intel Core i5 Intel Core i7 (likely to be U-series) GPU Intel HD Graphics 620 or NVIDIA GeForce 940MX w/2GB GDDR5 (optional) DRAM 4 GB DDR4 8 GB DDR4 16GB DDR4 Storage (SSD/HDD) 500GB HDD or 128GB+500GB (no dGPU) 1TB HDD or 256GB SSD or 128GB+500GB or 128GB + 1TB 128GB+1TB Dimensions 358 x 239 x 16.9mm 1.90 kg (4.19 lbs) Connectivity 802.11ac with 2x2 MIMO (Intel AC 8165?) with BT4.1 Battery 43.3 Wh (3800 mAh at 11.4 V) Additional Features Two USB 3.0 Type-A Ports One USB 2.0 Type-A Port HDMI Port (full size) 3.5mm audio jack DC-In Dolby Atmos Sound System 1MP Front Camera Colors Space Gray Champagne Gold Aurora Blue Pricing Core i5 + 8GB + 1TB HDD + 940MX: 799 Euro Core i5 + 8GB + 128GB SSD + 1TB HDD + 940MX: 899 Euro Core i7 + 8GB + 128GB SSD + 1TB HDD + 940MX: 999 Euro Huawei isn’t stating exactly what processors are going to be in place here, except that they will be Kaby-Lake based 7th Gen processors. We suspect they will be the 15W Kaby Lake-U parts, especially given that they list the graphics as HD 620. The MateBook D will come in a variety of CPU/GPU combinations, with either integrated graphics on the CPU or with a discrete GPU: the NVIDIA GeForce 940MX. It’s worth noting that this GPU came out in 2014 and runs around 20-30W, depending on the memory configuration. We asked about DDR3 or GDDR5 for the GPU (as the latter has 2.5x more bandwidth), although they didn’t know off hand (we might get to probe later today on that). We asked why Huawei chose this over something with a better power profile, such as the NVIDIA 1030 or 1050, although the rep we were asking wasn’t entirely sure (likely a supply issue, and bad market timing). Nonetheless, the discrete GPU is optional on all models except for the very basic storage configuration. For storage and memory, Huawei is offering a variety of combinations. The chassis supports both a PCIe M.2 based SSD and a 2.5-inch HDD, and so there will be: 4GB of LPDDR3 with either 500GB HDD, or a 128GB SSD+500G HDD 8GB of LPDDR3 with either 1TB HDD, 256GB SSD, 128GB+500GB or 128GB+1TB 16GB of DDR4 with 128GB SSD + 1TB SSD I was told that the units are user upgradeable as well. Having the 940MX discrete GPU is an option on all configurations except the 4GB models. Connectivity comes via the same 802.11ac with 2x2 MIMO with BT4.1 as the MateBook X, along with the same specifications for audio: dual speakers, dual microphones, and Dolby Atmos Sound System support. For the ports on the side, there’s a DC-in jack (sorry, no USB-C for power here), two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, one USB 2.0 Type-A port, a full-sized HDMI port, and a 3.5mm jack. The battery is rated at 43.3Wh, which given the size of the device and the weight (4.2lbs, 1.9kg), seems quite low. Devices this size typically come with 50Wh+, so I’m wondering if that’s another typo on the specification sheet. Gallery: MateBook D For pricing and availability, they didn't list any non-940MX editions but the i5 with 8GB DRAM, 1TB HDD and the 940MX will be 799 Euro, up to 999 Euro fot the top SKU. Colors will be region dependent, but expect to see one or more of Space Gray, Champagne Gold and Aurora Blue. It looks nice in blue.

POST A COMMENT 9 Comments View All Comments IntelUser2000 - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link "arguably DDR4 is much better, even though LPDDR3 has ‘low power’ in the name" False. LPDDR3 has 1/7th the standby power of DDR3. DDR4 is a natural progression from DDR3, while LPDDR3 is a low power optimized variant. I doubt the load power figures are better either. They are both at 1.2V, but DDR4 clocks noticeably higher, negating whatever technological advancements DDR4 has to reduce load power and is likely even higher. Reply Ian Cutress - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link DDR4 supports per IC voltage, rather than injecting a single voltage at the first IC and hoping there's enough left for the last. So arguably each IC can be configured to an ideal voltage. I found that 1/7 figure you stated, but only in reference to LPDDR3 compared to DDR3, not LPDDR3 compared to DDR4. You can get lower clocked DDR4-1600, so saying it is higher clocked isn't an issue. I actually just picked up my MateBook X review unit. It's running 8GB of LPDDR3, and flicks between 1066 MT/s at 10-10-10 with 1866 MT/s at 14-17-17. So the nominal rating on the spec sheet should be 1866 MT/s Reply BrokenCrayons - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link The GeForce 940MX was launched in March 2016 according to this statement on NV's site: "1 - 1.0x = performance of HD4400. GeForce performance score based on relative game performance. Games selected based on popularity at time of GPU launch, March 2016." Source: http://www.geforce.com/hardware/notebook-gpus/gefo... While it is a refresh of the original mobile 940, it's not quite the 2014 era hardware this article makes it out to be and it's rated at 15-25W per notebookcheck.net https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-940MX... Reply Ian Cutress - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link Ah sorry, I meant the GPU architecture (Maxwell) was launched in 2014. I'd argue that putting that 15-25W into a higher class CPU with beefier graphics (28W Iris?) would have a better response perhaps. Is the demand for discrete GPUs that high that OpenCL on Iris can't provide? I sat next to a journalist at the launch with a Surface Book, and she said that the dGPU was great for her video editing. Reply Klug4Pres - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link Agree on the CPU wattage, and make the thing much thicker for better keyboard travel, better cooling, room for a dGPU, maintainability, upgradeability, battery swappability etc. Iris, while nice on paper, is unfortunately too expensive to make any sense. Reply BrokenCrayons - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link It would seem to make more sense to use a CPU with Iris. The overall power consumption of the system would be a little lower and there's less motherboard complexity. I wonder if there's a cost benefit in picking the 940MX. Maybe it's actually less expensive for Huawei to include the discrete GPU. And then there's availability of Iris parts. I often wonder if there just aren't enough of them being produced to cope with demand or perhaps Intel isn't producing them because OEMs aren't asking for those SKUs.

Reply Bullwinkle J Moose - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link I like 3:2 displays and I prefer 8GB Minimum Ram But hopefully Canon and Ice Lake systems could integrate Hypetane into the motherboard for a Linux based VM boot launcher It would be nice to boot directly to your VM of choice or several simultaneously with Video passthrough and switch VM's instantly with a hotkey press With a VM launcher on an integrated hypetane chip or even in the UEFI, I think we could see under 10 second boot times for your VM of choice VM's could be on a M.2 or thumbdrive SSD for security with only the VM Launcher residing on the Hypetane chip Ever since the hardware manufacturers began limiting what I can boot to, I have been working on several methods of bypassing those limitations Hopefully, I will have 2 methods of booting directly to a VM of choice on the day Canon lake arrives, but this 3rd method cannot be implemented by the End User but may be the most ideal Boot to DOS/chrome/Linux/XP or whatever you want.....

While many were expecting a Surface Pro 5, Microsoft’s new tablet / laptop hybrid is simply the Surface Pro from now on. At first glance, the new Surface Pro looks a lot like the old Surface Pro 4, but it’s the inside that counts this time. “It’s a meaningful change," explains Microsoft's Surface chief, Panos Panay, in an interview with The Verge. "There are about 800 new custom parts in the new Pro.” These new custom parts all add up to a lot of refinement on the new Surface Pro. Microsoft is upgrading the Surface Pro to a new Intel seventh-generation Kaby Lake processor, with a fan-less design on the Core m3 and Core i5 models. This processor switch, and some improvements in Windows 10, means Microsoft is now confident the new Surface Pro will deliver up to 13.5 hours of battery life. That’s a huge increase over the Surface Pro 4, and if Microsoft’s claims are accurate then this new Surface Pro will have 50 percent more battery life than the previous model. While the Core m3 and i5 models will ship with a fan-less design, the top model, an Intel Core i7, still includes a fan. "This isn’t just a processor change." “This isn’t just a processor change," claims Panay. "We did take Kaby Lake, it’s the latest generation, of course. But it’s the integrated SSD on the motherboard. It’s the fundamental architecture changes that we do in Windows and Surface. It brings 13.5 hours of battery. It’s lighter than the previous generation product, and it’s more powerful with no fan.” Grid View Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Like the Surface Laptop, Microsoft is promising sleep improvements with the new Surface Pro so you can confidently open and close the device and maintain battery life. That’s been a problem on the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book previously, and it appears Microsoft has solved it for its latest Surface Laptop and Pro devices. Related Microsoft is placing a big bet on its new Surface family In photos, it’s hard to show exactly what’s changed with the new Surface Pro, but there are some subtle differences. The perimeter vent has shrunk a little around the device so it’s no longer so noticeable, and the device has rounded edges that make it feel better when you’re holding it as a tablet. While the Core m3 and Core i7 models are the same weight, the Core i5 has dropped a tiny bit of weight. It’s not noticeable at all, and it largely looks and feels like the Surface Pro 4. A new hinge goes nearly flat Other subtle changes include a new hinge design. Microsoft has adopted the same Surface Studio 165-degree angle for the Surface Pro, allowing it to lay nearly flat. The hinge no longer snaps (for safety) if you push it too far, and Microsoft is confident the hinge won’t break if you lean on it too much. Microsoft’s Surface hinges have been sturdy in the past, so that’s a claim that’s easy to believe. Surface Pro's new hinge lays nearly flat. Alongside this new hinge angle, Microsoft is also including Surface Dial support on the display of the Surface Pro. You can use the Dial just like the Surface Studio, placing it on top of the display to interact with apps like Sketchable. Microsoft is still planning to include this support on the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 later this year with a firmware update, but it ships out of the box on the new Surface Pro. One of the biggest changes to the Surface Pro is a new Surface Pen. It doesn’t come in the box anymore, so you’ll be able to purchase it separately for $99. While it will work on existing devices, a new tilt functionality is only available on the Surface Pro for now. Tilt will detect the angle of the pen to enable shading and better accuracy for inking. It’s something that creators who use Wacom tablets have been asking for, and Microsoft is finally delivering. Inside the new Surface Pen. Microsoft has also altered the level of pressure sensitivity to 4096, alongside a reduction in the activation force. Inking now feels a lot less laggy and way more responsive on the Surface Pro. Even the Pen itself feels a little more refined, and Microsoft has removed the clip at the top of the device. We’ll have to see what creatives think, but it feels like a big improvement. "Right when you put the pen down, depending on how far you push, it’s like a ballpoint pen at this point," says Panay. New Type Covers ship with alcantara fabric Just like the Surface Laptop, Microsoft is moving to Alcantara for the Surface Pro keyboard. Platinum, burgundy, and cobalt blue Surface Pro Type Covers will be available separately at $159, alongside a regular black Type Cover without the Alcantara fabric for $129. The new Surface Pen will also be available in these same colors to match. Sadly, just like the Surface Laptop, there's no USB-C ports on the Surface Pro. It's the same Surface connector, USB, and mini DisplayPort found on the Surface Pro 4. For the first time on the Surface Pro, Microsoft will also offer a model with LTE connectivity. The LTE version will support micro SIM and eSIM, and will be priced slightly higher than models without LTE support. Microsoft isn’t revealing exact pricing or a release date, or even what processor will power the Surface Pro with LTE. It's possible that Microsoft could opt for an ARM-powered Surface. LTE versions should be available later this year. Microsoft's Surface Pro devices are the most popular in the company's range, with some estimates suggesting more than 70 percent of all Surface devices in the US are Surface Pro. That makes this refresh an important one for Microsoft's Surface effort. “I believe it will be the fastest adopted Pro we’ve ever shipped," claims Panay. "There’s a reason for that, the brand is here and there’s people who have been waiting for it, and it turns out it’s just a kick-ass device." Microsoft’s new Surface Pro is available for preorder today starting at $799. You’ll need to purchase a Type Cover (starting at $129) and Surface Pen ($99) separately, and devices will start shipping on June 15th in 26 countries.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Economy Companies Markets Finance Regulation Business Fintech Blockchain Consensus 2017: R3 secures $107m funding for distributed ledger technology Top investors include SBI Group, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, Intel & Temasek. By Ian Allison May 23, 2017 13:51 BST Financial technology innovator R3 has secured $107m (£83m, €95m)– the world's largest distributed ledger technology (DLT) investment to date. The banking DLT consortium completed the first two of three tranches in its Series A fundraising round, allying any consternation about lack of support from some quarters. The first two tranches of the Series A round were made available only to R3 members, while the third and final tranche – which opens later this year – will be accessible to R3 members and non-R3 institutional investors. R3 will use the funds to accelerate technology development and expand strategic partnerships for product deployment. The company's efforts will be focused on Corda, R3's DLT platform for regulated financial institutions, and its infrastructure network, which will support a vast range of partner-built financial applications that interoperate seamlessly with each other, existing systems and networks. Since the launch of its DLT initiative in September 2015, R3 has grown from a staff of eight finance and technology veterans with nine bank members to a global team of over 110 professionals serving over 80 global financial institutions and regulators on six continents, said a statement released at Consensus 2017 in NYC. The company's work is further supported by over 2,000 technology, financial, and legal experts drawn from its global member base. That base includes banks, clearing houses, exchanges, market infrastructure providers, asset managers, central banks, conduct regulators, trade associations, professional services firms and technology companies. David E. Rutter, CEO of R3, said: "This investment is unprecedented. Many of the world's largest financial firms have come together not just with capital support, but with a robust commitment to work with R3 in developing industry solutions that will be the building blocks of the new financial services infrastructure. We've got unparalleled momentum. "R3 has proven the collaborative model can successfully drive innovation in financial services to a degree never before seen," added Rutter. "In the space of less than two years, we have built a network of over 80 members, launched an open-source distributed ledger platform specifically for wholesale financial markets, conducted over 60 detailed use cases across a variety of asset classes, led the way in regulatory engagement on behalf of the broader DLT community and are ahead of schedule for initial commercial deployments this year. We are on our way to becoming a new operating system for financial services." R3's globally diverse group of investors represents an equal geographical split across Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Americas, counting over 40 participants from over 15 countries. Investors include: Banco Bradesco1 Itaú Unibanco S.A. Bangkok Bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) Bank of America Merrill Lynch Mizuho Bank of Montreal Natixis Bank of New York Mellon Nomura Barclays Nordea Bank BBVA OP Cooperative BNP Paribas Ping An B3 (BM&FBOVESPA and Cetip) Royal Bank of Canada Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce SBI Group Citi SEB Commerzbank Societe Generale Commonwealth Bank of Australia Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation Credit Suisse TD Bank Group CTBC Financial Holding Temasek Daiwa Securities Group The Bank of Nova Scotia Danske Bank Northern Trust Deutsche Bank The Royal Bank of Scotland HSBC U.S. Bank ING UBS AG Intel Capital Wells Fargo Intesa Sanpaolo[2] Westpac Mauricio Minas, Vice President at Banco Bradesco, said:"Bradesco has been studying blockchain and distributed ledger technologies for some time. Today, it is clear to us that these technologies can, in fact, produce benefits to the Brazilian economy, such as cost reduction and process efficiency improvements. We have decided to invest in R3 because it is one of the companies that best translates the needs of the financial services industry with its distributed ledger technological platform – Corda. R3 has been successful in aggregating large banks across the world into collaborative work, which we believe is an important factor when considering these technologies." Ather Williams, Head of Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, added: "We are pleased to continue working with R3 on the development of the Corda effort. The investment reflects our commitment to innovating and collaborating on the next generation of financial services. We are excited about Corda's potential to advance interoperability and common standards, which will bring greater efficiency to the financial community and ultimately benefit our clients."

Over 40 institutions from more than 15 countries participated in the first two tranches of the New York company's fundraising round, making it one of the largest investments in a blockchain company to date, R3 said in a statement. The third and final tranche will open later this year. Other major investors and companies leading the deal include ING Groep NV (INGA.AS), Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4.SA), Itaú Unibanco SA (ITUB4.SA), Natixis SA (CNAT.PA), Barclays Plc (BARC.L), UBS Group AG (UBSG.S) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), R3 said. R3 launched in September 2015 with the backing of nine of the world's largest investment banks seeking to make their operations more efficient with new technology, and its membership has rapidly grown to about 80 financial institutions. It aims to raise $150 million from members and strategic investors, and give them a 60 percent stake. An R3 spokesman declined to disclose the company's valuation. Blockchain, best known as the system underpinning digital currency bitcoin, is a public online ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet. Financial firms hope that the nascent technology can reduce the cost and complexity of burdensome processes such as international payments and securities settlement. The completion of the first two tranches follows the departure of several large banks from R3 over the past few months, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Banco Santander SA (SAN.MC) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) The banks have internal blockchain projects or investments in other similar startups. State Street Corp (STT.N) has also left the group, the R3 spokesman added. "This year we will have pilot projects and early production phase products in the market," R3 Chief Executive David Rutter said in an interview. But "we are a couple of years away until we see massively impactful products," he added. Skeptics have warned that it might take many years for the financial industry to reap significant benefits from blockchain. "Distributed ledger technology is well suited for some uses case but it will not be the answer for everything," Kaushalya Somasundaram, head of fintech partnerships and strategy at HSBC, said in an interview.

The HP Spectre x2 features a 12.3-inch IPS display with a resolution of 3,000 x 2,000 that supports Windows Ink (450 nits of brightness). Under the hood, you’ll find up to an Intel 7th generation Kaby Lake Core i7 processor, Intel Iris Plus Graphics, 16GB of LPDDR3 memory and a sizable 1TB PCIe solid-state drive. HP’s latest features dual USB 3.0 Type-C ports (non-3.1 and non-Thunderbolt 3, unfortunately), a combination audio jack and a microSD card slot. Audio is supplied via dual front-firing Bang & Olufsen speakers and there’s now a front-facing IR camera for use with Windows Hello. Battery life is rated at up to eight hours and thanks to HP’s Fast Charge technology, you can recharge back up to 50 percent capacity in just 30 minutes. As PCWorld highlights, the new Spectre x2 uses a pen from N-trig (replacing the Wacom-based pen in the earlier model). The slide switch for popping out the kickstand is now a thing of the past; you simply pop out the kickstand manually. The magnets that hold the tablet portion of the device into the keyboard base are also stronger now, we’re told. The HP Spectre x2 goes on sale next month with pricing starting at $999.99.

MSC Technologies continues to round out its line of Intel “Apollo Lake” computer-on-modules with a 95 x95mm COM Express Compact Type 6 MSC C6C-AL. Like its recent Qseven form factor MSC Q7-AL and SMARC-based MSC SM2F-AL, as well as its earlier, COM Express Mini Type 10 MSC C10M-AL, the MSC C6C-AL supports all five Apollo Lake SoCs. These include the quad-core and dual-core Atom 3900 parts, as well as the dual-core Celeron N3350 and quad-core Pentium N4200. The default OS is Windows 10, with a Linux BSP available upon request. Other recent Linux-supported Type 6 Compact modules with Apollo Lake include Axiomtek’s CEM313. Two versions of the MSC C6C-AL (click image to enlarge) Like all these MSC modules, the MSC C6C-AL is available in both 0 to 60°C and -40 to 85°C models. With up to 16GB DDR3L-1866, it offers twice the maximum RAM of any of these modules, as well last year’s Intel Braswell based, Compact Type 6 MSC C6C-BW. The module ships with a microSD slot and optional eMMC (amount unspecified). A GbE controller is also onboard. The MSC C6C-AL supports triple independent displays, with a pair of DDI interfaces supporting DisplayPort 1.2 and/or HDMI 1.4b ports with up to 4096 x 2160 @ 60Hz or 3840 x 2160 @ 30Hz resolution, respectively. Depending on the SoC model, you get either a dual-channel, 18/24-bit LVDS interface with up to 1920 x 1200 @ 60Hz or an eDP 1.3 port with 4K support. HD audio support is available, and dual MIPI-CSI camera links are said to be optional via a feature connector. The MSC C6C-AL supports dual SATA 3.0 (6Gbps) ports, as well as 4x USB 3.0 and 2x USB 2.0 ports. You also get up to 5x PCIe x1 and LPCBus expansion. Additional features include a watchdog, system monitoring, fan control, and TPM 1.2. The MSC C6C-AL optionally offers hardware based security compliant to the requirements of TCG (Trusted Computing Group). The module ships with a wide range 5-20V power input, a passive heat sink, an active heat sink with fan, and a heat spreader. Optional carriers include the MSC C6-MB-EV Mini-ITX board, as well as an unnamed ATX form factor board, probably the MSC C6-MB-EVA.   Further information The MSC C6C-AL appears to be available now, with pricing unstated. More information may be found on MSC’s MSC C6C-AL product page.   Related posts: Rugged, Linux-ready Qseven module taps Apollo Lake SMARC 2.0 module gives Apollo Lake plenty of options Tiny COM features Apollo Lake and soldered RAM Rugged, Linux-friendly module taps Apollo Lake Mini Apollo Lake module takes the heat — and the cold Three more Apollo Lake COMs support Qseven and COM Express Aaeon shows its first Apollo Lake COM Qseven COM offers Apollo Lake and a security chip Ubuntu-friendly Qseven COM runs on Apollo Lake SODIMM-style module runs Linux on Apollo Lake (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

If you're going to buy a laptop, it might as well be a Windows 10 one, right? Wrong. If you only have £200-odd to spend, something like the Acer Chromebook 11 N7 is almost certainly going to be more fun to use than a Windows machine limping along with a 0.1-horsepower Intel Atom CPU. The special sauce in this particular Acer Chromebook 11 is its strength. Military-grade ruggedness means the N7 can pretty much survive being thrown through a wall. Acer Chromebook 11 N7 review: What's different about Chromebook? Chrome OS software (not Windows) Google apps installed, ideal for lightweight work tasks Google Play for Android apps incoming Herein lies the question many wonder: how does a Chromebook differ to a Windows laptop? It's all in the software: with Chrome OS on board, this Acer can't install Windows applications. You do get Chrome's standard array of Google apps, the same suite of Office-a-like apps you get in an Android phone plus Maps Photos and a few other bits. So it's ideal for education. Pocket-lint Chrome OS is at its happiest when connected to the internet, but you can also write documents, play certain offline games and watch locally-stored video when there's no Wi-Fi. One of Chrome's more recent additions is support for the Google Play app store - just as you would get from an Android smartphone or tablet - which should expand the array of apps available for this OS platform. However, it's not available for the Acer Chromebook 11 N7 yet. Acer says it's coming in an update, but you may be in for a bit of a wait (and for the Chrome geeks out there: yes we tried the Dev and Beta builds of Chrome, and Google Play isn't available in any of them yet). As is, the Acer Chromebook 11 N7 is therefore a useful but pared-back laptop. The software is friendly, feeling like an Android version of Windows properly designed for use with a keyboard and mouse. Acer Chromebook 11 N7 review: Design MIL-STD 810G military-grade ruggedisation All-plastic no-nonsense build Excellent build quality Let's be straight: the N7 is pretty boring-looking, right? Featuring a sea of grey plastic whose only texture beyond a general rough finish is on the bottom; we presume the diamond embossing on the undercarriage is designed to make the little thing stay on your knees better. Pocket-lint It's not unattractive, mind, and its curves give the Chromebook 11 N7 a sort-of friendly look. We imagine this Acer will end up in classrooms across the land (as long as they get their orders in before the Tories cut school budgets completely, anyway). If you must have a bit of bling to you laptop, Acer also makes a metal Chromebook for the same price. The big claim here is that the Chromebook 11 N7 has been MIL-STD 810G tested. That's a military-spec set of tests that includes "high and low temperatures, humidity, vibrations, mechanical shocks on drops, rain, dust and sand". And unlike some rugged gear, this one has actually been tested by a third-party lab. The downside? It's chunkier than most and, at 1.3kg, isn't light for a 11-inch laptop. Don't underestimate the value of the Acer Chromebook 11 N7's ruggedness if you're not buying for an unruly brat, though. The keyboard is designed to take up to a can's worth of liquid without letting any of it getting to the insides, and this little guy feels exceptionally well-made for a computer that's so affordable. Pocket-lint You can really feel the difference as you use the Acer Chromebook 11 N7. The keyboard surround is very stiff, more so than some fancy metal laptops costing over £1,000 that we've reviewed recently. Acer Chromebook 11 N7 review: Keyboard and trackpad Excellent typing feel for the price No backlight to help late-night typing Plastic trackpad is decent, but not high-end This feeds into what we think is the best part of the Acer Chromebook 11 N7: the typing experience. The ultra rigid insides and a frankly brilliant-for-the-price keys make this one of the best typing experiences you can have in a £200-odd ultraportable. Despite having just an 11-inch screen, the keyboard doesn't feel cramped. Pocket-lint We wrote this review using the Acer Chromebook 11 N7, and it honestly didn't feel like much of a downgrade coming from our day-to-day MacBook Pro. If you want cheap laptop to start writing that novel you've always wanted to churn out, this is a great place to give it a go. The trackpad below is less impressive, but only because you can't really recreate the feel of a high-end pad at this price. Expensive laptops use textured glass panels for the bit you actually swipe your finger across, but in this Acer you get plastic. It feels about as close as plastic can get to glass, but the friction is a little different, feeling less smooth when your finger changes direction. Pocket-lint You won't find much better at the price, mind. Acer Chromebook 11 N7 review: Connectivity 2x USB 3, 1x HDMI (no USB-C) SD card slot, 3.5mm headphones The Acer Chromebook 11 N7 also has plenty of connections, as long as you're not too bothered about having the very latest standards. There are two USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI video output and a full-size SD card slot. These are what we use 99 per cent of the time, although it would have been good to see a USB-C jammed-in here too. They're not much use at present, as even the USB-C phones tend to have cables that end in full-size USBs right now, but the future is almost certainly USB-C-shaped. Pocket-lint There's also a Kensington security port on one side. And if you don't know what one of those is, you probably don't need to worry about it. The Acer Chromebook 11 N7 is a real hardy "meat-and-potatoes" pub lunch of a laptop. There's nothing fancy going on, but it's satisfying and the price is right. Acer Chromebook 11 N7 review: Screen Low-resolution (1366 x 768) delivers so-so sharpness TN screen panel means undersaturated colour and limited viewing angles Matte screen is the best for versatility As with just about any laptop this price, the screen probably won't blow you away, though. It's an 11.6-inch LCD. Its sharpness, viewing angles and colour aren't as good as those from, for example, an iPad. Pocket-lint You can see the Acer's pixels pretty clearly, although the effect isn't all that different from looking at a 1080p 15.6-inch screen. Colour is a little undersaturated, but not so severely that people's faces will look totally lifeless if you watch a movie on the N7. Similarly, top brightness won't scorch your eyeballs, but because the screen has a matte finish rather than a glossy, reflective one, you can get away with using this laptop outdoors without the display being impossible to make out. The Chromebook 11 N7's screen tilts back an awful lot - more than 180 degrees - but doing so also shows off the contrast shift typical of TN panel like this. Colours invert, everything starts to look shadowy. However, viewing angles aren't so terrible you need to look at the display dead-on for it to look right. This isn't a great screen, but we don't expect much more in a laptop this cheap. Pocket-lint There's a version of the Acer Chromebook 11 N7 with a touchscreen, but ours is a plain old non-touch one. Giving it a prod just to check, the Chromebook's toughening seems to extend to the screen too. It feels sturdy. Acer Chromebook 11 N7 review: Performance Low-end, ageing CPU is not great for games Chrome still feels fast enough for the basics A fair amount of left-over storage The real benefit of a Chromebook over a normal Windows laptop is that it can get by with a true low-end CPU without running like a dog, and it much less storage space. This laptop has an Intel Celeron N3060 processor with 4GB RAM and a 32GB solid state drive. Pocket-lint That CPU is a little old and a lot low-end. It was released in early 2016, and Intel has already made a new family of N-series CPUs, including the N3350, that Acer has already plugged-into some of its other £200-ish laptops. It's still low-end, but is newer and faster. The N3060 is a dual-core Celeron processor with a base frequency of 1.6GHz. While using the Acer Chromebook 11 N7 to write documents and search the web, its performance is fine. There's none of the basic lag that makes using a Celeron-powered Windows 10 laptop such a trial. However, start doing something a bit more challenging and you'll find the Chromebook's limits pretty quick. There are Chrome games, for example, and there's pretty serious intermittent frame rate drops in most of the ones we tried: Spelunky, Portal 2D, Gore Script. Cut the Rope runs pretty well, perhaps because its code is better-optimised. Acer Chromebook 11 N7 review: Battery life 8.5 hours battery life with normal use Usable but not amazing speakers The Acer Chromebook 11 N7 also lasts a good while between charges, although not that close to Acer's claim of 13-hours. Using it as our usual day-to-day PC, connected to the internet and skipping between browsing and using Google Docs to write, we got around 8.5-hours use from a charge. That's enough for a good day's work, but not world-beating. Finally, the Acer Chromebook 11 N7 has a pair of speakers, one on each end of the underside. The sound is quite boxy-sounding, with little bass and limited treble. However, that's still better than a thin, caustic sound and the maximum volume is decent. Verdict The Acer Chromebook 11 N7 is a good Chromebook for those who'd rather have a laptop that feels hard as nails rather than looks that tell those nearby it's worth nicking. It must be one of the sturdiest laptops in the world at this price. We don't tend to torture our laptops too much, but the tough design has real benefits for actual use, levelling-up the typing experience. This is a great little typing machine. The screen is only fine, it could really do with the newer, slightly more powerful Celeron processor Intel has already released, but if you just want a computer for the basics this is a good choice. Alternatives to consider... Acer Chromebook 14 Acer Chromebook 14 £279 One of the best alternatives to the Chromebook 11 N7 comes from Acer. The Chromebook 14 is larger, has an aluminium body that looks and feels a lot fancier. And the latest version has a better 1080p IPS screen that will get you much better viewing angles. At just £30-40 extra, the Chromebook may be a better buy if you don't mind having a larger laptop. It's also more powerful, using the quad-core version of the N3060 used here. Make sure you look for the 1080p version, though, as there's a 1366 x 768 model too, which will look super-pixellated. Asus C201 Asus Chromebook C201 £239 As it doesn't have the military-grade rugged spec of the Acer, this Chromebook is significantly lighter, at under 1kg. How much are you going to abuse your laptop? The 4GB RAM version is roughly the same price, so there's no advantage there, and it has less storage too, 16GB. It uses a Rockchip processor rather than an Intel one. They're generally less well-regarded, but as it uses a very phone-like graphics chipset it may well fare better with Android apps. Asus Asus Chromebook Flip (C302CA) £549 What do you get if you spend real money on a Chromebook? The Asus C302CA doesn't feel too far off a MacBook in its construction, with metal used throughout. Its screen is also far better, and flips around for some hybrid-style antics. Performance with more demanding apps and games is also a lot quicker as it has a premium Intel Core m3 CPU rather than a cheap Celeron model. At more than double the price, and with a similar typing experience you have to wonder whether all the extra money is worth spending if all you need is a typing machine, though.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 24 great B2B and B2C brand journalism sites Advocate Heath Care is asking whether breastfed babies are smarter. Semiconductor chip maker Intel has insights on the top five most impressive game explosions. Power drink maker Red Bull wants you to know about three generations of a high-flying family and its “skytyping” business. All three are examples of a trend that has accelerated in the past six years: brand journalism sites. Recently, I was asked for stellar examples. After hitting up several experts, I offer the list below. Why practice brand journalism? Ragan Communications chief executive Mark Ragan, a former national political reporter and an early advocate of brand journalism, offers his philosophy: Stop begging the media, and become the media yourself. “Newsrooms have been decimated,” Ragan says. “If you want your company’s story told, you’d better write it or shoot it yourself. “But brand journalism works only if your story is credible, is helpful to the reader and eschews all corporate-speak and jargon. If the story is self-serving or it is designed to sell, it’s not brand journalism. It’s marketing.” (Ragan heads Ragan Consulting Group, which works with businesses to establish brand journalism sites.) From videos to white papers David Meerman Scott , another early advocate, defines brand journalism as the creation of web content—videos, blog posts, photos, charts, graphs, essays, e-books, white papers—that deliver value to the marketplace and position organizations as worthy of doing business with. “Brand journalism is not a product pitch,” he says. “It is not an advertorial. It is not an egotistical spewing of gobbledygook-laden corporate drivel.” He adds that those with the traditional skills of marketing, public relations, advertising and copywriting are not the right people to create brand journalism content. “Instead, you need the skills of a journalist,” he says. [RELATED: Learn how to infuse storytelling and great writing into all your communications at the Business Writing Summit.] Here are the sites we came up with: B2B brand journalism The good news, for a B2B company, is that you needn’t sit out this trend as flashy B2C companies like Red Bull hog the limelight. Consider the following. Cisco Systems, the networking hardware company, covers everything from innovative technology hitting the theater stage to IT that skills offer opportunities for Jordanian women. American Express’ OPEN Forum started out as a forum for small businesses, but it has grown into a leading brand journalism site. And just how is virtual reality going to shape the future of consumer experiences? IQ by Intel, in showcasing technology, offers not only the explosions article, but one on athletes and fans preparing for an e-sports competition Down Under. Adobe’s CMO will fill you in about everything from artificial intelligence to the U.S. Census Bureau, all in an effort to interest potential customers in the marketing department. Guys, HSBC Global Connections (and your female colleagues) think it’s high time you figured out “What Women Want—And What Businesses Need To Know.” GE has experimented with polished Facebook Live-casts tied to the Rio Olympics and “drome week.” If you’ve ever wondered how pilots rescue people from an avalanche in the Italian Alps, here’s where to go. UPS’ Longitudes has hosted series on trade and offers a piece titled, “3D Printing—Evolution Rather than Revolution.” Boeing has provided a wealth of stories and videos for aviation fans. A Veterans Day feature might sound internal: “Corps Education: Employees share how lessons learned during militaryservice have helped them at Boeing.” Because the aerospace company’s customers include the Pentagon and many veterans in the airlines industry, it made sense as an outward-facing story, as well. Speaking of the Pentagon, Scott recommends the U.S. military’s Armed with Science site. Where else could you find out how the military is capturing sunlight at Nellis Air Force Base? B2C brand journalism Although giant consumer brands such as Coca-Cola were pathfinders in this area, many hospitals have joined the stampede as they find the public is eager for news about health care and healthy living. Coca-Cola Journey fills us in on testing augmented reality for bottling equipment maintenance.

It is not an egotistical spewing of gobbledygook-laden corporate drivel.” He adds that those with the traditional skills of marketing, public relations, advertising and copywriting are not the right people to create brand journalism content. “Instead, you need the skills of a journalist,” he says.

Reuters/Steve Marcus Since Microsoft has claimed that there will be no Microsoft Surface Pro 5 in the near future, rival brands have been offered the opportunity to take the spotlight. The HP Spectre x2 tries to fill in the gap, a second-generation laptop that ups the specs the Surface Pro 4 currently has to offer.  For the record, HP is a familiar name in the laptop segment. It has its own share of hybrids, and the 2-in-1 device may just steal the thunder from the Surface Pro series. With Microsoft believing that the Surface Pro 4 is good for a couple of more years, the smalls steps the HP Spectre x2 in terms of features and specs could sway some buyers on their end.  The HP Spectre x2 ups the stakes a bit by pinning its hopes on the 7th generation Kaby Lake CPUs. Aside from that, it will come with Iris Plus graphics versions for the Core i5 and i7, embedded with 64 GB of DRAM. Both should ramp up the expectations as far as delivering high-resolution graphics – both for gaming and media viewing entertainment.  Other key features the HP Spectre x2 will carry include 16 GB of LPDDR3 RAM and SSD options of up to 1 TB PCIe. For the display, the HP Spectre x2 will offer a 12.3-inch screen (1920x1080 pixels), brighter which can accommodate up to 450 nits.  The HP Spectre x2 will also come with a pen technology plus a new IR camera in front, which should work well with Windows Hello authentication feature, PC World reports. For connectivity, the HP Spectre x2 comes with a pair of USB-C ports, DisplayPort and USB-PD charging. A 41-watt battery will be tasked to keep the 2-in-1 juiced up. The HP Spectre x2 specs do offer a slight upgrade from the celebrated Microsoft Surface Pro 4, but the kicker is really in the price. The Core i5 base model of the HP Spectre x2 is priced at US$999 (AU$1,333). This would include 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM and 128GB SSD.  For those who want to move up a bit, there is the Core i7 model to consider. Priced at US$1,280 (AU$1,708), included are the Iris Plus graphics, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Both models are expected to go on sale this June.  The flexible HP Spectre x2 hybrid should be worth checking out, especially for the ones yearning for a new 2-in-1 to use. With the Surface Pro 4 slowly aging, the HP Spectre x2 should be a keen alternative for folks hoping to see a new hybrid to get in the market.

By Corinne Reichert | May 23, 2017 -- 04:46 GMT (21:46 PDT) | Topic: Mobility (Image: Screenshot by Corinne Reichert/ZDNet) Ericsson has announced a trial of 5G network technology and virtual reality (VR) during the lead-up to the Indianapolis 500 motor race in partnership with Intel and telecommunications carrier Verizon. The companies made use of 5G technologies such as beam forming and beam tracking, wherein antenna arrays steer a beam to where a user is with less radio interference, attaining speeds in excess of 6Gbps across Verizon's 5G trial network. "We have to deliver the fastest 5G connection possible," said Dan Huffman, principle engineer for Verizon Wireless, in a video of the trial. "As our vehicles get smarter, our network also has to get smarter, and we're doing exactly that with a 5G network capable of pinpointing your device and maximising your bandwidth at all times." More than 180 beams were targeted at the car on the Indy 500 racetrack, Ericsson said in a blog post, with a prototype 5G antenna installed on the roof of the vehicle. "We're pushing beyond today's technology -- with multi-gigabit speeds and super low latency, we're enabling new applications and the Internet of Things," said Bill Goodman, lead engineer on Ericsson's Technology Team. Ericsson took the test further by blacking out the windows of a racing car, installing a camera on the roof of the vehicle, and fitting the driver with a 5G-enabled VR headset showing a 4K video stream of the track from the camera. "To really kind of push the envelope and showcase the low latency, we added in this virtual-reality driving where we'll black out the windows, virtual reality glasses will be worn by the driver, and the camera will take a feed and uplink through 5G into the network, turn it around and send it back over 5G, and do that quickly enough so the driver can react appropriately as he's running around this track at speed," Goodman explained. During the trials, Ericsson and Verizon attained downlink speeds of 6.4Gbps in a vehicle travelling at 60 miles per hour (100km/h). Ericsson saw similar speeds during a 5G trial in a moving vehicle in Australia last year using the Telstra network. Ericsson added that in future, sensors and cameras will be fitted to racing cars and racetracks in order to enable viewers and pit crews to see the race from several vantage points, as well as seeing information on each driver's speed, RPM, and tyre pressure in real time.

Verizon is currently rolling out 11 5G trial networks across the United States, with the first deployed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, earlier this month. The networks are being built by Samsung and Cisco using the former's 5G radio base stations and 5G routers alongside a Cisco Ultra Services Platform 5G virtualised packet core with Cisco Advanced Services and Samsung's virtual RAN (vRAN) solutions. The companies are also set to deploy pre-commercial 5G trial networks with partners Ericsson, Intel, LG, Nokia, and Qualcomm by mid-2017 in Atlanta, Georgia; Bernardsville, New Jersey; Brockton, Massachusetts; Dallas, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Houston, Texas; Miami, Florida; Sacramento, California; Seattle, Washington; and Washington DC. Ericsson has estimated 5G to be worth $1.2 trillion by 2026, with 20 percent of this market to be made up by energy utilities; 19 percent by manufacturing; 13 percent by public safety; 13 percent by healthcare; 10 percent by media and entertainment; 10 percent by public transport; 8 percent by automotive; and 6 percent by financial services. In February, Ericsson announced partnering with Telstra, Japanese telecommunications provider NTT DoCoMo, and European giant Vodafone on additional 5G trials. The 5G new radio (NR) trial with Telstra will see the two conduct interoperability testing and an over-the-air field trial using the current 5G NR specifications provided by 3GPP during the second half of 2017 in partnership with Qualcomm. For the trial, Ericsson will make use of millimetre-wave spectrum technologies at higher-frequency bands to increase network capacity and allow for multi-gigabit speeds across the 28GHz, 39GHz and sub-6GHz spectrum bands, as well as Multiple-Input Multiple-Output antenna technology along with beam forming and beam tracking. The two will trial Telstra's 5G network during the Commonwealth Games in 2018 ahead of a commercial launch by 2020.

Why it's never a good time to invest in the stock market Here are the constitutional crises worrying Wall Street Thompson’s days were numbered at the Census Bureau Who or what is keeping stock prices up even as there is continuous economic and political turmoil around the world? Could it be Switzerland? Stock prices fell sharply last Wednesday when the latest “scandal” — and I don’t even remember what it was — struck the Trump administration. I mentioned in a column on Thursday my Top 10 reasons US investors should be wary of ever-rising stock prices. One of the 10 things was the manipulation of equities markets by countries like China and Japan, which proudly admit to doing so. And then there’s the mysterious case of Switzerland, which has an enormous portfolio of US stocks — and no obvious reason that it keeps buying. According to its last filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Swiss National Bank owned more than $63 billion worth of stock — most of it in US companies. In fact, that amount was $1 billion higher than it was in the previous quarterly filing with the SEC. Since large shareholders are only required to make quarterly reports to the SEC, there’s no telling how active the Swiss National Bank is on a given day or whether it jumps in to support weak markets. The latest filing included more than 15 million shares of Apple, 13 million Intel, 25 million General Electric, 6.6 million Facebook, 10 million Ford, 13 million Intel and on and on and… In fact, a printed list of all the stocks is 66 pages long. No matter what the motive is for the purchase of all that stock, the end result is the same — it’s helping to prop up stock prices. And, I admit, the reason for the Swiss appetite for stocks could be nothing more than investment purposes. Like everyone else, the Swiss National Bank could be buying simply because the returns elsewhere — like in the bond market — are so abysmal. But is it possible that the Swiss are acting as an agent of US financial authorities who fear that a big decline in stock prices would be against America’s national interest? OK, I hear people shouting “conspiracy theory” already. So let’s get a little deeper into history. Central banks around the world have always come to one another’s rescue in currency markets. If America, for instance, wanted the US dollar to be stronger than it is, a foreign central bank like Switzerland’s would purchase dollars on behalf of the US. Mission accomplished. And nobody is the wiser that the US was behind the propping up of the dollar. Here’s another fact. A guy named Robert Heller, who had been a governor on the Federal Reserve Board, proposed in 1989 that the Fed rig the US stock market in the event of an emergency. Heller said this should be done only in dire situations, like the stock market crash of 1987 and the near crash just a month before he proposed this. Heller argued that rigging stocks — through the purchase by the Federal Reserve of stock index futures contracts — would be no harder than manipulating the currency markets. Why is this one of the things investors should worry about? Because there’s no telling why the Swiss National Bank is buying all that stock and when it will stop. As so with other investors, if interest rates rise high enough, the Swiss may decide that stocks aren’t worth the risk. So, all I have to say is: Go, Switzerland! You buy our stocks , and we’ll eat your chocolate. It seems like a fair deal.

Reuters/Steve Marcus Since Microsoft has claimed that there will be no Microsoft Surface Pro 5 in the near future, rival brands have been offered the opportunity to take the spotlight. The HP Spectre x2 tries to fill in the gap, a second-generation laptop that ups the specs the Surface Pro 4 currently has to offer.  For the record, HP is a familiar name in the laptop segment. It has its own share of hybrids, and the 2-in-1 device may just steal the thunder from the Surface Pro series. With Microsoft believing that the Surface Pro 4 is good for a couple of more years, the smalls steps the HP Spectre x2 in terms of features and specs could sway some buyers on their end.  The HP Spectre x2 ups the stakes a bit by pinning its hopes on the 7th generation Kaby Lake CPUs. Aside from that, it will come with Iris Plus graphics versions for the Core i5 and i7, embedded with 64 GB of DRAM. Both should ramp up the expectations as far as delivering high-resolution graphics – both for gaming and media viewing entertainment.  Other key features the HP Spectre x2 will carry include 16 GB of LPDDR3 RAM and SSD options of up to 1 TB PCIe. For the display, the HP Spectre x2 will offer a 12.3-inch screen (1920x1080 pixels), brighter which can accommodate up to 450 nits.  The HP Spectre x2 will also come with a pen technology plus a new IR camera in front, which should work well with Windows Hello authentication feature, PC World reports. For connectivity, the HP Spectre x2 comes with a pair of USB-C ports, DisplayPort and USB-PD charging. A 41-watt battery will be tasked to keep the 2-in-1 juiced up. The HP Spectre x2 specs do offer a slight upgrade from the celebrated Microsoft Surface Pro 4, but the kicker is really in the price. The Core i5 base model of the HP Spectre x2 is priced at US$999 (AU$1,333). This would include 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM and 128GB SSD.  For those who want to move up a bit, there is the Core i7 model to consider. Priced at US$1,280 (AU$1,708), included are the Iris Plus graphics, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Both models are expected to go on sale this June.  The flexible HP Spectre x2 hybrid should be worth checking out, especially for the ones yearning for a new 2-in-1 to use. With the Surface Pro 4 slowly aging, the HP Spectre x2 should be a keen alternative for folks hoping to see a new hybrid to get in the market.

Read More BHUBANESWAR: Twenty-six B.Tech graduates from Odisha's SOA University got the shock of their life on Tuesday when they went to join a company that had purportedly 'selected' them during the campus placement in April. It turned out that the company, Huawei, had never selected them. "We got the shock of our life. We were super excited after days of extended parties to celebrate the first job. But the entire world came crashing down when the company officials said the offer letters we possessed were never issued by them," an affected student told TOI. "It was so embarrassing. I could not look my father in the eyes," he said. After the agitated students and their parents contacted the university, the authorities crosschecked with various companies only to find that job offers to not only these 21 but more than 100 students by nine companies (Huawei, Ircon Construction, Schneider Electric, Mitshubishi Electric, Honeywell, Toshiba, Magneti Marelli Supertech and Intel) were fake. The people who came to recruit on behalf of these companies had no connection with them. "We were initially angry with the university. But now we feel even the varsity was cheated," said Amit Sahu, another student whose joining is due in June. A varsity spokesperson said the hiring was facilitated by a consultancy firm, who made false job promises on behalf of these companies. The firm charged a consultancy fee from the university and not from the students. "We will lodge an FIR against the consultancy on Wednesday. It's too early to say why it did so," a varsity spokesperson said. In a damage control, the university offered three options to the affected students. "We will provide a stipend support of monthly Rs 20,000 to them and engage them as teaching assistants for a year or till they get jobs. The varsity will explore job prospects for them," said varsity's registrar B B Pradhan. "If the students want to pursue M.Tech in the varsity, it will bear the entire course fee. For those willing to do MBA, the varsity will bear the first year fee," Pradhan said. The deemed university accredited 'A' grade by NAAC and was ranked the 33rd best institution at the national level and the 20th best university in the India Rankings 2017, the grading of higher educational institutions by the Ministry of Human Resource Development released in April.

For weeks, leading Democratic lawmakers, helped by some moderate Republicans, have been negotiating the details of a tax on corporations’ total sales — or gross receipts — in Oregon. They’ve debated how high the tax rate should be, how many businesses should pay it and whether to have different rates for different industry sectors. They’ve agreed to offset the new tax’s negative impacts by repealing the existing corporate income tax, but they continue to debate how big a cut to make to personal income taxes. Coupled with some curbs to state personnel costs, proponents hope the major new revenue source could both help fill the projected $1.4 billion hole in the state’s 2017-19 budget and provide more long-term stability. The budget gap is related to state costs — including pay, health benefits and pension expenses for state employees, K-12 school district employees, government retirees and others funded by the state — rising faster than state revenues, which are at record levels because of burgeoning income tax receipts. But reaching a deal between more liberal House Democrats — who would like the tax on sales to raise a net $3 billion per biennium from about 5,000 big businesses — and more moderate Senate Democrats — who favor a much smaller tax that more businesses would pay — has been difficult and time-consuming. Still, key negotiator Sen. Mark Hass, a Beaverton Democrat, said Tuesday that a compromise is “close.” A spokeswoman for House Speaker Tina Kotek, another chief negotiator, said she hoped a new proposal could be unveiled this week. Kotek on Monday stressed that the corporate tax and cost-curb package is her top priority for now, ahead of a recently unveiled transportation package that would increase taxes and fees to pay for infrastructure work. Controversial policy bills, meanwhile, “will have to wait until we get that done,” she said. “We’re just trying to find that spot where Senate and House members can come together on a long-term solution” for the budget, Kotek said. Without a major new revenue stream now, the state budget “just gets worse” in coming years, she added. The push for a new gross receipts tax received a momentum boost this week when a group of businesses, for the first time, publicly expressed some level of support for the effort. That coalition, which includes heavyweight Ore­gon companies such as Nike and Intel, as well as Comcast NBC Universal, Genentech and technology firms, said in a prepared statement that it supports “forging a path toward greater stability in the state budget” and is “committed” to working with Hass and Kotek. For businesses with a big physical footprint in Oregon, a gross receipts — or “commercial activities” — tax holds some advantages over the current corporate income tax structure. Many firms that now sell lots of products in-state but don’t have a physical address here aren’t subject to Oregon’s corporate income tax at all. But under a gross receipts tax, those companies would start paying taxes based on their in-state sales, regardless of where they’re headquartered. For companies that now pay big corporate income tax bills in Oregon, the prospect of spreading the business tax burden around to more firms — and minimizing the size of the tax increase they might individually face — is appealing. But Hass stressed that the potential source of business support will evaporate if the new “commercial activities tax” is too big. Hass’ latest draft version, released Tuesday, would apply a four-tiered tax rate of between 0.25 and 0.85 percent to businesses with yearly sales in Oregon of more than $3 million. Companies in the service industry would pay the highest rate; wholesalers would pay the lowest. The different rates are intended to avoid penalizing industries that operate on smaller profit margins and to mitigate the impact of “pyramiding,” where a product is taxed several times along the supply chain. The new proposal would raise a net $1.2 billion a biennium in new state revenue when fully phased in. That’s less than half of what House Democrats hoped to raise with their version released in early May. Hass stressed that the new version isn’t the compromise proposal with the House Democrats. But, he added, businesses that support his effort are unlikely to back tax rates higher than the ones he has proposed. “We’re already pushing things, with rates at this level,” he said. Even if House and Senate Democrats can reach agreement on a proposed tax structure, they are likely to face fierce resistance from the bulk of Oregon’s business community. They’ll also need at least one Republican lawmaker’s vote in both houses. The biggest and most influential group, the Ore­gon Business Plan Coalition, continues to oppose any gross receipts tax this session. Instead, it is calling for state government cost reductions along with a “bridge” funding package: small, short-term tax increases to patch up the state’s 2017-19 budget. That could include increases in personal income and corporate tax rates and trimming existing tax deductions, including potentially the popular one for charitable giving. Pat McCormick, a spokesman for the coalition, said the time isn’t right for a major gross receipts tax, with not enough time left in the session to work out policy details. Even if the Legislature can pass a measure, it is likely to be referred to voters, McCormick added, and voters still are soured on the idea of gross receipts taxes after they dealt a big defeat to Measure 97 last November. A gross receipts tax “and other options for restructuring Oregon’s tax system are worthy of thoughtful consideration,” he said. But “major revisions to Oregon’s tax system should be studied this interim, with a joint committee convened for that purpose as soon as practical after the current session adjourns.” But Hass said the proposals the Legislature is weighing now are far different from Measure 97, because they’re much smaller and are designed to do less harm to the state’s economy. Business groups’ “bridge” funding idea, meanwhile, would mean “doubling down” on the state’s existing corporate tax, he added, which allows many companies to avoid paying taxes in Ore­gon at all. “You can marshal an army to protect the status quo,” Hass said.

For weeks, leading Democratic lawmakers, helped by some moderate Republicans, have been negotiating the details of a tax on corporations’ total sales — or gross receipts — in Oregon. They’ve debated how high the tax rate should be, how many businesses should pay it and whether to have different rates for different industry sectors. They’ve agreed to offset the new tax’s negative impacts by repealing the existing corporate income tax, but they continue to debate how big a cut to make to personal income taxes. Coupled with some curbs to state personnel costs, proponents hope the major new revenue source could both help fill the projected $1.4 billion hole in the state’s 2017-19 budget and provide more long-term stability. The budget gap is related to state costs — including pay, health benefits and pension expenses for state employees, K-12 school district employees, government retirees and others funded by the state — rising faster than state revenues, which are at record levels because of burgeoning income tax receipts. But reaching a deal between more liberal House Democrats — who would like the tax on sales to raise a net $3 billion per biennium from about 5,000 big businesses — and more moderate Senate Democrats — who favor a much smaller tax that more businesses would pay — has been difficult and time-consuming. Still, key negotiator Sen. Mark Hass, a Beaverton Democrat, said Tuesday that a compromise is “close.” A spokeswoman for House Speaker Tina Kotek, another chief negotiator, said she hoped a new proposal could be unveiled this week. Kotek on Monday stressed that the corporate tax and cost-curb package is her top priority for now, ahead of a recently unveiled transportation package that would increase taxes and fees to pay for infrastructure work. Controversial policy bills, meanwhile, “will have to wait until we get that done,” she said. “We’re just trying to find that spot where Senate and House members can come together on a long-term solution” for the budget, Kotek said. Without a major new revenue stream now, the state budget “just gets worse” in coming years, she added. The push for a new gross receipts tax received a momentum boost this week when a group of businesses, for the first time, publicly expressed some level of support for the effort. That coalition, which includes heavyweight Ore­gon companies such as Nike and Intel, as well as Comcast NBC Universal, Genentech and technology firms, said in a prepared statement that it supports “forging a path toward greater stability in the state budget” and is “committed” to working with Hass and Kotek. For businesses with a big physical footprint in Oregon, a gross receipts — or “commercial activities” — tax holds some advantages over the current corporate income tax structure. Many firms that now sell lots of products in-state but don’t have a physical address here aren’t subject to Oregon’s corporate income tax at all. But under a gross receipts tax, those companies would start paying taxes based on their in-state sales, regardless of where they’re headquartered. For companies that now pay big corporate income tax bills in Oregon, the prospect of spreading the business tax burden around to more firms — and minimizing the size of the tax increase they might individually face — is appealing. But Hass stressed that the potential source of business support will evaporate if the new “commercial activities tax” is too big. Hass’ latest draft version, released Tuesday, would apply a four-tiered tax rate of between 0.25 and 0.85 percent to businesses with yearly sales in Oregon of more than $3 million. Companies in the service industry would pay the highest rate; wholesalers would pay the lowest. The different rates are intended to avoid penalizing industries that operate on smaller profit margins and to mitigate the impact of “pyramiding,” where a product is taxed several times along the supply chain. The new proposal would raise a net $1.2 billion a biennium in new state revenue when fully phased in. That’s less than half of what House Democrats hoped to raise with their version released in early May. Hass stressed that the new version isn’t the compromise proposal with the House Democrats. But, he added, businesses that support his effort are unlikely to back tax rates higher than the ones he has proposed. “We’re already pushing things, with rates at this level,” he said. Even if House and Senate Democrats can reach agreement on a proposed tax structure, they are likely to face fierce resistance from the bulk of Oregon’s business community. They’ll also need at least one Republican lawmaker’s vote in both houses. The biggest and most influential group, the Ore­gon Business Plan Coalition, continues to oppose any gross receipts tax this session. Instead, it is calling for state government cost reductions along with a “bridge” funding package: small, short-term tax increases to patch up the state’s 2017-19 budget. That could include increases in personal income and corporate tax rates and trimming existing tax deductions, including potentially the popular one for charitable giving. Pat McCormick, a spokesman for the coalition, said the time isn’t right for a major gross receipts tax, with not enough time left in the session to work out policy details. Even if the Legislature can pass a measure, it is likely to be referred to voters, McCormick added, and voters still are soured on the idea of gross receipts taxes after they dealt a big defeat to Measure 97 last November. A gross receipts tax “and other options for restructuring Oregon’s tax system are worthy of thoughtful consideration,” he said. But “major revisions to Oregon’s tax system should be studied this interim, with a joint committee convened for that purpose as soon as practical after the current session adjourns.” But Hass said the proposals the Legislature is weighing now are far different from Measure 97, because they’re much smaller and are designed to do less harm to the state’s economy. Business groups’ “bridge” funding idea, meanwhile, would mean “doubling down” on the state’s existing corporate tax, he added, which allows many companies to avoid paying taxes in Ore­gon at all. “You can marshal an army to protect the status quo,” Hass said.

At a news conference in Berlin, the Shenzhen-based company introduced its first line-up of three personal computer models, including a 15.6-inch screen notebook, a 2-in-1 tablet and notebook hybrid and an ultra slim, metallic 13-inch notebook. Initially, Huawei plans to target the premium-priced consumer market, competing with Lenovo, HP and Dell, which together sell more than 50 percent of all PCs. To a lesser extent, it will also go up against Apple’s high-end, but shrinking, Mac computer business. Huawei’s Matebook X is a fanless notebook with splash-proof screen and combined fingerprint sign-on and power button, priced between 1,399 and 1,699 euros ($1,570-$1,900). Its Matebook E 2-in-1 hybrid will run from 999 to 1,299 euros while the Matebook D with 15.6-inch display is priced at 799 to 999 euros, it said. Overall, PC market sales volumes dropped 8.3 percent in 2015 and a further 3.7 percent in 2016, according to research firm Gartner, which has predicted a flat outcome this year and increasing market consolidation through 2020. “From Huawei’s perspective, we see opportunities in the PC market’s decline,” Cheng Lei, senior marketing manager for the PC business, said in a phone interview of the cost-savings and design and manufacturing benefits it gets from its smartphone business. Huawei, the world’s top maker of wireless and fixed-line telecoms equipment, emerged two years ago as the world’s No. 3 smartphone maker after Samsung and Apple, displacing Lenovo, which remains focused on its computer business. Huawei’s new PCs all run seventh generation Intel microprocessors, Microsoft Windows 10 software and in-house developed software to automate data transfers between Huawei smartphones and its new computer models, Lei said. Huawei said it aimed to offer the new PCs in 12 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, and the Middle East in early June. On Monday, HP, the No.2 PC maker behind China’s Lenovo and ahead of No.3 Dell, introduced three new consumer models with mostly similar hardware specifications that boasted short-term pricing discounts and a bundle of popular third-party software. Long-term play In recent years, the big three PC makers have grabbed most of the growth and market share at the expense other, declining brands, thanks to their diversification and strong position in the commercial PC market. Lenovo and HP each hold around 20 percent while Dell has a 15 percent share globally. Business PC replacement demand remains stable, Gartner data shows, offsetting shrivelling consumer PC demand in recent years as users rely on bigger-screen smartphones and tablets and cloud data storage instead of new PCs for their basic computing needs. “If you are in a good position in the business market, you will have more opportunities to increase share,” said Gartner consumer and small business devices analyst Mikako Kitagawa. Huawei plans to keep its PC portfolio simple at first, by focusing on premium consumers while putting off any decision on a move into commercial PCs. “We are now quite confident and will try to expand in new segments in a couple of years,” Lei said. “Our investment in the PC industry is not short-term,” the Huawei executive said. “We will have a long-term investment, not only in marketing but in R&D (research and development).” But Huawei, which has a history of subsidising its entry into new product markets with profits from its network business, two months ago pledged to scale back on heavy marketing in its phone division in favor of more profitable overall growth. In March, Huawei reported flat net profits for 2016 of just over $5 billion on revenue of more than $75 billion. Huawei also must contend with a slowing smartphone market. Last year, phone shipments fell 1.6 percent, Gartner estimates, and while they are tipped for modest growth of 3.5 percent in 2017, they now count on replacements instead of new users. A year ago, Chinese smartphone rival Xiaomi offered its first laptop aimed at mid-priced consumer users, priced around $525, in one of the most competitive segments of the business. Gartner’s Kitagawa said PC-dependent firms had struggled to continue to invest as unit volumes decline and profits shrink compared with the industry levels of 10 or 15 years ago. “The new vendors already expect they aren’t going to make a lot of money,” she said. “They have a different mentality”.

Most Popular By Eric Limer May 23, 2017 Today in Shanghai, Microsoft announced its new Surface Pro. It's the fifth model of the tablet PC with laptop brains, but pointedly not the Surface Pro 5. That may seem like a slight (and slightly annoying) naming detail, but it indicates something noteworthy: Microsoft is just about done tweaking the form and format of the Surface Pro line. The Surface Pro is all grown up. From the outside, the new Surface Pro looks almost identical to its Pro 4 forebear. It's got the same display (12.3-inch, 2736 x 1824 pixels), the same thickness and weight (8.5mm and a little over a pound and a half).The one notable change is a new kickstand, which now extends to an extra deep 165 degrees, compared to the maximum 150 on the Pro 4. Other than that, you'd be forgiven for confusing the two at a glance. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below And that's because the updates are on the inside. The latest Pro comes with a choice of Intel's latest 7th generation chips which, on top of additional computing horsepower, offer efficiency that helps give the new Pro an estimated 13.5 hours of battery life, up from 9 hours on the Pro 4. Real-life use tends to burn out any gadget faster than its stated battery life by a few hours, but it seems there's a good chance the latest Pro might actually get you through the working day on a single charge. Surface Pro 2 Vernon Chan/CC BY 2.0, This sort of incremental, internal updating is a common endgame for a good gadget that has found its form-factor footing, and the Surface Pro took a rough road to get here. The first Pro, launched in 2012, was a 2-pound, half-inch thick monster of a slate, with a tiny 10-inch screen, miniature keyboard, and single-position kickstand that made it all but impossible to use like an actual laptop. Most Popular It wasn't until the Surface Pro 3 that the gadget widened (and thinned), got a much-improved kickstand, and started throwing its weight at replacing the Macbook Air instead of being a weird tiny-tablet PC. From there, it's mostly been a matter of refinement, with other variations of the Surface tablet line mostly dying out along the way, from the ill-fated Surface RT with its gimped version of Windows 8, to the Surface Mini tablet rumored to have been axed only shortly before its release. The result is a unique and useful bit of tech, enough like a laptop to take over for one, and with tablet tricks to sweeten the deal. Related Story GIF Surprisingly Sophisticated Science of Keyboards While the Surface Pro itself may mostly be set in stone, there's still room for upgrades for its optional accessories. The Type Cover—Microsoft's impressively thin-yet-still-comfortable keyboard—has been updated with some minor refinements as well as the soft, felt-like covering Microsoft is using on its new Surface Laptop. The new Pro also debuts with a new version of the Surface Pen, which can now detect and support degrees of tilt, an extra layer of control that can be used for shading and similar, subtle detailing in apps that support it. On top of that, the pen's sensitivity has quadrupled from 1024 levels of pressure detection to 4096. But at its core, it seems the Surface Pro will be remaining mostly the same from here on out, and that's good news. Because after a patchy five years of finding its legs, the Surface Pro is finally fantastic.

Since last year, the Internet has been clamouring for a replacement that never came. Instead of releasing a completely new product for the Surface Pro line, Microsoft has another thing in mind. Last May 23, Microsoft unveiled the much awaited update for the Surface Pro 4. Everyone was surprised to learn that instead of introducing a new product to the market, the company has decided to re-launch the older model but with a few internal upgrades. More powerful than the iPad Pro Since the very beginning, there has been that unspoken rivalry between Apple and Microsoft. When Microsoft released the Surface Pro line, Apple retaliated with the iPad Pro. Since then, the two companies have been fighting back and forth. One of them even releasing an ad that ridicules the other’s product. According to Microsoft, the new Surface Pro 4 is more powerful and efficient that ever before. The company claims that the updated tablet is more than twice as fast as the Surface Pro 3. In comparison to the iPad Pro, the new Surface Pro’s processor runs 1.7 times faster than the former’s A9X chip. Apple iPad Pro (via apple.com) More to increased processing power, Microsoft also managed to improve the tablet’s battery life. Now, users can enjoy up to 13.5 hours of continuous use on the Surface Pro 4. That is 50 percent more juice than the older model and 35 percent more compared to the iPad Pro. More processor and memory options The one thing that most Surface Pro users loved about the tablet is the fact that it can be tailored based on their liking. For entry-level users, there is a corresponding range of specifications to suite one’s needs. Starting with the m3 Intel chip and a 4GB RAM, a buyer can opt for this cheaper but capable setup. However, for those looking for more oomph factor, there is an option for an i7 processor and as much as 16GB of RAM. Storage size starts at 128GB and can go as far as 1TB. More inputs to choose from The iPad Pro relies heavily on the touch screen inputs as well as the Smart Keyboard. On the other hand, the new Surface Pro 4 has a few more tricks up its sleeve. Apart from the seemingly standard keyboard, touch screen, and pen inputs, users can also use either a mouse or the new Surface Dial. For those who are new to this, the Surface Dial is a very handy tool, especially for digital artists. It can be used in various applications ranging from selecting pen input styles to colors and sizes. Surface Dial, Surface Pen, and Surface Pro 4 (via microsoft.com) In addition to the Surface Dial, Surface Pro 4 owners can also connect a wireless mouse to the tablet for that complete mobile office feel. The Surface Pen also received a few handy upgrades from Microsoft. Now, it is made to be more precise with its 4096 pressure points, new tilt functionality, and an impressive 21-microsecond latency. Easily connect third-party products It is not a secret that Apple is quite picky when it comes to third-party products. Almost all of its products feature proprietary connectors and none of those industry standard ports like the microSD slot. Most newer iPads, including the current iPad Pro, has the Lightning port connector that serves as a charging port and data port. Apart from that, the only other connector it has is the 3.5mm headphone jack for audio. On the other hand, the Surface Pro 4 has a few more industry standard ports for its users. The tablet has a microSD slot, a USB 3.0 port, a Mini DisplayPort, and the run-of-the-mill 3.5mm headphone jack. Users will be able to easily add extra storage space to the tablet just by inserting a microSD to the slot. And for anyone who like carrying around cheap external hard drives, the USB 3.0 is more than capable of supporting fast data transfer. Surface Pro 4 (via microsoft.com) Lighter and quieter than the previous model Microsoft not only upgraded the internal hardware for the Surface Pro 4 but is also made it quieter and lighter. The same 12.3-inch form factor is now only 1.7 pounds. Also, Microsoft managed to forgo with fans so it runs quieter than ever. The only ugly bit As one would put it, it is not all rainbows and unicorns for the Surface Pro 4. It should be noted that for anyone looking for a Thunderbolt 3.0 connectivity will be disappointed to know that it still does not have one. Instead, the tablet still uses the same USB 3.0 interface as the with original model. Fortunately, it still runs on a full-fledged Windows 10 OS instead of the new Windows 10 S version. New Surface Pro 4 is cheaper than ever Finally, another thing that Surface Pro fans will be happy about is the fact that Microsoft has introduced further price reductions to the Surface Pro 4. Originally, the tablet starts at $899. Now, the new Surface Pro 4 can be had for only $799. This is quiet a good steal since the iPad Pro with the same storage will cost $100 more. A beefed-up Surface Pro 4 will set anyone back a hefty $2,699. On the positive note, this setup includes an Intel i7 chip, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of flash storage. According to the recently concluded Microsoft event in China, the Surface Pro 4 will be released starting June 15. The Surface Pen will be available in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the LTE version of the new tablet will arrive in store shelves later this year. For more updates on the Surface Pro 4, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

On one slide, the company claims that the Matebook X is ‘thinner but even more powerful’ than Apple’s MacBook – a comparison which may or may not be accurate … NordVPN Huawei also says that it is ‘pushing the edge of thinness’ as it draws comparison with Apple’s offerings, noting that the Matebook is 12.5mm thick against 13.1mm for the 12-inch MacBook and 14.9mm for the latest 13-inch MacBook Pro. The company additionally claims that its 4.4mm bezels are the slimmest offered on any notebook, making it the world’s smallest 13-inch notebook. However, the power comparisons are already coming under fire. Steve Troughton-Smith has suggested that the ‘Core i5’ chip is merely Intel rebranding its Core-M processors. While the Huawei chip is a later one, and presumably more powerful, an updated 12-inch MacBook would, he argues, use the same chip. I get the feeling Huawei’s ‘Core i5’ is Intel’s rebrand of the Core-M processors (as in the Retina MacBook). Misleading comparisons incoming — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) May 23, 2017 There is, though, some confusion and disagreement on the issue, with Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 also being dragged into the debate. @stroughtonsmith Pro 4's i5 had a fan.

Yeah, Microsoft has dropped the numbering scheme from its line up, with the Surface Pro 4 being the last of the numbered Surface Pro products, from now on they'll just be 'Surface Pro'.     The next-gen hybrid laptop/tablet has some pretty significant internal changes, with "about 800 new custom parts in the new Pro" says Microsoft Surface boss Panos Panay. Microsoft taps Intel's latest Kaby Lake family of processors for the new Surface Pro units, with fanless versions of the Core m3 and Core i5 processors.     Up To 13.5 Hours Battery Life   Because Microsoft makes not just the Surface Pro, but the operating system in Windows 10, it can do hardware and software level tweaks for Surface Pro. This gives Microsoft a very Apple-like future as they continue evolving Surface into something that has not only caught up, but far exceeded what Apple has in the laptop/tablet markets. Because of these tweaks, Microsoft is claiming the new Surface Pro has up to 50% longer battery life than the Surface Pro 4.   Microsoft says that the new Surface Pro will have up to 13.5 hours of battery life, which is impressive.     Core m3/Core i5/Core i7   The Core m3 version of the Surface Pro will be the lowest end SKU, with it being a fanless model, as is the Core i5 version. Microsoft will have the higher-end Core i7 version with a fan, but I'm sure it won't be too loud. Surface boss Panos Panay explained: "This isn't just a processor change. We did take Kaby Lake, it's the latest generation, of course. But it's the integrated SSD on the motherboard. It's the fundamental architecture changes that we do in Windows and Surface. It brings 13.5 hours of battery. It's lighter than the previous generation product, and it's more powerful with no fan".     Connectivity   The new Surface Pro doesn't include USB-C connectivity, with the same USB and mini DisplayPort outputs that Surface Pro 4 had. But in reality, not many devices have moved to USB-C yet. Most of the consumers and enterprise Surface Pro owners don't need USB-C just yet, and I'm sure Microsoft knows that. Future versions of Surface Pro, once the market is more flooded with USB-C products, I think we'll see a shrinking in size of the new Surface Pro with less outputs and maybe a large dongle with a plethora of outputs on it - an optional accessory, of course.     First Surface With LTE   Microsoft is, for the first time on a Surface Pro device, offering a model with LTE connectivity. The LTE-capable Surface Pro will take micro SIM and eSIM, and will be "slightly more expensive" than non-LTE models. We don't know what processor is powering the new Surface Pro, but I can guess that the new Surface Pro rocks Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 835 processor. This is something I revealed from a party invitation from Qualcomm and Microsoft for Computex, where I said they are going to "take over the world".     Improved Sleep = Longer Battery Life   Microsoft has fixed one of the bigger issues it had on Surface Pro 4 and its predecessors, with improvements to the sleep side of the new Surface Pro. This provides it with the ability to manage sleep better when you open and close the device.   The design is very similar to the previous models, with the new Surface Pro being lighter - but The Verge said it "largely looks and feels like the Surface Pro 4".     New Hinge   Microsoft has made a new hinge for Surface Pro, which uses the same 165-degree angle that Surface Studio has, which allows the new Surface Pro to lay nearly flat. If you push the hinge too far, it won't snap now - with Microsoft confident that you won't break the hinge if you push down too hard.     Another similiarity to the larger Surface Studio desktop PC is that the new Surface Pro works with the Surface Dial. Microsoft built Dial compatibility into the Surface Pro display, so you can use it on top of the display with software like Sketchable.     New Surface Pen   There's also a new Surface Pen launching alongside the new Surface Pro, which is available for $99. It'll work on exciting Surface devices, but Microsoft has limited its new tilt functionality to the Surface Pro, at least for now. Tilt will provide content creators with the system being able to detect the angle of a pen, which provides them with better accuracy and shading for inking. Microsoft has said that Wacom tablet owners have wanted this feature for a while, and Microsoft is providing the goods with the new Surface and Pen products.     Microsoft has made some other changes to the Surface Pen, increasing the pressure sensitivity to 4096, as well as a reduction in the activation force. The new Surface Pen is now feels less laggy, with increased response time on the new Surface Pro. The new Pen reportedly even feels more "refined" to The Verge, with Microsoft removing the clip at the top of the Pen. Panay added: "Right when you put the pen down, depending on how far you push, it's like a ballpoint pen at this point".     New Keyboards   We also have some new keyboards for the Surface Pro in platinum, burgundy, and cobalt blue.     The new Surface Pro Type Covers have the Alcantara fabric feel, and are available for $159, for $129 you can get the new regular black Type Cover.   NEWS SOURCES:Theverge.com >> NEXT STORY: Qualcomm Snapdagon 835 powers LTE-capable Surface Pro << PREVIOUS STORY: R.I.P.

I think Microsoft has been working with Qualcomm and getting their Snapdragon 835 processor inside of a new portable Surface Pro with LTE capabilities. It would be the big change Qualcomm and Microsoft are teasing for Computex 2017, that's for sure.     We broke the story of Qualcomm and Microsoft taking over the world at Computex, where they tease that they will celebrate the growing ecosystem that will "bring an out-of-this-world mobile PC experience to the masses".   Patrick Moorhead writes over at at Forbes that Microsoft went with a Qualcomm LTE chip for the new Surface Pro, and that the new Surface Pro with LTE will have an Intel CPU, and not the Snapdragon 835.

India obsessions our picks latest popular like us on facebook follow us on twitter about us Atlas quartz index quartz app quartz quartz India quartz Africa Change your edition back to menu STRIKING GOLD A new smart bangle is designed to prevent pregnant women from dying in rural south Asia Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Life as Laboratory 6 hours ago Quartz india Health first. (Grameen Intel Social Business Ltd.) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Life as Laboratory 6 hours ago Quartz india Globally, 830 women die from pregnancy- or childbirth-related complications every day. Nearly all of these deaths occur in developing countries. For instance, only nine mothers died for every 100,000 babies born in the UK in 2015 but in Bangladesh, there were 176 maternal deaths per 100,000 children. The issue is especially pressing in rural parts of developing countries plagued by poverty and inadequate or inaccessible health care services, where good health choices are often thwarted by deep-seated cultural practices like belief in witchcraft or husbands and in-laws with decision-making power, according to USAID and the Population Council. A Bangladesh-based tech company believes it has an answer: a smart bangle, made of water-resistant, highly durable plastic in order to withstand the rigor of rural life, developed by Grameen Intel Social Business Limited to improve maternal wellness and prenatal care, Disguised as an ornate piece of jewelry to blend in with other bangles, the COEL (short for “carbon monoxide exposure limiter”) is a smart wristband with a built-in speaker that educates women by playing a set of 80 pre-recorded pregnancy-related messages over the course of the pregnancy. It plays two messages per week, giving women tips about when and what to eat, and providing reminders to visit the doctor. The bangle comes with a built-in battery with a 10-month lifespan—enough to last through a complete pregnancy term. After that, it can be recharged and reused. The product will first be sold in Bangladesh and India, and then launched in Nepal. As its name suggests, the COEL bangle also has sensors to detect and alert pregnant women if they’re exposed to unhealthy levels of carbon monoxide, which can result from “daily activities like cooking which often involves burning wood, charcoal, or animal dung,” Grameen writes on its website. Carbon monoxide exposure during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk for stillbirths and birth defects. The bangle may offer immediate respite but it doesn’t help women—compelled to work and cook in harmful conditions—to earn money or feed their families every day. “If the product tells me the area I am in has high levels of carbon monoxide and that I should leave the kitchen, the food still needs to be cooked,” says Matthew Bunyi, with the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, South Asia. “The more realistic and actionable information might be to make a small chimney or cook outdoors.” In addition, says Bunyi, every pregnant woman is going to have different needs—something the bangle, with its prepared advice, won’t understand. “If I need to have more protein this month,” he says, “does the device tell me which items have protein and where I can get them?” And even with the advice that the COEL bangle can offer, pregnant mothers simply may not have enough money to purchase better foods, pay for medical services, or take off work during pregnancy. “There could be problems of access; clinics or midwives are simply too far,” Bunyi says. “Other dynamics like distrust of government could also deter people from going to clinics.” Taking charge Grameen says its COEL bangle is primarily meant to give women in patriarchal societies of south Asia more autonomy. In India, for example, most women have to borrow phones from their male family members; less than 46% of women own and use their own mobile phone. Among those who do, over 81% have never accessed the internet on their phones. That, says Grameen’s chief operating officer Pavel Hoq, is why the company went with a standalone wearable, and not just another mobile app. “We realized a wearable device solely for women, something she would likely wear all the time, would be better to connect with women in rural areas,” Hoq told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. COEL does not need to be paired with a smartphone, nor does it need an internet connection to function. However, the maternity band, at $12-15, is not cheap. Bunyi says the average farmer in Bangladesh earns something like $3.75-5 a day—i.e, when they have work. “Many farmers often go through periods without any work,” Bunyi says, and “the price point (for COEL) appears to be high relative to how much they earn.” It’s not clear that rural Bangladeshi women would be able to afford it without government subsidies or some sort of installation payment plan. Grameen Intel did not immediately respond to Quartz’s request for comment on pricing options. Moreover, as long as the husband is the only breadwinner in the family, it will still be up to the man to get the device for the woman in the first place—a truth even Grameen couldn’t ignore in its ad campaign.

Its stock from budget machines to expensive Alienware units, especially when it comes to 7th generation Intel hardware, is set at the best prices of the year.  Most of Dell's laptops with 2017 specs are hitting all-time lows, like the Dell Inspiron 7567 gaming laptop with a GTX 1050 video card. Just today it dropped to $686 at Dell Home, making a new low by $49 and a very reasonable price point for a gaming laptop that's capable of playing modern titles at decent settings. The Dell-owned Alienware brand is also on sale with the best laptop deals on the New Alienware 15 models. The base model with GTX 1050 Ti is on sale for $1,077 and the model with Radeon RX 470 can be found for $1,177.

The $799 laptop is being pegged by many members of the tech community as a killer competitor to  Apple's (AAPL)  MacBook Air, thanks to its more powerful processor and supposedly longer battery life. And while Microsoft claims to not be thinking about its cool factor, the laptop is being marketed on the website with photos of young creative types.  Intentional or not, Microsoft's chief marketing officer Chris Capossela said at the JPMorgan telecom, media and technology conference in Boston on Tuesday that the company does think about brand perception, but that being cool isn't its main focus. Capossela said a lot of consumers ask him what the company is doing to make itself cool and his answer is "nothing."  "We're never going to worry about whether we're viewed as a cool company," Capossela said at the event. "...Is Microsoft Word cool? Not at all...but man is it a cool tool."  Microsoft did, however, make direct comparisons between its Surface products and the MacBook Air at an event in New York City earlier this month. Panos Panay, the company's device chief, noted that the Surface Laptop (a slimmed down version of the Surface Pro) is 50% faster than the Air and has a longer battery life than the MacBook Pro. But Apple isn't standing still. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company is expected to update its entire MacBook line up at its Worldwide Developers Conference next month, with reports speculating that Apple might release three new models with Intel  (INTC) chips that make it perform faster than current models. The models aren't expected to look drastically different from the current MacBook lineup, instead featuring newer internal components.  The updated models come at a time when, by and large, the laptop market has slowed. Analysts expect 2017 global laptop shipments to fall about 2-4% year-over-year, according to market research firm TrendForce. The first quarter of 2017 was a bit brighter and, specifically, for Apple: Although the company sold 3.4 million laptops -- fewer than HP (HPQ) and Lenovo -- its sales increased 15.4% year-over-year, in part due to sales of the MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar that was released in November. TrendForce didn't give numbers for how Microsoft stacked up, but the company said in its most recent earnings report that sales of its Surface computers fell 26% year-over-year to $831 million.  A Microsoft Surface laptop. Amid slowing laptop sales, Microsoft has turned its focus to its other businesses, including its Azure cloud and Office 365 products, as well as other enterprise services. The company has also revised its core mission, with CEO Satya Nadella creating more of a brand focused on empowerment, Capossela explained. Nadella has revised Microsoft's mission statement to be in line with this idea, and it seems like the company has shaped its advertisements around this theme as well. The point is to have real people telling stories of how they use Microsoft, not just products that look good, he said. "I think we're doing the right thing," Capossela added. "If people love the Surface, great, but we're not studying any metrics about being cool." Microsoft's decades-long rivalry with Apple dates back almost as far as when the companies were founded. At one time, both tech giants were famous for trading insults: Former CEO Steve Jobs in 1995 remarked that Microsoft had "no taste" and was "unimaginative" with its ideas, while then-CEO Bill Gates took major credit for creating Apple's legacy Mac computer.  Microsoft seems to have bigger plans than just taking on Apple. The company also released a new version of Windows 10 as part of its Surface event in Shanghai on Tuesday, showing that the tech giant is increasing its focus on the region. The new Windows 10 is tailored for the Chinese government, which marks a resolution from an otherwise rocky relationship. China in 2014 banned Microsoft 8 from government computers due to security risks, but Microsoft's executive vice president Terry Myerson said in a blog post that the company has "earnestly" cooperated with Chinese officials to mitigate these concerns. The move comes just as Huawei released three new laptops equipped with Windows 10 on Tuesday.  Microsoft is also going after the Google Chromebook as part of its mission to regain footing in the sluggish laptop market. The new Surface Pro has several similar features to the Surface Pro 4, including a detachable keyboard and alcantara fabric, among other things. Beyond the specs, Microsoft wants the Surface Pro to become the preferred piece of hardware among educators -- a market that's currently dominated by the  Alphabet (GOOGL) unit's Google Chromebook.

This is where Microsoft may be trying to tie in its vision about empowerment, as Capossela said on Tuesday that it wants young consumers to view Microsoft products as a tool to help them from grade school to their first job. "These are the workers, CEOs and inventors of our future," Capossela explained. "It's important to have today's students using Windows, Office, Minecraft and Skype." To be sure, Microsoft has a lot of ground to cover, as more than half of U.S. primary and secondary-school students use Google applications like Gmail and Docs, while Chromebook use continues to surge just as quickly.

"While we disagree with Gen. Flynn's lawyer's interpretation of taking the Fifth," said Ranking Member Sen.

Warner said Tuesday that the committee was keeping "all options on the table."

Recent News Amazing PC Show 2017 Deals! Samsung Investigates Reported “Iris Scanner Hack” Microsoft unveils the beautiful new Surface Pro Lenovo Confirms the Moto Z2 Play Will Pack a 3,000mAh Battery The Microsoft Surface Laptop is Surprisingly, Traditional Wednesday, May 24, 2017 Gaming Personal Technology Smart Living Mobilty Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality Prosumer Reviews for 22 million Enthusiasts Forums SGCafe Advertise Search for: Home > Personal Technology > Microsoft > Microsoft unveils the beautiful new Surface Pro MicrosoftNews Microsoft unveils the beautiful new Surface Pro James Seaton May 23, 2017May 23, 2017172 Microsoft have unveiled the new Surface Pro during a press event in Shanghai on Tuesday. The Surface Pro replaces the ageing Surface Pro 4. Though it would be logical to assume it would be called the Surface Pro 5, Microsoft have removed the numeric designation and refer to it simply as the Microsoft Surface Pro.   The Surface Pro features a beautiful magnesium body that is thinner and lighter than previous models. With powerful options available, a maximum weight of 784 grams (1.73 lbs) is impressive. It’s equipped the latest Intel 7th generation processors with Core M3, i5 and i7 models available. As well as being faster, these processors will also provide battery life improvements. Microsoft claims up to 13.5 hours is possible. When you add in powerful options up to 1Tb of NVMe SSD storage, 16Gb of memory, AC WiFi and even a LTE modem option, we’re looking at a powerful, lightweight and ultra portable little system. The lower spec processor equipped models are also fanless. The PixelSense touchscreen display has been upgraded with the use of the new Surface Pen in mind. It’s a 12.3″ display with a resolution of 2736 x 1824 and a 3:2 ratio. Of course, like previous Surface models, the unit can be attached to the upgraded keyboard accessory (sold separately) and used as a notebook. Consumers can also buy the $99 Surface Pen to take notes or sketch on the screen. Another key inclusion is the single USB 3.0 Type-A port. While we appreciate its inclusion to allow us to use still standard Type-A USB devices, we think the the lack of USB Type-C seems a bit of an oversight as Type-C is definitely the connector of the future.   The Surface Pro isn’t the only goodie that was shown off in Shanghai. While the Surface Pro will find a home with all sorts of users, it is the creative professionals that Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro and the new Surface Pen. The Surface Pen features 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity, tilt support and different tips. Microsoft claims significant engineering effort has been directed at minimizing lag in order to mimic the use of a real pen/pencil. Lag is one of the key areas that creators wish to see improve as there is still some way to go to truly replicate natural writing/drawing on a digital device. As a result, creators in particular should be quite pleased with what they are seeing from the new Surface Pro. As a productivity oriented device, the Surface Pro ships with the latest Windows 10 Creators Edition. Additionally, the ubiquitous Microsoft Office has been updated with full support for the Surface Pen’s features. A new app called the Microsoft Whiteboard will be rolling out soon, which should add a further compelling creativity capability to the Surface Pro. Microsoft also introduced a new keyboard, called the Surface Pro Signature Type Cover. This keyboard is designed to mimic a genuine keyboard as much as possible, with 1.3mm of key travel and LED backlighting. It is clearly superior to virtual keyboards found on tablets. We’ve had a look at our fair share of tablets, 2 in 1’s and notebooks and will attest to the fact that nothing beats a real keyboard. Typing on a tablet, while not as bad as it once was, is sometimes an exercise in frustration. Long may the detachable keyboard remain. Microsoft claims the new keyboard has enhanced magnetic stability, which should be useful for adjustment of the screen for various viewing angles.   The Surface Pro starts at $799 USD with availability scheduled for June 15th. Singapore pricing and availability has yet to be confirmed.

"We've taken the actions we feel are appropriate right now," Burr said. "If there is not a response, we will seek additional counsel advice on how to proceed forward. At the end of that option is a contempt charge. I've said everything is on the table."

Leaders of the Senate intelligence committee, which is overseeing one of the three separate inquiries into potential ties between Trump’s campaign and Moscow, announced two new subpoenas for Flynn’s business records a day after he rejected earlier requests for documents by invoking his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. Michael Flynn may have lied to officials about his Russia ties, congressman says Read more Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner, the top Republican and Democrat on the panel, told reporters on Capitol Hill they were considering “all options” available to compel Flynn’s cooperation with their investigation. Among the possibilities, the senators acknowledged, was to hold Flynn in contempt of Congress, a criminal charge, if he continued down the path of refusing compliance. “The end of that option is a contempt charge,” Burr said. “That’s not our preference today. We would like to hear from Gen Flynn.” “We’d like to see his documents, we’d like him to tell his story because he publicly said, ‘I’ve got a story to tell’,” Burr added. “We’re allowing him that opportunity.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Warner (right) and Richard Burr speak to the media. Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA Flynn was forced to resign in February following revelations that he secretly discussed US sanctions against Russia with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US, and subsequently misled vice-president Mike Pence about the nature of their conversation. Flynn indicated in March he would share his testimony in exchange for immunity, a proposal that has been flatly rejected by both the Senate and House intelligence committees and the FBI, the three parties with ongoing investigations into Russia’s efforts to meddle in the November election with the apparent goal of boosting Trump’s candidacy. “It is not our plan today to offer immunity,” Burr said Tuesday. The investigations swirling around Donald Trump – a short guide Read more Warner added that Flynn’s two Virginia-based companies, Flynn Intel LLC, and Flynn Intel Inc, did not have a right to plead the fifth, telling reporters: “While we disagree with Gen Flynn’s lawyer’s interpretation of taking the fifth, it is even more clear that a business does not have a right to take the fifth. It is a corporation.” Other members of the Senate intelligence committee echoed the sentiment that Flynn was testing his limits by ignoring their requests. “I hope Gen Flynn decides to comply with our Intel Committee subpoena to produce business documents,” Florida senator Marco Rubio tweeted on Tuesday. “Otherwise all options should be on table.” Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) I hope Gen.Flynn decides to comply with our Intel Committee subpoena to produce business documents. Otherwise all options should be on table May 23, 2017 Burr and Warner said Tuesday that they also sent a letter to Flynn’s attorney seeking the legal rationale for his refusal to comply with their investigation. Flynn’s attorney did not immediately return a request for comment. Flynn has ignored several subpoena requests in relation to the three inquiries, even as his role in the complicated web of communications between Russia and associates of Trump has been compounded by recent reports suggesting the president urged ousted FBI director James Comey and intelligence community to back off its investigation of Flynn. Adding to Flynn’s legal woes was a letter released Monday by the top Democrat on the House oversight committee accusing him of misleading Pentagon investigators about payments he received from companies in Russia and his contacts with officials in Moscow while seeking a renewal of his top-secret security clearance last year. Flynn had already failed to disclose income from Russia amounting to tens of thousands of dollars while applying for clearance to work in the Trump White House. Intentionally misleading federal investigators is a felony charge that could result in possible jail time.

A: One useful reference is Corporate Responsibility Magazine's annual list, The 100 Best Corporate Citizens. Its rankings take into consideration a company's performance on climate change, employee relations, human rights, corporate governance, financial performance and philanthropy. The top 10 companies for 2017 are Hasbro, Intel, Microsoft, Altria, Campbell Soup, Cisco Systems, Accenture, Hormel Foods, Lockheed Martin and Ecolab. (You'll find the entire list at thecro.com.) The 2017 World's Most Ethical Companies list, via Ethisphere.com, includes names such as 3M, Aflac, Allstate, Colgate-Palmolive, Deere, Dell, Eli Lilly, Ford, GE, Kellogg, L'Oreal, Levi Strauss, LinkedIn, Marriott, MasterCard, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Royal Caribbean Cruises, Starbucks, T-Mobile, Target, UPS, USAA, Visa, Volvo, Wyndham and dozens more. Learn more about socially responsible companies at sites such as socialfunds.com, csrwire.com and ussif.org. ask the fool Being healthy and retired Q: How much might health care cost me when I'm retired? - H.E., Pleasanton, Calif. A: It will probably cost a lot. You have Medicare to look forward to, but it's not free, and even with it, you'll still have out-of-pocket expenses. According to Fidelity Investments, an average 65-year-old couple retiring this year will spend about $260,000 on health care in retirement - not counting the cost of long-term care. That's just an average, though. You might end up spending significantly more - or less - than that. Still, it's a useful reminder that health care costs can be substantial and should be factored into your retirement planning. Foolish Trivia Name that company I was founded as Sound of Music in 1966. (I took my current name in 1983.) Between 2000 and 2010, I bought Musicland Stores, Magnolia Hi-Fi, Pacific Sales, Napster and more. Today I'm a retail giant, with more than 1,500 stores in North America and more than 125,000 employees. My re-cycling program receives an average of more than 400 pounds of electronics every minute that my stores are open. I rake in close to $40 billion annually. I've gone through a rough patch and am now regaining my footing. My stores feature squads of technological heroes. Who am I? Last week's trivia answer: BASF the take Finding gold in Iron Mountain Iron Mountain's (NYSE: IRM) core business is providing storage, primarily of records, and information management services to companies and government organizations. It's also been expanding into related operations, such as data centers. The Boston-based company leads its industry, with a portfolio of more than 1,400 facilities spanning 47 countries. It has more than 220,000 customers, including about 94 percent of the Fortune 1000 companies. In 2014, the company reorganized into a real estate investment trust (REIT). REITS are required to pay out at least 90 percent of their income as dividends, and Iron Mountain recently yielded a fat 6.4 per-cent. What's wonderful about the storage business is that customers are willing to sign multiyear agreements to help keep their documents safe. Those agreements keep revenue flowing into Iron Mountain's bank account, even during economic slowdowns. Management plans to steadily increase revenue and profits between now and 2020, in part via $100 million in annual spending on acquisitions and expanding its capabilities in art storage and data-center management. Documentation management and storage is boring, but boring businesses that crank out predictable profits can be great investments. Iron Mountain shares aren't a screaming bargain right now, but they'll likely reward long-term investors.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is pleading the Fifth Amendment and refusing to cooperate with a subpoena from the Senate Intelligence Committee. USA TODAY The new subpoenas from Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the panel's top Democrat, come one day after Flynn invoked the Fifth Amendment and asserted his right against self-incrimination by rejecting the panel's demands for documents related to his contacts with Russian officials. "I've said everything is on the table,'' Burr said, referring to possible contempt proceedings. "It is not our preference today.'' Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, was fired by the White House in February after revelations he lied to administration officials about his contacts with Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, before President Trump's inauguration. Burr also said that it would not be "appropriate" for the panel to consider Flynn's previous request for immunity in exchange for his cooperation with the committee. "As valuable as Gen. Flynn may be to our counterintelligence investigation, we do not believe it is our plan today to offer him immunity,'' Burr said. Flynn's attorney did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. But in a Monday letter to the committee outlining his client's Fifth Amendment claim, attorney Robert Kelner said his client Flynn has been the "target on a near daily basis of outrageous allegations, often attributed to anonymous sources in Congress or elsewhere in the United States government, which, however fanciful on their face and unsubstantiated by evidence, feed the escalating public frenzy against him.'' As a result, the attorney said, Flynn has "more than a reasonable apprehension that any testimony he provides could be used against him.'' The new subpoenas the committee announced Tuesday seek records from Flynn's two consulting businesses – Flynn Intel LLC., and Flynn Intel Inc. The committee took action, Warner said, because business entities – unlike individuals – cannot assert a right against self-incrimination. In addition to Flynn, the Senate panel has issued subpoenas to former Trump advisers Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and Carter Page for information related to their contacts with Russian officials. The Intelligence committee has acknowledged receiving materials from Manafort, and Stone, but declined to comment on whether their submissions fully complied with the record requests. The three advisers are also prominent figures in the ongoing FBI inquiry into possible coordination between Trump associates and the Russian government. The Justice Department last week appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee that investigation after Trump's abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey. The appointment of Mueller came a day after revelations that Comey kept detailed memos of his contacts with Trump, including a February dinner in which the president allegedly pressed the then-FBI director to shut down the investigation into Flynn. Trump has denied making such a demand. Fox News reported Tuesday that Trump has hired private attorney Marc Kasowitz to deal with matters related to the special counsel's investigation. Kasowitz did not return requests for comment. Also on Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats declined to respond to another Senate panel's questions about whether Trump pressed and him and National Security Agency head Adm. Mike Rogers to publicly deny that there was evidence of collusion with Russia. The questions came after Trump's unusual requests to Coats and Rogers were first disclosed by the Washington Post. Warner said Tuesday that he will invite Coats to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee about his contacts with Trump. 2596 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 77 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rRb8li

These famous Clyde-based companies traded throughout the world and provided livelihoods for generations of local people. The history of Govan tells of a rapid growth in population, from 9,000 in the 1860s to more than 90,000 in the 1910s – a tenfold increase in just 50 years. The people who lived through the rapid growth of that once massive industry probably never anticipated how quickly it could all collapse. If the rate of growth in the industrial West of Scotland seemed remarkable in its day, it’s nothing to what parts of the world are experiencing now. For example, Shenzhen in China, which in 1955 had a population smaller than that of Govan 100 years before, has experienced a growth rate of more than 6000 per cent in just 30 years and now that one city has a population twice the size of Scotland. Fifty years ago Gordon Moore, the founder of Intel, stated that computer power would double every two years and today the pace of change in technology still shows no signs of slowing. Just as the pace of technological change has contributed to the decline of traditional jobs, it has also created many opportunities. People are now employed in roles and in industries that simply did not exist just ten years ago, and can expect to experience several career changes in their working lives. So how can we prepare our students here in Scotland for a future that we cannot predict, in a world of rapid change? Traditional education provides an essential foundation of technical knowledge, but with such a fast pace of change that is not enough. According to the World Economic Forum, the skills we need today are entrepreneurial; complex problem solving abilities, creativity, cognitive flexibility. Our young people need to learn new ways to work, and we need to support them by giving them the opportunities to shape the future. For some that will be by starting their own businesses, but for many it will be using these skills and outlook to change the way all organisations work. Let’s go back to where this article started, to the Fairfield Shipyard offices. The local community refused to let the heritage of the area die. They took over the buildings left behind from the old industries and created something new. Smart young people working in small, creative high technology businesses moved in and are reinvigorating the space that fell into decline at the end of the last century. They are located in the former drawing offices where their talented predecessors produced the blueprints for the great ships that crossed the world. It’s the start of the fourth industrial revolution, new businesses with a global outlook, taking advantage of new technologies and transforming and regenerating the area. These collaborative technology hubs are starting up all over the country. Some businesses will stay small; some will grow into the large employers of the future. All will need innovative employees in order to keep up with the modern pace of change. It’s a new way of working, and it’s working well. Fiona Godsman. CEO, Scottish Institute for Enterprise.

Let's see exactly how incremental, as we line it up next to its direct predecessor, the Surface Pro 4. Size NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW Absolutely no differences here: Microsoft's boasts of "lighter and thinner" only apply to the new keyboard covers for the Surface Pro – not the device itself. Weight Ditto for weight. Build The Surface Pro still has a magnesium (silver-colored) build. And any design differences are extremely minor. Display size Rest assured, we will eventually get to differences, but not here. Display resolution Or here. Processor There we go: The only significant upgrade in the 2017 Surface Pro is a generational move forward to Intel's 7th-gen (Kaby Lake) processors. Fanless The Core m3 model is fanless (silent) in both versions, but the new Surface Pro goes quiet with the Core i5 models as well. The i7 Surface Pro still has a fan, but Microsoft says it stays pretty quiet. (Constant fan noise was one of our few grips with the Surface Pro 4.) RAM RAM breakdowns look the same as in the Surface Pro 4, varying depending on which processor configuration you go with (with some overlap). That 4 GB of RAM looks pretty questionable for a premium 2017 productivity device. Heavy multi-taskers may want to consider ponying up $1,299 or more for an 8 GB or higher variant (or going with a rival device that's more generous in this department). Storage Storage tiers haven't changed. microSD Both have microSD card slots. USB Microsoft isn't as eager as Apple to push the world into USB-C – retaining a lone USB 3.0 port. Perhaps the company is exploiting Apple's questionable move to position the Surface as a common-sense device that works with the accessories customers already own. Camera megapixels If you use your large tablet as a camera, this is what you're working with. Bundled pen While Microsoft recently stopped bundling the Surface Pen (active stylus) with the Surface Pro 4, that model otherwise included the pen in the box. That all changes with the 2017 Surface Pro: The Pen will be a separate $100 purchase. Facial recognition Windows' Hello facial-recognition login is still around. Software Both devices will keep you updated to the latest version of Windows 10 Pro. Release The Surface Pro is up for pre-order now, with shipments starting June 15. Starting price These prices reflect today's price drop for the Surface Pro 4. For that minor difference, anyone who cares much about performance and fan silence (or relative silence) will likely be much better off going with the new model. If you already own a Surface Pro 4, it looks like you'll be fine standing pat – with such minor upgrades.

Gen. Michael Flynn, President-elect Donald Trump's choice for National Security Advisor, walks through the lobby at Trump Tower, November 29, 2016 in New York City.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Drew Angerer Copyright Getty Images Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next The leaders of the Senate Russia investigation said Tuesday they will continue to pursue critical documents from former national security adviser Michael Flynn, issuing two additional subpoenas to a pair of businesses Flynn ran. Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the panel, told reporters they did not believe Flynn could seek Fifth Amendment protections in regard to the documents they requested, and were seeking a firm answer. The committee is leaving open the possibility to filing contempt charges against Flynn later if he refuses to comply.   Burr said Tuesday that "all options are on the table" if Flynn doesn't comply -- including possibly holding him in contempt of Congress -- but he added that was a long way off from where they are now. Warner said earlier Tuesday he doesn't believe that Flynn's decision to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights gives him blanket immunity. Another Republican on the committee -- Sen. Marco Rubio -- encouraged Flynn to comply. "I hope Gen.Flynn decides to comply with our Intel Committee subpoena to produce business documents. Otherwise all options should be on table," he tweeted. Warner said in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash at the Peterson Fiscal Summit that he respected Flynn's decision to invoke his right against self-incrimination but said they will have news later Tuesday related to what comes next. "We are still pursuing vigorously, will have more to announce later today in terms of next steps," he said. "We respect anybody's right to take the Fifth Amendment but I don't believe that a request for documents" such as calendars or visas would be granted blanket immunity would apply. On another important piece of the investigation -- the upcoming testimony of fired FBI Director James Comey -- Warner expressed confidence that his committee will get Comey's side of the story, despite the Justice Department's decision to appoint a special counsel to lead the FBI investigation. "Mr. Comey wants to tell his side of the story and I'm glad he has chosen to do that with the Senate intelligence committee," Warner said. Warner explained the importance of continuing the Senate investigation even in light of the Justice Department's decision. "There may a series of cases where we have facts about people having contacts with Russians prior to the campaign and sharing of information that may fall short of legal collusion, but still be factual that we need to report to the American people in terms of our counterintelligence investigation." Warner, a Virginia Democrat, also told Bash that if reports that Trump asked top intelligence officials to publicly deny evidence of cooperation between his campaign and Russia are true, Trump's requests would be "outrageous." He added that the new reports have now demonstrated a pattern. "Anybody who gets close to this investigation loses their job or ends up in a difficult position," he said, before listing Flynn, Comey, fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Virginia senator explained that "This is an administration who says there is no there there. They sure as heck aren't acting like there is no there there." Warner pointed to reports that Trump called Comey a "nut job" in an Oval Office meeting with top Russian officials, saying the comments were "outrageous." "I don't care where you stand on the political spectrum," Warner said. "This is just not the way an American president should act." Copyright 2017 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

The numbering system is gone, and it’s back to just Surface Pro, but the latest generation is a long way from the original Surface Pro that came out in 2013, and it’s a design that they’ve now morphed into its fifth incarnation. Clearly they are pretty happy with the form factor, since Surface Pro hasn’t had a huge change in design since the Surface Pro 3 launched with the 3:2 display. Microsoft has had a lot of success with Surface Pro, but the previous generation Surface Pro 4 launched way back in October 2015, so this new model has been anticipated for a while. Despite the Surface Pro still offering the same 12.3-inch PixelSense display as its predecessor, Microsoft says that there are over 800 new custom parts inside, and they’ve managed to use up 99% of the interior of the tablet to pack it with new cooling, battery, and performance. The Surface Pro 4, despite being launched 580 days ago on October 21st, 2015, was still the tablet to beat in this space, with a fantastic display, impressive performance, solid battery life, a great keyboard, pen support, and a brilliant design. It felt long in the tooth because it was, but what was available was still a solid system. The issue any company offering a system like this is that people know there will be a new version, it’s only a matter of when, so once Kaby Lake was launched, it would have been tough to recommend someone run out and buy a Surface Pro 4 since there had to be a new model coming soon. Well, it didn’t exactly come soon, but it’s here now, so let’s look at what’s new. Microsoft Surface Pro Processor Intel Core m3-7Y30 (2C/4T, 1.0-2.6GHz, 4MB L3, 14nm, 4.5w) Intel Core i5-7300U (2C/4T, 2.6-3.5GHz, 3MB L3, 14nm, 15w) Intel Core i7-7660U (2C/4T, 2.5-4.0GHz, 4MB L3, 14nm, 15w) Memory 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB Dual-Channel Graphics Intel Core m3-7Y30 Intel HD 615 (24 EUs, 300-900 MHz) Intel Core i5-7300U Intel HD Graphics 620 (24 EUs, 300-1100 MHz) Intel Core i7-7660U Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 (48 EUs, 64 MB eDRAM, 300-1100 MHz) Display 12.3" 2736x1824 3:2 PixelSense Samsung IGZO Display, Touch and Pen support 100% sRGB color + enhanced color, individually calibrated panels Storage 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB PCIe NVMe Networking 802.11ac, 2x2:2, 866Mpbs Max, 2.4 and 5GHz Bluetooth 4.0 Audio Stereo Speakers (front facing) Dolby Audio Premium Battery Up to 13.5 hours Video Playback Right Side USB 3.0 Mini DisplayPort Surface Connect Port (charging and docking) Left Side Headset Jack   Power Button Volume Rocker   Keyboard Connector Dimensions 292 x 201 x 8.5 mm (11.5 x 7.9 x 0.33 inches) Weight Core m3: 766 grams (1.69 lbs) Core i5/i7: 786 grams (1.73 lbs) Cameras Rear: 8.0 MP auto-focus Front: 5.0 MP auto-focus and Windows Hello support Extras Surface Pen (included) micro SD card slot TPM 2.0 Pricing $799.99 USD and up Unsurprisingly, Microsoft stepped up to Intel’s 7th generation Core processors, codenamed Kaby Lake. Kaby Lake doesn’t jump to new levels of performance, but it’s a nice step up from Skylake, and it offers a lot more power saving features as well. Just like the Surface Pro 4, Surface Pro will offer a Core m3 model, a Core i5, and a Core i7 with Iris graphics. Memory configurations are also the same, with a 4 GB base model, and up to 16 GB maximum with the Core i7, so LPDDR3 is still the name of the game here. Storage is also the same, at 128 GB up to 1 TB of PCIe SSD. This is a very incremental update for performance, but nonetheless it is very welcome. The battery life has gotten a boost as well, with Microsoft now claiming up to 13.5 hours in a charge, although that test was done with video playback, which is offloaded to fixed function hardware and takes the least energy to perform. The display is also the same 12.3-inch 2736x1825 PixelSense panel, which works out to 267 pixels per inch. Microsoft has focused a lot on display quality over the last several years, so it would be expected that this is a solid, accurate, display, but much like the Surface Studio, Microsoft is adding a wider than sRGB color mode to the new Surface Pro, with a toggle to choose between enhanced color and sRGB. We’re not yet sure if that means P3-D65, but hopefully it does. The move to 3:2 triggered a new category of devices, so it’s difficult to blame them for not changing what already worked so well. Framing the display are new speakers though, with Dolby Audio Premium, and Surface Pro has always done a nice job of blending the speaker grilles into the frame. Reading this, you may be wondering where the 800 new parts fit in, if it’s an incremental update on the CPU side, with the same display. Rest assured, there’s still a lot new to the Surface Pro. First up is cooling, and the new Surface Pro now extends the fanless capabilities to the i5 model as well, despite the U series CPU having a 15-Watt TDP. When the Surface Pro 4 launched, I was talking to one of the engineers at the launch event who showed off the new cooling, and was told at the time, it would be able to handle the entire 15-Watt passively if needed, but with another 19 months under their belt, they’ve clearly tweaked it a bit more to make the i5 fanless as well. The i7 will continue to offer a fan, despite the same TDP as the i5, but the main difference is that the i7 offers Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, which will be able to stress the system much more than the HD Graphics 620 that ships with the i5 model. The m3 gets HD Graphics 615, and with just a 4.5-Watt TDP, there’s no question it can be run fanless. Microsoft is also evolving the hinge, again. The kickstand can now tilt back all the way to 165°, compared to 150° of the Surface Pro 4, and the reason for the hinge change is undoubtedly because the Surface Pro ships with support for the Surface Dial, which launched with the Surface Studio. Support will be added for on-screen use of the Dial through firmware for existing Surface Pro 4 users, but they won’t get the “studio” mode the new hinge provides. There’s also a new pen, except it’s no longer included with the device. The new pen now offers 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity, and lower latency than the previous model, with Microsoft tagging latency at 21 ms. It also supports tilt, which is something that wasn’t available on the previous model and was something it was often compared against. I really like the last Surface Pen, with its changeable tips, and it offered great on-screen traction and feel, so I’m excited to see the new, improved model. It's no longer included, but you can buy it for $60, and the cheapest m3 model is now $100 less than when the Surface Pro 4 launched. Plus, it's available in several colors to match the new keyboards. The last generation keyboard will still work, and likely be available, but Microsoft is touting the new Signature Type Covers, which offer Alcantara fabric over the keyboards for a softer feel, and they are available in Platinum, Burgundy, and Cobalt Blue, which happens to coincide with the colors of the new pen, if you’re into matching sets. The Alcantara is covered in a polyurethane coating to provide protection from liquids and oils, so hopefully they will hold up well. The Alcantara on the Surface Ergonomic keyboard has been pretty decent so far. There’s a lot that’s new, but there’s also some things that haven’t changed at all. The I/O ports on the Surface Pro are exactly the same as the Surface Pro 4: Full-sized USB 3.0 (Type-A), microSD, Surface Connect, Headset, mini DisplayPort, and the keyboard cover connector. What’s missing is USB-C, and Microsoft seems to be taking a hard stance here about supporting a future standard. Their concerns over USB-C are that the port is too open to interpretation, with quite a few different capabilities that could or could not be available, leading to customer confusion. It’s hard to argue with that since it is 100% true, and USB-C has kind of shot itself in the foot by being too open. Some ports support power, some don’t, and some have Thunderbolt 3, and some don’t, and just today Huawei launched a new MateBook X with two USB-C ports, and it can only charge on one of them. This kind of confusion is not ideal, and USB likely needs to come up with a good solution, soon. In an apparent attempt at humor, Microsoft will be releasing a dongle which supports USB-C, for those that need it. Even though they do have reasons to question USB-C in the marketplace, and the fact that, today, you need to use adapters for most things, there’s still the main issue in that the Surface Pro ships with a mini DisplayPort video output. To hook up practically anything to mini DisplayPort, you need either a dongle, or a DisplayPort to mini DisplayPort cable, meaning you already need a dongle to use the port that’s there. They could have swapped that for a fully functional USB-C with Thunderbolt 3 and Power Delivery, and it could have handled the DisplayPort natively (with a dongle, of course, just like mini DisplayPort. If they included everything that USB-C can do, there also wouldn’t ever be the scenario where a customer buys something and it wouldn’t work in the Surface Pro. So I don’t fully buy their argument, but it’s also not invalid either. Other than the lack of USB-C, the new Surface Pro does offer everything that would have been expected in an update like this, with a new CPU, a slightly updated design, a new kickstand, and better battery life. Hopefully by dropping the number from the end of the name, it won’t take 19 months until the next refresh can occur, since if it’s just a CPU refresh, it should be able to be handled with little fanfare. The Surface Pro is available for pre-order today, and ships June 15th, which is the same day the Surface Laptop will be shipping. Availability is listed as “worldwide” as well, so those that had to wait for the Surface Pro 4 to become available in their region shouldn’t have to wait any longer.

Reply Dr. Swag - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link Yeah, otherwise the Surface looks weird. Reply carldon - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link Is it just me or do people never have to charge their laptops and use a secondary screen at the same time? Dosen't combining the power delivery port with anything else cause similar issues? Reply Brett Howse - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link If you mean USB-C, why can't you just have more than one port? A better way to look at is you've already got to have a charging port, why not make it do more? Reply Egg - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link Presumably because it costs money and complicates board routing to do so. Most of the time when you are using an external display you also want to plug in your charger, so in practice, 1 USB port gets tied up for charging. At least that's my experience. Reply Alexvrb - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link Ding ding ding. Having a single USB-C handle power in and display out is awkward. Having two USB-C ports handle everything (data, power in, power out, power delivery x watts, displayport, data, thunderbolt, whatever else you want to throw on alt mode why not) adds extra cost and complexity. Having each one handle certain things but not others leads to confusion. With that being said I'd rather they tossed a single USB-C into the mix somehow. Maybe keep the existing ports and just add a USB/TB data-and-power-output-only port. But yeah USB-C is kind of a mess. If you have a USB-C port that charges the device... and you plug in a high-output USB battery pack... which transmits power and which receives? What if I want that flipped, where's the switch for that? Reply Frenetic Pony - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link No HDR spec screen. Which was literally the only must buy thing I had on my list. My Surface Pro 3 is aging, the keyboard is starting to malfunction. I'd LOVE a new laptop. Samsung just put out a crap Surface Pro clone with an HDR screen, but apparently Microsoft can't be bothered. Why did MS's hardware division suddenly turn into crappy Apple? They charge just as much, but at least Apple tries to appear "innovative" or whatever. MS doesn't even do that anymore. What happened to the guy that made the Surface Book and etc. I want that MS back. Reply Brett Howse - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link It's probably not really HDR and right now to get HDR you need a new discreet GPU. I'd not hangup on HDR for the time being. The support isn't there in software yet either. Reply Frenetic Pony - Tuesday, May 23, 2017 - link Nope, full HDR10 spec and everything. More and more games support HDR, Youtube and Netflix support it. But not MS hardware division.

AUTOMATION DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNET TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVES INSIGHTS GOVTECH.COM FutureStructure_Grey FutureStructure Self-Driving Car Firms Form Tangled Web of Alliances For automakers, forging a partnership with a tech firm or buying a promising startup can give them an edge — or a way to hedge their bets in case in-house efforts are falling behind. by David R. Baker, San Francisco Chronicle / May 23, 2017 waymo/ontheroad (TNS) — In the fierce competition to perfect self-driving cars, almost no one wants to go it alone. Big automakers with autonomous vehicle programs have forged alliances with tech companies that, in many cases, are working on the same thing. Silicon Valley companies, which often prefer designing products to building them, have sought out dance partners with decades of manufacturing experience, even as they fight among themselves over patents and personnel. RELATEDWaymo, Lyft Partner to Bring Autonomous Vehicle Tech Into the MainstreamFederal Ruling Stalls Uber Self-Driving ResearchFlorida Bans Local Uber/Lyft Regulations The last two years have seen a frenzy of deal-making. This month alone, chipmaker Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota; BMW reported an alliance with both Intel and auto parts supplier Delphi; and the ride service Lyft teamed up with Waymo, the self-driving car division of Google’s parent company, Alphabet. For the automakers, forging a partnership with a tech firm or buying a promising startup can give them an edge — or a way to hedge their bets in case in-house efforts are falling behind. “If they perceive this will get them to where they want to be six months earlier, it may be worth it,” said Ed Hellwig, senior editor at the Edmunds.com auto information service. He also suspects it’s a way for the established car companies to show Wall Street that they’re on top of a change that could soon revolutionize their business. “They’re buying some of these companies and investing, if only to change the public perception that they’re not doing enough,” Hellwig said. See a guide to the increasingly complicated web of alliances. Waymo Google kicked off the heated race to create self-driving cars when it first showed off its bubble-shape autonomous prototype in 2010. Now the Mountain View giant has renamed its self-driving effort Waymo and is forging alliances to bring its technology to market. The most fruitful of those partnerships, so far, is with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which agreed last year to integrate Waymo’s sensors and software into specially made Chrysler Pacifica minivans. Last month, Waymo CEO John Krafcik said his company would add 500 robot Pacificas to the 100 already running tests on public roads. Waymo is also asking for volunteers in Phoenix who want to ride the Pacificas on a regular basis. In December, Honda reported that it was in talks to tap Waymo’s technology, although Honda has its own in-house autonomous driving program. And on May 14, Waymo and San Francisco ride-hailing service Lyft acknowledged their partnership, although few details have been released. Bear in mind, Waymo is locked in a bitter legal fight with Lyft’s much larger San Francisco rival, Uber, whose self-driving program was until recently led by a former Google engineer. Lyft and Uber both want to use robot taxis. Uber Uber has been particularly aggressive in its deal-making, although one of the arrangements led to the courtroom fight with Waymo. That would be Uber’s $680 million purchase in August of Otto, a self-driving truck startup founded by Anthony Levandowski, formerly of Google. (In 2013, Google took a stake in Uber, but that relationship soured some time ago.) Waymo has accused Levandowski and Uber of conspiring to steal trade secrets. Uber has denied any knowledge of the engineer’s alleged misdeeds. August turned out to be a busy month for Uber. The company agreed to sell its China operations to Chinese rival Didi Chuxing — which is also developing autonomous vehicles — in return for an 18 percent stake in Didi. And Volvo agreed to build cars capable of incorporating Uber’s self-driving technology, with the two companies devoting a combined $300 million to the effort. In January, Uber and German auto giant Daimler, the parent of Mercedes-Benz, reached an agreement for the ride service to use Daimler’s self-driving cars on its network. Lyft and GM In addition to the new partnership with Waymo, Lyft has another big ally in the self-driving race: General Motors. The Detroit automaker invested $500 million in Lyft in January 2016, citing a shared vision of on-demand autonomous vehicles. Five months later, GM placed an even bigger bet on self-driving technology, buying San Francisco startup Cruise Automation for $1 billion. Cruise has installed its autonomous technology in a fleet of electric Chevy Bolts now circling San Francisco streets on a daily basis. Ford Not to be outdone, Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields announced last year at the company’s fast-growing Silicon Valley lab that it would start making robot taxis by 2021. And in February, Ford said it would invest $1 billion for a majority stake in Argo AI, a Pittsburgh robotics company stocked with veterans of Google, Uber and Carnegie Mellon University. Ford also joined with Chinese Internet giant Baidu last year to invest a combined $150 million in Velodyne , a Morgan Hill company that makes lidar (the laser equivalent of radar) for self-driving vehicles. Velodyne then used some of that money to open a factory in San Jose. Baidu, meanwhile, is also developing autonomous vehicles. Intel and Nvidia Sensing a huge new market for their goods, chipmakers Intel and Nvidia, both of Santa Clara, have been avidly seeking out partners among the automakers. Intel agreed in March to spend a stunning $15.3 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company whose software interprets images from the cameras now embedded in many cars. And on Tuesday, Intel joined an alliance with BMW and Delphi, one of the world’s largest auto-parts suppliers, to create a self-driving platform. Delphi already has a pilot project to operate self-driving taxis in Singapore. BMW joined with automakers Daimler and Audi last year to buy digital mapping company Here for $3.1 billion. (Intel announced in January that it would acquire a 15 percent stake in Here for an undisclosed amount.) Nvidia formed a partnership with Toyota this month to develop autonomous driving systems. Nvidia already has a long-running partnership with Audi on self-driving technology and supplies chips to Tesla, which has largely avoided partnerships with its self-driving rivals. In January, Nvidia announced a joint effort with Mercedes-Benz to develop a car together in 12 months. ©2017 the San Francisco Chronicle, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.   RELATED Waymo, Lyft Partner to Bring Autonomous Vehicle Tech Into the Mainstream Federal Ruling Stalls Uber Self-Driving Research Florida Bans Local Uber/Lyft Regulations DISCUSS We invite you to discuss and comment on this article using social media.

Politics ESSENTIAL WASHINGTON Michael Flynn Donald Trump Richard Burr Dan Coats John O. Brennan Trump's budget relies on rosy forecasts and proposes deep cuts to anti-poverty programs May 23, 2017, 3:31 p.m. Here's our look at the Trump administration and the rest of Washington: President Trump wraps up his two-day visit to Israel and heads to the Vatican Palestinians are underwhelmed by Trump's visit to the West Bank Trump's first budget relies on rosy forecasts and trillions of dollars in cuts for domestic spending President condemns "evil losers" in Manchester, England, bombing All updates Congress Immigration Media Watch: On the Right North Korea Obamacare Russia Supreme Court Trump budget White House CongressRussia May 23, 2017, 2:54 p.m. Subpoenas issued for Flynn's businesses; contempt charge remains an option, senators say Lisa Mascaro (Carolyn Kaster / Associated Press) The Senate Intelligence Committee issued two subpoenas Tuesday for Michael Flynn's businesses after President Trump's former national security advisor refused to testify before the panel. Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) announced their decision as the committee continues to pursue Flynn's assistance in the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible links to Trump's campaign. Warner said the subpoenas to Flynn Intel LLC and Flynn Intel Inc. were being issued on the premise that companies cannot similarly invoke the 5th Amendment right not to testify, as the former NSA chief did.  The panel's action came at the close of an intense day of testimony on Capitol Hill as former CIA Director John Brennan appeared before the House Intelligence Committee and Dan Coats, who is Trump's director of national intelligence, appeared before a Senate panel. Coats was also being invited to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Warner said. Trump forced Flynn to resign in February over the former general's failure to disclose to White House officials the details of his interactions with Russian officials. The New York Times has since reported that the White House knew before naming Flynn to the post that he was under federal investigation for his secret lobbying for Turkey. Flynn, who often warmed up the crowds at Trump campaign rallies, has been central to the Russian probe because of his contacts with Russians during and after the presidential campaign. The committee also sent Flynn's lawyer a letter Tuesday pushing back on his reasons for not sharing documents with the committee as it pursues his testimony. Burr reiterated that while the panel preferred not to hold Flynn in contempt "everything is on the table." “That’s not our preference today," Burr told reporters. "We would like to hear from Gen. Flynn. We’d like to see his documents. We’d like him to tell his story because he publicly said I’ve got a story to tell."

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Microsoft Corporation Upgrades the Surface Pro The software giant finally updates its Surface Pro 2-in-1 hybrid computer with some straightforward hardware upgrades. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 23, 2017 at 5:16PM On May 23, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced an updated version of its relatively successful Surface Pro line of laptop/tablet hybrids. Microsoft claims improvements in performance and battery life thanks to use of new Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) seventh-generation Core processors. Microsoft also introduced a new iteration of its Surface Pen, which Microsoft says is "the fastest pen ever" and now supports a tilt functionality "for more natural shading." Image source: Microsoft. Additionally, the company said the device has a "new hinge that adjusts to 165 degrees," which should enable users to "put Surface Pro into Studio Mode, creating the optimal position to write or sketch." Finally, Microsoft says that versions of the new Surface Pro with LTE Advanced connectivity will be available "later this year." A straightforward upgrade There's nothing groundbreaking with the new Surface Pro; it appears to be a solid, albeit straightforward, enhancement of the current Surface Pro. This isn't a dig at Microsoft, though, as the tablet, laptop, and, by extension, 2-in-1 hybrids are mature product categories. What device makers need to aspire to, then, is delivering solid improvements at an annual clip so that by the time a user decides it's time to upgrade to a new computer, those incremental generational improvements add up to a substantial improvement over a three-, four-, or five-year-old system. Microsoft's Surface business needs a boost It's worth noting that last quarter, Microsoft's Surface business saw revenue decline 26% on a year-over-year basis. The company said 1% of that decline was attributable to currency fluctuations, so the apples-to-apples revenue decline was 25%. That kind of year-over-year decline isn't great. It's worth noting that the previous Surface Pro -- the Surface Pro 4 -- launched all the way back on October 26, 2015, so it's been more than a year and a half since the company last updated its Surface Pro lineup. The Surface Pro isn't the only product in Microsoft's Surface family of products; the company announced a high-end all-in-one computer, called the Surface Studio, in October of last year, and the company began selling its Surface Book (a detachable notebook) alongside the Surface Pro 4 in October of 2015. However, aside from the niche Surface Studio, both the current Surface Pro and the Surface Book (likely the two highest-volume runners in Microsoft's Surface portfolio) are dated and should benefit from upgrades. And, fortunately for Microsoft's Surface business, updates to both product lines have now been announced (though the "Surface Book" has now become the "Surface Laptop"). What investors need to watch for is a reversal in the year-over-year revenue trend that Microsoft's Surface business saw last quarter. If the year-over-year decline narrows over the next several quarters (or, more optimistically, returns to growth), then it'll be clear that Microsoft's Surface business simply suffered from a stale product line rather than a fundamental decline in demand for the product line. However, if after releasing refreshed Surface Pro and Surface Laptop products Microsoft's Surface business continues to see steep declines, that would signal a bigger structural problem for the business.

Microsoft said Tuesday that its new Windows 10 China Government Edition is ready for Chinese government agencies to use. China Customs, the city of Shanghai, and China government-controlled IT company Westone Information Technology are Microsoft’s first customers for the new software. A Microsoft spokesperson said that this is the first time Microsoft has built a custom version of Windows for China. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Microsoft's (msft) debut of a tweaked version of Windows for China highlights the headaches involved when U.S. technology companies do business in that country. For example, an upcoming Chinese cyber security bill would require foreign technology companies to share with government inspectors the underlying software code of their products. The Chinese government claims that it needs to see the software code, which is usually proprietary, in order to verify that there are no flaws that hackers can exploit. Microsoft, along with IBM (ibm) and Intel (intc), criticized the bill in December, according to the Wall Street Journal. "Sharing source code in itself can’t prove the capability to be secure and controllable," Microsoft said at the time. "It only proves there is source code.” Part of the reason the Chinese government wants to scan the source code of foreign companies stems from the high-profile government leaks by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Some of Snowden’s leaks revealed that U.S. spy agencies were covertly installing so-called back doors in U.S.-based tech products like Cisco’s networking routers and switches that allowed them to carry out cyber espionage. To address China’s concerns, Microsoft said in September that it would open a transparency center in Beijing where Chinese government officials could analyze various Microsoft products for security bugs. Terry Myerson, a Microsoft executive vice president of Windows and devices, said in a blog post that for the past two years Microsoft has “has earnestly cooperated with the Chinese government on the security review of Windows 10.” Myerson said the new China version of Windows is based on the traditional Windows 10 Enterprise Edition for business customers but with extra features tailored to suit Chinese officials. For example, Chinese government officials can use their own encryption technology in their version of Windows 10 to scramble data that they don’t want others to see. Additionally, the China version of Windows does not allow access to Microsoft’s OneDrive service, which lets people store documents and files on Microsoft-controlled data centers in what’s known as cloud-based storage. Presumably, Chinese officials want to keep all of their data locked down on their own computers to minimize the risk of that information being stored to data centers that are outside their control. For more about finance and technology, watch: Microsoft also said that PC maker Lenovo is the company’s first partner that would pre-install the Chinese version of Windows on computers sold to Chinese government officials.

It’s not the Surface Pro 5, mind you, but an incremental update of the Surface Pro 4. It comes with Intel Kaby Lake processors and other refinements that will provide a better user experience to customers. However, the new Surface Pro doesn’t have a USB Type-C port, something that’s common on almost all high-end computers now. Microsoft’s solution for that is a USB Type-C dongle. Microsoft hasn’t been quick to adopt USB Type-C in its hardware. It launched the Surface Laptop a couple of weeks back and it also doesn’t feature the port. Microsoft has said that it’s going to adopt USB Type-C when it believes that the technology is ready for its customers. Microsoft’s Surface chief Panos Panay told The Verge that the company’s interim solution to the lack of USB Type-C ports on its new devices is going to be a dongle. It’s going to release a dongle for customers who want to have this functionality on their Surface Laptop and Surface Pro. The company’s dongle will plug into the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop’s proprietary Surface connector. It will then provide USB Type-C functionality, even enabling users to charge the device with a Type-C charger. Data transfer with a USB Type-C peripheral will work as well. The company hasn’t confirmed precisely when this dongle is going to be released and how much it’s going to cost. Filed in Computers.

Yes, those are x86 CPUs. Yes, they are not super competitive in terms of performance. They will come in 4C/4T and 8C/8T variants. Expected performance per MHz of entire 8C/8T chip is close to both AMD/Intel 4C/8T. Expected Clock ~3.6GHz. Expected release date 2017Q4/2018Q1. VIA's share of x86 touched 0%, it may change a bit. While this CPU is not targeted for western market, it may be interesting due to lower price as it is for Asia market. I do follow this for quite long time. If someone has additional info, please feel free to share as it is not easy to get reliable data for Asia targeted products.     Fox2232 View Public Profile Find all posts by Fox2232     (#2) CalculuS Maha Guru     Videocard: 6950 Asus DC2U Processor: I7 920 4.1ghz 1.3v Mainboard: Asus P6T Deluxe Memory: 8GB DDR3 1600Mhz/CL8 Soundcard: Xonar DX PSU: EVGA 500W Yesterday, 22:09 | posts: 2,704 | Location: Netherlands I wonder on what socket/mobo's they work.     CalculuS View Public Profile Find all posts by CalculuS Tags via zx-e zhaoxin « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

There has been a lot of hardware, software, services, and developer related news across all three events and today Microsoft put a big bow on the month worth of news and held their first global product launch from mainland China. Microsoft's Terry Myerson and Panos Panay were the senior executives on stage in Shanghai with Terry covering the software and services side of things and then Panos doing what he does best - talking about Surface hardware. Here is a rundown of the various announcements from today: Windows 10 China Government Edition This version of Windows 10 will be based on the Enterprise edition of the operating system and is being developed through a partnership between Microsoft and CETC and this version of Windows 10 will be used by Chinese government and state-owned organizations. The initial pilot of this version of Windows 10 will be done by three government customers and includes China Customs, the City of Shanghai, and Westone Information Technology. "The China Government Edition will use these manageability features to remove features that are not needed by Chinese government employees like OneDrive, to manage all telemetry and updates, and to enable the government to use its own encryption algorithms within its computer systems." Lenovo will also preinstall Windows 10 China Government Edition on new devices for sale across China. HoloLens in China Microsoft confirmed that HoloLens will begin shipping to developers across China on 24 May 2017. This follows the announcement back in December at WinHec that the device had been submitted for government approval in China. Pre-orders for HoloLens opened up a couple of weeks ago. Project Scorpio in China Another new piece of hardware will be coming to China later this year and that is Microsoft's high performing follow on to the Xbox One - code named Project Scorpio. No details on a release date or price was shared although we might hear that information next month at the annual E3 event during the Microsoft press briefing that will unveil Project Scorpio fully to the world. According to Microsoft this is the first next generation console that will be made available to customers in China. Also included in the gaming related announcements was Forza Racing Championship, where gamers compete against each other for prizes and bragging rights, will come to Shanghai this summer. Microsoft states that Forza is a very popular franchise in China since it launched there. The final gaming related announcement was that Microsoft was partnering with NetEase to bring Minecraft to China. They are planning on two more betas in July as they move towards release later this year. Microsoft Office There are two new Office related announcements tied to the events in Shanghai today and one is directly related to the updated Surface Pen mentioned below under the new Surface Hardware news. Fast, fluid and expressive ink—The new Surface Pen’s industry-leading technology shines when you write and draw in Office apps. With the new Surface Pen, your ink reacts to your unique touch with increased pressure sensitivity of 4,096 pressure points (from 1,024), as well as new tilt functionality that adjusts the thickness and texture of your ink granularly, based on the angle of your pen. Your ink also flows even more beautifully and effortlessly when you use the new Surface Pen in Office apps, with almost zero latency between your writing and the pen. Simply pick up your Surface Pen and start writing more expressively! Then there is the new collaborative whiteboard feature: A new collaborative whiteboard experience—We showed future inking innovation coming first to the Microsoft Whiteboard app on Windows 10, such as collaborative inking, geometry recognition, table conversion and automatic table shading. Whiteboard is currently available in private preview on Surface Hub, and our vision is to bring it to more Windows 10 devices later this year (including the Surface Studio and Surface Pro, as demoed today) with exclusive capabilities for Office 365 subscribers. Surface Hardware in China This obviously was the star of the event in Shanghai and Panos Panay did not disappoint because whether he is talking about brand new Surface hardware or products that have been previously announced - his passion oozes through the entire presentation. So let's discuss Surface Studio and Surface Laptop which have both been previously announced in October 2016 and May 2017 respectively. The big news today was that each of these devices are now available for pre-order in China and will each be available/shipping on 15 June. Next up is the new Surface Pro which Panay described as the most versatile laptop that exists which is a serious departure from how the company described the first four generations of the popular 2-in-1 convertible device. What we have been used to hearing in the keynotes, product launches, and commercials was that the Surface Pro series of hardware was the tablet that could replace your laptop.  That approach is now retired in favor of the most versatile laptop and as several reports indicate, Microsoft has made this change because only 30% of users actually put the Surface Pen to use in any mode on those earlier versions of Surface. This also means the pen is also not going to be included in the Surface Pro box when the device begins shipping on 15 June. By the way, pre-orders began today and that lines up all of these shipping dates to 15 June including Surface Laptop, Surface Pro, and Surface Studio to China customers. According to Panay, the new Surface Pro - they dropped the numerical aspect of the product name with this release - has over 800 new custom parts and the thinner/lighter device uses 99% of the available space in the body. It really appears to be a solid upgrade to the line but many will consider it incremental compared to its Surface Pro 4 predecessor however, the internals have been updated to much of the latest tech. The Core m3 and i5 based devices will be fanless while the i7 will have a fan but Microsoft states it is quieter than previous versions running the i7. The new Surface pro also includes a re-designed hinge that extends to 165 degrees and allow the device to be laid almost flat in what they are calling Studio Mode and the product demo video even shows Surface Dial being used directly on the screen in this configuration. That means the new Surface Pro now has three modes - Tablet, Laptop, and Studio. While there are some subtle visual changes on the outside of the device - the real performance improvements are on the inside - so here are the general specs for the new device: -- Operating System: Windows 10 Pro -- Dimensions: 11.50 x 7.93 x 0.33 in (292.10 x 201.42 x 8.5 mm) -- Weight: m3: 1.69 lbs (766 g); i5 & i7: 1.73 lbs (786 g) -- Storage: Solid state drive (SSD) options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB -- Display: Screen: 12.3" PixelSense Display; Resolution: 2736 x 1824 (267 PPI); Aspect Ratio: 3:2;Touch: 10 point multi-touch -- Battery Life: Up to 13.5 hours video playback -- Processor: Intel 7th Gen Core m3, i5, i7 -- Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 615 (m3); Intel HD Graphics 620 (i5); Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 (i7) -- Security: TPM chip for enterprise security Enterprise-grade protection with Windows Hello face sign-in -- Memory: 4GB, 8GB, 16GB RAM -- Wireless: Wi-Fi: 802.11ac Wi-Fi wireless networking; IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n compatible; Bluetooth Wireless 4.0 technology -- Ports: Full-size USB 3.0; microSD card reader; Surface Connect; Headset jack; Mini DisplayPort; Cover port -- Camera, video, and audio: Windows Hello face sign-in camera (front-facing); 5.0MP front-facing camera with 1080p HD video; 8.0MP rear-facing autofocus camera with 1080p HD video; Stereo microphones; Stereo speakers with Dolby Audio Premium You will notice there is no USB-C port in Surface Pro but Microsoft explains the time is not right to add this port to the device however, they will provide USB-A to USB-C dongle later this year that customers can use to connect their USB-C to USB-C peripherals. There are six possible configurations/price points for the new Surface Pro: -- 128GB / Intel Core m3 / 4GB RAM - $799.00 -- 128GB / Intel Core i5 / 4GB RAM - $999.00 -- 256GB / Intel Core i5 / 8GB RAM - $1,299.00 -- 256GB / Intel Core i7 / 8GB RAM - $1,599.00 -- 512GB / Intel Core i7 / 16GB RAM - $2.199.00 -- 1TB / Intel Core i7 / 16GB RAM - $2,699.00 What catches my eye in that price list is the $500 jump to a 1TB SSD for the Intel Core i7 version and then the $600 bump to double storage and RAM on the lower end Core i7 version. Alongside the new hardware Microsoft also unveiled updates to the Signature Type Covers which will all have the Alcantara fabric on them with the protective layer to repel dirt and oils which is just like the upcoming Surface Laptop plus the Surface Pen itself has undergone one of its biggest upgrades. The new Type Covers are available in Burgundy, Cobalt Blue, and Platinum and are listed at $159.99 each. The new Surface Pen, which now has 4,096 pressure points and the capability to understand the tilt of your pen as you draw and ink, does not have a retail price listed at the Microsoft Store website nor are they available for pre-order like the new Type Covers. They will come in Burgundy, Black, Platinum, and Cobalt Blue and are compatible with all previous versions of Surface except for the original Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2.

John McCainJohn McCainRepublicans give Trump's budget the cold shoulder Overnight Defense: Trump budget gets thumbs down from hawks | UK raises threat level after Manchester attack | Paul to force vote on 0B Saudi arms deal Five takeaways from a busy day of Russia hearings MORE (R-Ariz.) says reports that President Trump asked top intelligence officials to publicly deny evidence of collusion between Russia and his 2016 campaign are “troubling.” During an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on Tuesday, McCain compared the allegations to the plot of a "lousy movie." McCain noted that Director of National Intelligence Dan CoatsDan CoatsOvernight Cybersecurity: Takeaways from today's Russia hearings | More links between 'Wanna Cry' and North Korea | Wikimedia scores win in NSA lawsuit Overnight Defense: Trump budget gets thumbs down from hawks | UK raises threat level after Manchester attack | Paul to force vote on 0B Saudi arms deal Five takeaways from a busy day of Russia hearings MORE, one of the officials Trump reportedly spoke to, is a “very straightforward individual.” Coats on Tuesday declined to comment on reports that Trump asked him and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers to publicly deny that any evidence exists of ties between Russia and his 2016 bid. “I have always believed, given the nature of my position and the information which [the president and I] share, it’s not appropriate for me to comment publicly on any of that,” he told the Senate Armed Services Committee. “I don’t feel it’s appropriate to characterize discussions and conversations with the president,” Coats added. The Washington Post on Monday reported that Trump asked Coats and Rogers in March to publicly deny that evidence exists of collusion between his election campaign and Russia. The report said that both officials refused Trump’s request as they found it inappropriate during a probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 race. McCain on Tuesday suggested two “templates” that the investigation into Russian election meddling could follow: Watergate or the Iran-Contra affair. “Get it all out, and if necessary, apologize,” McCain said, referencing former President Ronald Reagan’s contrition for the Iran-Contra affair. “Americans are very forgiving,” McCain added at the Peterson Fiscal Summit. “We don’t expect perfect people, and we’re a very forgiving nation.”  Tags Russia John McCain Dan Coats Republicans Politics national intelligence Senate   View the discussion thread.

The company had previously suggested it would not be launching a new Pro, outright denying that it has been working on a Pro 5. The reason is now clear as Microsoft has dropped the number entirely. The new Surface Pro was introduced this morning. It’s the second new Surface product to be unveiled this month, following Microsoft’s first proper laptop in the form of Surface Laptop. The company said that the new Pro is built for the fans of the Pro 4 who’ve been asking for upgraded hardware. This is what Microsoft has delivered, focusing on lifting performance to a new level through revamped internals. The available processor choices are now taken from Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake family, giving a noticeable boost to performance and efficiency. Options ranging from the low-end Core m3 all the way up to the Core i7 will be available. With the exception of the i7, all of the chips are passively cooled so there’s no noisy fan to interrupt your work. Externally, Microsoft hasn’t made any radical changes. At first glance, it’s still the same Surface that the company has been selling since 2014’s Pro 3 ushered in the current 12.3-inch form factor. The PixelSense display now features enhanced color powered by custom-built hardware which is meant to make creative work more vibrant and “captivating.” [Image by Microsoft] Improving on one of the noted shortcomings of the Surface Pro 4, the new device features a much longer battery life for extended on-the-go computing. Microsoft claims it will last 13.5 hours on a single charge, although this will vary with the processor picked and the exact software configuration. Going on the spec sheet figure, the quoted runtime is 50 percent higher than the Pro 4 and 35 percent higher than the iPad Pro. Although the basic chassis design is unchanged, Microsoft has significantly upgraded the signature Surface kickstand. It now has a 165-degree range of motion which lets the device lie almost flat against a desk, like Microsoft’s Surface Studio all-in-one PC. The company suggested the new mode will make it easier to write and draw on the device. Inking itself has also received a major upgrade. The new Surface Pen is four times as precise as the outgoing model, capable of detecting 4,096 distinct degrees of pressure. The active stylus has “almost no latency” for pixel-perfect writing, creating an experience of ink flowing that Microsoft claims is almost as good as the real thing. It allows for new subtlety in digital artwork and creates a more personal link between you and the device. Surface’s other primary accessory, the well-regarded Type Cover keyboard, has been updated too. It’s now covered in soft-touch Alcantara fabric, a material that also features on the Surface Laptop and some Type Covers for older Surface Pro products. Besides the new “natural allure and warmth” created by the Alcantara, the keyboard features an improved 1.3mm of key travel for a more accurate typing experience. [Image by Microsoft] All things considered, the new Surface Pro is a well-rounded refresh of the range. With faster processors, dramatic battery life improvements and some meaningful usability adjustments to design, typing and ink, Microsoft’s evidently attempting to affirm its now respected position as the leader in convertible products. Its blog post introducing the device slyly points out that’s its 1.7 times faster than the iPad Pro, its primary rival. “The new Surface Pro is gorgeous. The design, the clean lines and curved edges are beautiful to see and touch,” said Surface head Panos Panay. “Surface Pro continues the iconic look and feel of previous Surface Pros, but has been completely redesigned from the inside out. We’ve optimized every millimeter, with over 800 new custom parts and used 99% of the space inside the device – to give people exactly what they need to work and create anytime, anywhere.” The 2017 Surface Pro and Signature Type Cover are available to pre-order from the Microsoft Store in 25 regions worldwide starting from today. Pricing starts at $799.99 and will vary with configuration and country. Devices will begin to ship in all markets on June 15. The new Surface Pen will launch in a few weeks’ time.

Subscribe About RSS Brought to you by Transition Tech Defense Acquisition Watch Listen Attend Community acquisition States are sizing up FirstNet alternatives (Getty Images) Share Written by Colin Wood May 23, 2017 | FedScoop This story first appeared on StateScoop.  State leaders knew this decision was coming for a long time, but they probably didn’t think it would be this complicated. What began as a federal IT project to support the nation’s first responders has devolved into a turf war over who will control the radio waves. A contract awarded to AT&T in March left billions on the table from a competitor, and what recently appeared to be a straightforward plan by most states to go along with the federal government now appears less certain. Several industry sources told StateScoop they believe that a majority of states are now preparing to opt out of the plan, unsatisfied with the federal agency’s bureaucratic approach, the lack of a mission-critical voice network and a suspicion that the winning vendor’s proposal won’t align as closely with state interests as they had initially hoped. America won’t have to wait long to see if these predictions are realized. In June, the federal First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) and AT&T will present to each state a draft plan of the first nationwide wireless data network for public safety. For the first time, states will have a precise description of the next-generation technology the federal plan can offer their firefighters, police officers, paramedics and other first responders — from features to pricing. If they don’t like what AT&T offers, they can select another vendor to build a comparable system for their state and hook it up to the national network. A superficial look at the landscape today would indicate most states are not prepared to opt out. Just a handful — including New Hampshire, Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, Alabama, and Wisconsin — have issued request for proposals (RFPs) or requests for information (RFIs) to develop alternative plans. And, officially, even those states remain uncommitted — several state contacts assured StateScoop that checking out an alternative plan was mere “due diligence,” a piece of common-sense research designed to keep their options open. With several key details of AT&T’s plan still not available, no state was willing to dismiss the federal offering outright, but adoption may be spottier than people initially believed. If enough states say no to the multibillion-dollar AT&T deal, some say it could “imperil” the network’s interoperability and introduce complexity, cost, and undue cybersecurity risk. The technology that states commit to buying in the coming months could determine the the ultimate fate of the network, and who lives and dies in the next big emergency. Accelerated timeline Discussions of a network for public safety like the one FirstNet is building have been ongoing since publication of the 9/11 commission report, which highlighted the need for first responders to have dedicated access to communications towers during emergencies and easy interoperability between agencies. Sometime in June, each state or territory will receive a draft plan along with the funding level being offered. After 45 days of review by the states and then 45 days of review by FirstNet, the federal agency will return to issue final plans. Then the clock starts ticking. Governors will have 90 days to make to make their final opt-in or opt-out decision that will lock each state into a vendor for the following 25 years. States choosing to opt out will be allowed 180 days to develop a plan that meets comparable objectives to the federal AT&T plan. AT&T has the right experience and will likely do “a great job” on the deployment, said Royce Kincaid, a former executive with aerospace and defense firm Northrop Grumman. When FirstNet began holding board meetings in 2012, Kincaid was there. His firm was seeking to participate in some form, but eventually dropped out of the picture after declining to partner with AT&T. Despite an endorsement of the agency’s chosen vendor, Kincaid sympathized with the frustration coming from states — he’s been hearing about it for years, he said. “It took them almost four and a half years to award the contract,” Kincaid said. “Sure, FirstNet had to abide by the legislation and they had to get a lot of input. If it took that long in the commercial world, those people would have been fired.” Early tumult and “shenanigans” between board members gave the agency a poor reputation from the start, Kincaid said, but things have since stabilized, especially since Susan Swenson was appointed board chair in 2014. “But if I were a state,” Kincaid said, “having seen what happened in the last four and a half years, I can’t believe they couldn’t do it themselves more efficiently than a national model.” For a few billion more AT&T became the federal provider because all others were eliminated from consideration. FirstNet’s objectives-based RFP ultimately fell into the hands of lawyers and bureaucrats. A Department of Interior investigation and federal court proceeding that deemed vendor Rivada Mercury out of competitive range in March also resulted in AT&T becoming the default winner. The prize for AT&T: 20 megahertz of 700 MHz band radio spectrum to operate a public safety network. The contract stipulates that within the first five years, FirstNet will support the project with $6.5 billion in funding, with the remainder of investment coming from the vendor. AT&T committed to investing $22 billion in its FirstNet business during the course of the 25-year agreement. AT&T also committed to paying FirstNet $18 billion in cash, $16 billion of which is slated for rural connectivity improvements. The resulting deal appears to be a safe bet for public safety — a trusted name in the telecommunications industry would lend its expertise and stability to ensure a reliable network is there for fires, for terrorist attacks, for rescuing kittens from trees. But Rivada Networks founder and CEO Declan Ganley argues that any deal would seem like a great deal with nothing to compare it against. Until now, key details of Rivada Mercury’s bid remained hidden under court document redactions. These details reveal a disqualified competitor that was proposing a network with more coverage, lower cost to users, and a vastly larger cash offer to the federal government. Rivada Mercury told StateScoop its offer was to give FirstNet $29.5 billion in cash, plus $22.2 billion in in-kind services, for a total of $51.7 billion — $33.7 billion more than AT&T’s $18 billion cash offering. Rivada Mercury — a coalition of Rivada Networks, Harris Corporation, Ericsson, Nokia, Intel Security, Fujitsu Network Communications, and Black & Veatch — was noted by the court for its depth of experience in wireless communications. However, the Department of Interior determined that Rivada Mercury’s plan “lacked financial stability,” and that such a level of risk should not be tolerated for an infrastructure project of this size and importance. Ganley reckoned that someone at the department must have made a mistake. “We had the best in the industry — Gartner, outside analysts, and the credit committees of eight of the top banks on Wall Street sign off on this,” Ganley said. “Plus, it was bonded by one of the top insurance companies in the world. … The thing was financed layer by layer up to gazoo and then with a bond to bond guarantee of the execution of the contract.” The competitor was also penalized for its pricing model, which was also deemed unstable. Rivada Mercury’s proposed monthly per user fee: one cent. “We got dinged really hard for doing that,” Ganley said. “But we felt it’s our mission, our job to get the value out of the spectrum, not out of public safety. That was the whole idea of giving them the spectrum in the first place. The value of the capacity on that network is immense. We may find more gold, we may find more oil. We are not going to find any more radio spectrum. It is extraordinarily valuable.” AT&T’s pricing is not yet available — the federal agency has so far only reported its pricing will be “aggressive” and “competitive.” Strong AT&T supporters like APCO International maintain that not only was Rivada Mercury’s financial model unstable, but that any state now choosing to opt out — using any vendor — would undermine the premise of the network. FirstNet was intended, after all, to work with the consistent reliability and functionality anywhere in the country. Fragmenting the network with more than one vendor is simply not a viable option, Jeff Cohen, the group’s chief legal counsel told StateScoop. “To opt out, when we look at it from a purely public safety communications perspective, we get very nervous, because the odds are really stacked against [states] in terms of relative resources compared to FirstNet,” Cohen said. The group argues that any state opting out will face a near impossible review process, incur sustainability risk through changes of administration, introduce unnecessary cybersecurity risks, and add cost and complexity to what is already a massive and highly complex project. “There’s no safety valve if a state network fails,” Cohen said. The value of spectrum In 2012, Congress enacted the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Recovery Act, which included provisions to create FirstNet, fund it and direct the Federal Communications Commission to allocate radio spectrum that public safety could use to operate the network. The network that would fix the problems firefighters and police experienced during America’s worst terror attack would finally come to life. But somewhere along the way, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley told StateScoop, things went wrong. “FirstNet — I’m disappointed in it, really,” O’Malley said. “It was one of the cool, bipartisan things that we all came together around as mayors and as governors.” O’Malley, who serves as an unsalaried member of the Rivada Mercury board, said his problem with FirstNet’s approach is that states are being asked wait in line to pay to use something that already belongs to them. “Administrations change, but the story’s always the same,” O’Malley said. “The federal government wants to take our public safety spectrum from us, auction it off to a giant national monopoly for a one-time price and pat us on the head and tell us they’ll get to us with interoperable communications. And I don’t think governors are inclined to buy it.” Once a few states opt out and others see that meeting the federal requirements is not an insurmountable challenge, O’Malley said, even more states will follow. “If the federal government wanted to be helpful, they could have by making an appropriation,” O’Malley said. “Instead, almost 15 years later, the solution they come up with is ‘let us monetize your public safety broadband and eventually we’ll get around to building a national network.’ I wouldn’t want to take that chance if I were a governor.” Without substantial user fees to support network costs under Rivada Mercury’s proposal, an alternate means of income was proposed by the vendor in the form of yearly, monthly and real-time open market spectrum auctions similar to those found in electricity markets. States opting out of the federal plan will be required to pay a yet undetermined user access fee to access core network elements, and the law notes that revenue gained by the state can only “be used for constructing, maintaining, operating or improving the radio access network of the state.” But a spectrum auctioning system conceived through research supported by Rivada Networks would theoretically provide adequate income to support network development and beyond, particularly as a growing Internet of Things spurs demand for wireless connectivity. Additionally, the researchers claim a demand-based pricing schema that opens bidding to anyone would spur welcome competition in an innovation-barren oligopoly now found in the wireless market. Put simply by the researchers: “Network capacity goes to those willing to pay the most for it, and the price paid for capacity is set to balance supply and demand. When capacity is scarce, a high price is paid to efficiently allocate the available supply; when capacity is abundant (uncongested) there is no need to ration demand and the price is set to a nominal floor.” An analysis by consultancy NERA Economic Consulting published in March characterizes the researchers’ claim of being able to squeeze more value out of the existing spectrum market as “extremely overstated.” The report, which was cited by APCO International in a blog post, posits that if the spectrum exchange doesn’t perform as anticipated, an opt-out state would not be able to afford paying network costs for the life of its contract. The author concluded that the costs for New Hampshire, Alabama and Arizona — three states now surveying the market for alternative plans — could reach as high as $48 million, $269 million, and $524 million, respectively. A question of preemption In interviews with StateScoop, FirstNet state contacts tended to repeat the same kinds of requirements when asked what they wanted from a national public safety network. Cost, coverage, reliability, resiliency, performance, device options and cybersecurity were common considerations named. Priority and preemption — first-in-line service for first responders to ensure they always have network access — always came up as an essential feature. Arizona is among the states keeping its options open. It issued an RFP for an alternative plan last year and has received responses from three vendors, which will soon be evaluated, an official said. Rivada Mercury told StateScoop it was one of the companies seeking Arizona’s business. Tim Chung, assistant director of the Technical Services Division at the Arizona Department of Public Safety, said the reason the state is looking at other vendors now is to ensure there’s enough time to consider alternative paths when the federal plan is released. “Law enforcement, fire, and EMS communicating on one band — I think that’s going to move law enforcement and public safety into the future,” Chung said. “We have to have that.” A dedicated platform for sending photos, video, and location data to doctors, paramedics, police or helicopter pilots before they arrive on the scene will be a tremendous evolution in intelligence gathering and information sharing, he said. In Arizona, 22 federally recognized tribes, rugged and rural terrain including the Grand Canyon — which receives more than four million visitors each year — make for a unique challenge. But the entire network won’t amount to more than a collection decorative steel pylons if first responders aren’t granted immediate access to the towers when they need them most. Duane Schell, director of the Network Services Division at the North Dakota Information Technology Department, said the decision to opt in or opt out will follow a similar decision process to any other technology procurement. North Dakota is keeping an open mind until the details of AT&T’s offer are presented, he said. “Does it have public-safety grade capabilities? The big feature of that on FirstNet is talking about priority and preemption. How well does the solution they are putting forth align with the vision that FirstNet originally created, and how well does that vision align with the requirements we provided to FirstNet a year or so ago?” Schell asked. How vendors implement preemption is one of the crucial battles that will determine who wins this war. All the administrative policies surrounding contracts won’t matter a bit if the users can’t get the kind of service they want. During a large event like the Super Bowl or an NCAA Final Four game, first responders attempting to join a cell network today enter the queue alongside thousands of civilians, and sometimes that can mean not getting access when they need it, an unacceptable proposition by all accounts. Aware of how essential this feature is, both AT&T and Rivada Mercury promise a form of preemption, though the latter holds a patent on something it calls “ruthless preemption.” When a cell is full, a first responder enjoying regular preemption will become first in line to take a spot on the network when one becomes available, cutting in front of all others waiting to use the network who do not have priority access. But ruthless preemption takes things one step further. Non-priority users are moved — or booted, as a last resort — off the network to free up an immediate spot for the priority user. Rivada Mercury says no other company owns the rights to this particular technology. Both FirstNet and AT&T declined phone interviews for this article, but in comments provided by email, FirstNet chief customer officer Rich Reed noted that AT&T is providing “true priority access to police, fire and EMS personnel on all of its LTE bands.” Who will control the switch — governors or the federal agency — that gives priority access to first responders over the public during an emergency remains unclear. Precision coverage Within the past year, several sources told StateScoop that some states have no intention of perusing an alternative plan — that they don’t have the resources or desire to meet the stringent requirements and added work that opting out would entail. A South Dakota official, for instance, reported the state doesn’t think opting out is a viable option. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, territories with limited populations and resources, also reported plans to opt in. But like political candidates, vendors seeking control over the national network are vying for population numbers. An alternative vendor won’t be able to wrest control of the core network from AT&T, but stealing their customer base would certainly change things. Opt out decisions from just a few large population states would have unpredictable influence on AT&T’s plans. To entice states, the federal agency is compiling a list of features the full breadth of which will become available later this year. So far, FirstNet reports it will offer “rapid deployment,” though what this means for each state is still to be determined. It will offer access to more than 700 AT&T “deployables,” including 72 “cell on light truck” (COLT) mobile command centers that will be dedicated to use by first responders. Constant access to customer service, network generation upgrades that parallel the commercial market, and a developer and apps ecosystem will also be included in the federal offering. After governors make their decisions, the federal agency told StateScoop its coverage will include more than 99 percent of the population “expected by the end of 2017.” Dollars already slated for rural development could fill gaps in the coming years. One unique feature of Rivada Mercury’s offering is its high resolution radio propagation network design. Rivada Mercury was the only vendor to comply with the federal agency’s request for maps with shapefiles “no greater than 30 [by] 30 meters” of America’s entire landmass. Unsure if the request for this high degree of precision was necessary, the vendor followed up with the agency three times asking for more details before embarking on a gigantic technical project that no one had never completed before. It cost millions, Ganley said, and resulted in more than 12 terabytes of data — files turned over to the government delineated how 32 billion plots blanketing the U.S. would comprise Rivada Mercury’s network coverage. The high level of coverage offered by the vendor’s plan ultimately contributed to its disqualification — it was too much coverage and exposed the plan to undue risk, the Department of Interior reported. By comparison, AT&T’s design included plots that were 1 square mile in size. “It turns out, we’re the only bidder that complied with the hardest, most onerous, most technically challenging part of the RFP,” Ganley said. “And someone showed up with only having done only a tiny fraction of that and they get deemed OK. I cannot begin to tell you how galling that is.” Decision time New Jersey’s JerseyNet was as one of FirstNet’s precursors — a dedicated, interoperable communications network for public safety serving the state’s Route 21 corridor, Camden County and Atlantic City. The network showed how first responders could stay in contact across technology platforms, regardless of what was happening on commercial cell networks. The vendor isn’t important, said Eric Tysarczyk, director of the Policy and Planning Division at the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness — the only thing his state cares about is that it gets the best solution available. Like most states, New Jersey has yet to telegraph any intention of opting in or out of the federal plan. Cost is a major concern, Tysarczyk said, but it comes second to the functionality the network will offer and the ability of vendors to provide definitive answers in the coming months. “After all these years of meeting and talking about this network, if all the information isn’t solidified, that’s going to be a challenge and might be a credibility hurdle,” he said. “The way the legislation is set up, they don’t make it easy to do it on your own, and there are still some questions of how grant funds would be allocated for that, but we’re prepared to impose a high level of scrutiny to get to the best product for the state and our residents.” Kevin O’Connor, assistant to the general president at the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), said that while he anticipated FirstNet will be good for public safety, the “woefully inadequate” funding from the federal government combined with the fact that it’s purely a data network means it can’t and won’t live up to the marketing hype. “To me, FirstNet’s a lot like kissing your sister,” O’Connor said. “We recognize data is a very important component, but the simple truth is we’ve killed people because we haven’t had good mission-critical voice communication.” While his group doesn’t endorse or condemn specific vendors, O’Connor said he harbored “tremendous” reservations with the government’s selection of AT&T. “They’re a large international conglomerate. Their model is based on retail. I don’t think they will put enough emphasis into the public safety piece of it, and that causes me a lot of concern. I’ve articulated that even before the RFP was opened and we knew who all the bidders were,” he said. “Basically where we are with it is: caveat emptor.” -In this Story- FirstNet, StateScoop Related news Acquisition CIO must expand role in... by Ryan Johnston • 5 days ago Acquisition 7 vendors get FedRAMP... by Billy Mitchell • 3 weeks ago Acquisition CSRA scores $57M U.S.... by FedScoop Staff • 3 weeks ago About Sponsor RSS © 2017 Scoop News Group | All Rights Reserved Search for: The best federal IT news, delivered straight to your inbox.

(NYSE: CLDR) has seen a strong push higher since the company entered the market in late-April. The shares are pushing even higher on Tuesday following a flurry of analysts weighing in on the stock now that the quiet period has ended. For the initial public offering (IPO), Cloudera priced its shares at $15, above the original expected pricing range of $12 to $14. Since that time, the stock has surged over 30% to the current price level. The underwriters for offering were Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Allen, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank Securities, Stifel, JMP Securities and Raymond James. This company empowers organizations to become data‑driven enterprises in the newly hyperconnected world. Cloudera has developed the leading modern platform for data management, machine learning and advanced analytics. Cloudera’s pioneering hybrid open source software (HOSS) model incorporates the best of open source with its robust proprietary software to form an enterprise‑grade platform. This platform delivers an integrated suite of capabilities for data management, machine learning and advanced analytics, affording customers an agile, scalable and cost-effective solution for transforming their businesses. This company also has financial backing by Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC). It’s worth noting that Intel bought a 17% stake three years ago, and a recent purchase still makes Intel’s investment underwater, according to a May 1 article in the Wall Street Journal. It had about $261 million in sales last year, up about 57% from the prior year, but the company still lost $187 million last year, versus $203 million in the prior year. Here’s what analysts were saying about Cloudera after the quiet period: JPMorgan initiated coverage with an Overweight rating and a $24 price target. Deutsche Bank started it as a Buy with a $25 price target. Stifel started it at Buy with a $24 price target. Citigroup initiated it with a Buy rating and a $23 price target. JMP Securities was the one firm with a Market Perform rating. Shares of Cloudera were trading up over 2% at $21.43 on Tuesday, with a post-IPO trading range of $17.73 to $23.80.

It’s just the Surface Pro, or “new” Surface Pro, more “beautifully crafted” than ever, as well as significantly faster, quieter and lighter. More importantly perhaps, you get a whopping 13.5 hours of continuous battery life (in video playback, no less) advertised now, massively up from “only” 9h on the fall 2015-released Pro 4. It’s all thanks to an updated lineup of Intel processors, aka the 7th gen “Kaby Lake” family capping off at Core i7, and the SoCs somehow keep the 2017 12.3-incher nice, cool and silent with no fans in m3 and i5 configurations. Speaking of the screen, whose size is the same old, same old, Microsoft touts “enhanced color PixelSense” technology, despite not going beyond the 2736 x 1824 resolution and 267 ppi marks. Other promoted selling points include optional LTE Advanced connectivity, Windows Hello support, substantial sound improvements of sorts and a “next generation” hinge helping with both endurance and versatility. Of course, it’s the detachable keyboard that contributes greatly to making the new Surface Pro the “most versatile laptop”, and as expected, the thing looks more premium than ever, with Alcantara fabric all over. The “next-gen” Surface Pen, meanwhile, offers an incredible 4096 levels of pressure, almost no perceivable latency and tilt functionality. Accessories not included, the refreshed Microsoft Surface Pro starts at $799 on June 15 across 26 different markets, from US to UK, China, Australia, Germany, Italy and Japan.

By Sophia Tesfaye / Salon May 23, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: YouTube Screengrab Two months after he was originally scheduled to testify in an open hearing that was unexpectedly canceled by House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., former CIA Director John Brennan testified before the committee that he had concerns about possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. “I was worried by a number of the contacts that the Russians had with U.S. persons,” Brennan testified on Tuesday. Pressed by Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who has served as acting chair of the Intel Committee since Nunes had to recuse himself in April, Brennan publicly acknowledged for the first time ever that he left office in January with “unresolved questions” about whether Russia had been successful in getting Trump campaign officials to act on its behalf “either in a witting or unwitting fashion.” I encountered and am aware of information and intelligence that revealed contacts and interactions between Russian officials and U.S. persons involved in the Trump campaign that I was concerned about because of known Russian efforts to suborn such individuals, and it raised questions in my mind about, again, whether or not the Russians were able to gain the cooperation of those individuals. Brennan declined to identify any specific Trump campaign officials who had contact with Russian officials, saying that the information was classified and had been provided to the committee on a classified basis. He added: “I don’t know whether such collusion existed . . . But I know there was a sufficient basis of information and intelligence that required further investigation by the bureau to determine whether or not U.S. persons were actively conspiring and colluding with Russian officials.” “Therefore,” Brennan said, “I felt as though the FBI investigation was certainly well founded and needed to look into these issues.” Trump has repeatedly insisted that there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia. But Brennan testified on Tuesday that the Kremlin “brazenly interfered” in last year’s presidential election and “they clearly had a more favorable view of Trump.” He said he became aware of Russia’s activities last summer. The former CIA director’s testimony comes one day after The Washington Post reported that Trump had pressured his director of national intelligence and his chief of the National Security Agency to push back against the FBI’s ongoing Russia investigation.   Sophia Tesfaye is the Deputy Politics Editor at Salon.         Share on Facebook Share         Share on Twitter Tweet Report typos and corrections to [email protected] '.         Comments Sign Up!

The Linux Kernel 4.10.y was not a long term support release, so the time for it to be superseded was always on the horizon, much to the joy, but also fear, of many. Many users found the 4.10.y kernel to fix numerous bugs for them, but as anyone experienced in using a GNU/Linux operating system knows, with new Kernel updates can also come breakage, sometimes catastrophic; such as when Linux creator Linus Torvalds lost his marbles about code in the 4.8 stable kernel, that was NOT so stable at all. Nonetheless, I am personally of the belief that it’s always better to upgrade your kernel when you see new updates are available for it, as more often than not the benefits outweigh the negatives; I’m also very security oriented and would prefer to keep my system updated especially when I see updates to security aspects and filesystems. Another example which is useful for me to know personally with the initial 4.11 release, having multiple servers in production environments using the EXT4 filesystem, are the following changes, taken directly from the Linux Kernel archive sent to Linus Torvalds, “For this cycle we add support for the shutdown ioctl, which is primarily used for testing, but which can be useful on production systems when a scratch volume is being destroyed and the data on it doesn't need to be saved. This found (and we fixed) a number of bugs with ext4's recovery to corrupted file system --- the bugs increased the amount of data that could be potentially lost, and in the case of the inline data feature, could cause the kernel to BUG. Also included are a number of other bug fixes, including in ext4's fscrypt, DAX, inline data support.” Today, I logged into my laptop to find that there was an update to Linux 4.11.2-1, which came with more bug fixes and is now considered the latest stable version of the kernel. However, according to the Linux Kernel GIT repository Linus posted the Linux Kernel 4.12-rc2 files 37 hours ago at the time of writing this article, for those who with to test the release candidate for the next major kernel update. Now granted, release candidates are not stable, and there will almost definitely be some issues, but hey, some people prefer absolute bleeding edge technology at the cost of stability. All major distributions should already be rolling out updates to kernel 4.11.2, and if they haven’t yet, will likely be doing so in the very near future, so keep your eyes on your updating tools, or run a command line update today and see if it pops in! A really quick and easy way to check which kernel you are using is to pop open your terminal and type: uname -a You’ll get a message of something like this: Linux myhostname 4.11.2-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon May 22 06:53:49 CEST 2017 x86_64 GNU/Linux Happy updating! Summary Article Name Linux Kernel 4.11.2-1 released Description Today, I logged into my laptop to find that there was an update to Linux 4.11.2-1, which came with more bug fixes and is now considered the latest stable version of the kernel.

Skip to content Facebook Tumblr Instagram Pinterest YouTube Snapchat People Crime News Courts & Trials Cold Cases Exclusives Crime What Happened in Manchester? 5 Things to Know About the ‘Appalling’ Concert Explosion That Killed 22 By People Staff Posted on May 23, 2017 at 11:36am EDT Share Tweet Email Twenty-two people were killed and dozens more were injured after an explosion rocked Manchester Arena in the U.K. on Monday night just as Ariana Grande was finishing a concert there. The suspected bomber was among the dead, according to police. The attendees — including many children, teens and young adults, and their accompanying parents — were sent scrambling in the blast, and eyewitnesses described to PEOPLE a scene of chaos and fear. As authorities confirm all of the details of the apparent terror attack, here are five things to know about what happened. 1. Suspected Attacker Is Lone Male: Police Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said early Tuesday that the explosion occurred around 10:33 p.m. local time Monday near the ticket office outside the arena. The attack was carried out by one suspect carrying a bomb, he said. Manchester is about a two-hour-and-15-minute train ride northwest of London. “The attacker, I can confirm, died at the arena,” Chief Hopkins said. “We believe the attacker was carrying an improvised explosive device, which he detonated, causing this atrocity.” He added, “We have been treating this as a terrorist incident and we believe, at this stage, the attack last night was conducted by one man. The priority is to establish whether he was acting alone or as part of a network.” The scene at Manchester Arena in the U.K. following a deadly explosion there on Monday night. Joel Goodman/LNP/REX/Shutterstock The exact location of the explosion had been somewhat in dispute until Manchester police confirmed it was outside the arena. British Transport Police said in the immediate aftermath that it was reported in the “foyer area,” and multiple witnesses described it as being somewhere in or near the front area of the venue. In a brief initial statement, Manchester Arena (whose representatives could not be reached for comment) said the explosion occurred “outside the venue in a public space.” In a statement Tuesday, the arena said, “Our community suffered a senseless tragedy. Our entire team’s thoughts and focus are now on supporting the people affected and their families.” A motive in the attack remained unclear Tuesday, but according to the SITE Intel Group, ISIS has claimed responsibility.

Children Are Among the 22 Killed Local authorities have not yet confirmed the identities of many of the people who died in the explosion, but a few of the victims have been named, including 8-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos, 18-year-old Georgina Callander and 26-year-old John Atkinson. “The thought that anyone could go out to a concert and not come home is heartbreaking,” the headteacher at Saffie’s school said in a statement. “Georgina was a lovely young student who was very popular with her peers and the staff and always made the most of the opportunities she had at the school,” said a school she had recently attended. One of Atkinson’s friends, Tracey Crolla, called him “an amazing young man” who was “so kind and thoughtful.” Numerous media reports have highlighted Grande’s youth-skewing appeal as an entertainer, and many of the Monday night attendees were children or young adults. Fifty-nine people were hospitalized after the attack and approximately another 60 “walking wounded” were treated but not hospitalized, according to officials with the North West Ambulance Service. Meanwhile, multiple desperate parents took to social media in search of their missing kids. “It’s the most horrible feeling ever to know that your daughter’s there,” one mom, who was still searching for her child, told CNN through tears. “You can’t find her. You don’t know if she’s dead or alive, and I don’t know how people can do this to innocent children.” Several of the injured were hospitalized in serious condition, according to authorities. 3. British Royals and Other World Leaders React “The whole nation has been shocked by the death and injury in Manchester last night of so many people, adults and children, who had just been enjoying a concert,” Queen Elizabeth said in a statement issued by Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. “I know I speak for everyone in expressing my deepest sympathy to all who have been affected by this dreadful event and especially to the families and friends of those who have died or were injured.” In his own statement, Prince Charles said, “That such a large number of people, including so many young concert-goers, lost their lives or have suffered so much in this appalling atrocity is deeply distressing and fills us with intense sadness.” And the U.K.’s prime minister, Theresa May, called Monday’s violence “an appalling terrorist attack.” “The cowardice of the attacker met the bravery of the emergency services and the people of Manchester,” she said. Speaking from Israel, during an international trip, President Donald Trump said, ““We stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom. So many young, beautiful, innocent people living and enjoying their lives, murdered by evil losers in life. I won’t call them ‘monsters’ because they would like that term.” The scene at Manchester Arena in the U.K. following a deadly explosion there on Monday night.

Ariana Grande ‘Broken’ by the Attack: ‘I Am So So Sorry’ Grande took to social media late Monday to share her devastation in the wake of the explosion. Witnesses said she had just finished her last song of the night before the explosive went off. “Broken. From the bottom of my heart, I am so so sorry,” Grande, 23, wrote on Twitter. “I don’t have words.” Many others from the music world and Hollywood celebrities expressed their condolences as well. And late-night host James Corden shared a taped video message, reacting to news of the attack. “I’m telling you, a more tight-knit group of people you will be hard pressed to find,” Corden, who was born in London, said of Manchester. “Strong, proud, caring people with community at its core. The spirit of Manchester will grow even stronger this evening. We’ll all go to bed holding out little ones even tighter this evening.” A fan is comforted as she leaves the Park Inn hotel in central Manchester on May 23, 2017, following a deadly explosoin at an Ariana Grande concert there on Monday night. Rui Vieira/AP 5. Local Residents Rally for Hope Amidst the swirl of bloodshed and confusion, as authorities tended to the dead and wounded and families searched for loved ones, the residents of Manchester began offering their support to those in need. People living near Manchester Arena used the hashtag #roomformanchester on social media to provide survivors a place to stay overnight. Others nearby were also offering rides to those struggling to get home, and taxi drivers also reportedly gave free lifts to concertgoers. A branch of the Holiday Inn hotel located near the venue took in around 60 children separated from their parents and others in need of shelter. Want to help?

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT START-UPS Blockchain group secures $107m, as bitcoin and radar interest soars by Gordon Hunt 27 minutes ago1 Share Image: beejung/Shutterstock Traditional banks’ enthusiasm to embrace blockchain shows no signs of abating as $107m was raised by R3, an organisation with significant support from the old guard. With Goldman Sachs and Banco Santander walking away from a potential deal last November, blockchain start-up R3 CEV was forced to change its funding targets, dropping from $200m down to $150m. The drastic cut saw it offer ‘just’ 60pc of the organisation, rather than the 90pc originally touted, as the blockchain company sought to navigate its way through to a good conclusion in 2017. R3 results The results are starting to pour in now, with more than two-thirds of that targeted raise reported today (23 May). Financial and technology companies led by Bank of America, SBI, HSBC, Intel and Temasek helped to raise $107m across two rounds, with the next tranche expected in the coming months. More than 40 institutions from more than 15 countries participated in the first two rounds into the start-up, a spin-off of one of the many R3 businesses in operation today. “This year, we will have pilot projects and early production phase products in the market,” said David Rutter, chief executive of R3. “We are a couple of years away until we see massively impactful products,” he told Reuters. Bitcoin boom Elsewhere, $11.4m was raised by the company behind LedgerX, which is an options exchange specialist for bitcoin. The round for Ledger Holdings was led by Miami International Holdings and Huiyin Blockchain Venture Investments. “In the short term, these investments will further our application to become a regulated exchange and clearing house for bitcoin options,” said Paul Chou, CEO of LedgerX. “In the long term, these strategic investors will help us enter additional marketplaces and territories.” On the radar Moving away from blockchain technology, Bill Gates is one of the people involved in a successful $29m series B round for Echodyne. The US start-up specialises in a radar system, with plans to replace LiDAR, which is one of the main components behind much of the autonomous vehicle research of today. Gates’s interest on this occasion comes through Vulcan Capital, a fund run by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Gates has shown particular interest here, personally investing in an earlier round. Echodyne said the funding will be used to scale the production of its radar system, Metamaterial Electronically Scanning Array (MESA). The main appeal of MESA is how it can be mounted to devices as small as tiny drones. The company claims that the radar system is stronger and more reliable than LiDAR, the latter being a system already beset with security concerns. Shipshape The other side of the Atlantic sees Shipamax, a London-based start-up fresh from Y Combinator, raising $2.5m in seed funding. Shipamax plans to use the new reserves to build and market its cloud software platform for the shipping industry. However, given the investments being made into blockchain approaches in this industry, most technological developments tend to relate back to ledgers of some kind.

Steve Russell (R-Okla.) announced Tuesday that he’s running to lead the House Oversight Committee, making him the first Republican to formally enter the race to succeed outgoing Chairman Jason ChaffetzJason ChaffetzJordan won't run for Oversight gavel Oklahoma rep. launches long-shot bid for Oversight chair Mueller reviewed Comey memos: report MORE (R-Utah). Russell is considered a long shot to win the coveted, high-profile gavel. Rep. Trey GowdyTrey GowdyOvernight Cybersecurity: Takeaways from today's Russia hearings | More links between 'Wanna Cry' and North Korea | Wikimedia scores win in NSA lawsuit Five takeaways from a busy day of Russia hearings Jordan won't run for Oversight gavel MORE (R-S.C.) is considered the front-runner for the spot, if he chooses to run. Russell, first elected to the House in 2014, is 18th in seniority on the House Oversight Committee. ADVERTISEMENT A statement from Russell’s office cited his record of getting four bills signed into law that were estimated to save $4 billion, as well as publications on what he considers wasteful government spending. “Consistent with the mission of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, his focus has been government reform,” the statement reads. Gowdy, who led the select panel that investigated the 2012 attack in Benghazi, has not formally announced whether he’ll seek the Oversight gavel.  The Hill reported last week that Gowdy has been contacting members of the House Steering Committee, which decides committee assignments, about the gavel. He’s considered a lock to win the Oversight post if he wants it. Gowdy has not yet made a decision on whether to seek the chairmanship, spokeswoman Amanda Gonzalez said Tuesday. Gowdy, a former prosecutor, proved himself to House GOP leaders after running the Benghazi panel. The committee's investigation helped uncover that Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonHannity: I won't discuss Seth Rich story for now "out of respect for the family" Clinton slams Trump's budget: 'An unimaginable level of cruelty' Trump’s crisis of legitimacy MORE was using a private email server while serving as secretary of State, which became an issue that dogged her presidential campaign in 2016. Still, if Gowdy were to become the next chairman, he'd be tasked with the potential political landmine of leading oversight of a Republican administration. He'd inherit a review established by Chaffetz of whether ousted White House national security adviser Michael Flynn improperly accepted foreign payments for a 2015 paid speech in Russia.  Chaffetz has also asked the FBI for documentation of memos written by former FBI Director James Comey alleging that President Trump pressured him to drop the agency's investigation of Flynn. The White House denies the allegations. Chaffetz invited Comey to testify at a hearing this week. That hearing has since been postponed to give the former FBI director time to consult with Robert Mueller, the special counsel now leading the agency's investigation of the Russian government's attempts to influence the 2016 election. Rep. Dennis Ross (R-Fla.) has also been reaching out to the Steering Committee, but has said he’d defer to Gowdy if he decides to run. The House Oversight Committee is stacked with members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, many of whom think Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) should be the next chairman.  But Jordan, despite being third in seniority, acknowledged he likely wouldn’t get the endorsement of the GOP leadership-allied Steering Committee. The Freedom Caucus has frequently clashed with GOP leaders since its inception in 2015, particularly after it pushed then-Speaker John BoehnerJohn BoehnerLobbying World Jordan won't run for Oversight gavel Oklahoma rep. launches long-shot bid for Oversight chair MORE (R-Ohio) to resign. A GOP aide confirmed on Tuesday that Jordan has decided not to seek the Oversight gavel. Chaffetz announced last week that he will leave Congress at the end of June.

In the run up to the reveal we were told to expect new hardware but not a Surface Pro 5, however that's wholly to do with Microsoft dropping the numerical suffix from its Surface Pro tablets. Microsoft showed off the new Surface Pro, which as its headline features sports a more flexible 165-degree hinge, up to 13.5 hour battery life, and fanless models up to the Core i5 versions (only the Core i7 models have cooling fans). There's a new and improved Surface Pen too. New to the Surface Pro range is the use of Intel's latest 7th gen Core processors. On the pre-order page Microsoft has six SKUs listed - there are models with Core m3 processors, and Core i5 and i7 processors. The Core m3 option has the lowest memory and storage spec at 4GB/128GB, you can get a Core i5 version with the same memory and storage or double up on both accounts. For the Core i7 versions 8GB/256GB forms the base line with options of double the RAM and double or quadruple the storage available too. As mentioned in the intro, only the Core-i7 chip equipped Surface Pro machines use active cooling - creating impressively low amount of unwanted noise, "an unprecedented 18dB," says Panos Panay. Central to the Surface proposition is the excellent 10-point touch screen. The new Surface Pro comes with a high-resolution 12.3-inch PixelSense Display with 2736 x 1824 pixels, 267ppi, and 3:2 aspect ratio. Panay said that Microsoft has equipped a custom silicon PixelSense Accelerator chip, to enhance colour and make profile switching a cinch. Another important enhancement to the hardware offering is in its thriftiness with power. The new Surface Pro can run for 13.5 hours between charges, a claimed 50 per cent better than the Surface Pro 4 or 35 per cent improvement on the Apple iPad Pro. This extended battery life is delivered despite the new Surface Pro being thinner and lighter than ever at 8.5mm and between 766g (m3) and 786g (i5 and i7 versions). Covering all the hardware bases, other specs include the following: Ports: Full-size USB 3.0, microSD card reader, Surface Connect, Headset jack, Mini DisplayPort, and a Cover port Volume key and power key Wi-Fi: 802.11ac Wi-Fi wireless networking, IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n compatible, Bluetooth Wireless 4.0 technology, LTE-A Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 615 (m3), Intel HD Graphics 620 (i5), Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 (i7) TPM chip Sensors: Ambient light sensor, Accelerometer, Gyroscope Cameras: Windows Hello face sign-in camera (front-facing), 5.0MP front-facing camera with 1080p HD video, 8.0MP rear-facing autofocus camera with 1080p HD video Audio: Stereo microphones, Stereo speakers with Dolby Audio Premium Size: 292.10 x 201.42 x 8.5 mm OS: Windows 10 Pro plus Office 365 30-day trial Keyboard refinements Microsoft claims to have produced the best Surface Type Covers yet for the new Surface Pro. You can immediately see that these covers use the same luxurious Alcantara material that is featured on the recently launched Surface Laptops. Colours include Platinum, Burgundy, and Cobalt Blue. The keyboards boast 1.3 mm of key travel and feature a high-quality scissor mechanism. Surface Pen enhanced The new Surface Pen is said to be Microsoft's most natural and responsive yet. It features 4096 pressure points, only 21 milliseconds of latency and new tilt functionality. Inking should seem more realistic and natural than ever with "the lowest parallax in the industry" and the improved accuracy and pressure sensitivity. The Surface Pen is being made available in Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt Blue and Black. Microsoft Whiteboard is a new program for Pen users, its meant for simultaneous collaboration and live multi-device inking across the family of Surface devices. It’s a great collaborative tool, reckons Microsoft, with its "magical experience that you have to see to believe". Availability The Surface Pro and Surface Pro Signature Type Cover are available for pre-order from today and will ship on 15th June worldwide (25 markets). Surface Pen will be available in the coming weeks. Surface Pro starts at US$799.99 / UK£799.00. There are discounts available for students and academic staff.

Posted by LSG501 - Tue 23 May 2017 18:40 From all reports I've seen the pen isn't included anymore so you can add on another £70 by the looks of it…. seriously how can you call it a surface pro if it doesn't have the one thing that makes it a pro device in the box…. Posted by qasdfdsaq - Tue 23 May 2017 22:25 Does anyone know what the actual processor model(s) on offer are? Thanks to Intel renaming their Core M's into i5's and i7's, it's impossible to tell whether they are all 4.5w CPUs or if the i5 is a 15w CPU (presumably the i7 is, or it wouldn't need a fan) Posted by excalibur1814 - Tue 23 May 2017 22:37 Imagine an article writer actually providing something over and above what they're paid to push!

The i5s and i7s are not renamed Core M, as all renamed Core M chips have the HD Graphics 615. If the pen's not included, that sucks. And still no USB-C, Microsoft? Seriously?

(AMD) Stock for More Free Profits View All Posts On its last dip in early May, I shared a trade in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) that delivered free profits in mere days. I have since booked it since I don’t want to overstay my welcome in winning trades. Today I want to reset another bullish AMD stock trade but I will only sell risk in this one without buying hopium. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Usually when a quality stock corrects as hard as AMD stock recently did, it sheds enough froth that it becomes easy to sell downside risk against support lows. But that’s not the case here. Even after falling 35% from its 52-week highs, Advanced Micro Devices is still up over 160% in the past year. So this makes it imperative that my homework be thorough enough to find the key support levels that are not so obvious. Fundamentally I cannot argue for bargains. The stock is not cheap, but markets are pricing in future value. Our world is becoming so dependent on technology that there will no doubt be room for AMD and all its competitors to thrive. Once the Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) rumors abate price should settle down. Technically AMD stock trades like a momentum stock, and when it rallies, it’s hard to find entry point. Conversely, when it falls few traders are brave enough to catch the falling knife. So many stay out, never seeing the perfect opportunity. This is where AMD options come into play. Click to Enlarge Using the options instead of trading the stock allows me to structure trades with room for error, thereby reducing the need to be surgical in entry and exit points. I also find it important to zoom out into weekly charts to eliminate the short-term noise. This allows me to better evaluate the relativity of the current price. The massive size of the AMD rally tells me that markets had it wrong at $4 per share just like they were too early for $40 in 2006. Somewhere in the middle usually lies the truth, but for what period of time? Today I will assume that equity markets are in the Trump era so for this trade purpose I will evaluate AMD’s post-election-period-to-date. Now at $11 AMD fans and hater are battling over the middle of that range. Bull and bears are in balance so going long here should not be a grave mistake. Yet instead of risking $11 per share to buy the stock at face value and without any buffer, I will employ AMD options. My thesis will be that the stock will find buyers if it hits pre-Donald-Trump-era levels. AMD Stock Trade Idea The Bet: Sell the AMD Jan 2018 $8 put for 75 cents where I have an 80% chance of success. But if AMD falls below $7.25 per share, I would accrue losses. I will not sell opposing risk to balance my trade since I have a 25% buffer. I am comfortable that I will be able to manage my risk short-term against price gyrations. Selling naked options is risky and I only do it if I am willing and able to own the shares. I could also buy cheap July sacrifice puts to guard against a disastrous earnings report.

The 2017 iteration of the boutique but highly profitable fondleslab loses the numbering – it's now just a "Surface Pro". Cosmetically there's little difference: the tablet retains the 2736 x 1824 (267 PPI) display and 786g weight (for the i5 and i7 models). However, Microsoft claims much better battery life is possible from this year's Intel processors – a 50 per cent increase over the 2015's Surface Pro 4, with 13.5 hours of video playback. We found that battery life was the Achilles Heel of the Surface Pro 4 when we reviewed it 18 months ago. Prices start at £799 for the m3 model with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and £979 or the i5 model with 4GB/128GB. An i7 Surface Pro with 256GB costs £1,549 and the full blown i7 16GB/1TB is £2,699 – all prices inclusive of VAT. There's also a new stylus and fabric-type covers. SSD has been integrated on the motherboard. The new kit is available from 15 June but, alas, the LTE versions with a SIM card slot won't be around until later in the year.

An apparent suicide bomber attacked an Ariana Grande concert as it ended Monday night, killing over a dozen people among a panicked crowd of young concertgoers, in Manchester, England. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus) comments The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing Monday night at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that left at least 22 dead.  The incident is just the latest in a string of deadly terror attacks that have occurred in Europe over the past year. Here's a look at some of the most recent terror attacks in Europe: April 2017: In Paris, a gunman with an assault rifle shot and killed a police officer on the Champs-Élysées before being shot dead on April 20.The Islamic State identified the attacker as Abu Yusuf al-Beljiki through its Amaq news agency, according to SITE Intel Group, a U.S.-based organization that monitors terrorists' activity online. In Sweden, four people were killed on April 7 when a large beer truck slammed into an upscale department store in a busy Stockholm pedestrian mall in what Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven called an apparent "terror attack." The suspect was named in court documents as Uzbekistan national Rakhmat Akilov, 39. March 2017: In London, a sole attacker killed five people, including a police officer, and injured at least 50 others in two apparent terror assaults near Britain's Parliament. Khalid Masood rammed his car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, before fatally stabbing the policeman outside Parliament. Masood, who lived in the central city of Birmingham and spent the night before the attack in Brighton, southern England, was shot dead by police on March 22. December 2016:  In Berlin, 12 people were killed and dozens injured after a truck attack on a popular street Christmas market. Anis Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker suspected of carrying out the attack, was shot dead by Italian police four days after the attack on Dec. 19. October 2016: A 16-year-old boy was stabbed multiple times in Hamburg, Germany, by an assailant that was described as Middle Eastern. He later died from his injuries. ISIS took responsibility for the attack, though German officials could not confirm the authenticity of the claims at the time, Fox News reported. July 2016:  Two men armed with knives killed an elderly priest and injured three others after seizing hostages at a Catholic church in Normandy, France. ISIS claimed responsibility. Both attackers were shot dead by French police as they attempted to leave the church. July 2016:   In Nice, France, 86 people were killed after a large truck barreled into a thick crowd of revelers watching fireworks Bastille Day. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. June 2016:  In Istanbul, Turkey, 45 people were killed and approximately 240 wounded in an attack at the Ataturk International Airport. June 2016:  A police officer and his partner were killed in a Paris suburb by Larossi Abballa, a man who was later killed by police. Abballa had pledged allegiance to ISIS. March 2016: In Brussels, Belgium, 32 people were killed and hundreds wounded in suicide bomb attacks.  Two suicide bombers blew themselves up in the airport's departure hall during a peak travel period, and an hour later, a bomb was ignited in a train at a busy metro station, killing 16 more people. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks. March 2016:  In Istanbul, Turkey, five people, including two Americans, were killed in a suicide bombing. At least thirty-six people wounded, according to the health ministry. January 2016: In Istanbul, Turkey, 12 German tourists were killed and 15 wounded in a suicide bombing.

(NASDAQ: XLNX) with a price target boosted from $66 to $71 after attending the company's Analyst Day presentation. According to Srivastava, Xilinx's event on Monday focused on the company's commitment to expand its multi-node lead over rival Altera/Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC). For instance, Xilinx previously estimated a one-year lead in its 16nm node, but now this lead appears to be over 18-months ahead of the competition. "We believe Xilinx is currently in a position that is pretty unparalleled in the history of the industry — i.e., a multi-node, or a multi-generation lead over its rival Altera," the analyst noted. Big Win With More To Come Xilinx is confident a contract with AWS could be potentially transformative for that segment in terms of opening up the machine-learning market. In fact, the analyst expects to see more contract wins with additional large hyperscale companies in the future. Srivastava added that Xilinx expects to see an incremental $750 million in revenue by 2021 through expanding its markets and gaining a bigger market share in existing markets. Finally, there were some concerning aspects of the company's presentation. Management's operating expenditure guidance implies an operating margin of 29.0 percent, which is short of the 29.6 percent the analyst was expecting. Nevertheless, the company does expect to return to a 30-percent rate after fiscal 2018, although Tuesday's notable sell-off may indicate some investor frustration with the guidance. At time of publication, shares of Xilinx were down 6.25 percent at $63.30.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Microsoft unveils new surface pro device to combat sales dip 2017-05-23 17:54 - Dina Bass, Fin24 Post a comment 0 share: The new Microsoft Surface Pro 3 tablet has a detachable keyboard and pen for writing on the screen. (Pic: File, AFP) RELATED ARTICLES Microsoft quarterly profit surges to $4.8bn Microsoft CEO receives $18m in 2016 pay Microsoft readies Windows 10 update, answers critics Seattle - Microsoft unveiled a new version of its Surface Pro tablet and laptop combination device with more powerful chips and better battery life, updating an aging product with declining sales that hurt financial results last quarter. The Redmond, Washington-based company introduced the fifth version of the Surface Pro at an event in Shanghai, the first time it’s held the launch of a major product outside the US Microsoft also announced a version of Windows 10 for use by the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises, ending a standoff over the operating system by meeting the government’s requests for increased security and data control. Surface Pro is the workhorse of the company’s computer hardware line. It’s the biggest seller among the Surface devices, a category that Microsoft created - the two-in-one, or a tablet with a removable keyboard. Yet Microsoft’s Pro 3 and 4 are aging, and partners like Lenovo and HP have come out with their own Windows-based versions, that give Microsoft software revenue but take away hardware sales. Meanwhile Apple’s take on the category, the iPad Pro, has been stealing market share.  Those factors contributed to a 26% drop in Surface sales last quarter. The new version should turn that around, said Yusuf Mehdi, who oversees marketing for devices and Windows. The device has 13.5 hours of battery life, a 50% improvement over the previous version, and runs Intel’s faster seventh generation Core chips. “We have shown it to corporate accounts already and the reaction has been very positive,” he said. “We are optimistic this will get a good start out of the gate.” The Pro will be available for pre-orders on Tuesday starting at $799 and goes on sale June 15, the same day as the Surface Laptop Microsoft announced earlier this month. The device has a new kickstand that lets it fold almost flat to resemble a drafting table, similar to the pricier Surface Studio computer, and the Pro can now be controlled on screen by the Surface Dial device that Microsoft introduced with the Studio. Custom windows Microsoft also announced customers for the Chinese government version of Windows 10, including the Chinese customs agency and the city government of Shanghai. This version of Windows 10 lets the government use its own encryption on its computers. A joint venture in China manages all the system updates and telemetry so no data leaves China, Terry Myerson, Microsoft’s Windows and Devices chief, said in an interview. The government can also remove features it doesn’t want like the OneDrive file-sharing service, or certain entertainment apps. The software is available only for government use and won’t be sold to any other Chinese customers, Microsoft said. Operating in China has been something of a minefield for US technology companies. Some are blocked, Microsoft is facing an antimonopoly investigation and in January a law took effect that requires telecommunications and internet companies operating in China to provide law enforcement with technical assistance, including decryption of sensitive user data, in any probe meant “to avert and investigate terrorist activities.”  Myerson said the custom version of Windows fully complies with the company’s values. “We are aware this could be perceived as a sensitive issue but it’s quite appropriate for a sovereign country, within its own computer system and its own employees to have its own encryption systems,” Myerson said. Long negotiations The product is the result of two years of work by the company and the Chinese government to resolve an impasse in which the government, citing security concerns, has refused to use either Windows 8 or Windows 10, blocking a key source of Chinese revenue for Microsoft. Microsoft also announced that it’s bringing its full lineup of Surface hardware to the Chinese market. Currently, it only sells the Pro models and the Surface Book laptop in the country. The company will also show a new Office app that lets a team of users create a digital whiteboard that they can all draw on simultaneously on different machines.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search Is Now a Good Time to Buy a New NVIDIA or AMD Graphics Card? By Michael Crider on May 23rd, 2017 A few years ago, people were predicting the death of PC gaming as we know it. Those people are feasting on an abundance of humble pie, as PC games remain a cornerstone of the industry: digital delivery gives us more variety than ever before, and even the relatively niche market of performance gaming hardware has never been more healthy. But even the most humble of PC gamers needs a graphics card (well, sort of), and it’s one of the most frequent upgrades gamers make. But is now a good time to buy one? Short answer: Yes. The GeForce 900 and 1000 series are now well-supported in the marketplace, with initial production issues overcome and frequent sales on both new and older models. The next refresh is months away at the very least, and even when it comes, it’s likely to be very expensive and produced in limited initial runs. In addition, AMD’s RX 400 and 500 series are keeping competition hard in at the low-end and mid-range. At the moment, there are excellent choices to be had for both spec hounds and bargain hunters alike. NVIDIA GTX 900/1000 and AMD RX 400/500 Cards are Plentiful and Powerful The GeForce GTX 900 series was introduced in late 2014, though NVIDIA had already been using some of its “Maxwell” class manufacturing techniques for the mid-range GTX 750 and 750 Ti cards. In addition to the usual bumps in pure speed for the processors and local memory, 900-series GPUs also expanded support for performance at higher 4K resolutions and VR applications for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. NVIDIA’s previous-gen lineup consists of the following cards, from least expensive to most expensive and powerful, in various packages customized by OEM vendors: GTX 950 GTX 960 GTX 970 GTX 980 GTX 980 Ti GTX TITAN X The GTX 970 is worth a particular note here: a unique design on its memory bus means that the stated 4GB memory capacity on the reference card can’t all be accessed at the highest 224-bit bus speed. This lowers performance versus a similar system with high-speed access to all memory. Consumers were upset when this was discovered, and NVIDIA settled a class-action lawsuit over the matter. Nevertheless, the GTX 970 sold well and continues to be a good option for gaming builds. The equivalent generation of AMD Radeon cards is the R 300 series, first released in late 2015. But since AMD is in a distant second place when it comes to market share, their newer cards tend to be much more competitive in price, so the newer generation is still going head-to-head with NVIDIA’s older designs. The RX 400 series, first on sale in late 2016, is the logical match-up to the GTX 900, while still being cheaper at every level: RX 460 RX 470 RX 480 Remember that unlike CPUs, PCI Express-based GPUs can be installed on any compatible motherboard, whether it uses Intel or AMD for the processor. The GTX 1000 series, first released to market in May of 2016 with the GTX 1080, adds support for new CUDA features, the DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0b standards, support for faster memory, and a dynamic load-balancing scheduling system. The architecture series, “Pascal,” is a considerable boost over Maxwell. The current lineup of desktop cards is as follows: GTX 1050 GTX 1050 Ti GTX 1060 GTX 1070 GTX 1080 GTX 1080 Ti GTX Titan XP NVIDIA-branded cards can generally be split into three categories: budget (X50 and X60), high-end (X70 and X80), and super-high end (X80 TI cards and above). Even the budget cards can handle most new games at 1080p resolution with 60 frames per second performance. Upgrading to faster and more robust cards is an option for those who want to play with extremely high visual settings, at 2K and 4K resolutions, and with demanding virtual reality headsets. Despite launching in April and May of 2017, AMD’s most recent series of cards is considerably behind the GTX 1000 series when compared to the previous models. The Radeon RX 480, for example, is generally competitive with the GTX 970, but the newer RX 580 is well behind the GTX 1070. The current top-of-the-line Radeon 500 series cards compete with NVIDIA’s mid-range offerings. That’s not a serious issue, though, since they’re priced accordingly. RX 550 RX 560 RX 570 RX 580 AMD’s upcoming RX Vega card, a no-holds-barred, high-end competitor to the GTX 1080 and above, will likely even out the current lopsided playing field at the top end of the GPU market. This will be a successor to the Radeon R9 Fury cards, launched in 2015 to compete with the Titan but not updated since. The RX Vega is expected to launch sometime after the workstation version in June of 2017. RX 400 and 500 Series Cards Are a Great Bargain While NVIDIA and AMD are duking it out at the $200-300 price range, and AMD currently has no cards from the past year that can compete with the higher end aside from the frankly insane Radeon Pro Duo, the entry level market belongs squarely to AMD. The RX 460 and RX 550/560 cards, starting at just under $100 and going up to about the $200 mark, can generally handle new games at 1080p resolution with a few of the more exotic graphics options turned down. For budget builders looking to get a gaming machine with a rock-bottom price, they’re an excellent choice. The Radeon RX 460 is a capable card that can be had for $100 or less. The mid-range is a battlefield, if you’ll pardon the pun, and the new AMD RX 570 and RX 580 cards are competing neck and neck with the GTX 1060 and older equivalents in terms of both price and value. Vendor modifications to reference cards, like a slight overclock or a bump in GDDR5 memory, can make the difference in a head-on battle. But whichever manufacturer you prefer, you’ll find that these new cards can easily handle almost all games at 1080p and 2560p. It’s a good time to be a mid-range gamer. At $300-400, NVIDIA rules the roost for now, making the older GTX 970 and the new GTX 1070 cards almost the only choice in this category without reaching back into the older Radeon R9 line. That means less price flexibility, though the competing NVIDIA partner brands like ASUS and Gigabyte might allow for a little wiggle room there. Super high-end cards, starting with the GTX 1080 and going up, have no AMD equivalent until later this year. Volta and Vega-Series GPUs Are Still a Long Way Out The next revision in NVIDIA’s GPU architecture is codenamed “Volta,” and it’s generally assumed they’ll be using “GTX 20X0” for the brand names (as opposed to 11X0). But with only a single server-class chip recently announced, consumer-grade gaming models are still probably five to six months away at best. And since NVIDIA releases its mid-high ’70 and ’80 cards first, usually with fairly low production yields as chip factories adapt to the new designs, you can bet those cards will be both expensive and rigid in price. It will take several months after that for current GTX 1000-series GPUs to start dropping in price, as the expensive GTX 2000 models become easier to find and the budget options his the market. Volta will probably be a significant bump up in terms of performance at all levels, thanks to a shift to the 12-nanometer manufacturing process. At that point it should be close to the Radeon Vega launch, giving us a dramatic battle at the high-end and ultra-high-end portions of the market. With its older 14nm chips, AMD will need to hold on to its competitive pricing strategy to sell to users who want an alternative to the GTX 1080 and higher cards. So if you can wait for about half a year, and you’re willing to pay top dollar for the best new cards, it might be worth waiting for the next big round of graphics card releases. Otherwise, go ahead and upgrade your GPU now without fear of regret. Image Credit: NVIDIA, Amazon, Newegg JOIN THE DISCUSSION Tweet Michael Crider has been covering technology on the web since 2011.

The Matebook X will be available this summer and will start at around $1,569. At first glance, the Matebook X can easily be mistaken for a MacBook. The only overt design difference here is the Huawei logo on the Matebook X’s lid. Huawei’s new notebook is only 12.5mm thick and only weighs 2.31 pounds. For comparison, Apple’s 12-inch MacBook is 13mm thick and weighs 2.03 pounds, according to CNET. The Matebook X features a fanless design and an aluminum chassis. Huawei says that the exact material it used to make the notebook actually helps in absorbing heat potentially avoiding any overheating issues that’s usually the case with laptops. The Matebook X is also the first laptop ever to feature Dolby’s Atmos Sound System. Dolby and Huawei worked together to create the speakers that are located on top of the keyboard. This is why the Matebook X will also come with Dolby’s software that will allow users to optimize the sound quality depending on what kind of media they’re consuming. The Huawei Matebook X features a 13-inch  display with a screen resolution of 2,160 x 1,440. The side bezels are incredibly thin at only 4.4mm thick making the display appear even larger than it actually is. The Matebook X also comes with a full-sized, backlit keyboard along with a large Precision Touchpad just beneath it, according to Ars Technica. The Matebook X features a fingerprint scanner right on its power button. Photo: Huawei The power button, located by the top-right corner of the keyboard, also doubles as a fingerprint scanner. The Matebook X’s fingerprint scanner is also able to recognize different people’s prints. This makes it easier for several people to share the notebook without worrying about security and privacy. As for internal specs, the Huawei Matebook X can be configured to come with Intel’s Core i5 or i7 Kaby Lake processors. For memory, users have the option for either 4GB or 8GB of RAM, and storage options include 256GB and 512GB SSD. The Matebook X is equipped with Intel’s HD 620 graphics. Although the Matebook X is incredibly thin, it doesn’t skimp on battery life. The upcoming notebook comes with a 41.4Whr battery that Huawei claims can last up to 10 hours on a single charge. For ports, the Matebook X sports two USB Type-C ports; one on each side. Although USB-C technology is slowly gaining popularity, Huawei recognizes that a lot of people haven’t fully transitioned to the new port yet. This is why Huawei will include a USB-C MateDock 2.0 along with the Matebook X. The dock will give users a USB-A port, an HDMI port, a VGA port and another USB-C port. The Huawei Matebook X will be available in the United States in space gray and prestige gold. The rose gold (pink) color option will only be available in China. Huawei also announced the Matebook E and the Matebook D. The Matebook E seems like an upgraded version of the original Matebook. The E model now comes with a 2K resolution display instead of 1080p full HD, 9 hours of battery life and an updated leather folio keyboard, according to The Verge. The Matebook E starts at around $1,120. The Matebook D, on the other hand, is a 15-inch laptop featuring mid-range specs intended for a wider range of consumers. The Matebook D offers configuration options of i5/i7 processors and 4GB/8GB/16GB of RAM. Users also have the choice of simply having a 1TB hard drive, or have it supplemented with an additional SSD. The Matebook D starts at around $896. Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

Added by Agency Staff on 23 May 2017. Saved under News Tags: Huawei, Intel, Microsoft Tweet After upending the phone networking gear and Chinese smartphone markets, Huawei has its eyes set on business users with its first laptops. Building on branding used by its smartphone unit, the world’s third largest, the 13-inch MateBook X is targeting a market dominated by Lenovo, Dell and HP. Sporting a fingerprint sensor, near full-screen display and an Intel processor, the 1kg PC will sell for up to €1 699 (about R25 000), according to Huawei. Closely held Huawei is entering a market that has shrunk for five straight years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence from research firm International Data Corp (IDC), as consumers opt for tablet computers and increasingly powerful smartphones. The Shenzhen-based company has faced challenges before, pushing aside networking giants such as Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson before turning to smartphones, where it rose to the top of the world’s biggest market. While global PC shipments rose 0,6% in the March quarter, the first increase since 2012, most of the growth focused on the major players. The top five vendors all posted gains while the rest saw an 11,4% decline according to IDC. Huawei also introduced an upgrade of 2-in-1 MateBook E as well as a new product line of traditional laptops called MateBook D. The devices will be available in a dozen markets, including the US, Germany, Spain, Japan, Saudi Arabia and China, according to the company. Huawei introduced its first generation of the MateBook series last year, a 12-inch 2-1 with a detachable keyboard, similar to how Microsoft’s Surface works. The company did not disclose sales figures for the product.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 12Trevor Manuel blasts Eskom board 10Why software updates make us WannaCry 8E-tolls mess just got even messier 4DStv to add four e.tv channels 4State won’t appeal nuclear ruling Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Jeanne Shaheen Jeanne ShaheenDem senator: 'One of our closest allies' expressed concern about intelligence sharing Sessions postpones Senate testimony on DOJ funding McConnell promises women can take part in healthcare meetings MORE (D-N.H.) said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.

ADVERTISEMENT Trump reportedly told Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak “code-word information” related to an Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) plot. The information reportedly came to the United States from Israel. Trump on Monday denied mentioning Israel in that meeting, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintained during a joint appearance with Trump that the intelligence relationship between the two countries remains strong. Reports about Trump’s disclosure to the Russians do not allege that he explicitly named Israel, but said that Russia could have gleaned the source from what Trump revealed. The incident has raised concerns among critics that allies could curtail their intelligence sharing with the United States. In response to Shaheen, Coats spoke about the importance of intelligence sharing. Asked by Sen.

He hasn’t discussed the issue with Trump yet, he said, because the president has been traveling. When Heinrich said he found that “troubling,” Coats responded, “Well, I was in Europe and he was in the White House.”  Coats also said he is “not aware” of whether Trump followed the interagency process on deciding whether to declassify intelligence before Trump shared the information with the Russians.

(Photo: Martin Rickett, AP) 1375 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing Monday night at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that left at least 22 dead. The incident is just the latest in a string of deadly terror attacks that have occurred in Europe over the past year. Here's a look at some of the most recent terror attacks in Europe: April 2017: In Paris, a gunman with an assault rifle shot and killed a police officer on the Champs-Élysées before being shot dead on April 20.The Islamic State identified the attacker as Abu Yusuf al-Beljiki through its Amaq news agency, according to SITE Intel Group, a U.S.-based organization that monitors terrorists' activity online. In Sweden, four people were killed on April 7 when a large beer truck slammed into an upscale department store in a busy Stockholm pedestrian mall in what Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven called an apparent "terror attack." The suspect was named in court documents as Uzbekistan national Rakhmat Akilov, 39. March 2017: In London, a sole attacker killed five people, including a police officer, and injured at least 50 others in two apparent terror assaults near Britain's Parliament. Khalid Masood rammed his car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, before fatally stabbing the policeman outside Parliament. Masood, who lived in the central city of Birmingham and spent the night before the attack in Brighton, southern England, was shot dead by police on March 22. December 2016:  In Berlin, 12 people were killed and dozens injured after a truck attack on a popular street Christmas market. Anis Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker suspected of carrying out the attack, was shot dead by Italian police four days after the attack on Dec. 19. October 2016: A 16-year-old boy was stabbed multiple times in Hamburg, Germany, by an assailant that was described as Middle Eastern. He later died from his injuries. ISIS took responsibility for the attack, though German officials could not confirm the authenticity of the claims at the time, Fox News reported. July 2016:  Two men armed with knives killed an elderly priest and injured three others after seizing hostages at a Catholic church in Normandy, France. ISIS claimed responsibility. Both attackers were shot dead by French police as they attempted to leave the church.

June 2016:  In Istanbul, Turkey, 45 people were killed and approximately 240 wounded in an attack at the Ataturk International Airport. June 2016:  A police officer and his partner were killed in a Paris suburb by Larossi Abballa, a man who was later killed by police. Abballa had pledged allegiance to ISIS. March 2016: In Brussels, Belgium, 32 people were killed and hundreds wounded in suicide bomb attacks.  Two suicide bombers blew themselves up in the airport's departure hall during a peak travel period, and an hour later, a bomb was ignited in a train at a busy metro station, killing 16 more people. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks. March 2016:  In Istanbul, Turkey, five people, including two Americans, were killed in a suicide bombing. At least thirty-six people wounded, according to the health ministry.

The new Surface Pro looks similar to the Surface Pro 4 that debuted in late 2015, but there are some small changes that add up to make this a new computer. For example, Microsoft has thrown in Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors, with options ranging from an Intel Core m3 to a Core i5 up to a Core i7. Microsoft is also promising longer battery life with the new Surface Pro. Whereas the Surface Pro 4 was estimated to get up to nine hours of battery life on a single charge, Microsoft says that the new Surface Pro can get up to 13.5. This new Surface Pro also boasts an updated hinge with a 165-degree range of motion that lets you lay the device nearly flat. Microsoft touts that it has ditched fans on the Core m3 and Core i5 models, too. When it comes to raw specs, the new Surface Pro is packing a 12.3-inch 2736x1824 display, 4/8/16GB RAM, 128/256/512GB and 1TB storage, 8-megapixel rear and 5-megapixel front cameras, full-size USB 3.0, microSD, and Mini DisplayPort. The new Surface Pro measures 292.10 x 201.42 x 8.5mm and the Core m3 models weighs 1.69 pounds, while the i5 and i7 models are 1.73 pounds. Microsoft is also planning to offer a Surface Pro with built-in LTE that will launch later this year. No pricing details for that model have been announced. And then there are the accessories. Microsoft is offering Signature Type Covers for this new Surface Pro that are covered in Alcantara and available in three colors: Platinum, Burgundy, and Cobalt Blue. There’s also a black Surface Pro Type Cover without Alcantara that’s coming soon. There’s also an updated Surface Pen that comes in those same four colors. This new Surface Pen boasts 4096 pressure points, 21 milliseconds of latency, and a new tilt feature. The new Surface Pro is now available for pre-order and is launching in 25 countries on June 15, including the US, the UK, China, Australia, Korea, Portugal, Ireland, and Germany. Pricing starts at $799 for the Core m3/4GB RAM/128GB storage model and goes up from there. Both the Signature Type Covers and Surface Pen are sold separately. The Signature Type Cover is priced at $159.99 and is also now available for pre-order, while the Surface Pen is “coming soon” for an undisclosed price.

Building on branding used by its smartphone unit, the world’s third-largest, the 13-inch MateBook X is targeting a market dominated by Lenovo, Dell and HP. Sporting a fingerprint sensor, near full-screen display and an Intel Corp. processor, the 1 kilogram PC will sell for up to 1,699 euros ($1,912), according to Huawei. The Huawei MateBook X Source: Huawei Technologies Co. Closely-held Huawei is entering a market that has shrunk for five straight years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence from IDC, as consumers opt for tablet computers and increasingly powerful smartphones. The Shenzhen-based company has faced challenges before, pushing aside networking giants such as Alcatel-Lucent SA and Ericsson AB before turning to smartphones, where it rose to the top of the world’s biggest market. The Huawei MateBook E Source: Huawei Technologies Co. While global PC shipments rose 0.6 percent in the March quarter, the first increase since 2012, most of the growth focused on the major players. The top five vendors all posted gains while the rest saw an 11.4 percent decline according to research firm IDC. Huawei also introduced an upgrade of 2-in-1 MateBook E as well as a new product line of traditional laptops called MateBook D. The devices will be available in a dozen markets, including the U.S., Germany, Spain, Japan, Saudi Arabia and China, according to the company. Huawei introduced its first generation of the MateBook series last year, a 12-inch 2-1 with a detachable keyboard, similar to how Microsoft Corp.’s Surface works. The company did not disclose sales figures for the product. — With assistance by Yuan Gao Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The tweet, posted late Sunday, shows four cover keyboards, including a red one and a blue one. “Working session. 30 hours to go,” said Panay, using hashtags, #MicrosoftEvent #Surface #Shanghai. Read: iPad Pro 2 Launching At WWDC, Expected Features Include Bezel-less display, 10nm processor, Reports Photos of the hybrid tablet-laptop were leaked by Evan Blass earlier this month. Blass said the update from the Surface Pro 4 will be called the Surface Pro, not Surface Pro 5. Panay had  said earlier this month there’s “no such thing as the Surface Pro 5.” Microsoft’s new tablet, which was previously expected to be unveiled Tuesday, won’t see major changes, with most upgrades expected to be internal. The device looks similar to the Surface Pro 4, and comes with the same 3.5mm headphone jack, Mini DisplayPort and a USB Type-A port, another report said. The Surface Pro won’t have any USB-C ports, since Microsoft believes the feature is not yet ready for the mainstream. It was previously rumored Microsoft was looking into adding Intel’s seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors for the new Surface Pro, so users should expect better performance from the device. Read: Apple iPad Pro 2 10.5-Inch Launching At WWDC In June, Leaked Screenshot Hints The Surface Pro is rumored to come with new accessories, including Microsoft’s Surface Arc Mouse, which was unveiled alongside the Surface laptop. The Surface Pro will also come with a new Pen and Type Cover color versions that will resemble the Surface Laptop’s color palette. Microsoft released the Surface Pro 4 in October 2015. Panay previously said the company wants to deliver meaningful and “experiential change that makes a huge difference in the product line,” and not just equip it with the latest processor. The Surface Pro will compete with other tablets on the market, including Apple’s iPad, Amazon’s Fire devices and Samsung’s new Galaxy Tab S3. The Tab S3 features a 9.7-inch display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage with expansion of up to 256GB, a 13-megapixel autofocus camera and a 5-megapixel front camera. Apple is expected to unveil the iPad Pro 2 at the Worldwide Developer Conference next month. The tablet is rumored to come with an edge-to-edge screen display measuring 10.5-inches. The iPad Pro will also come with a new accessory: a revamped Apple Pencil, which is said to be magnetic. The tablet is expected to have an electromagnetic strip, which will serve as a charging point and dock for the Apple Pencil 2. Additionally, the iPad Pro 2 is rumored to come with a 12-megapixel camera for 4K video recording and Live Photos. Meanwhile, Amazon released its latest low-priced tablets last week: the Amazon Fire 7 Tablet, Amazon Fire HD 8, all-new Amazon Fire 7 Kids Tablet and the Fire HD 8 Kids Edition.
