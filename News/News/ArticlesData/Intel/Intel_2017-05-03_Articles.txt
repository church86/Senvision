By Tas Bindi | May 4, 2017 -- 01:56 GMT (18:56 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Intel has shuffled its executive ranks again, announcing that long-time executive Diane Bryant is stepping down from her role as GM of the Data Center Group (DCG). Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in an email to employees that Bryant would be stepping away for six to eight months to tend to a personal family matter. Navin Shenoy, formerly GM of the Client Computing Group (CCG), will be heading up the DCG, which is Intel's second-largest business unit in terms of revenue behind the CCG. In the latest quarter, the DCG reported revenue of about $4.2 billion, more than a quarter of Intel's total quarterly revenue and representing a 6 percent year-on-year increase. "DCG is a central part of our transformation and corporate strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution," CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement. Bryant was appointed leader of the DCG in 2012 after four years as Intel's CIO. In the email, Krzanich credited Bryant for transforming DCG "from a server-centric group to a business that spans servers, network, and storage across all end-user segments, and with product lines and business models that extend beyond the traditional." Intel is hoping DCG will become a bigger revenue driver than the CCG, which deals in PCs. The goal is to put more server chips and equipment in datacentres as computing moves into the cloud and as the Internet of Things market grows. Shenoy will have one month to work with Bryant before she hands over leadership and begins her leave of absence. Bryant will be given a new position upon return. "Management changes can be distracting, but it is critical that we all give Navin, Diane, and the CCG leadership team our full support during this transition and focus on delivering leadership products and executing flawlessly," Krzanich wrote to employees. Meanwhile, Doug Davis, the chip giant's SVP and GM of the Autonomous Driving Group, wrote an article saying the reason he decided to postpone his retirement from the company in which he spent more than 30 years is because of Intel's potential in the autonomous driving sector. Davis believes Intel is not getting enough credit for its role in autonomous driving technology, saying that many autonomous vehicle carmakers are not talking about "who is powering the brains in their test cars lest they give away secrets". In the article, Davis said that he firmly believes Intel is best equipped to address the data challenge associated with autonomous driving technology. According to Intel, autonomous cars will generate about 4TB of data -- from cameras, LIDAR, RADAR, and other sensors -- every 90 minutes of operation. To prepare for this, Davis said the company has set up the first of several planned datacentres dedicated to autonomous driving, which will be used for algorithm development and training, as well as understanding the infrastructure required for autonomous driving data movement and storage. At an event in San Jose, California, Intel and BMW also unveiled the first of approximately 40 autonomous cars built on the 7 Series platform that it will be testing on the road. The vehicles will include technologies such as cameras for road scanning from Israeli company Mobileye, which Intel acquired for $15.3 billion in March. Under its partnership with Intel, BMW will be responsible for driving control and dynamics, component integration, and evaluation of functional safety including setting up a high-performance simulation engine. All the cars are expected to be on the road by the end of the year. Intel also unveiled on Wednesday its Advanced Vehicle Lab in Silicon Valley, which it said will explore artificial intelligence, connectivity, in-vehicle computing, sensing, and other technologies required to make fully autonomous vehicles a reality. It joins the company's other labs in Arizona, Oregon, and Germany. Intel is among a growing cohort of tech companies looking to capitalise on autonomous driving technology, including Apple, Baidu, BlackBerry, Google, Lyft, Nvidia, and Uber. what's hot on zdnet Windows 10 S: Chromebook killer or the second coming of Windows RT?

(KGO-TV) Wednesday, May 03, 2017 09:45PM SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Intel took the wraps off a new garage Wednesday where engineers will tinker with the cars of the future as self-driving cars inch closer to your driveway than ever before. While the ribbon cutting was quiet, the innovation inside will echo around the world. "It's looking around to see if there's a safe distance and changing lanes," Intel representative Anthony said. Anthony may be in the driver's seat, but really, he's just along for the ride. The cars have sensors and cameras pointed in every direction, allowing the car to generate so much data that within a week, the trunk would be filled with hard drives. The trick is how to use all that data, and then quickly make room for more. Intel is teaching the cars to drive in different countries. "In the U.S. we have left freeway exits, we have right turns on red," BMW Engineer Grant Mahler said. With no human to talk to, designers have to figure out how you'll interact with the car, from how long you need to hold the button down to how the car will convince you to trust it. "People obviously want to feel safe, they want to feel comfortable; physically comfortable yes, but more importantly psychologically comfortable," Intel Internet of Things Creative Director Matt Yurdan said. An autonomous BMW could hit the market by 2021. Related Topics: technologyintelself driving carcardriver Email share share tweet email Load Comments Please enable JavaScript to view comments.

The car is planned for sale in 2021. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) By Ethan Baron | ebaron@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 3, 2017 at 3:37 pm | UPDATED: May 3, 2017 at 3:46 pm SAN JOSE — Semiconductor titan Intel has officially jumped into the self-driving car frenzy, throwing itself into battle with Google spinoff Waymo, Apple and a host of other firms. “That is an arms race going on,” said Raj Rajkumar, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University focused on autonomous driving. “I don’t think they are late, but they have to execute, of course.” In an event for press and analysts Wednesday at its “Innovation Campus” in San Jose, Intel unveiled a sleek silver BMW sedan showcasing Intel’s partnership with the German automaker and the computer vision company Mobileye that Intel is buying. The partnership is intended to let Intel develop a “base functionality platform” for self-driving cars that it would license to car makers, said Intel spokeswoman Marcie Miller. The Santa Clara firm’s move comes as its business has been on the upswing after it missed the mobile-computing revolution and saw PC sales falter before it pivoted toward cloud computing and development of 5G wireless networks. Autonomous cars represent another new frontier in technology markets. “It’s very wise for them to diversify,” Rajkumar said. Intel’s semiconductor chips would act as the “brains” for an autonomous-driving system, Miller said. The chips would process data from vehicles’ sensors within the vehicle, as well as in Intel’s self-driving system, and for processing autonomous-vehicle data in the cloud, Miller said. The foray into autonomous driving will leverage and bolster Intel’s strengths, including its data centers, its work on 5G networks, and its processors, said Kathy Winter, vice-president of the firm’s Automated Driving Group. “It plays well to all of the things that we are already doing, and it’s another way to extend those businesses,” Winter said. Or, as AutoPacific analyst George Peterson said, “it’s a way to sell chips.” Intel’s gambit puts it up against companies from a variety of technology sector, analysts said. “One of their primary competitors is going to be Waymo, of course, they’re well ahead,” Peterson said. Another rival will be Apple, which probably won’t build a car but instead produce autonomous-driving software and possibly some hardware modules, Peterson said. In an additional arena of competition, Intel will do battle with companies like Bosch making components for self-driving systems, and in yet another competitive realm, Intel will strive against companies with expertise in mapping  — including Google, Magellan and TomTom — that’s crucial to autonomous driving systems, Peterson said. Car makers like Ford and GM also represent competition for Intel’s self-driving efforts, along with Uber, which is testing autonomous vehicles, and smaller firms such as Aurora Innovation, co-founded by Google’s former self-driving project head Chris Urmson, Rajkumar said. Another chipmaker, Santa Clara’s NVIDIA, will put additional competitive pressure on Intel, via NVIDIA processors used within autonomous cars — including all Teslas sold in the last six months — and for processing self-driving vehicle data in the cloud, said Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead. Whether a dominant autonomous-driving player will emerge with a widely used platform, or whether car makers will pull technology from a variety of sources remains to be seen, Peterson said. The BMW 740i showcased Wednesday is a prototype for the “iNext” electric car that BMW plans to put on the market in 2021, with self-driving capabilities falling somewhere between mostly driving itself but needing human backup, and full autonomy, said BMW advanced technology engineer Kyle Moy. Intel in November announced a partnership with Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye, and in March, it announced it was buying the company for about $15 billion. It is Mobileye’s machine-vision technology that will act as the “eyes” of the BMW prototype. Intel, by its own admission, missed the mobile revolution. And with the company netting more than half its sales from shipment of PCs as of 2016, five straight years of falling PC sales led Intel last year to announce it would cut 12,000 jobs and focus on chips for the cloud and Internet-connected devices. However, Intel’s fortunes have swung upward of late, with CEO Brian Krzanich in the company’s latest earnings report highlighting record first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, and looking toward self-driving car technology.   Tags:  Apple Autos Google Intel Self-driving cars Technology Ethan Baron Ethan Baron is a business reporter at The Mercury News, and a native of Silicon Valley before it was Silicon Valley.

At the former Altera facility in San Jose, California, the company better known for powering your laptop and PC outlined its vision for driverless cars over the coming years. While collaboration is the name of Intel‘s game, make no mistake: it sees this as a prime opportunity to sell more silicon. “We think this is a place where we can be close to potential partners, potential startups,” Kathy Winter, VP of Intel’s Automated Driving Group, said of the center, which will act as a “garage” for the company’s self-driving work moving forward. According to Winter, the positioning is essential because of how it facilitates different teams within the firm working together. “At Intel, this is probably been the best examples I’ve seen of “One Intel”,” she said. However, there’ll be more than just Intel staff on-site. “The only way we’re going to solve this problem across the industry,” Winter said of autonomous technology taking old, is not by ourselves but by working together.” That means a long list of partners, from automakers, through wireless experts, software developers, and experts in the high-definition mapping self-driving vehicles will demand. One such example is BMW, which will be providing the donor cars for a new Intel-powered fleet of autonomous testers. Though at first glance they look like your typical 7 Series, look closer and you can see a Mobileye camera array behind the windshield, and a pair of high-resolution GPS sensors on the roof near the satellite radio antenna. Around forty of the cars will be on the road by the end of the year. The goal isn’t just to make a system for BMW to deploy its own production self-driving vehicles. Instead, the automaker, Intel, and Mobileye will collaborate on a scalable architecture that other car companies can build upon, ranging from select modules – like sensor hubs that pull together camera, radar, and LIDAR data – to an entire turn-key system. Exactly how that will roll out is unclear at this stage: as BMW’s Kenn Sparks told us, “we have to build it first!” The automaker is counting on the various autonomous platforms in development coalescing into a single, open standard. What BMW is backing may not be the only one to contribute to that, “but we want it to be the best,” Sparks said. BMW has earmarked 2021 as the target for a commercial roll-out. Whatever the underlying platform, individual cars themselves will have some degree of onboard intelligence, but it’s when technologies like V2V (vehicle to vehicle), V2I (vehicle to infrastructure), and V2P (vehicle to pedestrian) are factored in that autonomous driving will be able to reach a tipping point. That will allow for cars that can report back traffic conditions to their counterparts not yet with line-of-sight to a crash, or for cities to redirect self-driving vehicles around congestion or road works. That, of course, relies on a persistent wireless connection. “We think of the network like oxygen,” Lynn Comp, senior director of industry enabling for the Network Platforms Group, “people use it, but they don’t necessarily realize they need it.” Comp’s team is working with infrastructure providers like Ericsson to ready the wireless world for the demands of self-driving vehicles and the distributed computing that Intel is betting will be the brains of that. 5G will be key to that, though Intel isn’t holding off until next-gen networks are deployed. While the current LTE deployment may not support the minimal latency autonomous cars would require to rely on the overarching cloud for their intelligence, the Network Platforms Group is looking to mobile edge computing (MEC) stations to fill in the gaps. Effectively a hub of cloud compute that’s positioned just one hop away from cellular base stations, it minimizes latency through sheer proximity to the data users: potentially down to around 20ms over an LTE connection, Comp told me. Such architecture clearly has benefits for Intel, in that it means more servers and thus more chips. However, it’s no temporary stopgap until 5G proliferates. Even with the next-generation networks in operation, a distributed mobile edge computing system would be able to survive interrupted network connections or downtime by routing the workload adaptively. The danger is one of network overload. Just as the highways can get weighed down with physical traffic, so the wireless network could easily slow to a crawl when each car is gathering terabytes of data every day. Intel’s strategy there is “Intelligence Everywhere”, in effect smarter filtering at each stage of the process, from car to MEC to the broader reaching cloud. So, while the car itself might only need the data it’s collecting to monitor for potential engine faults, it’ll also be clever enough to decide what of that data might be more useful higher up the chain. That could be fed back to the mobile edge computing installation, which could collate and rake through data related to its immediate location. The traffic data communicated from a group of proximate vehicles, for instance, might be sufficient for adaptive routing to navigate autonomous vehicles around congestion hotspots. Meanwhile, each MEC point would also have the filtering intelligence to feed data back into the cloud overall. That could then be used to figure out things like where new city infrastructure could be best positioned, or identify accident hotspots for greater attention from emergency services. At the same time, the inherent intelligence to filter out the extraneous information could help prevent the network as a whole from being overloaded. NOW READ: This is Apple’s self-driving SUV Intel clearly isn’t the only company working on autonomous technologies, and neither is it the only silicon business hoping to get its chips into pole position. Still, there are few rivals which have, not only the same scale, but the various strands of processor, storage, network infrastructure, computational vision and sensing, and other components that will together enable vehicles that can pilot themselves.

Not only is Intel expanding its production of 3D TLC NAND, it's also releasing two new lines of datacenter solid-state drives: the DC P4500 and DC P4600 series. Between the P4500 series and P4600 series, Intel is releasing a total of six new drives. All the models pack Intel's TLC NAND and an all-new controller developed internally. As expected of datacenter drives, these SSDs use PCI express connectivity and the NVMe protocol. All models will be available as half-height, half-length add-in cards, and some higher-capacity variants be offered as U.2 2.5" drives. The drives in the P4600 series are the most powerful of the bunch, particularly when it comes to write speeds. According to Intel, the highest-capacity 4TB model provides sequential read speeds up to 3270 MB/s, while sequential writes can go as far as 2100 MB/s. For random operations, the P4600 drives can reach 694K IOPS on reads and are capable of 228K IOPS when writing. Available capacities are 1.6TB, 2TB, and 4TB. As for the P4500 series, Intel reports that the drives provide read performance on par with their P4600 brethren. The 4TB P4500 drive, for example, posts sequential read speeds up to 3270 MB/s and random read speeds up to 687K IOPS. The drives fall behind the higher-end models when it comes to writes, however, offering sequential writes up to 1860 MB/s and random writes up to 62K IOPS. The P4500 series drives will be available with 1 TB, 2 TB, or 4TB of storage space. Intel plans a second quarter launch for all of these drives, so we'd expect them to hit the shelves sooner than later. The company hasn't announced pricing, though it noted that will offer five-year warranty coverage. Tags: Storage Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Intel Editorial: Intel Will Succeed in Autonomous Driving - I Bet My Career on It Putting Self-Driving Cars on the Road Will Be My Biggest Accomplishment Intel’s Doug Davis, senior vice president and general manager of the Automated Driving Group (ADG) at Intel Corporation, speaks to investors and media about Intel’s role in the autonomous vehicle market as part of Intel’s Investors Day events at the 2016 Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Thursday, Aug. 18, 2016. (Credit: Intel Corporation) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail May 03, 2017 03:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The following is an opinion editorial provided by Doug Davis, senior vice president and general manager of the Automated Driving Group (ADG) at Intel Corporation: For more than 30 years, I have climbed out of bed to go work at Intel. But never in those 30 years have I been more excited to do so than I am right now leading Intel’s autonomous vehicle team. Don’t get me wrong – I’ve had an absolutely wonderful career and have worked on some programs that have had a significant impact on the world around us. But the chance to solve one of the most complex technology challenges of our time, the opportunity to help the auto industry reinvent transportation, the potential to save a million lives every year – those things are unlike anything I’ve done before. They’re the reason I postponed my retirement. Press Kits: 2017 Autonomous Driving Workshop | Autonomous Driving at Intel I have unwavering confidence that Intel will succeed in autonomous driving. We have an astounding breadth and depth of experience and the world’s finest technology toolkit to apply to this challenge. We have tapped resources from across the company and have added experienced talent from the automotive industry. Our teams are operating in high gear and will deliver the necessary technology breakthroughs. Here’s why: First: We are already demonstrating great progress Intel technology is in hundreds of autonomous test vehicles on the roads today. Not all carmakers are talking about who is powering the brains in their test cars lest they give away secrets. But the fact is many of them are using Intel. I encourage you to open their trunks, boots or hatchbacks and see which tech company they are relying on the most to provide the brains for their development vehicles. Today we are also showing off one of the first of approximately 40 highly automated driving (HAD) cars promised from BMW, Intel and Mobileye this year. It was less than a year ago that the three companies announced plans to bring highly and fully autonomous vehicles into series production by 2021 through the development of a common platform. We are now successfully demonstrating that platform and are preparing plans to bring it to market for other OEMs and tier-one suppliers to accelerate their programs. Stay tuned for more on that front. Second: We are prepared for the data challenge The single most important factor in autonomous driving is data – how best to process it, manage it, move it, store it, share it and learn from it. From PCs to data centers and everywhere in between, no company’s silicon has analyzed, computed and moved more data than Intel’s. As we move down the road toward autonomous cars, the data challenge will become much more complex and require new ways to work with data inside the vehicle, throughout the network and across the cloud. To ensure we have the absolute right strategy to handle that data challenge, we’ve installed the first of several planned data centers dedicated to autonomous driving. These unique labs will be used for algorithm development and training, as well as for understanding the special infrastructure needs for autonomous driving data movement and storage. Researchers will continually feed information from Intel’s test cars into these data centers to train neural networks and improve machine learning algorithms. And, we’re busy building similar labs with customers and partners. Which brings me to artificial intelligence (AI). Mastering AI both inside the car and in the data center will be essential to the autonomous driving data challenge. Here it’s important to remember that autonomous driving isn’t a game. When cars are thinking and acting without human intervention, they must be able to do so in a safe and trustworthy way. The artificial intelligence needed to make this happen isn’t just computer vision – think voice, decision-making, personalization and preferences. Each of those AI workloads needs a different set of algorithms and likely different kind of processing for optimum performance. If all we needed was a supercomputer to handle the autonomous driving data challenge, our work would be done. Third: We’ve built big industries before and will do it again I’ve said this before: Autonomous driving will accelerate when the industry comes together to align on common platforms and technologies. That enables developers to go quickly and in volume while still differentiating their solutions in software. How do I know this? Let’s look at the PC and server industries as examples: Before 1980, the computer industry was highly proprietary, serving primarily researchers, big companies and hobbyists. This changed a few years later when IBM built the first personal computer using mostly off-the-shelf parts and an outsourced operating system. These early PCs were the base for a standardized approach to computer design that led to faster evolution of technology and 150x growth in two decades. The data center is similar. After mainframes came microcomputers that enabled some flexibility and cost-effectiveness. But it was the adaptation of PC technology that allowed data centers to evolve quickly to handle the data that came with the internet. IDC reported there were 1.8 zettabytes of data generated in 2011, and the agency estimates we will generate over 40 zettabytes by 2020. Only through standardized solutions have we been able to grow the industry fast enough to keep up. Which brings me back to autonomous cars. There are plenty of naysayers who think Intel’s experience in enabling rapid scaling cannot be replicated in autonomous driving. At the same time, there are plenty in the automotive industry who don’t understand how open collaboration can enable differentiation and innovation. I understand the skepticism, but from years of experience, I know that technology solves problems best when it’s organized around common platforms and predictable interfaces. Without a doubt, that’s the fastest way forward on our autonomous journey. As a society, I don’t think we can afford to continue down a proprietary path. The cost in time, money and human lives is too great. The faster we can deliver autonomous driving technology and take humans out of the driver’s seat, the faster we can save lives. It’s that simple – and that important. And I am confident Intel will not only succeed in helping our partners put self-driving cars on the roads, we will do so in the fastest, smartest way possible.

Bryant, who has been with Chipzilla for more than 30 years, will be taking a leave of six to eight months to deal with unspecified family matters. She will turn permanent control of the DCG over to Navin Shenoy. "DCG is a central part of our transformation and corporate strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution," CEO Brian Krzanich said. "Over the past five years, Diane has transformed DCG from a server-centric group to a business that spans servers, network and storage across all end-user segments, and with product lines and business models that extend beyond the traditional." Bryant assumed the role atop the DCG in 2012 after working as Chipzilla's CIO and corporate vice president. She has been an Intel lifer, joining the company fresh out of university in 1985. With PC sales on the decline, the DCG has been an increasingly important part of Intel's long-term strategy. The group accounted for $4.2bn in revenues last quarter, and Intel says that the DCG delivers roughly half of its operating margin. On the one hand, Intel enjoys a virtual 100 per cent monopoly in the data center compute world, which is a comfortable place to be. On the other hand, Chipzilla must continue to innovate so that it, for example, sees off Nvidia's challenges in the AI and high-performance computing spaces. With that in mind, Shenoy – formerly general manager of the client computing group – will face a tall task in heading up the DCG. Intel says he will have one month to work with Bryant before she hands over the reins and begins her leave of absence. "The fact that he and Bryant will work together for a month should help minimize any hiccups in the process, an important point since DCG is expected to introduce new products later in 2017," Pund-IT Inc principal analyst Charles King told The Register. "It would be a mistake to assume that absolutely nothing will go wrong during this process, especially when it involves an executive who has made the sorts of contributions that Diane Bryant has to Intel. But given the experience and talent of the company's larger executive team, I expect any potential problems will be minimal or easily solvable." ® Tips and corrections 1 Comment MORE Intel Chips Datacenter Servers Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Lenovo: If you value your server, block Microsoft's November security update UEFI scramble for frozen boxes 71 Comments Lenovo shows off 'Microsoft-friendly' VR cosplay at CES CES 2017 No actual demo, though.

Twitter Facebook Intel's new data centre chief, a former PC exec, will be hands-on Navin Shenoy is the new general manager of Intel's money-making Data Center Group, replacing Diane Bryant, who has gone on a temporary leave of absence Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 04 May, 2017 04:26 - - - - print email Comments A top executive responsible for shaping Intel's PC roadmap will now run the company's data center business. Navin Shenoy -- previously senior vice president and general manager of the company's Client Computing Group -- has been appointed the general manager of Intel's Data Center Group (DCG). He will replace the well-respected Diane Bryant, who was group president of DCG. Bryant is taking a leave of absence for six to eight months, and will be given a new position on returning, Intel said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. Bryant was one of Intel's more powerful executives and turned DCG into a money maker. The DCG unit deals in server, networking and storage equipment, which are seen as the future of Intel, especially with its limited focus on PCs. Replacing Bryant is no small task, but Intel thought Shenoy was a key talent, given his success with the company's PC business, analysts said. Intel previously flipped Kirk Skaugen from the data center to the PC group, but he is no longer with the company. Intel hopes that DCG eventually becomes a larger revenue earner than the Client Computing Group, which deals in PCs. The goal is to put more server chips and equipment in data centers as computing moves into the cloud and as the IoT market grows. The articulate Shenoy was hands-on with the PC group and will bring the same focus to DCG. DCG is the only part of Intel firing on all cylinders, and Shenoy's appointment will have a positive influence on organizations that are buying, using, and developing for servers, said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64. Shenoy is a key executive, and Intel has consistently been moving important employees into fast-growing areas in the company, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. There's been a change in Intel's management over the last few years, with one key appointment in 2015 being Venkata Renduchintala, who is the second-in-command to CEO Brian Krzanich. Renduchintala holds the long title of group president of the Client and Internet of Things Businesses and Systems Architecture and chief engineering officer at Intel. Since his arrival, Renduchintala's influence has been spreading, and he has a big say in the company's decisions. He was Shenoy's boss and may have played a role in moving him to run the Data Center Group. While Bryant was there, nobody else -- not even Renduchintala -- touched the DCG business, except for Kraznich. Renduchintala will temporarily take charge of the PC group. Intel is now looking for somebody to replace Shenoy as the general manager of the PC group. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Andrew Cunningham - May 3, 2017 7:05 pm UTC Enlarge Samsung reader comments 35 Share this story Intel has been the world's biggest chipmaker by revenue since January of 1993, when sales of its 386 and 486 processors helped it surpass Japanese companies like NEC and Toshiba. The release of the first Pentium CPU later that year and the proliferation of Windows 95 and 98-powered PCs over the next decade helped keep Intel on top. The company continues to grow today—revenue from chips for PCs, servers, and Internet of Things devices is all still increasing year-over-year. But a new report by IC Insights suggests that Intel might not be at the top of the heap anymore. Further ReadingSamsung’s new 10nm process promises big power efficiency improvements That's because demand for DRAM and NAND flash memory are both growing at double-digit rates, and Samsung in particular is raking in revenue. Assuming that both companies perform as expected in the second quarter of 2017, Samsung's semiconductor business could pull in $14.6 billion in revenue for the quarter, compared to $14.4 billion for Intel. Even if Samsung can't pass Intel in the second quarter, it seems likely to happen soon, given that Samsung's chip business is one of the brightest spots on its balance sheet—in Q1, revenue was up over 40 percent year-over-year. IC Insights Samsung's positioning is strengthening not just because of increased demand for RAM and flash memory, but because an ongoing NAND shortage is keeping prices high. Analysts blame a rocky transition from 2D to 3D NAND, increased demand from Chinese smartphone manufacturers, and the increasing popularity of SSDs as factors in the shortage. On top of the RAM business, Samsung also says it's seeing solid demand for 14nm SoCs, image sensors, and other smartphone chips. The company expects its new 10nm process to keep the business growing. Samsung manufactures its own Exynos SoCs as well as some of Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips and some of the A-series chips Apple uses across its iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple TV lineups.

Intel's new data centre chief, a former PC exec, will be hands-on Navin Shenoy is the new general manager of Intel's money-making Data Center Group, replacing Diane Bryant, who has gone on a temporary leave of absence Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 04 May, 2017 04:26 0 - - - - print email A top executive responsible for shaping Intel's PC roadmap will now run the company's data center business. Navin Shenoy -- previously senior vice president and general manager of the company's Client Computing Group -- has been appointed the general manager of Intel's Data Center Group (DCG). He will replace the well-respected Diane Bryant, who was group president of DCG. Bryant is taking a leave of absence for six to eight months, and will be given a new position on returning, Intel said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. Bryant was one of Intel's more powerful executives and turned DCG into a money maker. The DCG unit deals in server, networking and storage equipment, which are seen as the future of Intel, especially with its limited focus on PCs. Replacing Bryant is no small task, but Intel thought Shenoy was a key talent, given his success with the company's PC business, analysts said. Intel previously flipped Kirk Skaugen from the data center to the PC group, but he is no longer with the company. Intel hopes that DCG eventually becomes a larger revenue earner than the Client Computing Group, which deals in PCs.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

The rules, announced by the Cyberspace Administration of China, come into effect on June 1 and are part of President Xi Jinping’s move to tighten up on media regulation, and follows the announcement that China would publish its own state-approved version of Wikipedia. Workers on news publications will also have to undergo officially approved training as part of the crackdown, and the rules apply very widely – to reporting and opinion pieces about politics, economics, military or diplomatic matters on blogs, websites, forums, search engines and all platforms that share and edit news, said Reuters. Intel patches vulnerability Intel has patched a vulnerability that has been lurking on many of its processors since 2010 that could have allowed an attacker to take control of the devices running on vulnerable networks. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Intel says the vulnerability doesn’t affect consumer devices – it’s found in Intel’s AMT, ISM and Small Business Technology firmware versions 6.x through to 11.6. An advisory from Intel includes the recommendation that if you’ve got an affected system, you should check with your system OEM for updated firmware. Facebook to nearly double moderating team Facebook is to hire 3,000 people around the world over the next year to review content in the wake of criticism after users had livestreamed incidents of rape and murder, its founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged in a Facebook post on Wednesday. The wave of hirings will nearly double Facebook’s 4,500-strong community operations team and the aim is to help Facebook respond more quickly to reports of hate speech and abusive behaviour. Zuckerberg said: “We’ll keep working with local community groups and law enforcement who are in the best position to help someone if they need it – either because they’re about to harm themselves or because they’re in danger from someone else.” Catch up with all of today’s stories on Naked Security Follow @NakedSecurity Follow @katebevan         China Cyberspace Administration of China Facebook intel Mark Zuckerberg vulnerability Free tools Sophos Home for Windows and Mac XG Firewall Home Edition Mobile Security for Android Virus Removal Tool Antivirus for Linux Post navigation Previous: BASIC turns 53 – find out just how cool that is!

Navin Shenoy, senior vice president and general manager for the Intel (intc) Client Computing Group (CCG), will step in as general manager of the unit while Bryant attends to an undisclosed personal matter. "Given the extended duration, an interim leader for the Data Center Group (DCG) is not possible," Krzanich wrote. Bryant, president of Intel's Data Center Group, is one of Intel's most high-profile execs and the highest-ranked woman since Renee James stepped down as president two years ago. She is regular speaker at tech industry events, where she pushes the use of Intel (intc) technology in data center servers and other gear. She was also on Fortune's Most Powerful Women list for 2016. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. At Intel, Bryant led a highly strategic effort to push the chip giant beyond the PC chips that fed its growth for decades. Intel faces new challenges amid the age of cloud computing as tons of processing power is aggregated in massive data centers run by Amazon (amzn), Facebook (fb), Google (goog), and Microsoft (msft). Related: Intel Shakes Up Ranks in the Face of Falling PC Sales While Intel works with those companies to ensure it makes server chips to suit their needs, all of those software giants also have the resources to explore their own chip design. Google, for example, appears to be getting into the chip business.

Krzanich said Shenoy and Bryant will work together over the next month to ensure a smooth transition. Editors Note: (May 3, 2017 4:47 p.m.) This story was updated to note that Shenoy's new job leading the Data Server Group is not an interim appointment.

Intel's NUC platform is putting in a strong showing of late. You can pick one up with Windows 10 for $232, and there's a range of 7th generation Kaby Lake models now on the market, starting at $295 for the Core i3 version. These tiny PCs typically ship with a small fan inside for cooling the processor, but a few companies offer completely fanless cases for NUCs. Akasa is one of those companies, and its latest case will silently cool a Kaby Lake Core i7 NUC. The most impressive Akasa NUC case (both in terms of cooling offered and overall design) is its fanless case for the Skull Canyon NUC. This latest case is called the Plato X7, and it's been made specifically for the Kaby Lake NUCs, including the Core i7 NUC7i7BNH ($482), Core i5 NUC7i5BNH ($397) and NUC7i5BNK ($397), and the Core i3 NUC7i3BNH ($298). Related Gigabyte's Latest BRIX PC Is for IoT Gigabyte's Latest BRIX PC Is for IoT Cooling is managed through the use of aluminum fins that form part of the casing along with a large heatsink mounted over the processor. Akasa achieves enough cooling while keeping the case only 38.5mm tall, which is impressive (the case is 247mm wide and 240mm deep). There's also two front USB 3.0 ports, support for a 2.5-inch hard drive/SSD inside, and infrared remote support so you can use your NUC as a media box. The one negative point of the Akasa Plato X7 is its price. According to FanlessTech, it will be available for $200 later this month. That's a lot of money to pay to make a NUC run silent. But if you want a Core i7 PC without any fan noise, it could still be a tempting purchase. Back to top Previous : Lian-Li's PC-O11 Dual-Chamber Glass PC Case Hides All Cables...

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Microsoft Corporation Is Trying to Resurrect Windows-on-ARM Could it be different this time? Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 3, 2017 at 12:30PM A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and a handful of ARM-based chipmakers made a big deal about an operating system dubbed Windows RT. Windows RT was a version of Microsoft's Windows operating system designed to run on processors that implement the ARM instruction set architecture, rather than on Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) x86 architecture. The reason that Windows RT was such a colossal flop was simple: Systems running Windows RT couldn't run software designed for traditional Windows, since that software also needed Intel x86-based processors to run properly. Image source: Microsoft. Yesterday, at an education-focused event, Microsoft introduced a new flavor of Windows 10 known as Windows 10 S, which has been described as a competitor to Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Chrome OS. Windows 10 S differs from standard Windows 10, per Ars Technica, in that it "can only run and install applications that are obtained through the Windows Store." "Both applications [that] are built using Microsoft's new Universal Windows Program (UWP) framework, and traditional Win32 applications ported to the Store using the Desktop Bridge (formerly known as "Project Centennial") will be permitted, but Win32 applications that use their own installers will not function," Ars Technica explains. It seems to me that this is Microsoft's way of paving the way for wider adoption of ARM-based processors on the Windows platform, since restricting the kinds of applications that will work in Windows 10 S in this fashion means that ARM-based chips shouldn't be at a disadvantage in terms of compatibility to Intel x86-based ones. Winners and losers Obviously if Windows 10 S allows Microsoft and its partners to bring down system price points to make them more competitive with Chrome-based devices, then that'd be a clear win for Microsoft. I don't see Windows 10 S-based computers substantially cannibalizing sales of full-fat Windows 10-based systems, so I see this more as Microsoft defending itself against Chrome-based systems (halting or even reversing share loss in certain segments). Other potential winners include ARM-based chip makers, such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), that now can sell processors into such systems. The loser, of course, would be chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which sells the clear majority of chips into notebook computers today. To the extent that ARM-based vendors can win designs, Intel stands to lose unit and revenue share. A similar argument could have been made for Chromebooks, which enabled fundamentally the same thing that Windows 10 S aims to -- the viability of ARM-based systems. However, Intel wound up gobbling up the bulk of Chromebook processor market share, leaving only scraps for the ARM-based vendors to split. Strategy for Qualcomm and Intel I think that the two main suppliers of processors into Windows 10 S-based computers will be Intel and Qualcomm, as these are the two companies large enough with the resources to develop and support Windows-compatible platforms. I suspect that Intel's existing supply chain relationships with the major PC vendors will help it maintain a high level of share within Windows 10 S-based devices (I think said relationships helped immensely in allowing Intel to capture significant Chrome OS share). At the same time, though, if Intel can't deliver competitive low-power, low-cost products (via its Atom line), that could give Qualcomm a window of opportunity. Qualcomm, for example, has the advantage of higher levels of chip integration (particularly when it comes to connectivity technologies like Wi-Fi and 4G LTE) over Intel. It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Last year, Intel Ireland submitted a revised planning application for an 88,000 square metre manufacturing plant in Collinstown Industrial Park, Leixlip. This application has been granted by Kildare County Council and could result in the development of a plant to manufacture new semiconductor technology out of Intel’s base in the county. Speaking about the announcement, County Kildare Chamber chief executive Allan Shine said this planning permission will now allow Intel Ireland to bid for the tender of a new chip manufacturing plant from its head office. He added that a successful bid for the tender could result in a €3.6 billion investment bin manufacturing facilities in Leixlip. The project could create 3,000 construction jobs and also up to 850 full-time jobs once developed, according to the chamber. The planning permission also included the development of a two-level water treatment building, a multi-level car park and a two-level air compressor building. The move comes a year after Intel Ireland announced plans to cut jobs at its Irish operations. Previously the firm also stated it would move away from hardware manufacturing towards the development of cloud-based software.

The company already employs thousands of people at its local plant, which is one of the biggest manufacturing operations in the Republic. Last year Intel Ireland confirmed that it would trim its workforce in Ireland as part of a global jobs cull. It said that restructuring activities would see 12,000 positions axed worldwide. Staff here were told that the company’s Irish workforce would be reduced by 11%. Despite the rollback on its Irish activities, Intel stated its operations in the Republic remained “critical to the future growth of the company”.

Photo by Gareth Halfacree. Feature and banner images courtesy of SiFive There has been an upswell of interest in custom, open hardware among makers, in which community-developed and shared designs abound. The availability of low-cost development boards such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, together with open source software, has made it easier to get started with making innovative, new hardware designs. Read articles from the magazine right here on Make:. Don’t have a subscription yet? Get one today. However, in terms of embracing open source to achieve greater innovation and productivity, the hardware industry is still far behind software. Up until now, the open source hardware movement has been limited by the use of off-the-shelf, commercial silicon chips. These chips often include blocks that are closed source. Their programming interfaces can only be accessed under non-disclosure agreements, or by using opaque precompiled software “binary blobs” that cannot be modified or reverse engineered. Many advanced chips are not even available to purchase in small quantities, as the vendors are only interested in supporting high-volume customers. Without access to custom silicon technology, makers and small startups are currently constrained to using off-the-shelf microprocessors combined with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which can be reprogrammed to emulate a custom chip design. FPGAs, although excellent for prototyping, are too expensive and power hungry to use in large production runs. This lack of open source chips led me, along with my computer architecture research group at UC Berkeley, to develop an open source instruction set architecture (ISA). The latest version, RISC-V, allows hardware developers open access and full power over their parts — down to the level of the chip. The chip on SiFive’s HiFive board contains the RISC-V instruction set. The creators of RISC-V founded SiFive to commercialize RISC-V designs and to grow the RISC-V ecosystem. Photo by Gareth Halfacree Room for Improvement Back in early 2010 at UC Berkeley, our research group was pondering which ISA to choose for our upcoming research projects. An ISA defines the set of instructions that a microprocessor understands. For example, laptop and server chips from Intel and AMD only run software encoded in the Intel x86 ISA, whereas mobile chips from Apple, Samsung, and others only run software encoded in the ARM ISA. Ideally, for our research projects, we wanted to evaluate our new processor ideas running a wide range of software. Using x86 or ARM for our projects would have seemed the obvious choice, but three big problems forced us down an alternative path. Photo by Hep Svadja First, both these ISAs are large and complex. The Intel x86 has its roots in the 16-bit 8086 chip, one quickly designed in ten weeks back in the late 1970s after a different, more ambitious Intel ISA was late to market. In a momentous decision, IBM chose the cheaper Intel 8088 variant of this chip for its first PC prototype and brought in third-party operating software from Microsoft. It inadvertently left the platform open for clones and enabled Intel and Microsoft to grow into industry titans on the back of the IBM PC platform’s dominance. Flush with revenue from the PC business, Intel rapidly grew the x86 ISA, expanding from 16- to 32-bit and now 64-bit registers — all while being conscious not to sacrifice backwards compatibility with the original hastily constructed foundation. Nearly 40 years later, not even an Intel architect will claim the x86 ISA is elegant, and high-performance implementations of this baroque ISA require huge engineering resources, far beyond the reach of a small university team. The ARM ISA, in contrast, has it roots in the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) movement pioneered by groups at IBM, Stanford University, and UC Berkeley in the early 1980s, a movement that promoted simple ISAs for high-performance implementations. “RISC” was coined by my colleague Dave Patterson to name the world’s first RISC-I and RISC-II chips that were produced in the project he led at UC Berkeley, but RISC is now used to refer to the style generally. In 1985, inspired by the student-led UC Berkeley RISC effort, engineers at Acorn Computer in Cambridge, England, built their own high-performance 32-bit Acorn RISC Machine (ARM) to replace the 8-bit 6502 microprocessor used in their earlier desktops. Unfortunately, the Acorn RISC desktop machines could not survive the IBM PC onslaught. However, noting its low cost and low power, Apple picked it for the original Newton handheld project. Apple, VLSI Technology, and Acorn formed a new company, ARM Ltd (ARM now meaning “Advanced RISC Machines”) in 1990 and created a new business model. Instead of selling its own chips, ARM licensed processor designs for customers to incorporate in their own systems on chip (SoCs). Back in 2010, the ARM ISA did not meet our needs; it lacked 64-bit addressing and had several quirks that complicated high-performance implementations. Now, ARM dominates the mobile and embedded SoC processor market and is at the heart of almost every smartphone and tablet. Photo by Hep Svadja The second big problem with both ISAs is that they are not open. The ISA is perhaps the most important interface in computing, as it connects software to hardware. However, there have been very few open ISAs, even though many other computing parts have a healthy ecosystem built around open standards. Apart from Intel, only AMD and VIA have the right to build x86-compatible processors. ARM prohibits other companies to make or sell ARM-compatible processors without a license. We believed that it was important for researchers to share detailed core designs, both to improve the quality and reproducibility of research and to share the effort of building research infrastructure. We did consider the few existing open ISAs, but decided against them because they were not open source and lacked 64-bit design, among other technical deficiencies. The third big problem was the lack of extensibility in these ISAs. With Moore’s Law scaling coming to an end, our research project was investigating specialized processors to improve compute capability. Existing ISAs were not designed to support much expansion, wastefully using up many instruction bits for the initial ISA design. After decades of enhancements, there was little encoding space left to add new extensions. Also, the mainstream ISAs had become too large to be an efficient base for a specialized processing engine. Photo by Hep Svadja Although we originally set out to use an existing ISA, we realized that creating our own might actually be the best path forward, so we began our design in May 2010. We named the new ISA “RISC-V” (pronounced “risk-five”) to represent the fifth generation of RISC designs from UC Berkeley. Clamor for Community While we worked on the design, we were also working on the supporting software and chip implementations. The first RISC-V implementation was the 64-bit Raven-1 chip in 2011, fabricated in a 28-nm FDSOI process donated by ST Microelectronics. Subsequently, over a dozen RISC-V implementations have been completed at UC Berkeley in a range of fabrication technologies, with more underway. In addition to research, RISC-V was used in a growing number of university classes, with our course material freely posted on class websites. The design for the RISC-V ISA was influenced over these first few years by both our software and hardware implementation experience and learning from the mistakes made over the last thirty years of ISA design and use. Unfortunately, we started receiving emails from outside UC Berkeley complaining about these changes. There was a user community out there relying on RISC-V and our software tools for real engineering projects. We realized the demand for a free and open ISA standard was much larger than we previously thought. Photo by Hep Svadja By May 2014, we felt confident enough in the RISC-V base ISA design to call it done and freeze it permanently. That summer, in order to raise the profile of RISC-V in both academia and industry, Dave Patterson and I wrote a series of position papers on why instruction sets should be free. We could see no technical reason why a free and open ISA standard could not work just as well, if not significantly better, than the current proprietary standard. More importantly, we believed a free and open ISA would enable much more innovation by allowing competition between open-source and proprietary standards. For example, a SoC designer currently has to first pick a processor vendor, possibly through a competitive bid, and is then stuck with that vendor’s proprietary ISA. Most SoC designers hope their product is successful enough to warrant a second version, but at that point, it would generally be too expensive to port all the chip’s software to another ISA. So the SoC team is effectively locked into the original choice of proprietary ISA, which makes the licensing negotiations for the next round much less competitive. With an open ISA like RISC-V, an SoC designer can choose between multiple vendors of RISC-V cores, use an open-source design, or just build their own. In fact, when we held the first RISC-V workshop in January 2015, we were surprised to learn that the initial RISC-V processors were already shipping commercially in dental cameras produced by Rumble Development in Massachusetts. Rumble had built its own simple RISC-V softcore to fit in an FPGA in only three weeks. Build a Solid Foundation Photo by Hep Svadja The next workshop in June 2015 also sold out with an even larger group of attendees. It was clear the RISC-V project was now larger than a university project. In August 2015, I founded the RISC-V Foundation, a 501(c)(6) non-profit trade association to manage, protect, and promote the RISC-V ISA and hired Rick O’Connor as the executive director. We launched the foundation in January 2016 with sixteen member companies. By the fourth RISC-V workshop in July 2016, we had grown to nearly fifty member companies. Membership in the RISC-V Foundation ranges from small startup companies all the way up to some of the largest companies in the computing industry, including Google, Microsoft, IBM, HPE, Qualcomm, and AMD. It will ensure that the ISA remains free and open and uses licensing of the RISC-V trademark to ensure that commercial implementations remain compatible with the spec in order to avoid fragmentation.

Glad I had the opportunity to hear Nir speak!" --March 2017 "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, 10 May 2017: When Surveillance Goes Private: A 2027 Retrospective from Adrian Hon Location: Mozilla London + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: It’s 2027. In the UK, 8 out of 10 homes host a range of microphones, cameras and motion detectors. They help users secure their homes, find lost items, assist with cleaning, keep an eye out for accidents and falls, and a hundred other everyday tasks. They're integrated so seamlessly into daily life that they're considered indispensable – and they're cheap. Of course, consumption habits ranging from entertainment, clothing and food are not only known, but anticipated by intelligent systems. These habits are also owned, captured, analyzed and used by the corporations that run them. Interestingly, just a few decades ago in the 1990s, the UK’s introduction of Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) met with significant public outcry over concerns of privacy abuses. Yet now, less than half a century later, we’ve not only abandoned such talks: we’ve opted in to 24/7 surveillance of our homes. In our May 10 “future retrospective,” we’ll look at how we - in 2027 - became so collectively compliant to others owning data about our personal habits and lives. What factors led to us to give so much of our lives to corporations, with so little transparency or accountability? Why were we more open to private surveillance than public surveillance? And when we return to 2017, what can we learn from this evolution to map a different future? Host: Sarah Allen Speaker: Adrian Hon Adrian Hon is CEO and founder at Six to Start, co-creators of the most successful smartphone fitness game in the world, Zombies, Run!. The game has won awards for its stories and storylike games, and the team’s work has been displayed at the MOMA and Design Museum in London. He’s the author of A History of the Future in 100 Objects, and he used to write about technology for The Telegraph. Previously, Adrian was Executive Producer and Director of Play at Mind Candy from 2004 to 2007, where he designed and produced the Perplex City alternate reality game (ARG). Adrian’s interest in ARGs began with the genre itself in 2001, when as a moderator for the Cloudmakers community for ‘The Beast’ (an ARG for Steven Spielberg’s A.I.), he wrote a detailed walkthrough for the game, called ‘The Guide.' During that time, Adrian studied Natural Sciences at Cambridge, specialising in experimental psychology and neuroscience. In 2003, he began a neuroscience DPhil at Oxford, but left after a year to join Mind Candy. Adrian has also spoken at the main TED conference in Monterey in 2001 (about the human colonisation of Mars), as well as various SXSW, GDC, Economist, and other such tech and gaming conferences. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, July 20, 2017: Are you an introvert? Working Across Personality Types with Jennifer Selby-Long Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: Engineers are introverted. Agile = meetings all the time. Which is great… for the extraverts. Over the past year a few hundred staff at Mozilla have used the Insights Discovery tool to better learn about their individual personality temperaments, and to be more effective on their teams. But can these tests really help us? What’s the real science behind them? Can they be abused? Or are there ways they can help us work together better? On July 20, Jennifer Selby Long, an expert in the ethical use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®), will lead us in a very interactive session on this material. She’ll help us explore these frameworks and the science behind them, with a focus specifically on their Introversion / Extraversion dimensions and workplace collaboration. Importantly, we’ll make it personal, rolling up our sleeves with some exercises to help us explore how our (and our team’s) MBTI preferences can help us work together better, regardless of job description, culture, or demographics. Hosts: Matt Frassica & Tyler Haugen Speaker: Jennifer Selby-Long Jennifer Selby Long is an executive coach, management consultant, and MBTI® expert who helps technology leaders navigate the challenges of seismic change to achieve their highest potential. She also advises on the impact of personality and gender on financial behavior. Jennifer is the past president of the Association for Psychological Type. She has been quoted by business and technology writers in the Fast Company, Information World, Dice.com, Univision, and the Bulletin of Psychological Type. She is an award-winning business writer and the author of Traveling Light, a blog helping leaders skyrocket their impact and lighten the load in their lives. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Previous Speakers Wednesday, April 26, 2017: American Spies: Jennifer Granick on U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: American Spies: U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Intelligence agencies in the U.S. (aka the American Spies) are exceedingly aggressive, pushing and sometimes bursting through the technological, legal and political boundaries of lawful surveillance. Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security’s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Before teaching at Stanford, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California.

But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #InclusiveDesign + #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Hashtag: #mozSS September 1: Being Human in a Data-Filled World with Genevieve Bell, Intel Location: Mozilla Portland + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 1 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Being Human in a Data-Filled World In May, Kevin Kelly shared the possibilities that technology will offer us over the next 30 years. Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books. Her newest books, published by HarperCollins are What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 (2009), inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity (2012), and Insight Out (2015). She’s been honored to receive significant recognition of her work, including the Gordon Prize from the National Academy of Engineering, the National Olympus Innovation Award, the SVForum Visionary Award, and several university teaching awards.

Hashtag: #mozSS Deck materials also in this post May 26, 2016: Twelve Technology Forces Shaping the Next 30 Years with Kevin Kelly, Wired Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, May 26 @ Mozilla SF - 10:30am PT / 1:30pm ET / 6:30pm UTC Topic: Twelve Technology Forces Shaping the Next 30 Years Much of what will happen in the next thirty years is inevitable, driven by technological trends already in motion. Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016.

Hashtag: #mozSS #theinevitable April 27, 2016: When Change is the Only Constant, with Kirsten Wolberg, PayPal Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, April 27 @ Mozilla SF - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: When Change is the Only Constant, Org Structure Doesn’t Matter While it may be true in tech that “change is the only constant,” some changes are bigger than others. Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement.

Kurz and Alexander Callo Haug Partners Your LinkedIn Connections at Firm In a recent opinion, Mentor Graphics Corp. v. EVE-USA Inc., No. 15-1470 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 16, 2017), the Federal Circuit evaluated when a patentee is entitled to lost profit damages. Lost profit damages are the profits that a patent holder would have made if an infringer had not infringed. The Court found that one "useful, but non-exclusive" method to establish an entitlement to lost profit damages is the test first articulated in Panduit Corp. v. Stahlin Bros. Fibre Works, Inc., 575 F.2d 1152 (6th Cir. 1978). In Mentor Graphics, the parties appealed several trial court decisions from a patent infringement case, including the jury instructions that led to an award of lost profits as damages. Specifically, the jury awarded the plaintiff/patentee ("Mentor") over $36 million in lost profit damages resulting from the defendant's ("Synopsys") sales of its infringing product to Intel Corp. ("Intel"). Synopsys appealed the district court's denial of judgment as a matter of law and motion for a new trial with regard to damages, arguing that the court failed to properly apportion the lost profits. In considering this issue, the Federal Circuit first established that the Patent Act calls for compensatory damages as a remedy to patent infringement, and that the standard for determining compensatory damages is fairly consistent across all areas of the law, including torts and contract disputes.1 This standard embraces the notion that "but for" a harmful act by a defendant, a plaintiff would be in a better position; accordingly, "[w]hen a plaintiff proves it would have been in a certain position but for a defendant's harmful act, it is entitled to damages to put it in the same position it would have occupied had the harmful act never occurred." Applied to a patent litigation, "[t]he goal of lost profit damages is to place the patentee in the same position it would have occupied had there been no infringement."2 The Federal Circuit then went on to apply the Panduit factors to establish the patentee's entitlement to lost profits. Under Panduit, a patentee is entitled to lost profit damages if it can establish: (1) demand for the patented product, (2) absence of acceptable non-infringing alternatives, (3) manufacturing and marketing capability to exploit the demand, and (4) the amount of profit it would have made.3 Panduit, the Federal Circuit found, applied neatly to the facts of the immediate case-namely, for each infringing sale Synopsys made to Intel, Mentor lost that sale. In other words, there was (1) demand for Mentor's emulators, (2) a lack of non-infringing alternatives to Mentor's emulators, (3) manufacturing and marketing capability for Mentor to exploit the aforementioned demand, and (4) an easily calculable profit that Mentor would have made absent Synopsys' infringing sales. The Federal Circuit determined that the facts of this case were "remarkably simple for a patent damages appeal," and were undisputed. However, Synopsys argued that the Court should apply a different compensatory damages framework. Synopsys proposed an apportionment framework, which would require that: (1) "a patentee must calculate the amount of profits it lost as a result of the infringement using the Panduit factors," and (2) "a patentee must further apportion its lost profits to cover only the patentee's inventive contribution."4 Synopsys argued that such apportionment would limit damages to "only the amount of profit properly attributable to [the product's] patented features." Applied to this case, this proposed framework would have discounted most, if not all, of Mentor's lost profits from the emulator sales to Intel. The Federal Circuit rejected Synopsys' proposal, deciding that "Panduit's requirement that patentees prove demand for the product as a whole and the absence of non-infringing alternatives ties lost profit damages to specific claim limitations and ensures that damages are commensurate with the value of the patented features." The Federal Circuit held that, under the facts in this case, "satisfaction of the Panduit factors satisfies principles of apportionment," and that "Mentor's damages are tied to the worth of its patented features." The court reasoned that it was undisputed that Mentor's emulator and Synopsys' infringing emulator were the only suitable alternatives to Intel and that "Intel would not have purchased emulators without the features claimed in [the patent-in-suit]."5 Accordingly, the Federal Circuit found that Mentor "is entitled to be made whole for the injuries it suffered as a result of the infringement," which the jury appropriately calculated as be the profits Mentor would have earned by selling its emulators to Intel "but for" Synopsys' infringing sales.

Business & Tech Xinhua/SIPA USA/PA Images 12:00 3 May 2017 Joseph Conroy 20 hours ago Planning permission has been granted to Intel for a massive 88,000 square metre facility at its Kildare campus. The application is part of a bid to become the location of a new $4bn chip-manufacturing facility. Intel's parent company has yet to decide whether it will proceed with the project, but it's understood that Leixlip and Israel are the firm's preferred locations for the facility. Kildare County Council granted a 10-year permission for a similar project in 2013. If it goes ahead it would create some 850 new full-time jobs, and 3,000 construction positions during the building of the facility. Allan Shine, CEO of the County Kildare Chamber said, "This is great news for Kildare and further demonstrates that Kildare is the location of choice for existing and potential business enterprises.  I am confident that Intel Ireland will be successful in this bid as Kildare is primed for further development." The company currently employs more than 4,000 workers in Leixlip. 12:00 3 May 2017 Joseph Conroy 20 hours ago 4 Related articles Should the Dáil prayer be saved?

Apple said most of the positions it was offering would be based at its own Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, but the company would provide relocation and immigration assistance. BlackBerry announced last month that it plans to lay off a shocking 40% of its global workforce by the end of the year. The first round of cuts began this week, with 300 employees let go. But Apple isn't the only one circling. Just two days later, according to the Post, Intel held its own two-day "information session" at a nearby hotel. BlackBerry employees received emailed invitations to Intel's event, the newspaper said. Ex-BlackBerry employees who don't get jobs at Apple or Intel may not have to travel too far from the Kitchener-Waterloo area to find their next jobs. The region has long been a hotbed of engineering activity, thanks in large part to the University of Waterloo. The city is home to large enterprise tech firms including OpenText and Desire2Learn, and the Communitech startup hub has helped the region gain a reputation as one of the hottest startup cities in the world. Just last month, Google announced it would open a Motorola Mobility office in Waterloo. Google itself already employs 250 people in its existing Waterloo office, where staffers focus on social and mobile efforts -- and enjoy a giant in-office slide (sorry, only Googlers are allowed to try it). Google also chose Communitech as one of seven North American hubs to join a new "Entrepreneurs Tech Hub" network. Also in September, Square -- a payments company created by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey -- announced it will open an office in Kitchener-Waterloo sometime in 2014.

Intel applied for a licence to export tens of thousands of chips to update the Tianhe-2 computer. The Department of Commerce refused, saying it was concerned about nuclear research being done with the machine. Separately, Intel has signed a $200m (£136m) deal with the US government to build a massive supercomputer at one of its national laboratories. The Tianhe-2 uses 80,000 Intel Xeon chips to generate a computational capacity of more than 33 petaflops. A petaflop is equal to about one quadrillion calculations per second. According to the Top 500, an organisation that monitors supercomputers, the Tianhe-2 has been the world's most powerful machine for the past 18 months. This year the Chinese machine was due to undergo a series of upgrades to boost its number-crunching abilities past 110 petaflops. The upgrades would depend largely on new Intel Xeon chips. The chipmaker informed US authorities of its involvement with the upgrade programme and was told to apply for an export licence. 'In compliance' In a notice published online the US Department of Commerce said it refused Intel's application to export the chips for Tianhe-2 and three other Chinese supercomputers because the machines were being used for "nuclear explosive activities". The relevant section of US export regulations reveals that this covers technologies used in the "design, development or fabrication" of nuclear weapons. The notice added that the four institutions where the supercomputers would be located were deemed to be "acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States". In a statement given to the IDG news wire, the chipmaker said: "Intel complied with the notification and applied for the licence, which was denied. We are in compliance with the US law." China is now believed to be accelerating its own home-grown chipmaking efforts to boost the power of the four supercomputers and complete the upgrade programme. Although Intel has been denied the chance to sell its Xeon chips to China, the company has signed a large deal to build the Aurora supercomputer at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. When finished that machine is expected to have a peak performance of 180 petaflops.

The contract, which is seen by many industry experts as unnecessary and shady, will see Sibton Switch Systems Limited – a company formed only in August 2015 – run a system to make banks, mobile money platforms and other payment systems interoperable. Initial figure sighted by Daily Guide as the cost submitted by Sibton to the Bank of Ghana (BoG) for the implementation of the retail payment system was GH¢4,667,414,340.82. What raises eyebrows is the fact that two other entities that bid for the same contract – Vas Intel Limited and Mericom Solutions Limited – submitted tender amounts and packages worth GH¢14,094,795.00 and GH¢5,465,396.06 respectively. Vas Intel files for annulment Minutes of a tender committee meeting dated Monday, July 04, 2016, capture the bids submitted by all the three interested companies. The tender committee, chaired by Mr Innocent Asamoah, in its remarks after the evaluation of the tenders, concluded that all three were responsive and met their expectations and so awarded the contract to Sibton Switch Systems Limited. This led Vas InteL Limited to write to the BoG to protest the award of the contract to Sibton Switch Systems Limited. In its letter dated July 25, 2016, Vas Intel wrote that it was conceivably impracticable for the BoG to award a contract to Sibton within six business days after the opening of tenders on July 4, 2016. According to the letter, “All procurement actions taken by the BoG pursuant to Act 663 must be done with a strict and uncompromising adherence to the principles of transparency and fairness so as to protect and preserve public property and interest, as well as the integrity of the laws governing public procurement within the territory of the Republic of Ghana.” Telecom operators in the country are unhappy about moves by the Central Bank to impose on them a third-party company which will be intermediate in mobile money transactions across different networks. Telecom operators outraged The Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications has bared its teeth at the Central Bank and condemned the move to impose Sibton Switch Systems Limited on the players in the industry. In a letter dated January 9, 2017, the chamber argues that the move by the BoG and Sibton is not in alignment with international standards or benchmarks. They also argue that the fees being charged by the switch are too high and have the potential to undermine the successes chalked by the industry. The Telecoms Chamber, after meetings with banks, mobile money operators, and the Central Bank, warned that aside from the outrageous costs of the project, the scope was also not well defined and could run the industry into a state of chaos. Case for GHIPSS The Ghana Interbank Payment and Settlement Systems Limited (GhIPSS) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Ghana. It was incorporated in May 2007 with a mandate to implement and manage interoperable payment system infrastructure for banks and non-bank financial institutions in Ghana. Industry leaders believe that the BoG should annul the deal with Sibton Switch Systems Limited and offer GhIPSS the needed leverage to continue integrating payment systems like they have successfully done over the past decade.

An aggrieved party, Vals Intel Limited, whose GH¢14m bid was rejected says the BoG failed to follow the Public Procurement Law in arriving at the decision to award the contract to Sibton Switch Services Ltd in July 2016. In a lay man's understanding, the BoG contract to Sibton Switch Services Limited (SSSL) is to create a platform that allows customers to electronically transfer monies across different financial networks. You could transfer money from say, Tigo to Airtel money or from E-Zwich to mobile money. SSSL is expected to recoup its GHC4.6bn investment after 20 years by imposing some charges on telecommunications networks and financial institutions which in turn are expected to transfer the charge to their clients. But speaking on Joy FM's Super Morning Show Thursday, the Executive Director of Vals Intel, Kojo Graham raised a redflag over the deal. He said his company had gathered evidence showing "a legion of violations" in the award of the contract. The Executive Director says the BoG is not granted the power by the Procurement law to approve a contract with a value beyond GH¢100,000. For the three restrictive tender bids submitted to the BoG, it requires approval from the Central Tender Review Board. Kojo Graham maintains the evaluation process used to choose Sibton Switch over the two competitors was 'not transparent' and 'discriminatory'. He said although his company was evaluated as not technically good enough, Vals Intel and its technical partner is one of about three companies worldwide that does inter-operability, the services SSSL was expected to offer. Sibton Switch got marks for technical competence although the 14 months old company had never done any work in that area, he explained. Another evaluation criteria required that the BoG visits the sites of the vending companies to inspect and ascertain their capabilities and award marks. He says he never got any site visit and was scored zero. Sibton Switch Services Ltd on the other hand, was only visited after the BoG had awarded the contract to them, he claimed. Kojo Graham also said that although Sibton Switch Services Ltd was awarded the contract it was Sibton Switch Communications that bid for the contract. In effect, the company that won the award did not bid for the contract, he claimed.

Even though it was free to upgrade from Windows 7 or 8 for a year after Windows 10 launched, many people refused to do so Many People Refuse the Free Windows 10 Upgrade, Here's Why Many People Refuse the Free Windows 10 Upgrade, Here's Why People like free stuff. Yet many refuse to upgrade to Windows 10. We have asked them why. Read More . Of course, while Windows 10 is getting new feature updates, Windows 7 and 8.1 are still supported and receiving security updates until 2020 and 2023, respectively… …unless you have Why Windows 7 Won't Work On Intel's Current & Next Gen CPUs Why Windows 7 Won't Work On Intel's Current & Next Gen CPUs Microsoft doesn't want you to use old Windows versions on new hardware. Users on Intel Skylake processors won't receive updates for Windows 7 after July 2017. And next generation processors will be Windows 10 only. Read More a cutting-edge Intel Kaby Lake or AMD Ryzen processor in your machine. Users with those CPUs have stopped receiving all Windows updates on Windows 7 and 8.1, which is both an inconvenience and security risk. This is a controversial move that’s understandable on Microsoft’s part, but frustrating at the same time. Windows 7 could easily turn into another Windows XP situation, where people use the OS long after Microsoft abandons it. To circumvent this, Microsoft is slowly phasing support for Windows 7 from modern hardware. If you’re building a PC with the best components inside, it has to run Windows 10. Chances are if you’re building your own PC, you’ll put Windows 10 on it anyway. But in case you’re still using Windows 7 or 8.1 with a modern processor, you can use a third-party workaround to enable Windows Updates. GitHub user Zeffy has published a small patch that modifies a few system files on your machine to trick Windows into thinking that your CPU is still supported. You can find details on his research on the project page, but it just takes a simple install to fix the problem. He notes that you’ll have to run the patch every time the wuaueng.dll system file has an update. Also, making this change may trigger errors in the SFC command, since Windows will see the change to a system file as a problem. It stinks that Microsoft is cutting support for older operating systems on new machines before their support lifecycles end. While this will hopefully mean a quicker death for Windows 7 when the time comes, this workaround will suffice for now. If you’re still using Windows 7 or 8.1 on a modern system, you’re missing out. Check out the new Creators Update for Windows 10 A Peek Into the Windows 10 Creators Update A Peek Into the Windows 10 Creators Update Microsoft just announced the next major Windows 10 upgrade. The Creators Update will come to 400 million users in Spring 2017. Here are the highlights of Wednesday's Windows 10 event. Read More and all the cool features it offers.

Die P4000-Generation ist die erste große Aktualisierung seit drei Jahren, was auch neue SSD-Controller bedeutet. Intel hat zwei SSDs für Datacenter vorgestellt, die DC P4600 und die DC P4500. Beide Modellreihen sind die Nachfolger der 2014 veröffentlichten Serien DC P3700, DC P3600 und DC P3500. Die neuen Flash-Drives sind PCIe-Steckkarten im HHHL- (Half Height Half Length) oder U.2-Formfaktor (2,5 Zoll mit SFF-8639-Anschluss) und nutzen das NVMe-Protokoll. Die DC P4600 ist mit 2 oder 4 TByte (HHHL) oder mit 1,6 und 3,2 GByte (U.2) verfügbar. Die DC P4500 gibt es mit 1, 2 oder 4 TByte einzig als Steckkarte. Beide neuen Serien basieren auf dem aktuellen 3D-Flash-Speicher von IMFT (Intel Micron Flash Technologies). Ein Die fasst 384 GBit und nutzt 32 Schichten aus TLC-Zellen. Die Chips werden mit einem 12- statt zuvor 18-kanaligen Controller kombiniert, der das NVMe-1.2-Protokoll und PCIe Gen3 x4 unterstützt. Die DC P4500 soll eine sequenzielle Lese- und Schreibgeschwindigkeit von bis zu 3,29 und 1,89 GByte pro Sekunde sowie bis zu 710.000/67.000 Input-/Output-Operationen pro Sekunde erreichen. Für die DC P4600 nennt Intel bis zu 3,28 sowie 2,1 GByte pro Sekunde und 703.000/257.000 IOPS. Diese Werte liegen trotz recht langsamem TLC-Flash höher als bei der P3000-Reihe. Anzeige Rendering einer DC P4000 (Bild: Intel) Die Leistungsaufnahme der DC P4500 beträgt unter Last 10,8 bis 18,3 Watt und bei der DC P4600 sollen es 9,9 bis 20,7 Watt sein. Die Haltbarkeit des kleineren Modells gibt Intel mit 0,7 DWPD (Drive Writes per Day) an, was über dem P3500-Vorgänger mit 0,3 DWPD liegt. Die größere DC P4600 schafft 2,9 DWPD und damit einen Hauch weniger als die DC P3600 bei gleicher Kapazität. Die Garantie der DC-P4000-Familie liegt bei fünf Jahren, Preise liegen nicht vor. Parallel zur Veröffentlichung der DC P4600/4500 hat Intel angekündigt, die Fab 68 im chinesischen Dalian aufzurüsten, um mehr TLC-Flash produzieren und so den steigenden Bedarf befriedigen zu können. Intel hatte das Halbleiterwerk 2015 für 5,5 Milliarden US-Dollar auf die 3D-Fertigung umgestellt. 0 4 10 2 zur Startseite Kommentarübersicht Re: Billigere SSDs Ach 00:49 Mit Ram hat das zwar nichts zu tun(Flash ist kein elektrischer, sondern ein Phase Change...

New Microsoft Surface Laptops: The new Surface laptop flaunts slim and light anodised metallic body and features 13.5-inch screen with PixelSense Display technology, 3:2 display aspect ratio, edge-to-edge Corning Gorilla Glass 3 shield and Alcantara-type keyboard, which resists spills and absorption.

Its prices start at $999 (roughly €913/Rs. 64,076). It is available for pre-order in 20 select markets -- U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom at Microsoft Store, microsoftstore.com and BestBuy.com from May 2 onwards and hit stores on June 15.

It also comes with proprietary Windows Defender and all the security features of the previous Windows 10 OS edition.

Subscribe to our newsletter. Vishal Mathur The Surface Laptop clearly goes up against Apple’s MacBook line-up, particularly the MacBook with the 12-inch display and the MacBook Air 13 with the 13.3-inch display. It is not just a new edition that has been added to the Windows 10 line-up with Windows 10 S, but there is also the Surface Laptop that now becomes the newest addition to the Surface line-up of devices. The basic specifications include the latest generation Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processors, a 13.5-inch PixelSense Display, USB 3.0 and the Intel HD 620 graphics (Core i5) or the Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 (Core i7). Prices start at $999 (around Rs64,000) for the Core i5 machine with 4GB RAM and a 128GB SSD, and jump to $1,299 (around Rs83,000) for the version running 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. If you go for the higher-spec Core i7 variants, the first version with 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD is priced at $1,599 (around Rs1,02,000), while the top-spec version with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD is priced at $2,199 (around Rs1,40,000). Out of the box, these machines will run the Windows 10 S software, with certain restrictions about what software can be run. Incidentally, if you like the looks of the Surface Laptop, but aren’t entirely sure about the Windows 10 S limitations, Microsoft will allow an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for free, until 31 December. Microsoft claims as many as 14.5 hours of battery life on continuous video playback too. The Surface Laptop’s touch display works with the Surface Pen stylus too. The Surface Laptop clearly goes up against Apple’s MacBook line-up, particularly the MacBook with the 12-inch display and the MacBook Air 13 with the 13.3-inch display. The former is priced upwards of Rs1,12,900 while the latter carries a price tag of Rs80,900 onwards but is available at multiple online and offline stores for around Rs55,000 after various discounts and schemes. The Surface Book claims to have superior battery life, to the MacBook Air’s 12-hour battery life, for example. The other big advantage is that the Surface Book runs newer Intel processors and graphics, which could also help battery life figures in real-world usage scenarios. However, for many users, the entire package of a laptop goes beyond just specs. It has a lot to do with the experience of using the software as well, and while Windows 10 remains significantly better than the disaster that was Windows 8, there are still issues that plague it—automatic updates, crashed machines after the Creators Update, inconsistent performance because of hardware and much more. While Microsoft is keenly pushing this to specific users for educational usage, the reality is that such powerful specification and the slick form factor will have a much wider appeal. And at these price points, it will catch the eye of anyone who was planning to buy a MacBook. However, in its standard avatar, the Surface Laptop with the Windows 10 S operating system is no match for the MacOS, simply because of the limitations in terms of running software, games and peripheral drivers. For that, you will need to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which though free till the end of the year, will add $49 more to the overall cost. It will be interesting to see how, and if at all, Apple responds to the Surface Laptop. It will be interesting to see how quickly it flies off the shelves once it hits the stores on 15 June, and that could be when Apple may consider taking some corrective action. But if the previous Surface device sales are anything to go by, Apple wouldn’t be worried about Mac loyalists switching camps just yet.

Now it's chasing another category many believe is Apple's to lose: the $1,000 laptop for everyone. Microsoft, a company once derided for buggy software, unstable hardware and indifferent design, debuted the Surface Laptop on Tuesday. The machine boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and gets a claimed 14 hours of battery life (two better than Apple's MacBook Air). Weighing in at 2.76 pounds, about a quarter-pound less than the Air, the Surface Laptop boasts a 13.5-inch screen and is one of the thinnest and lightest products in its class. Microsoft is targeting the education market-and even threw laptops inside backpacks stuffed with textbooks, notepads and keys to simulate college-kid wear-and-tear. Yet the Surface Laptop's affordable price, portability and features could appeal to a far broader audience-including Mac loyalists. During a tour at Microsoft's sprawling Redmond, Washington, headquarters last month, the Surface team showed off the $999 machine's evolution, starting from the first prototype-little more than a mashup of parts from older Microsoft devices-to the finished product. The engineers and designers spent two years working on the machine, creating multiple prototypes and inviting partners like Intel to set up shop right on campus. The team's pride was evident. After years of struggling to crack the hardware market, they were finally building products they themselves would use. "This product is a reflection of our learnings since we started this team," said Panos Panay, who oversees Surface-brand hardware and has been around long enough to have experienced first-hand the early flops and later successes. Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay's team adhered to a "fail-fast" philosophy that emphasized constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mockups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard, the circuit board containing a computer's main components, to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. Microsoft, Apple Scramble to Capture US Schools After Google's Success In an effort to make the surface around the keyboard more pleasing to the eye and touch, designers used Alcantara, a synthetic microfiber that's more durable than the suede it mimics. The team brought in dozens of giant rolls of fabric and spent six months choosing colors, from a dark burgundy to a platinum hue. Microsoft already uses Alcantara in the covers of its tablets, but that didn't stop the team from taking a field trip to a BMW dealership to see how the material worked as upholstery. Microsoft chose Alcantara, Panay said, because "it gets rid of that cold, sterile feeling." The designers couldn't poke holes in the Alcantara for the speakers so they figured out a way to transmit sound via gaps in the keyboard. The audio was tested in one of many "anechoic" chambers, rooms that don't let sound in or out. The finished laptop, milled from a slab of custom aluminum alloy, has no screws or holes, save for a pair of microphones to converse with Cortana, Microsoft's voice assistant. With its hardware and software teams working together, Microsoft created a new version of its operating system, called Windows 10 S, that's tailored to the laptop. Terry Myerson, who runs both groups, said inspiration for the "S" came from the auto industry, which often uses the letter to flag sporty, high-performance models. The new OS is designed to prevent the computer from slowing down over time and remaining predictable even if under assault from malware-a selling point long touted by Apple's iOS. (Other manufacturers will install Windows 10 S into their own machines, giving Microsoft a way to compete with cheap machines running Google's Chrome OS.) Pushing the education market theme, Panay said the Surface Laptop will be "same on commencement day as it is on graduation day." (Users can still install Windows 10 Pro over Windows 10 S, but they won't be able to switch back.) The OS also runs only apps offered on Microsoft's app store. "Everything that runs on this device is going to be trusted and verified by Microsoft," Myerson said. Panay said the new OS unlocks performance and features not found on many Windows-based machines. The laptop wakes from sleep almost instantly when the lid is opened, and takes seconds to turn on from a fully powered-off state. The slick computer, which will be available June 15, arrives at an auspicious moment for Microsoft. The company is riding the success of its Surface Studio and Surface tablets (though sales slipped in the the most recent quarter, dragging down total revenue). Meanwhile, Apple has come under fire from Mac owners for focusing on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch-and letting the Mac lineup languish. The Air hasn't had a serious makeover since 2010, just a modest upgrade two years ago. Stung by the criticism from the disgruntled faithful, Apple has pledged to do better. Panay said Microsoft has made its own luck, saying his team "created what we know our customers are asking for." Of course, luring Mac devotees will take some doing because Apple's OS syncs almost flawlessly with the iPhone, making it a snap to transfer photos, send and receive text messages and make online payments from a Mac. Users will lose that ability if they switch to the Surface Laptop. And despite the impressive hardware, people are used to the Mac interface, another sticking point. Finally, students may balk at paying almost $1,000 when they can get an adequate laptop for much less. Pete Kyriacou, who helps manage the devices team, is sanguine about the challenges facing Microsoft's first real laptop. "In the end," he said, "it's going to appeal to everyone." © 2017 Bloomberg L.P. For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

Millions of Intel workstation and server chips have harbored a security flaw that can be potentially exploited to remotely control and infect systems with spyware. The news reaches us today through the register who picked up on it in depth. The bug is in Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT), Standard Manageability (ISM) and Small Business Technology (SBT) firmware versions 6 to 11.6. According to Intel , the security hole allows "an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by these products: That means it is possible for hackers to log into a vulnerable computer's hardware – right under the nose of the operating system – and silently tamper with the machine, install virtually undetectable malware, and so on, using AMT's features. This is potentially possible across the network because AMT has direct access to the computer's network hardware. These insecure management features have been available in various, but not all, Intel chipsets for nearly a decade, starting with the Nehalem Core i7 in 2008, all the way up to this year's Kaby Lake Core parts. Crucially, the vulnerability lies at the very heart of a machine's silicon, out of sight of the operating system, its applications and any antivirus. The programming blunder can only be fully addressed with a firmware-level update, and it is present in millions of chips. It is effectively a backdoor into computers all over the world. The vulnerable AMT service is part of Intel's vPro suite of processor features. If vPro is present and enabled on a system, and AMT is provisioned, unauthenticated miscreants on your network can access the computer's AMT controls and hijack them. If AMT isn't provisioned, a logged-in user can still potentially exploit the bug to gain admin-level powers. If you don't have vPro or AMT present at all, you are in the clear. Intel reckons the vulnerability affects business and server boxes, because they tend to have vPro and AMT present and enabled, and not systems aimed at ordinary folks, which typically don't. You can follow this document to check if your system is vulnerable – and you should. Basically, if you're using a machine with vPro and AMT features enabled, you are at risk. Modern Apple Macs, although they use Intel chips, do not ship with the AMT software, and are thus in the clear. According to Intel today, this critical security vulnerability, labeled CVE-2017-5689, was discovered and reported in March by Maksim Malyutin at Embedi. To get Intel's patch to close the hole, you'll have to pester your machine's manufacturer for a firmware update, and in the meantime, try the mitigations here. These updates, although developed by Intel, must be cryptographically signed and distributed by the manufacturers. It is hoped they will be pushed out to customers within the next few weeks. They should be installed ASAP. "In March 2017 a security researcher identified and reported to Intel a critical firmware vulnerability in business PCs and devices that utilize Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM), or Intel Small Business Technology (SBT)," an Intel spokesperson said. "Consumer PCs are not impacted by this vulnerability. We are not aware of any exploitation of this vulnerability. We have implemented and validated a firmware update to address the problem, and we are cooperating with equipment manufacturers to make it available to end-users as soon as possible." Specifically, according to Intel: An unprivileged network attacker could gain system privileges to provisioned Intel manageability SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel Standard Manageability (ISM). An unprivileged local attacker could provision manageability features gaining unprivileged network or local system privileges on Intel manageability SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel Small Business Technology (SBT). Apparently, Intel's Small Business Technology is not vulnerable to privilege escalation via the network. Whether you're using AMT, ISM or SBT, the fixed firmware versions to look out for are, depending on the processor family affected: First-gen Core family: 6.2.61.3535 Second-gen Core family: 7.1.91.3272 Third-gen Core family: 8.1.71.3608 Fourth-gen Core family: 9.1.41.3024 and 9.5.61.3012 Fifth-gen Core family: 10.0.55.3000 Sixth-gen Core family: 11.0.25.3001 Seventh-gen Core family: 11.6.27.3264 "The short version is that every Intel platform with AMT, ISM, and SBT from Nehalem in 2008 to Kaby Lake in 2017 has a remotely exploitable security hole," explained semiconductor industry journo Charlie Demerjian earlier today. First of all, does your system even support AMT? AMT requires a few things: 1) A supported CPU 2) A supported chipset 3) Supported network hardware 4) The ME firmware to contain the AMT firmware Merely having a "vPRO" CPU and chipset isn't sufficient - your system vendor also needs to have licensed the AMT code. Under Linux, if lspci doesn't show a communication controller with "MEI" or "HECI" in the description, AMT isn't running and you're safe. If it does show an MEI controller, that still doesn't mean you're vulnerable - AMT may still not be provisioned. If you reboot you should see a brief firmware splash mentioning the ME. Hitting ctrl+p at this point should get you into a menu which should let you disable AMT. Fixing this requires a system firmware update in order to provide new ME firmware (including an updated copy of the AMT code). Many of the affected machines are no longer receiving firmware updates from their manufacturers, and so will probably never get a fix.  Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ...

Agreed - just look at the phrasing of the article. It repeatedly explains how and why these are security risks but I didn't see anywhere they mentioned what these features were intended for (in a secure manner), nor are they apologetic for the security risks. At least they provided patches. It's interesting to me how deliberate some of it was. For example the statement "If AMT isn't provisioned, a logged-in user can still potentially exploit the bug to gain admin-level powers." but honestly, how many system admins know about what AMT is and/or know they can do something about it? So basically what they're saying is "despite that we [should have] known about this 'bug' for nearly a decade, we never told users to provision AMT nor supplied a patch to Windows to do it for you". They basically intentionally left it alone.

I don't know exactly when this was implemented relative to Obama's inauguration, but whether Obama wanted/approved of this or not, the timing of the implementation would've been way too quick. The checks and balances of the government alone would have made the process take up too much time, but you also have to consider Intel's software and hardware engineers had to design and create these features. Together, I'm sure that likely would've taken at least a year to accomplish. However, I wouldn't be surprised if Obama was aware of this "bug", and, I don't think the ending of his presidency is related to this either. Just to clarify, I'm not being a tinfoil hat here, just speculating - I honestly couldn't care less if the CIA or NSA wants to spy on me. mieciu184 Newbie Posts: 2 Joined: 2017-05-02 #5427164 Posted on: 05/02/2017 04:32 PM Took em 9 years to notice the bug nice Picolete Member Guru Posts: 101 Joined: 2014-12-09 #5427223 Posted on: 05/02/2017 06:24 PM Quote: Originally Posted by mieciu184 took em 9 years to notice the bug nice :d "bug" Turanis Maha Guru Posts: 1039 Joined: 2014-08-15 #5427227 Posted on: 05/02/2017 06:37 PM At least!

Mark GurmanDina Bass Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. Photo: Bloomberg San Francisco/Seattle: Microsoft has already cracked the professional and creative markets with inventive tablets and a desktop that turns into a virtual drafting table. Now it’s chasing another category many believe is Apple’s to lose: the $1,000 laptop for everyone. Microsoft Corp., a company once derided for buggy software, unstable hardware and indifferent design, debuted the Surface Laptop on Tuesday. The machine boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and gets a claimed 14 hours of battery life (two better than Apple’s MacBook Air). Weighing in at 2.76 pounds, about a quarter-pound less than the Air, the Surface Laptop boasts a 13.5-inch screen and is one of the thinnest and lightest products in its class. Microsoft is targeting the education market—and even threw laptops inside backpacks stuffed with textbooks, notepads and keys to simulate college-kid wear-and-tear. Yet the Surface Laptop’s affordable price, portability and features could appeal to a far broader audience—including Mac loyalists. ALSO READ : Microsoft launches $999 laptop in hardware push to college students During a tour at Microsoft’s sprawling Redmond, Washington, headquarters last month, the Surface team showed off the machine’s evolution, starting from the first prototype—little more than a mashup of parts from older Microsoft devices—to the finished product. The engineers and designers spent two years working on the machine, creating multiple prototypes and inviting partners like Intel to set up shop right on campus. The team’s pride was evident. After years of struggling to crack the hardware market, they were finally building products they themselves would use. “This product is a reflection of our learnings since we started this team,” said Panos Panay, who oversees Surface-brand hardware and has been around long enough to have experienced first-hand the early flops and later successes. Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay’s team adhered to a “fail-fast” philosophy that emphasized constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mockups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard, the circuit board containing a computer’s main components, to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. In an effort to make the surface around the keyboard more pleasing to the eye and touch, designers used Alcantara, a synthetic microfibre that’s more durable than the suede it mimics. The team brought in dozens of giant rolls of fabric and spent six months choosing colours, from a dark burgundy to a platinum hue. Microsoft already uses Alcantara in the covers of its tablets, but that didn’t stop the team from taking a field trip to a BMW dealership to see how the material worked as upholstery. Microsoft chose Alcantara, Panay said, because “it gets rid of that cold, sterile feeling.” The designers couldn’t poke holes in the Alcantara for the speakers so they figured out a way to transmit sound via gaps in the keyboard. The audio was tested in one of many “anechoic” chambers, rooms that don’t let sound in or out. The finished laptop, milled from a slab of custom aluminum alloy, has no screws or holes, save for a pair of microphones to converse with Cortana, Microsoft’s voice assistant. With its hardware and software teams working together, Microsoft created a new version of its operating system, called Windows 10 S, that’s tailored to the laptop. Terry Myerson, who runs both groups, said inspiration for the “S” came from the auto industry, which often uses the letter to flag sporty, high-performance models. The new OS is designed to prevent the computer from slowing down over time and remaining predictable even if under assault from malware—a selling point long touted by Apple’s iOS. (Other manufacturers will install Windows 10 S into their own machines, giving Microsoft a way to compete with cheap machines running Google’s Chrome OS.) Pushing the education market theme, Panay said the Surface Laptop will be “same on commencement day as it is on graduation day.” (Users can still install Windows 10 Pro over Windows 10 S, but they won’t be able to switch back.) The OS also runs only apps offered on Microsoft’s app store. “Everything that runs on this device is going to be trusted and verified by Microsoft,” Myerson said. Panay said the new OS unlocks performance and features not found on many Windows-based machines. The laptop wakes from sleep almost instantly when the lid is opened, and takes seconds to turn on from a fully powered-off state. The slick computer, which will be available 15 June, arrives at an auspicious moment for Microsoft. The company is riding the success of its Surface Studio and Surface tablets (though sales slipped in the most recent quarter, dragging down total revenue). Meanwhile, Apple has come under fire from Mac owners for focusing on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch—and letting the Mac lineup languish. The Air hasn’t had a serious makeover since 2010, just a modest upgrade two years ago. Stung by the criticism from the disgruntled faithful, Apple has pledged to do better. Panay said Microsoft has made its own luck, saying his team “created what we know our customers are asking for.” Of course, luring Mac devotees will take some doing because Apple’s OS syncs almost flawlessly with the iPhone, making it a snap to transfer photos, send and receive text messages and make online payments from a Mac. Users will lose that ability if they switch to the Surface Laptop. And despite the impressive hardware, people are used to the Mac interface, another sticking point. Finally, students may balk at paying almost $1,000 when they can get an adequate laptop for much less. Pete Kyriacou, who helps manage the devices team, is sanguine about the challenges facing Microsoft’s first real laptop. “In the end,” he said, “it’s going to appeal to everyone.” Bloomberg Mark GurmanDina Bass Topics: Microsoft Laptop Surface Laptop college students Apple More From Livemint READ MORE India faces piquant situation at WTO In search of a ‘Dharna Chowk’ in Hyderabad IPL 2017: Rahul Tripathi fires Supergiants to 4-wicket win over Knight Riders First Published: Tue, May 02 2017. 11 05 PM IST Editor's Picks The fault in IPL match schedules Cabinet clears ordinance to tackle Rs9.64 trillion bad loans at India’s banks Why India should tax agricultural income Latest News In search of a ‘Dharna Chowk’ in Hyderabad IPL 2017: Rahul Tripathi fires Supergiants to 4-wicket win over Knight Riders Global gold prices rise, but hold near six-week low on Fed rate hike worries Affordable home loans grew 23% over the last five years: TransUnion Cibil report Govt paves way for easy exploration of oil and gas reserves in forest areas Mint On Sunday The private lives of Delhi’s LGBT youth Getting Justin Bieber to India is very, very hard work 2003 World Cup final: If only India had chosen to bat first...

Travis Pope05/02/2017 There was a time when almost no one seriously competed with Apple’s MacBook line of laptops. The machines were too well designed for cheaper Windows laptops to compete against. Even those that matched its price and offered improved hardware couldn’t match its sales. The Surface Laptop, Microsoft’s newly announced Windows 10 PC, will take the battle to Apple this summer. The Surface Laptop hopes to become the college status symbol that the MacBook Air has been by offering long battery life and a thin profile that’s easy to stuff into a bag. Microsoft is also hoping that its compatibility with some Surface accessories and Microsoft software will make it the obvious choice for students. The Microsoft Surface Laptop. Read: Surface Laptop Release Date, Pre-Orders & Features How does the Surface Laptop compare to the MacBook Air? Which should students buy when the summer arrives and they’re looking for their university laptop? You’ll be surprised how easy this decision is. Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air: Internals The Surface Laptop is made of up Aluminum. That’s the same material that previous devices in the Surface line-up have used. Microsoft mixed its Surface Book design with the way a Surface Pro 4 looks when paired with a cover. The lid and body are made of metal, but the keyboard deck is covered in the Alcantara fabric that is also used for the Surface Signature Type Cover. The device comes in Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt and Gold, depending on which model you order. Read: 6 Best Surface Pro 4 Keyboards They each weigh 2.76 pounds. They are only.57-inches thick from top to bottom. Its 13.5-inch display has a resolution of 2256 x 1504 pixels. It also uses the Intel HD 620 graphics in its least expensive model. Upgraded versions use Intel Iris Plus 640 technology. It was the MacBook Air that ushered in the era of ultra-thin laptops. Which is why it’s ironic that it measures 0.68 inches from top to bottom. It’s thicker than Surface Laptop. It has the same all Aluminum design that it started out with. It weighs 2.96 pounds, which is slightly more than the new Surface Laptop. MacBook Air The MacBook Air’s 13.3-inch display has a resolution of 1440 by 900 pixels. Videos will be less crisp on the Air than the Surface Laptop. There’s no touch experience because it’d be wasted on the Air if there was a touchscreen. MacOS isn’t made for anything but a mouse and keyboard. The entry-level models come with a 1.6GHz Dual-Core processor and 8GB of RAM DDR3 RAM. An option lets you add Intel’s 2.2GHz Core i7 processor but no additional RAM. Read: 2015 MacBook Air Release Retina vs MacBook Air: 5 Exciting Details The MacBook Air and Surface Laptop both cost a minimum of $999, and if the MacBook Air sounds underpowered compared to the Surface Laptop is because it is. Microsoft is attempting to go after a huge weak spot in Apple’s line-up. Rather than refresh the MacBook Air, Apple has focused on dropping ports and slimming down the mainline New MacBook. The only thing that makes Microsoft’s comparisons to the MacBook Air fair is Apple’s refusal to drop the price of the slimmer MacBook and its continual sale for $999 on the company’s website and in stores. Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air: Features The MacBook Air is the last Apple mobile computer to offer a MagSafe 2 power plug. It’s one of the few that offers two USB 3.0 ports, a Thunderbolt 2 port and a headset jack too. The current mainstream New MacBook dumps all that for a single USB Type-C port instead. The SDXC card slot allows the MacBook to pull video and photos off cameras without attaching a cable or hub. The trackpad uses Apple’s multi-touch technology to emulate some of the same gestures you’d use on an iPad to navigate and browser. The Surface Laptop features a full multi-touch display, meaning it can detect 10 different points of input. The company has also gone and added support for its other Surface accessories. Surface Dial lets you manipulate apps and programs naturally. Surface Pen lets you write in your apps, and the Surface Connect port is for docking and charging. There’s a Mini DisplayPort, a headset jack, and a full-size USB 3.0 port. You can sign into the laptop using the front-facing Windows Hello camera that the Surface Pro 4 pioneered. The MacBook Air runs the latest version of MacOS, while the Surface Laptop will run a new version of Windows 10 called Windows 10 S. Windows 10 S is just like the regular version of Windows 10 except that you have to get all your apps and programs from the Windows Store. That means no Chrome and no iTunes unless the companies that make those programs decides to bring them to the Windows Store or you upgrade the operating system. For the first year, Microsoft will upgrade Surface Laptop buyers to a version of Windows 10 without this limitation for free. The company will throw in a subscription to Office 365 until October 2017. After the free period, upgrading to Windows 10 Pro will cost Surface Laptop buyers $50. It’s worth noting that Apple gives away its iWork suite of apps to all buyers. That offer doesn’t expire and neither do the apps. The MacBook Air lasts 12 hours between charges. The Surface Laptop lasts 14 hours. There’s something that Microsoft can’t best with hardware alone that the MacBook Air has to its credit: the iPhone and iPad. Both are so successful that you may have one already. The services and iTunes content that’s available on your iPhone can be loaded into Windows 10 with iTunes. However, Surface Laptop can’t replicate how easy it is to switch tasks or reply to messages on your iPhone with a MacBook Air. Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air: Which Should You Buy? The MacBook Air is the original thin-and-light notebook. It arrived even before the original Surface devices did. Steve Jobs revealed the notebook by pulling it out of an inter-office envelope. Its days are numbered though, and even Microsoft knows it. For the same price as the MacBook Air you can get a Surface Laptop with a modern processor, modern design and modern integrated graphics, thinner profile, lighter chassis and more battery life. The 4GB of RAM in the entry Surface Laptop is clearly a misstep that users will have to decide if they’re okay with. So is the use of Windows 10 S instead of Windows 10 Home. After 2017, users won’t be happy that they have to pay Microsoft to do something that has been free in existing versions of Windows that they’ve used. Look into the Surface Laptop, if you’d planned for an upcoming MacBook Air purchase to be your first foray into Apple’s hardware. The Surface Laptop may have enough advantages to keep you from leaving. If you love MacOS already, you should consider the New MacBook. It’s a bit more expensive, but you’ll all the latest features Apple’s offers. At this point, the MacBook Air is a bit old. The Surface Laptop arrives on store shelves June 15th. You can place a pre-order now from the Microsoft Store. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

According to IC Insights predictions based on recent trends and shifts, the world’s top smartphone and TV vendor could also become the number one chipmaker for the first time in history during Q2 2017, breaking an uninterrupted Intel supremacy dating as far back as 1993. You may have expected Qualcomm or even Broadcom parent Avago to challenge Intel after costly acquisitions and mergers probably aimed at just that, but Samsung has pretty much managed to rise by itself from posting semiconductor sales of around $9.3 billion between January and March 2016 to no less than $13.5B over the same timeframe of this year. Up next, “if memory market prices continue to hold or increase through the second quarter and the balance of this year”, which both Samsung and analysts strongly believe will be the case, the chaebol should “charge into the top stop and displace Intel” from the chip-selling chart’s peak. We’re looking of course at a tiny projected gap of half a billion dollars in chip revenues ($14.9 vs. $14.4 billion), which Intel could theoretically reverse in the ensuing quarter, though it’s far more likely Samsung will retain its newfound control over the hugely lucrative industry through the end of 2017, and possibly beyond.

VK_KHX_multiview Lands In Mesa 17.2 Git For Intel's ANV Vulkan Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Vulkan on 3 May 2017 at 05:25 PM EDT. 1 Comment The VK_KHX_multiview Vulkan extension that's important for VR use-cases is now found in Mesa 17.2-devel for the Intel ANV driver. After being in the works for a while and available via patches, the VK_KHX_multiview support and associated SPIR-V SPV_KHR_multiview extension is now in mainline Mesa Git for the Intel open-source driver. VK_KHX_multiview is similar to OpenGL's OVR_multiview extension spearheaded by Oculus. Pull from Mesa Git for the many commits that landed a short time ago for this Vulkan multi-view support. Yes, this is one of the Vulkan experimental extensions as denoted by the "KHX" while the firmed up version of it will likely be coming later this year (SIGGRAPH perhaps?). 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

At the very least, it’s provided a stable platform for Microsoft’s hardware partners to build great machines. Lenovo has certainly taken advantage of this opportunity. It’s making some of the best laptops it ever has. The ThinkPad 13 2017, available from Lenovo for as little as $699, isn’t good-looking or flashy. It’s not a laptop for those that need something ultra-slim or ultra-powerful. The ThinkPad 13 2017 is a workhorse, an everyday PC that’s perfect for handling the tasks that office workers need to get accomplished without worrying about battery life or ports. This laptop is a classic ThinkPad in every way. That is, Lenovo hopes that decent battery life, a glare-free display and durable shell are enough to overcome its less exciting attributes and an important port that’s missing. It’s a gamble, but one that has paid off for the ThinkPad line in the past. Lenovo ThinkPad 13 Review: Summary That gamble certainly pays off here, too. Most of the essentials you need to stay productive throughout your day are present in the Lenovo ThinkPad 13. Decent build quality and a slate of options allow you to create the productivity laptop that you want with only the features you care about. ThinkPad 13 2017 2017 Review: Design & Internals The ThinkPad 13 2017 is the textbook definition of a device with an understated design. There’s very little here that indicates it’s cutting edge. Its bezels aren’t so thin that they almost disappear. Its keyboard deck doesn’t nearly disappear when you look on at it from the left or right side. Matte black plastic dominates the outer shell of the ThinkPad 13 2017. Even still, it is as rugged as the other ThinkPad notebooks, even if it doesn’t feel cool to the touch or high-end. When closed, the lid has just the ThinkPad logo and a status indicator that lets you know when it is sleeping. The plastic is used for every surface of the notebook, including the keyboard deck and bezels. Buyers can opt for cold MacBook-like aluminum silver skin during the ordering process, Lenovo says. The outer shell has a texture that the keyboard deck lacks. Not extending it to the keyboard deck was a smart move on Lenovo’s part. It’d have grated on your palm as you typed had they used it for the entire machine. Even with all the plastic, the standard version of the notebook has passed the military durability tests that Lenovo puts all ThinkPad laptops through. This is a laptop that can handle being jostled in a bag or dropped from a medium height. It’ll have a scuff, but it’ll continue working. It only weighs 3.17 pounds. Internals On the left edge there’s an air vent that cools the notebook. This is great news for people who are right-handed and frequently find themselves using a mouse next to their notebook. The traditional ThinkPad power plug, an always-on USB 3.0 port and OneLink+ port are on this side. This positioning is smart because you can get your laptop going when you arrive at the office without much work. The right edge of the notebook holds 2 more USB 3.0 ports, a USB Type-C port, HDMI port, media card reader and headsets jack. The USB Type-C port is Lenovo future proofing the ThinkPad 13 2017. More and more phones and laptops are using it to connect to monitors, televisions, hard drives and docking accessories. Like other machines in Lenovo’s lineup, the ThinkPad 13 2017’s internals can be customized to suit your needs and wants. Every version comes with a 13.3-inch display, but whether your machine has a 1080p display with touch technology is up to you. You can add 16GB of RAM and a 256GB solid state drive for faster loading times. These types of drives also make moving large files on your PC from place to place easier on you. Lenovo offers up to an Intel Core i5 processor with this model, which is perfect for what most people will use this machine for. ThinkPad 13 2017 Review: Experience Gotta Be Mobile’s ThinkPad 13 2017 came with a less powerful Intel Core i3 processor that was still adequate. These laptops use the current 7th Generation Intel Core technology, meaning they produce less heat and handle heavy loads better and are great for 4K video. Of course, watching 4K video on this machine won’t be a high priority for most, they’ll have to pair it with a 4K display using the USB Type-C port. This USB Port is wired up to prevent surges that can come from faulty USB Type-C devices. The always great ThinkPad keyboard is solid. Because it’s thicker than some of the Lenovo’s other machines, there’s more travel for each key. It’s still comfortable but can sometimes feel a tad mushy if you’re not used to it. It’s a fine keyboard, but you’ll have to adjust to where Lenovo sticks its CTRL key, as you need to with all ThinkPad notebooks. The touchpad and TrackPoint are as solid as they usually are in other ThinkPads. I did find myself adjusting the sensitivity of the trackpad. Its default setting didn’t feel that responsive to me. Read: Windows 10 Anniversary Update Review I’m big on productivity apps. That is, I spend my days inside of web browsers, word processors and photo editing software. In the afternoons, I throw in a web radio streaming app and a Sublime Text program that makes it easy to edit the files that power my personal website. With 80% brightness, the ThinkPad 13 2017’s internal battery lasted around 9 hours for me. Dialing back the brightness to 25% got me a lot closer to the 14 hours of battery life that Lenovo promises. Turning on Windows 10’s Battery Saver was the only way I could hit the promised 15 hours of battery life and stay productive. Speaking of Windows 10, I was taken aback by just how many extras and programs Lenovo decided not to put into this notebook. A Lenovo Settings app handles any features the company has added. Sometimes it throws you to the Windows 10 Settings app instead of making things more confusing for you. I liked that. I liked that a lot. This is a side effect of Lenovo adopting Microsoft’s Signature Program. Signature gets you a laptop or desktop that’s free of extra software. That is unless Microsoft includes that extra software in Windows itself. I’ll never forgive the company for sticking Candy Crush into every mainstream edition of Windows 10. Also, during daily activities this notebook is silent. There’s no gentle hum of a fan when checking email or browsing the web. More laptops need to be this quiet. The only thing I didn’t like about the ThinkPad 13 2017 was the fingerprint reader. The ThinkPad 13 2017 features a swipe-style reader that is a little more irksome to use than the version that Lenovo makes available with the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. The Carbon’s version seems to unlock the PC in less time than this version does. It still worked well with Windows Hello to secure the PC, which is what it’s meant to do.

ThinkPad 13 2017 Review: Should You Buy? Routines are nice. We do things over again until they become second nature because they’re comfortable for us. Squeaky wheels get the grease, wheels that stay silent get some subconscious appreciation. Lots of people say that the ThinkPad line is stale. They complain that its looks haven’t changed. They gawk at its TrackPoint. The ThinkPad 13 2017 is the only evidence needed to show that keeping things the same is sometimes prudent. It offers great battery and solid options. It’s not the thinnest notebook ever, but it’ll act as a companion for any office worker just fine. It’s future-proofed enough to enable new ways to work when you’re ready for the latest docks and ports. Sometimes you don’t need something exciting. Sometimes reliability is enough. The ThinkPad 13 2017 proves it. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website
Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Intel Editorial: Intel Will Succeed in Autonomous Driving – I Bet My Career on It SANTA CLARA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The following is an opinion editorial provided by Doug Davis, senior vice president and general manager of the Automated Driving Group (ADG) at Intel Corporation: For more than 30 years, I have climbed out of bed to go work at Intel. But never in those 30 years have I been more excited to do so than I am right now leading Intel’s autonomous vehicle team. Don’t get me wrong – I’ve had an absolutely wonderful career and have worked on some programs that have had a significant impact on the world around us. But the chance to solve one of the most complex technology challenges of our time, the opportunity to help the auto industry reinvent transportation, the potential to save a million lives every year – those things are unlike anything I’ve done before. They’re the reason I postponed my retirement. Press Kits: 2017 Autonomous Driving Workshop | Autonomous Driving at Intel I have unwavering confidence that Intel will succeed in autonomous driving. We have an astounding breadth and depth of experience and the world’s finest technology toolkit to apply to this challenge. We have tapped resources from across the company and have added experienced talent from the automotive industry. Our teams are operating in high gear and will deliver the necessary technology breakthroughs. Here’s why: First: We are already demonstrating great progress Intel technology is in hundreds of autonomous test vehicles on the roads today. Not all carmakers are talking about who is powering the brains in their test cars lest they give away secrets. But the fact is many of them are using Intel. I encourage you to open their trunks, boots or hatchbacks and see which tech company they are relying on the most to provide the brains for their development vehicles. Today we are also showing off one of the first of approximately 40 highly automated driving (HAD) cars promised from BMW, Intel and Mobileye this year. It was less than a year ago that the three companies announced plans to bring highly and fully autonomous vehicles into series production by 2021 through the development of a common platform. We are now successfully demonstrating that platform and are preparing plans to bring it to market for other OEMs and tier-one suppliers to accelerate their programs. Stay tuned for more on that front. Second: We are prepared for the data challenge The single most important factor in autonomous driving is data – how best to process it, manage it, move it, store it, share it and learn from it. From PCs to data centers and everywhere in between, no company’s silicon has analyzed, computed and moved more data than Intel’s. As we move down the road toward autonomous cars, the data challenge will become much more complex and require new ways to work with data inside the vehicle, throughout the network and across the cloud. To ensure we have the absolute right strategy to handle that data challenge, we’ve installed the first of several planned data centers dedicated to autonomous driving. These unique labs will be used for algorithm development and training, as well as for understanding the special infrastructure needs for autonomous driving data movement and storage. Researchers will continually feed information from Intel’s test cars into these data centers to train neural networks and improve machine learning algorithms. And, we’re busy building similar labs with customers and partners. Which brings me to artificial intelligence (AI). Mastering AI both inside the car and in the data center will be essential to the autonomous driving data challenge. Here it’s important to remember that autonomous driving isn’t a game. When cars are thinking and acting without human intervention, they must be able to do so in a safe and trustworthy way. The artificial intelligence needed to make this happen isn’t just computer vision – think voice, decision-making, personalization and preferences. Each of those AI workloads needs a different set of algorithms and likely different kind of processing for optimum performance. If all we needed was a supercomputer to handle the autonomous driving data challenge, our work would be done. Third: We’ve built big industries before and will do it again I’ve said this before: Autonomous driving will accelerate when the industry comes together to align on common platforms and technologies. That enables developers to go quickly and in volume while still differentiating their solutions in software. How do I know this? Let’s look at the PC and server industries as examples: Before 1980, the computer industry was highly proprietary, serving primarily researchers, big companies and hobbyists. This changed a few years later when IBM built the first personal computer using mostly off-the-shelf parts and an outsourced operating system. These early PCs were the base for a standardized approach to computer design that led to faster evolution of technology and 150x growth in two decades. The data center is similar. After mainframes came microcomputers that enabled some flexibility and cost-effectiveness. But it was the adaptation of PC technology that allowed data centers to evolve quickly to handle the data that came with the internet. IDC reported there were 1.8 zettabytes of data generated in 2011, and the agency estimates we will generate over 40 zettabytes by 2020. Only through standardized solutions have we been able to grow the industry fast enough to keep up. Which brings me back to autonomous cars. There are plenty of naysayers who think Intel’s experience in enabling rapid scaling cannot be replicated in autonomous driving. At the same time, there are plenty in the automotive industry who don’t understand how open collaboration can enable differentiation and innovation. I understand the skepticism, but from years of experience, I know that technology solves problems best when it’s organized around common platforms and predictable interfaces. Without a doubt, that’s the fastest way forward on our autonomous journey. As a society, I don’t think we can afford to continue down a proprietary path. The cost in time, money and human lives is too great. The faster we can deliver autonomous driving technology and take humans out of the driver’s seat, the faster we can save lives. It’s that simple – and that important. And I am confident Intel will not only succeed in helping our partners put self-driving cars on the roads, we will do so in the fastest, smartest way possible. Doug Davis is senior vice president and general manager of the Automated Driving Group (ADG) at Intel Corporation.

CEO Brian Krzanich Wednesday (May 3) announced a new leader for its Data Center Group (DCG) due to a leave of absence being taken by Diane Bryant, the business unit's president. Krzanich said in an email to Intel employees that Bryant would be stepping away for six to eight months to tend to a personal family matter. Navin Shenoy, formerly general manager of the Client Computing Group, was named general manager of the DCG. Diane Bryant Krzanich said in the email to employees that, due to the extended duration of Bryant's leave, an interim leader for the DCG was not a possibility. The DCG is Intel's second largest business unit in terms of revenue, trailing only the Client Computing Group. In the first quarter, the DCG had revenue of about $4.2 billion, or about 28 percent of the company's total revenue for the quarter. "DCG is a central part of our transformation and corporate strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution," Krzanich wrote in the email. Bryant became leader of the DCG in 2012 after four years as Intel's chief information officer. In the email, Krzanich credited Bryant with transforming DCG "from a server-centric group to a business that spans servers, network and storage across all end-user segments, and with product lines and business models that extend beyond the traditional." He added, "I want to thank Diane for her outstanding leadership and I will announce her next role upon her return." Navin Shenoy Prior to becoming GM of the Client Computing Group, Shenoy was general manager for Intel Asia Pacific. Earlier in his Intel career, Shenoy spent three years as technical assistant to former Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini, assisting Otellini in the development and implementation of Intel’s long-term corporate strategy and the daily management of the company's business. Krzanich appointed Murthy Renduchintala, president of Intel's Client and IoT Businesses and Systems Architecture Group, acting leader of the Client Computing Group. Krzanich said more information about the succession plan for Shenoy as GM of the Client Computing Group would be communicated in coming weeks. —Dylan McGrath is the editor-in-chief of EE Times.

X Intel granted permission for revised chip-making plant plan Co Kildare facility to provide more than 850 full-time jobs if Irish bid is successful about 16 hours ago Ciarán D'Arcy Intel’s planned development includes buildings for water treatment, water purification and electrical support.         Intel Ireland has been granted planning permission for a revised development proposal at its Leixlip site in Co Kildare that will allow it to bid for a $4 billion (€3.67 billion) chip-manufacturing facility. It was confirmed on Wednesday that the company’s application for a two-storey development which will provide almost 90,000sq m of additional floor space to its existing campus has been granted planning permission by Kildare County Council. The multinational already had 10-year planning permission for a larger facility following a successful application in 2013 but it later decided that a smaller facility would suffice and submitted alterations to the existing permission to reflect this. The plans were scaled down to align with changes in standard designs to Intel manufacturing plants which were made after the 2013 application was granted. This has now been given the go-ahead by Kildare planning authorities. Support buildings The new development will contain a number of structures including a boiler building as well as buildings for water treatment, water purification and electrical support. The plans also include proposals to widen the R148, which skirts the campus, as well as alterations to internal road layouts. Intel’s Irish division is said to be in competition with Israel to host the multibillion-euro chip-manufacturing plant, and it is thought the proposed development will proceed in line with current plans only if it is successful in its bid. It was estimated that the development originally granted permission in 2013 would create more than 3,000 jobs during the construction and fit-out phase, although it is not known if the revised smaller layout would reduce this figure. In a statement released on Wednesday the Kildare Chamber of Commerce welcomed the successful conclusion of the planning process. Chief executive Allan Shine said: “This planning permission now ensures that Intel Ireland can bid for the tender which if successful will create 3,000 construction jobs and in excess of 850 full time jobs once developed. “This is great news for Kildare and further demonstrates that Kildare is the location of choice for existing and potential business enterprises. I am confident that Intel Ireland will be successful in this bid as Kildare is primed for further development.”       Read More Profits fall at maker of Ariel detergent and Gillette razors Ardagh to appeal $50m patent infringement order Wicklow job losses as Rennicks sells signs business to UK rival Ecocem appeal over €45m California mill to be heard next month European car sales in March rise but Irish sales less buoyant First-quarter profits help LafargeHolcim rebuild its reputation Berlin gets the better of Brussels in Dieselgate row US judge hands Volkswagen three-year probation sentence GE cash flow turns negative in first quarter Harley-Davidson reports slowing sales  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Central Bank governor rejects suggestions of new property bubble Technology Facebook outlines plans to tackle propaganda Sport Sonia O’Sullivan: For the record, I welcome new proposals Retail & Services Profit growth slows at Zara parent Sponsored The Story of Home: Light and shade ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ The Story of Home: 'People need a sense of belonging' Charting a family adventure on the Shannon-Erne Waterways Latest Business HSBC’s shares rise after Q1 profits beat forecasts 07:49 Huge increase in mortgage approvals, draw downs in first quarter 07:46 Irish Management Ill-Equipped for Digital Future 07:34 Kerry reaffirms full-year earnings guidance after ‘solid’ start 07:27 Irish services sector growth rebounds to 10-month high 07:25 Most Read in Business 1 Shortfall in tax revenue threatens spending increases 2 JP Morgan to shift back-office roles to Dublin as Frankfurt nets traders 3 The tricks Uber uses to win at the expense of its drivers 4 WhatsApp suffers widespread outage 5 Central Bank governor rejects suggestions of new property bubble 6 Toshiba’s startling spiral downwards continues 7 ‘Rampant’ growth of Irish e-commerce set to continue 8 First-time buyers: It’s cheaper to buy than rent, but do the sums 9 Braced for Brexit – and the death of Queen Elizabeth 10 Should you charge your phone overnight?

It's an FBI translator who was investigating an ISIS fighter in 2014 and then fled the United States for Syria and married him. So why are we just finding out about this breach? Joining me now is Pete Hoekstra, the former Chairman of the House Intel Committee. Pete, welcome, good evening. It's shocking that she would only get 2 years for this breach, and why was this kept so quiet, this whole thing? PETE HOEKSTRA: Well I think that's a very interesting question. The FBI as we all know during the recent election was more than willing to talk about cases that were under investigation, whether it was the Hillary Clinton emails, her server. After the election, they're saying, hey, we're investigating the Russian connection with the Trump campaign. But when it came to talking about the FBI, it's kind of like, we need to seal these records. We can't put into the public domain that we've had a major breach within our own organization. Let's bury it. Let's bury it for two and half years. Even right now, the FBI appears to be very tight-lipped about what happened and really not sharing a lot of details with Congress. At least that's what my sources on the Hill are saying. MACCALLUM: So we don't know what intel she may have shared with him, what she may have disclosed, what their interaction might have exposed about our sources and methods, you know, all of that. Big concern. HOEKSTRA: It's a huge concern. And , you know, good practice in the intelligence community says you have to assume that everything that she knew has been shared with ISIS. And so the FBI has to do a damage assessment of exactly what now happens or what ISIS now knows about their policies, procedures, their tactics, and those kinds of things. And they have to go back and they need to change all of those because the assumption is that whatever she had, whatever intelligence she had, is now in the hands of ISIS. MACCALLUM: If you read the emails that she wrote, I can't even imagine being in the position that she's in. And she is sort of writing about it like, this might be bad. I might be in trouble. This could be dangerous. And you wonder what kind of person she is, and I guess we're going to learn more about that. But, you know, the other thing that really struck me, Pete, especially given the warning that went out today, a broad warning for travel in Europe. I mean, these people live among us and they are friends with people, as this guy was with this FBI agent. Talk to us, and we're putting some of the particulars about this alert on the screen, but how serious is this? HOEKSTRA: Well, I think that's absolutely essential that we look at this as a pattern and not one isolated data point. Remember, after 9/11 it was connect the dots. Americans need to connect the dots. We've done it in Europe, but we need to connect San Bernardino, Fort Hood, Orlando, this event. They are among us. Their message is seductive and people fall victim to it. We connected the dots in Europe with Nice, with Paris, with Brussels, with what's going on in Germany, in the U.K. Who would have expected that at this point in time that America, that our State Department would be sending out a travel alert warning Americans that going to Europe, you know, stay aware of your situation because Europe is at the highest level of alert and threat that it has seen in decades. And Europe has taken way too long to connect the dots that this terror is among them and is a real threat. MACCALLUM: There are thousands of potential operatives in Europe, according to this report. HOEKSTRA: Right. MACCALLUM: Pete, thank you very much pretty, good to see you tonight, sir.

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:37 ColonelFlanders says: I know, and to be honest it’s outrageous that they don’t take the time to develop their game three times so that people from the past can have a go as well.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 23:06 Panther_Modern says: The game is terribly optimized, it isn’t a question of handling a weird use case that no one cares about. For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 02/05/2017 at 09:15 Ferno says: Is it badly optimised? I must be lucky as I’ve had no performance issues whatsoever! 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.) Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:20 Andy_Panthro says: Not sure I could face playing through modern games like that… I’ve got Dishonored 2 installed at the moment but I’m struggling with it because my laptop isn’t good enough to run it on any decent settings. Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?). Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:54 Styxie says: Nice, but can it run The Witcher 3 at 4 FPS, like my i7 4790k’s integrated graphics? This new GPU can’t get here quick enough. I’ve been surviving on nothing but Battle Brothers, Crusader Kings 2 and Spelunky for three months now.

Hey it was that or something pithy about how it looks no different. So droll and on trend. Sadly my poor pc won’t run it whatever, so don’t even get to try. Boo! Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post. So, Hi! :D (And sorry if my english is shoddy here and there – not my native language. :)) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 09:26 Hydrogene says: Great post! I always have a great satisfaction at running a game below spec on an old laptop so I know exactly how you feel. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:36 Mister eX says: Thanks! Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly. Oh Lord, I’ve just spotted that I’ve managed to misspell GeForce… :’D Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:21 emotionengine says: You might find this video (and indeed the whole channel) interesting where a guy tries to get demanding games such as DOOM running on less than impressive hardware. His channel is aptly called “Low Spec Gamer” and with some choice console commands he squeezes the last drops of performance out of DOOM running on a Celeron and Intel HD Graphics: link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:49 Mister eX says: Yeah, I know him! His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 02/05/2017 at 18:03 Hydrogene says: Ah ah! When you’re as old as I am and remember having had to tweak config.sys and autoexec.bat files in DOS to free memory at boot, editing a small confil file is no big deal! :)) Log in to Reply 03/05/2017 at 08:51 Mister eX says: It’s by no means a big deal, but not every game allows that kind of outside tweaking – like an optional “user.cfg” file with the Frostbite engine – where you can change stuff that’s not available in the game’s or config util’s settings, or in the default settings file. You have to do research on what kinds of parameters you can put in there, etc… 30/04/2017 at 21:07 Railway Rifle says: “my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours” This man will go far.

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:50 Tigris says: Well from a computer game journalist one would expect to have a better laptop though, since playing games is kind of his job. I mean he could most likely even get a laptop for free if he put a review up here about it. Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop. Also a side note: I had “supporter” written in red on the top oif my screen below the “Howdy Tigris” this kinda seemed like a bug.

Articles on bleeding edge GFX cards are interesting, sure, but probably only really relevant to a few % of the readers. Low-spec gaming articles are probably relevant to a much higher percentage. Also, how much do you imagine a journalist gets paid? Look that up, then adjust down for “gaming journalist..” (your words!) and adjust again for “…for a blog.” Aww great, now it sounds like I’m beating on an author that has my dream job. Love these low-spec articles– I can always read hardware porn on Tom’s or Ars, but this here blurb addressed a topic that’s underserved.

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 19:34 haldolium says: Well I don’t know about others, but for me playing core games isn’t viable most of the time in any train or plane anyways, unless you pay a tremendous amount of money for traveling in a (good) 1st class in which case you might be able to get a proper rig anyways. I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier.

Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of. Those games had brutally small textures stretched over the map mesh. It’s really noticeable with a modern patched version. Also, high-five for remembering that Myth existed.

The basic gameplay was superb, both in single-player and multiplayer, and I’ve never played anything else with that specific type of pure tactical combat with no resource management at all. And the writing + art assets, both sprites and loading screens, were so much better than… honestly virtually anything I’ve played before or since.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming. (no, there is no chance of hardware damage, just crashes and a slight/minute chance of software corruption or losing unsaved work) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 15:31 poliovaccine says: As someone currently doing most of their gaming on a laptop with almost exactly the same specs as the “clearly underpowered” one in this example, I gotta say, the struggle is real. The big broad bouncer of technological limitation keeps me out of the current gen of games – if it werent for titles like Tyranny and Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor I wouldnt be playing anything newer than 2014..! Gee you guys, The Witcher 2 was pretty interesting, wonder what they’ll cook up next..? Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:18 Kaeoschassis says: On an ancient, physically broken laptop bearing a particularly terrible intel graphics setup (which has all sorts of fun quirks, for example, glitching out like crazy anytime anything tries to do v-synch ever), and yeah, I know the feeling. There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

Log in to Reply 03/05/2017 at 10:26 BlueTemplar says: The Surface Pro 3 has a native resolution of 2160×1440 (3:2 or 13.5:9), which is _way_ too high in pixel density (216 ppi) for a 12.0 inches (30 cm) screen. You have to run it with scaling, which causes all sorts of issues with older software and additional screens – annoying for what is supposed to be a “Pro” device. So recently I settled on running it directly at 1440×900 (16:10), with no scaling. It’s the native horizontal resolution of 2160 divided by 1.5, so the blurriness is minimized, it has a pixel density of a bit more than 140 ppi, which feels not too dense, and the integrated graphics can better withstand games at that resolution. This also means I can run some games windowed at 1280×720. Log in to Reply 03/05/2017 at 19:06 Nolenthar says: Fun times. In the case of the author (being, an user having one normal PC and one non gaming PC), it’s good fun I admit. I have good fun as well playing on my laptop, even though I generally stick to old games just because, technically, a game is fun irrelevant if it was made in 2005 or in 2017. New games on a crappy hardware, it’s better to avoid it imo, as a new game on low settings generally look a lot worse than an old game on medium or high settings, for some reasons Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Intel’s top-ranking woman and data center chief Diane Bryant takes leave of absence Dean Takahashi@deantak May 3, 2017 10:34 AM Above: Diane Bryant at Intel Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Diane Bryant, head of Intel’s Data Center Group, is taking a leave of absence for the next six to eight months to attend to a personal family matter. Bryant has been one of the most prominent female leaders at Intel as head of the company’s Data Center Group. Her business generated $4.2 billion in revenue last quarter, or about 28 percent of its revenue. But the server chips that the division generates are among the highest-profit products that Intel makes. She will be replaced by Navin Shenoy, who will become general manager of DCG on an interim basis. You could say this is a blow to diversity — albeit a temporary one — at Intel, where the topic has been a big priority. In a comment, an Intel spokesperson said, “This has no effect on Intel’s commitment to diversity and inclusion or our diversity initiative, which aims to enhance and encourage more diversity at Intel and in the technology industry.  When she returns in six to eight months, Diane will take on her next challenging business role, and will continue to pursue her passion of championing diversity and changing the pipeline based on strong science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education.” In an email today, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced changes to the company’s leadership team: Today I’m writing to share two important leadership transitions on our executive leadership team. Diane Bryant has made the difficult decision to take a leave of absence from Intel to tend to a personal family matter. She is stepping away for the next six to eight months. Given the extended duration, an interim leader for the Data Center Group (DCG) is not possible. As a result, I have asked Navin Shenoy to take the position of general manager of DCG. DCG is a central part of our transformation and corporate strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution. Over the past five years, Diane has transformed DCG from a server-centric group to a business that spans servers, network and storage across all end-user segments, and with product lines and business models that extend beyond the traditional. DCG’s leading products and strategies — driving industry transformations’ to pervasive cloud computing, virtualization of network infrastructure, and adoption of artificial intelligence solutions — have positioned the business to be the growth driver for Intel. I want to thank Diane for her outstanding leadership and I will announce her next role upon her return. Navin will now report to me in this role. Since joining Intel in 1995, Navin has held leadership roles in the CEO’s office, sales and marketing, and the PC and tablet businesses. Most recently, as general manager of the Client Computing Group (CCG), he was responsible for the P&L, strategy and product development. Information about the succession plan for Navin as the general manager of CCG will be provided over the coming weeks. In the interim, Murthy Renduchintala will be CCG’s acting leader. Navin and Diane have been instrumental to Intel’s success and our executive leadership team over the past few years. They will work closely together for the next month to ensure a smooth transition for the organization and our customers. Management changes can be distracting, but it is critical that we all give Navin, Diane and the CCG leadership team our full support during this transition and focus on delivering leadership products and executing flawlessly. And, it goes without saying that my thoughts are with Diane. I look forward to welcoming her back to her next challenging role.

X Intel granted permission for revised chip-making plant plan Co Kildare facility to provide more than 850 full-time jobs if Irish bid is successful about 16 hours ago Ciarán D'Arcy Intel’s planned development includes buildings for water treatment, water purification and electrical support.         Intel Ireland has been granted planning permission for a revised development proposal at its Leixlip site in Co Kildare that will allow it to bid for a $4 billion (€3.67 billion) chip-manufacturing facility. It was confirmed on Wednesday that the company’s application for a two-storey development which will provide almost 90,000sq m of additional floor space to its existing campus has been granted planning permission by Kildare County Council. The multinational already had 10-year planning permission for a larger facility following a successful application in 2013 but it later decided that a smaller facility would suffice and submitted alterations to the existing permission to reflect this. The plans were scaled down to align with changes in standard designs to Intel manufacturing plants which were made after the 2013 application was granted. This has now been given the go-ahead by Kildare planning authorities. Support buildings The new development will contain a number of structures including a boiler building as well as buildings for water treatment, water purification and electrical support. The plans also include proposals to widen the R148, which skirts the campus, as well as alterations to internal road layouts. Intel’s Irish division is said to be in competition with Israel to host the multibillion-euro chip-manufacturing plant, and it is thought the proposed development will proceed in line with current plans only if it is successful in its bid. It was estimated that the development originally granted permission in 2013 would create more than 3,000 jobs during the construction and fit-out phase, although it is not known if the revised smaller layout would reduce this figure. In a statement released on Wednesday the Kildare Chamber of Commerce welcomed the successful conclusion of the planning process. Chief executive Allan Shine said: “This planning permission now ensures that Intel Ireland can bid for the tender which if successful will create 3,000 construction jobs and in excess of 850 full time jobs once developed. “This is great news for Kildare and further demonstrates that Kildare is the location of choice for existing and potential business enterprises. I am confident that Intel Ireland will be successful in this bid as Kildare is primed for further development.”       Read More Profits fall at maker of Ariel detergent and Gillette razors Ardagh to appeal $50m patent infringement order Wicklow job losses as Rennicks sells signs business to UK rival Ecocem appeal over €45m California mill to be heard next month European car sales in March rise but Irish sales less buoyant First-quarter profits help LafargeHolcim rebuild its reputation Berlin gets the better of Brussels in Dieselgate row US judge hands Volkswagen three-year probation sentence GE cash flow turns negative in first quarter Harley-Davidson reports slowing sales  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Central Bank governor rejects suggestions of new property bubble Technology Facebook outlines plans to tackle propaganda Sport Sonia O’Sullivan: For the record, I welcome new proposals Retail & Services Profit growth slows at Zara parent Sponsored The Story of Home: Light and shade ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ The Story of Home: 'People need a sense of belonging' Charting a family adventure on the Shannon-Erne Waterways Latest Business HSBC’s shares rise after Q1 profits beat forecasts 07:49 Huge increase in mortgage approvals, draw downs in first quarter 07:46 Irish Management Ill-Equipped for Digital Future 07:34 Kerry reaffirms full-year earnings guidance after ‘solid’ start 07:27 Irish services sector growth rebounds to 10-month high 07:25 Most Read in Business 1 Shortfall in tax revenue threatens spending increases 2 JP Morgan to shift back-office roles to Dublin as Frankfurt nets traders 3 The tricks Uber uses to win at the expense of its drivers 4 WhatsApp suffers widespread outage 5 Central Bank governor rejects suggestions of new property bubble 6 Toshiba’s startling spiral downwards continues 7 ‘Rampant’ growth of Irish e-commerce set to continue 8 First-time buyers: It’s cheaper to buy than rent, but do the sums 9 Braced for Brexit – and the death of Queen Elizabeth 10 Should you charge your phone overnight?

FILE PHOTO: An autonomous car from Delphi departs Treasure Island for a cross-country trip from San Francisco to New York City in San Francisco, California, U.S. on March 22, 2015. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo 03 May 2017 10:25PM (Updated: 04 May 2017 12:15AM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail DETROIT: Automotive supplier Delphi Automotive Plc on Wednesday said it plans to spin off its powertrain unit in order to focus on developing technology for electrically powered and self-driving vehicles at a time where more companies and investors see the future of the auto industry evolving. Delphi, the former unit of General Motors , has shed most of its lower-margin automotive supplier businesses in recent years and is seen as one of the companies best placed to grow as the industry moves toward self-driving vehicles. The company said the move to spin off its traditional powertrain business that is focused on the internal combustion engine - the heart of the automobile since its creation - was more of a positioning tactic. In a conference call with reporters, Delphi Chief Executive Officer Kevin Clark rejected the suggestion that there are doubts about the long-term viability of the internal combustion engine and said the as-yet-unnamed spinoff company had plenty of areas for potential growth. "We believe ... the internal combustion engine is going to be around for long time," Clark said. Advertisement "The need for focused product development has become more critical," he added. "This is really about how do we position (the powertrain business) so we can better serve our customers." Shares of Delphi were up about 9 percent at US$85.24. Delphi has partnerships through its autonomous vehicle business with Intel Corp and Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye , which is being bought by Intel for US$15.3 billion. The move to the self-driving auto universe has traditional car companies and tech majors battling to be the first to bring these vehicles to the masses. Alphabet Inc's Google unit has invested heavily in the area and Apple Inc has been issued a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California fuelling speculation that it is working on self-driving car technology. But the stark divide between companies deemed as focusing on "old" technology versus those seen as benefiting from "new" electric and autonomous vehicle technologies is well demonstrated by the valuations of GM and Tesla Inc . GM sold 10 million cars in 2016 compared to less than 80,000 for Tesla, but GM's stock barely moved last week when the company reported a blowout first-quarter net profit. Yet as of Wednesday Tesla, which is not profitable, was worth close to US$2.3 billion more than GM. Delphi itself has been a darling of Wall Street with its shares up more than three-fold since the end of 2011. Before Wednesday's announcement of the spinoff, the company's stock was up more than 14 percent since the start of 2017. In 2016, the powertrain unit contributed around US$4.5 billion to Delphi's revenues, or around 27 percent of its total sales. The spinoff will be tax free and is expected to be completed by March 2018, Delphi said. Delphi shareholders will hold stock in both companies. The automotive supplier said Liam Butterworth, currently senior vice president and president of the powertrain unit, will become the new company's chief executive. Delphi bases its top management in Michigan but is headquartered in England for tax purposes. Chris McNally of Evercore ISI said in a research note that the spinoff would allow "investors to invest in a clean, high growth" autonomous and electric vehicle company, and "separates the traditional Powertrain division where investors are less clear about the strategic direction of diesel penetration and the internal combustion engine over the medium/long term." On Wednesday, Delphi also reported a better-than-expected first-quarter net profit as revenue rose in all regions, and it gave a robust full-year earnings outlook. Quarterly net profit from continuing operations was US$335 million or US$1.24 per share, up from US$320 million or US$1.15, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings per share was US$1.59. Analysts had expected US$1.46. Delphi said it expects second-quarter earnings per share of between US$1.62 and US$1.68, compared with analysts' expectations of US$1.68. The company said full-year earnings per share should be US$6.40 to US$6.70, compared with analysts' forecasts of US$6.53.

Intel’s Irish division is said to be in competition with Israel to host the multibillion-euro chip-manufacturing plant, and it is thought the proposed development will proceed in line with current plans only if it is successful in its bid. It was estimated that the development originally granted permission in 2013 would create more than 3,000 jobs during the construction and fit-out phase, although it is not known if the revised smaller layout would reduce this figure. In a statement released on Wednesday the Kildare Chamber of Commerce welcomed the successful conclusion of the planning process. Chief executive Allan Shine said: “This planning permission now ensures that Intel Ireland can bid for the tender which if successful will create 3,000 construction jobs and in excess of 850 full time jobs once developed. “This is great news for Kildare and further demonstrates that Kildare is the location of choice for existing and potential business enterprises. I am confident that Intel Ireland will be successful in this bid as Kildare is primed for further development.”       Read More Profits fall at maker of Ariel detergent and Gillette razors Ardagh to appeal $50m patent infringement order Wicklow job losses as Rennicks sells signs business to UK rival Ecocem appeal over €45m California mill to be heard next month European car sales in March rise but Irish sales less buoyant First-quarter profits help LafargeHolcim rebuild its reputation Berlin gets the better of Brussels in Dieselgate row US judge hands Volkswagen three-year probation sentence GE cash flow turns negative in first quarter Harley-Davidson reports slowing sales  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Central Bank governor rejects suggestions of new property bubble Technology Facebook outlines plans to tackle propaganda Sport Sonia O’Sullivan: For the record, I welcome new proposals Retail & Services Profit growth slows at Zara parent Sponsored The Story of Home: Light and shade ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ The Story of Home: 'People need a sense of belonging' Charting a family adventure on the Shannon-Erne Waterways Latest Business HSBC’s shares rise after Q1 profits beat forecasts 07:49 Huge increase in mortgage approvals, draw downs in first quarter 07:46 Irish Management Ill-Equipped for Digital Future 07:34 Kerry reaffirms full-year earnings guidance after ‘solid’ start 07:27 Irish services sector growth rebounds to 10-month high 07:25 Most Read in Business 1 Shortfall in tax revenue threatens spending increases 2 JP Morgan to shift back-office roles to Dublin as Frankfurt nets traders 3 The tricks Uber uses to win at the expense of its drivers 4 WhatsApp suffers widespread outage 5 Central Bank governor rejects suggestions of new property bubble 6 Toshiba’s startling spiral downwards continues 7 ‘Rampant’ growth of Irish e-commerce set to continue 8 First-time buyers: It’s cheaper to buy than rent, but do the sums 9 Braced for Brexit – and the death of Queen Elizabeth 10 Should you charge your phone overnight?

Powered by Chrome OS, it won’t run professional-grade software like Photoshop or After Effects, but it still makes a good companion for those living within Google’s ecosystem. Hardware | The design of the Chromebook 11 N7 is anything but exciting. Its 2.98 lb plastic chassis has plenty of give with pressure applied to almost any point, but that’s partially for durability’s sake. This Chromebook is MIL-STD 810G certified, meaning that at least on paper, it should be able to withstand drops from up to 48 inches/1.2 meters. There’s also a “gutter” system within the keyboard that’s able to drain up to 11 ounces of water in case of a spill. The 11.6″ IPS display is dim and easily washed out in direct lighting, but looks a touch better than its 1366 x 768 resolution would suggest. Touch sensitivity is surprisingly good, and much more responsive to multitouch than the trackpad. Speaking of — the trackpad is smooth and works well for cursor movement and two-finger scrolling, but falls apart with very hit-or-miss sensitivity to two-finger “right clicks.” Under the hood, the C731T (the “T” refers to its touch screen — there is also a non-touch model) sports a dual core Intel Celeron N3060 clocked at 1.6 GHz, and 4 GB of DDR3 RAM. You’re only given 16GB of internal storage, but given the cloud-centric nature of Chrome OS that should be plenty of space for most users. There’s also an integrated Intel GPU inside, and a 3,980 mAh lithium polymer battery powering it all. There’s a decent amount of ports on the C731, including two USB 3 ports, HDMI, an SD reader, and a headphone jack. Sadly there are no USB-C ports to be found, and the charger instead is a proprietary cable. It would have also been nice for Acer to have included an Ethernet port (or at the very least an adapter), but the built-in WiFi 802.11 ac connectivity is good to see. Software | Chrome OS on the C731 is, as always, clean and simple. Upon the first boot, you’re prompted to sign into your Google account, after which you’ll be greeted with all of your bookmarks, Chrome plugins, and passwords from other Google devices. Like most other Chromebooks (with the exception of a few recent Samsung models), the C731 is limited to only being able to run web apps within Chrome, but Android app compatibility will be coming soon. Test notes | Performance on the C731T is typically fairly smooth, though with a dated processor on board it’s easily overburdened by media-heavy web pages. You’ll also bog it down from time to time if you’re an especially fast typist; I found myself waiting on the laptop to catch up with my typing on more than one occasion, which is too bad since the keyboard is actually pretty nice and easy to type on. The C731’s speakers get surprisingly loud, though the audio quality leaves a lot to be desired. Their placement on the bottom of the chassis also make them easy to accidentally muffle with your lap … you know, where a laptop usually goes. Battery life is the highest point of the C731’s user experience, providing a terrific ten to twelve hours per charge. It’s still a shame that Acer used a proprietary charging cable, but it at least charges fairly quickly — two hours should be enough to charge up from an empty battery. Conclusion | It goes without saying that the C731 isn’t for content creators. The nature of Chrome OS is heavily rooted in cloud storage and web apps, and as such it’s not supposed to run heavy duty programs. On the other hand, for the busy student who constantly runs between classes and is comfortable working off of Google Docs and other productivity apps within the Google ecosystem, there’s a certain peace of mind that comes with a tough and rugged laptop that you can throw around, even in the rain. Sweeten the deal with excellent battery life and a low cost of entry, and the C731T makes a great budget laptop.

Tuesday, May 2, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Microsoft Surface Laptop Microsoft (Web site): Meet the new Surface Laptop. Performance made personal. Mark Gurman and Dina Bass: Microsoft has already cracked the professional and creative markets with inventive tablets and a desktop that turns into a virtual drafting table. Now it’s chasing another category many believe is Apple’s to lose: the $1,000 laptop for everyone. I would have thought so, but the lackluster MacBook starts at $1,299, the $999 MacBook Air hasn’t been updated in 785 days, the $899 MacBook Air was discontinued, and the current 13-inch MacBook Pro (sans Touch Bar) starts at $1,499. Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay’s team adhered to a “fail-fast” philosophy that emphasized constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mockups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard, the circuit board containing a computer’s main components, to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. Andrew Cunningham: The Surface Laptop ships with Windows 10 S, the new cut-down Windows 10 SKU Microsoft also announced today. Out of the box, the operating system can only run apps from the Windows Store, though it’s possible to upgrade it to a full Windows 10 Pro install for free until December 31, 2017. Afterward, the Pro upgrade will cost $50, the same as it normally will for Windows 10 S users. John Gruber: I, for one, don’t find it the least bit odd or surprising that Microsoft has shipped a version of Windows that’s locked to their app store before Apple has done similarly with MacOS. That’s a fundamental aspect of Apple’s dual OS strategy. Microsoft only has one OS, Windows, so if they want to ship a laptop with the advantages of being restricted to software from an app store, they have to do it in a version of Windows. I wouldn’t go so far as to state with certitude that Apple will never ship a version of MacOS that is App-Store-only, but I would bet against it. John Gruber: I can see the argument for making the OS App-Store-only by default. I can also see the argument for an iOS-style system where it’s App-Store-only, period. But charging $50 for this feels like a shakedown. It does. And I can see why this could end up being worse than choosing one or the other. But I think it might actually be a good compromise—and one I’d like to see on iOS. Fully locked down has advantages and drawbacks. So does fully open. A fee that people will think twice about, but which isn’t insurmountable, could be a good way of providing an escape hatch. Anyone who really needs it could use it, but most users won’t bother opening the door to untrusted software. Update (2017-05-02): Nilay Patel: All anyone wanted was a MacBook Air with a Retina Display, and Microsoft gave it to ’em. Ian Betteridge: Yep. Apple has failed to give people a proper replacement for the hugely-popular Air. Microsoft just delivered that. Tom Warren: “The performance on this device is absolutely amazing,” says Panay. Microsoft is using the latest Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, and claims the battery life will last for 14.5 hours as a result. Microsoft claims the Surface Laptop is faster than the i7 MacBook Pro, and it has “more battery life than any MacBook Air on the market today.” Update (2017-05-03): Daniel Jalkut: Another alluring aspect to the Windows 10 S lineup is that the most affordable computers will sell for as little as $189. While my understanding is that these computers are licensed, and not manufactured by Microsoft, I wonder if the cutthroat pricing represents a compromise on Microsoft’s part. To allow for computers this cheap, the OEM price for Windows 10 S must be effectively $0. Separately, Microsoft is offering the operating system as a free update to schools that want to update older Windows computers. Marco Arment: Apple did finally make the Retina MacBook Air we wanted. They just called it the MacBook Pro 13” (non-Touch Bar) and charged $500 too much. Jackson: The lack of reliable Thunderbolt 3/USB-C docks means that I can’t use my 13” full time with only 2x Thunderbolt 3 ports. ATP Tipster: The 12″ is too slow for too many people and the Air’s screen is an abomination. I don’t think it’s good for the brand for there not to be an affordable laptop for students and such. The practical result, though, is that people buy the 12″ MacBook and find it too slow to enjoy using. The Air CPU class is special. Education iOS Mac MacBook MacBook Air MacBook Pro Microsoft Microsoft Surface Retina Windows 5 Comments 5 Comments Microsoft Launches Surface Laptop — Pixel Envy May 2, 2017 7:03 PM […] Microsoft Launches Surface Laptop […] Lukas May 3, 2017 3:02 AM There's no problem at all with Windows 10 S. It's a great idea - for a cheap, consumer-level computer, where Microsoft gives away the OS license for free to hardware manufacturers, and at the same time protects them from malware by locking down the OS. For a premium device aimed at professionals, it's an insult to Microsoft's customers. CalvinAndHobbs May 3, 2017 11:56 AM Well that was horrible! Just cause MS makes a device does not there fore means they "cracked" into any market. Many of the latest devices are interesting but will it sway anyone already on another platform? I don't. They made MP3 players, they made smartphones, and they even opened storefronts, yet history would argue they have yet to crack into those market. I really hate these types of headlines cause it really paints how ignorant the people are of their history. Honestly, I want MS to kick ass! I really want a true alternative so I can have choice, but so far everything has been the same. Yes people throwing tired headlines too often enough prove to be wrong. Let's be critical of the companies the produce our tech , to push them to produce products that really are useful and easy to use. Lead us to the future with a sense of wonderment and curiosity. Is MS there yet, not really. Dmitri Zdorov May 3, 2017 12:08 PM if hackintosh installation would be possible it would make it even more insteresting Chucky May 3, 2017 4:43 PM @Lukas "For a premium device aimed at professionals, it's an insult to Microsoft's customers." Yeah. That's the only really weird part, no? You'd think they'd ship this product with normal Windows, and reserve Windows 10 S for cheap-o devices from them or 3rd party manufacturers.

'Cruel' health care bill will bring 'death, pain and suffering' says Cory Booker Trump approval rating makes huge jump among very unlikely group University trains white students and faculty on their 'white privilege' Breaking: Republicans say they'll vote on AHCA Thursday TV Channels Glenn Beck Dana Loesch The Wonderful World of Stu Doc Thompson Check out all channels Radio MyVoice Signup Login www.theblaze.com Trey Gowdy defends House Intel investigation into alleged Russian election meddling Carlos Garcia May 3, 2017 8:30 am Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) defended the existence of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into charges that the Trump campaign might have colluded with the Russian government before the 2016 election. (Image Source: YouTube screenshot) 106 Follow Share Tweet Fox News host Tucker Carlson asked Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) Tuesday to explain why an investigation was necessary into the alleged collusion between the Trump administration and the Russian government before the election since their relationship has soured in the last month. Gowdy explained why the House Intelligence Committee was doing so despite President Donald Trump’s agenda hitting obstacles. “So it does seem in light of the foreign policy developments of the past month or so,” Carlson began, “where the United States has assumed a hostile posture toward Russia, that most people have kinda decided y’know, how would Trump be doing the bidding of Vladimir Putin when he and Putin are so at odds. So why given that, is this going forward?” “Well, I think some of the folks initially who thought that was the motive behind,” Gowdy explained, “you have to accept as accurate that Donald Trump colluded and coordinated with the Russians and that they had a motive to help him. So all of those assumptions had to be made before you can then say, ‘but he’s taken a more belligerent stance towards Russia, therefore that must not be true.’ “I start at ground zero,’ he continued. “What happened in 2016, whether it was Russia or another foreign actor, did they try to interfere with our election, what was our response in 2016? Not two months ago, 2016, what did we know, what did we do about it? The felonious dissemination of classified material to me is always relevant. Whether it’s in the headlines or not, it’s always important. And the issue of unmasking is important.” “But it does seem like, look, in a world where there’s only so much time and so many priorities,” Carlson pressed.  “In a Congress where, y’know, we didn’t get a wall passed. Obamacare has not been repealed or replaced. Where there are a lot of priorities that the president ran on that are unfulfilled, for the Republicans in the body to pursue what is basically a fever dream from CNN, seems a little weird.” “Well, there’s six of us, three Rs [Republicans] and three Ds [Democrats] that kinda been assigned to the task force,” Gowdy replied. “And we’re all on House Intel, so we do have broad jurisdiction. But it doesn’t include the border wall, it doesn’t include health care, it doesn’t include tax reform. We’re just intelligence. So, uh, whether it’s North Korea, whether it’s, uh, human trafficking in South America, it’s what we’re supposed to do, and providing oversight over the intelligence community is part of it. So, the Intel Community has a robust jurisdiction, but this is part of it. No other committees of Congress to my knowledge are holding hearings, not on the House side. “And quite frankly, Tucker, we have time. Those of us that are on intel, we can’t talk about North Korea, we can’t talk about other things that we are investigating. This is one of those rare exceptions where we can both do it,” he concluded, “and then ultimately answer people’s questions at the end.” “So unless I’m missing something,” Carlson said, “the only crime that we’re pretty certain occurred, in the U.S., was the leaking of Michael Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador, is that part of the investigation?” “I would say the hacking of the DNC would also constitute a criminal act,” Gowdy responded. “So, and the FBI would have jurisdiction over both of those. But I don’t think Congress is well equipped to investigate crime. In fact, I know we’re not. So, the constitutional injury or things that are of significant public interest, there is a role for Congress to play. We’re dreadful at investigating crime, and we should not attempt to do so. Which is why you don’t hear me alleging that people committed crimes.” “That doesn’t stop some of your colleagues, I notice,” Carlson interrupted. “It doesn’t, and that disappoints me,” Gowdy replied, “because I think you ought to wait until all the evidence is in and then ask the jury to draw whatever conclusion you want. But we only have one reputation, and it is so easy to accuse someone of a criminal act, and we do it unfortunately in modern day culture a lot. It’s just unfair to the individual no matter who’s doing it.” “I totally agree,” Carlson said. “Are you confident that [FBI] Director [James] Comey is stable and trustworthy?” “I am. I have a rich and provocative history with Director Comey dating back to 2016,” Gowdy answered. “I prefer to talk to him privately than in public because in fairness to him he can’t answer most of my questions in a public setting.” “Well, that hasn’t stopped him from making all kinds of provocative public statements and not explaining them,” Carlson challenged. “I have a rich and provocative history with him,” Gowdy repeated, “we’ve agreed on some matters, we’ve not agreed on some matters. Whether I like it or not, he’s a foundational witness. In fact, he’s touches all four tranches of our investigation and he may be the only witness that does touch everything from felonious dissemination all the way back to when did the bureau initiate their investigation. So, he’s foundational. It’s not fair to ask him questions in public when I know he cannot answer them. And them from him we’ll develop other witness leads and documents that we need.” The House Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing Thursday on the alleged Russian interference in the U.S. election. Former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said on a panel at Harvard University that Russia was likely using its success in the U.S. election to guide efforts in other democratic elections around the world. Officials in Montenegro accused Russia of aiding a coup and assassination plot on the eve of their election, and some believe Russia is attempting to influence the outcome of the French election as well.

Codenamed Bay Trail-T, the current, 22-nanometer line of Atom chips for tablets impressed us with benchmark scores that were 2 to 3 times higher than that of its predecessor when it launched in 2013. Now, Intel is leaping forward with a new generation that is mostly based on its 14nm Cherry Trail architecture and divided into three distinct sub-brands -- Atom x3 for phones and connected tablets, and Atom x5 and Atom x7 for mainstream tablets. Like the Intel Core series, which uses the Core i3, Core i5 and Core i7 labels, the new Atom nomenclature is designed to help consumers distinguish between the "good, better or best" CPUs in the line.  Designed for devices that cost under $150, including low-end phones for developing markets, the entry-level Atom x3 series uses a 28nm SoFIA architecture that's less powerful than its siblings, but provides built-in 3G or LTE connectivity. Atom x3 comes in 3 different SKUs, starting with the dual-core x3-C3130, which runs at a mere 1-GHz and can only support displays with up to 1280 x 800 resolutions. The x3-3230RK has four cores and runs up to 1.2-GHz while supporting displays as sharp as 1920 x 1080, but, like the C3130, only connects at 3G. The higher-end x3-C3440 features an LTE radio and four cores that can run at up to 1.4-GHz while outputting at 1080p. I had the chance to handle an Atom x3 reference design phone from Intel, and found its 720p picture sharp and its UI smooth as I swiped through the icons. With low-cost, ARM-powered phones from big brands like Samsung and Lenovo selling for under $50 in Asia, the x3 is Intel's attempt to break into that market. Despite its low price, the Atom x3 chip has reasonable performance. According to Intel's benchmarks, the x3 was 1.8 times faster than Qualcomm's 1.2-GHz, quad-core MSM812 CPU when running through a series of light media editing tasks such as running filters on photos. The Atom x5 series is the mainstream member of the family, with a 14nm Cherry Trail architecture that powers devices ranging from $150 to $350. It is available in two SKUs: the 1.84-GHz Atom x5-8300 and 2.24-GHz Atom x5-8500, with the former supporting up to 1920 x 1200 displays and the latter capable of 2560 x 1600 internally or 4K2K on external displays. There's only one Atom x7 SKU, the x7-8700, which runs at up to 2.4-GHz on its 14nm architecture but otherwise offers similar specs to the x5-8500. Intel expects x7-powered tablets to cost more than $350. According to Intel, the Atom x7 should offer double the graphics performance of Bay Trail-T CPUs on some applications. During his Mobile World Congress press conference, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich showed off a Cherry Trail-powered tablet running a driving game very smoothly. He also pointed to a number of Cherry Trail reference designs from Intel and ODM partners such as ASUS and Malata.  Though we don't have a list of shipping tablets with Atom x5 or x7 in them, we'll probably see some later in the year. The Atom x3 phones are more likely to appear in developing countries than in the U.S. What others are reading NDC must stay in opposition for 16 years – Kweku Baako Expect power in three hours - GRIDCO confirms 70% plunged in darkness Association of alcohol manufacturers commends FDA probe into Adonko Bitters saga Students get ‘free passco’ on Vodafone’s Instant Schools portal Latest Stories I’m sorry – Nii Noi begs Akufo-Addo A rewarding career in Corporate Communications Expect power in three hours - GRIDCO confirms 70% plunged in darkness Coventry graduate recounts life-changing commitment to tackling terrorism Guinness Ghana is manufacturing company of the year LIFESTYLE Doctors unhappy with queueing to use theatre ODD NEWS Father drinks his daughter's breast milk to help beat bowel cancer AUTOS The Junction Mall Auto Show TECHNOLOGY Galaxy S8: The Smartphone Evolution We Dreamt About OBITUARY Madam SARDIS EMMAROSE OSEW ELECTIONS EC holds district elections in Nkoranza after 2015 disruption Home News Politics Business Sports World News Opinion More Sections Entertainment Elections Health Odd News Automobile Technology Media Audio on Demand Photo Gallery Online Radio Videos On Demand Live TV Social RSS Feeds Twitter Facebook Youtube Google+ Instagram LinkedIn Myjoyonline Advertise Online Team Privacy Policy Services Contact us Feedback Our daily bread

Executive Chairman of the company, Mr Kojo Graham told JOY FM’s Kojo Yankson on Thursday that they their misunderstanding of the process resulted in the company stating in their bid documents that they will prepare bill for the BOG to pay after the period they planned to operate the switch. Explaining the company’s concerns over the raging interoperability contract on the Super Morning Show, Mr Graham affirmed in the positive to a question posed by the programme host to the effect that “You didn’t quite understand the technical obligations as spelt out in the tender documents”. The contract for a third party to interoperate the electronic retail payment system was awarded to Sibton Switch who are offering to execute the contract using a self-financing mechanism to raise GHC4.6 billion on their own to build a robust interface intended to ensure efficiency and safety, among numerous other benefits. The company hoped to recoup their investments over 15 years. Two other companies that lost out of the bid were Vals Intel and Mericom Services Ltd. The two quoted GHC 14m and GHC 4m respectively while the winning firm, Sibton opted to undertake the project raising GHC 4.6billion for it.  Mr Graham told the radio station it was true that all 3 companies have international technical partners including Sibton to execute the project.  He agreed with the assertion that the very highly technical nature of the contract compelled the BOG to opt for Restrictive Tendering.  According to him, his company thought it was possible to recoup investments made within a period between 3 and 5 years and that was why they stated same in their documents to the central bank. He also explained that all 3 firms were afforded the opportunity to engage extensively with all relevant stakeholders during the bidding process.  The BOG’s decision to engage a third party for the operation of a national central switch for interoperability has been lauded by many industry watchers. It is proven elsewhere that Interoperability is the only way to create a true inclusive financial ecosystem and because the results have often delivered exponential growth for all participants. Examples in other places have shown that Interoperability has contributed to market growth in a way that has not been experienced before. The system works in a way that develops better understanding for how the telecommunications companies compete among themselves. Competition lies in quality of service, and agent quality and liquidity are far more significant determinants for success. A Telcos's Mobile Money success is measured by driving value into the system, rather than growing segregated networks. That way also, one will find customer engagement more responsive because it is much easier to position. It is therefore not true that with the coming into being of the interoperability concept, consumers will pay more. May be a simple demonstration will suffice. So for instance, instead of paying GHC 20 for sending GHC 2,000 as it is currently, the figure will reduce to GHC 17.5; GHC 7.5 for GHC 1,000 instead of GHC 10; GHC 3.50 for GHC 500 instead of GHC 5; GHC 1.75 for GHC 200 instead of GHC 2.00 and GHC 0.75 for GHC 100 instead of GHC 1.00. this is how one stands to gain when the interoperability becomes operational.

All the giant global industry players like Intel, Qualcomm, Ericsson, Google, Samsung, STC, ZTE, Huawei, T-Mobile, NEC, LG, HTC, AT&T, Vodafone, SEAT, Oredoo, and others are projecting smart cities solutions and virtualization over and above the normal cool smart devices. The discussions and exhibitions already make 4G look extinct and bring to the fore the internet of things (IoT), where everything is connected to everything via cloud solutions billed to run mainly on 5G technology for optimum efficiency. It also shows that devices and technology companies are collaborating, and in some cases overlapping roles to develop more holistic and relevant solutions together, instead of buying from each other. Key among the smart cities solutions are the connected factories, cars, homes, utility systems, health facilities, face recognition systems, transportation systems, agricultural processes, security systems, down to drones, smart vendors and many more, that allow things to remotely interact with service stations via Cloud for efficiency. Indeed, Ericsson has set up a complete IoT and smart city centre doing live testing of a host of 5G facilities like base stations, data centers, customer experience measurement centers, manufacturing plants, connected trucks, connected homes, power stations and many more, all live through the Cloud. Other industry players also hold their own in terms of smart cities and IoT solutions. Cars The smart cars, for instance, have features that allow them to communicate directly with manufacturers, regulators, insurance companies, traffic systems and more, and gives the user and other stakeholders relevant and timely information. Indeed, there are smart cars that also do auto drive and allow the occupants to just relax and just configure the destination address into the car's GPS. The car recognizes traffic lights, curves, obstacles and others. Homes Smart homes also allow the users to control stuff at home just my issuing audio commands and also allow homeowners and security services to know what is happening back home even while they are out. AT&T's smart home solutions, for instance, allows the home to automatically lock doors and open them when necessary, and in a case of fire outbreak, the home can lock or gas channels to prevent explosion and direct occupants to a safe exit. Intel also has a smart home chip that ensures optimum data experience for as many people that enter the home and uses the wifi system. The experience is as if only one person was at home and is using the Wifi. There are smart health items as well, key among which is a special glasses for blind persons, that communicates with trained agents remotely and they see what the blind person is not seeing, so they are able to get the blind person around very complex places like airports, shopping malls and other without physical humans assistance. Smart Vendors Ubuntu is also showcasing a smart vendor, which is basically a vending machine that can scan ID cards and actually issue people with items that require the use of ID, like SIM cards and other items. So telecom operators could, for instance, place such smart vendors in shopping malls and offer potential customers the convenience of purchasing SIM cards without having to go to customer service centers. The smart vendor takes up to 45 SIM cards at a time. Oredoo telecoms has also developed a drone that automatically launches itself on rescue missions when there is a need. The drone can be configured to rescue people drowning by flying to where they are and throwing them a safety net. The drone can also be configured to provide border security. Key at the NEC stand is a facial recognition solution designed to recognize people and deliver information about them within nanoseconds (very fast). This allows terrorists, criminals and other wanted person trying to cross borders or board a plane to other countries to be easily identified and quickly arrested before they could get away. Devices Samsung's Galaxy smartwatches that connects to both iPhone and Android phones via Bluetooth and Wifi makes it possible for users who leave their phone at home to connect to it via Wifi in the office and still make and receive calls and messages. The watch has a 4GB memory which can store enough music, and it does everything like a phone, while still working as a watch. Close on the heels of Samsung is MyKronoz, which is showcasing a smart watch that is both digital and analogue. The digital watch has a battery that lasts for three days and the analogue battery lasts for 30 days. In terms of handheld devices also, ZTE is showcasing a prototype of for first ever 5G phone that does a one gigabit download in one second. ZTE is one of many company companies pushing for 5G to come on stream one year earlier than the planned 2020 launch, and they are ready with the first 5G base station and now the phone. Virtual reality Also big at MWC 2017 is virtual reality, which until recently has been used mainly for games, where players wear special classes and see virtual images they interact with in games. But now virtual reality makers are not just playing games but they are using the solution for training and education. HTC Vive, for instance, has virtual reality solutions for technical training in painting, where people could learn how to spray a car excellently without physically touching actual spraying equipment. They also have solutions for education, where schools can actually teach about, for instance, the body parts by letting both the students and teacher wear virtual reality glasses that show the specific body part as the teacher navigates them through where explaining. Security All of that brings up the issue of security because  IoT means all information about everything is running in the cloud and sophisticated hackers could tap into private information about any system and hack into it. CEO of cyber security giant Kaspersky, Eugene Kaspersky noted that IoT poses a huge security danger and that gives rise to jobs for many more IT savvy people in the area of cyber security to ensure that users feel safe and comfortable to connect. Indeed, AT&T is one of the companies showcasing as security solution that protects the automated production plants of manufacturing companies from being hacked. The system blocks all other remote commands apart from what was originally configured into the manufacturing line and there ensures data and intellectual property is secured even though it is connected to Cloud services. Africa As if MWC this year is a conspiracy to leave Africa behind as usual, Vice President for Sales in Africa at Japanese technology company NEC, Chad Baker told Adom News in an exclusive interview "Africa is not ready for smart cities yet" citing infrastructural, regulatory, attitudinal and other hurdles the continent would need to deal over the next five to 10 years. Indeed, the most advanced African economies in terms of modern technology are largely grappling to really popularize 4G technology, as most players in that space are only offering piece mill coverage and services. In Ghana, the regulatory environment appears to be an impediment. In the way of operators who has the financial muscle to deploy 4G, while the government has also not supported local license holders enough to deploy. Meanwhile, as African telecoms and ICT industry players still struggle to deploy 4G widely some giant global industry players are pushing for 5G to come on stream a year ahead of the planned global deployment. Industry watchers believe it is time for Ghana, for instance, to clear up the bottlenecks in the 4G space and pursue policies that allow a faster spread of 4G before idle spectrum become extinct as 5G come on stream.

The companies’ new laptops will sell for $299 and will primarily be intended for students and educators. The HP ProBook x360 Education Edition is a rugged laptop with an 11.6-inch 1,366 x 768 resolution display. It’s being powered by an Intel Celeron processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. It features a 360-degree hinge and a touchscreen display. Users will be able to fold the laptop into tablet mode, or have it on stand or tend mode. The original ProBook x360 was actually announced back in December 2016 and typically sells for around $329, but this Education Edition is running Windows 10 S instead of the Pro version of the operating system.  However, the ProBook x360 running full Windows 10 is now on sale for $299, making the Education Edition seem like a downgrade for the same price, as pointed out by The Verge. As for Acer’s new laptop, the company is simply reintroducing a new version of its TravelMate Spin B1 Convertible. Acer’s Windows 10 S laptop features a rugged design wth its rubber bumper casing that can absorb shock from drops. The chiclet keyboard is also resistant to up to 11 ounces of water. For specs, the Acer B1 is pretty much the same as the HP’s ProBook. It’s still powered by an Intel Celeron processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. Acer’s TravelMate Spin B1 also features the same 360-degree hinge that allows the keyboard to fold back against the monitor to turn it into a tablet or prop it up in stand or tent mode. Microsoft may have already introduced the new Surface Laptop that runs Windows 10 S, but these new iterations from HP and Acer are exactly what Microsoft needs to compete against Google’s Chrome OS-powered Chomebooks in the flourishing market of affordable education-centric laptops. Affordable Chromebooks have become quite popular in schools, and it would make sense that Windows 10 S laptops should feature competitive price tags. Surface Laptop is Microsoft's answer to the MacBook Pro, and it's got the price and specs to prove it. The 13.5-inch product features the latest Kaby Lake CPUs and SSD storage starting at $999. It's set to release June 15. Photo: Microsoft/Twitter This is also why Microsoft has teamed up with a bunch of manufacturers that have agreed to build new Windows 10 S laptops. Asus, Dell, Fujitsu, Samsung and Toshiba are just some of the other OEMs that are now working on affordable Windows 10 S machines. Microsoft says that the laptops from these manufacturers will start at $189, according to TechCrunch. These devices will include free one-year subscription of “Minecraft: Education Edition,” while Office 360 online apps will also be free for all student and teachers. The new Windows 10 S laptops will start shipping this summer, while Microsoft will also rollout the software as a free upgrade for schools. Windows 10 S is a lightweight version of the full Windows 10 Pro. It only allows users to run apps downloaded from Microsoft’s Windows Store. Users have the option to pay $49 to upgrade to the full Windows 10 Pro, while students and teachers can upgrade for free until the end of 2017 if they have Microsoft’s brand new Surface Laptop. Acer and HP announced new $299 laptops running Windows 10 S.

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 23:06 Panther_Modern says: The game is terribly optimized, it isn’t a question of handling a weird use case that no one cares about. For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 02/05/2017 at 09:15 Ferno says: Is it badly optimised? I must be lucky as I’ve had no performance issues whatsoever! 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.) Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:20 Andy_Panthro says: Not sure I could face playing through modern games like that… I’ve got Dishonored 2 installed at the moment but I’m struggling with it because my laptop isn’t good enough to run it on any decent settings. Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?). Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:54 Styxie says: Nice, but can it run The Witcher 3 at 4 FPS, like my i7 4790k’s integrated graphics? This new GPU can’t get here quick enough.

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post. So, Hi! :D (And sorry if my english is shoddy here and there – not my native language. :)) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 09:26 Hydrogene says: Great post! I always have a great satisfaction at running a game below spec on an old laptop so I know exactly how you feel. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:36 Mister eX says: Thanks! Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly. Oh Lord, I’ve just spotted that I’ve managed to misspell GeForce… :’D Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:21 emotionengine says: You might find this video (and indeed the whole channel) interesting where a guy tries to get demanding games such as DOOM running on less than impressive hardware. His channel is aptly called “Low Spec Gamer” and with some choice console commands he squeezes the last drops of performance out of DOOM running on a Celeron and Intel HD Graphics: link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:49 Mister eX says: Yeah, I know him! His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 02/05/2017 at 18:03 Hydrogene says: Ah ah! When you’re as old as I am and remember having had to tweak config.sys and autoexec.bat files in DOS to free memory at boot, editing a small confil file is no big deal! :)) Log in to Reply 03/05/2017 at 08:51 Mister eX says: It’s by no means a big deal, but not every game allows that kind of outside tweaking – like an optional “user.cfg” file with the Frostbite engine – where you can change stuff that’s not available in the game’s or config util’s settings, or in the default settings file. You have to do research on what kinds of parameters you can put in there, etc… 30/04/2017 at 21:07 Railway Rifle says: “my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours” This man will go far.

I mean he could most likely even get a laptop for free if he put a review up here about it. Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop.

Also, how much do you imagine a journalist gets paid?

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier.

Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming.

There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

You have to run it with scaling, which causes all sorts of issues with older software and additional screens – annoying for what is supposed to be a “Pro” device. So recently I settled on running it directly at 1440×900 (16:10), with no scaling. It’s the native horizontal resolution of 2160 divided by 1.5, so the blurriness is minimized, it has a pixel density of a bit more than 140 ppi, which feels not too dense, and the integrated graphics can better withstand games at that resolution. This also means I can run some games windowed at 1280×720. Log in to Reply 03/05/2017 at 19:06 Nolenthar says: Fun times.

Read on for details. Creative Commons Zero Pixabay Linus Torvalds has returned to an animal-themed nickname for Kernel 4.11. After 4.10 was named “Happy Anniversary" for a brief time in its development cycle, 4.11 is Fearless Coyote, a name carried over from version 4.10-rc6. And, after spending an extra week on rc8, Torvalds remarked how the last leg of the development of 4.11 "contained smaller fixes [...] but nothing that made me go "hmm..."" -- which is the way he likes the last week to go. That doesn't mean the rest of the cycle has been uneventful, quite the contrary. For example, along with a bunch of improvements to video drivers, this kernel comes with drivers that implement the last link to get a fully functional DisplayPort MST support (to wit, audio) on Intel video cards. DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport (DP MST for short) is a technology that allows you to daisy-chain together several monitors. You only need one cable running from your output video port on your computer to a monitor, and then another cable running from the first monitor to a second monitor, and then another to the next, and so on. This means that, even with only one video port, in theory you could have any number of monitors hooked up to your machine. The new drivers now allow you to pipe audio to monitors decked out with loudspeakers. Decidedly cool. Continuing with Intel-based hardware, work has started on drivers to support graphic acceleration on the new Gemini Lake SoCs coming out later next year. This means that, by the time machines start shipping with Gemini Lake, hopefully, there will be mature drivers for Linux. Speaking of partially supported platforms, the Lego Mindstorms EV3 gets some love in 4.11. Currently working is pin muxing, pinconf, the GPIOs, the MicroSD card reader, the UART on input port 1, the buttons, the LEDs, poweroff/reset, the flash memory, EEPROM, the USB host port and the USB peripheral port. Stuff that is still being worked on includes the speaker, the A/DC chip, the display, Bluetooth, the input and output ports, and the battery indication. Other things to look forward to in 4.11 The ever-so-useful perf tool, used to analyze the performance on your machine, gets an ftrace function and function_graph trace. This will allow you to trace practically every function in the kernel, which is great for debugging or just to learn from watching the kernel working live. As usual, a fair number of ARM architectures are now supported by the kernel -- the HiSilicon Kirin960/Hi3660 and HiKey960 development board, for one. The Banana Pi M64, powered by an Allwinner A64 is another, as is the NXP LS1012a SoC, along with three developer boards using this hardware. Also supported are devices that adhere to the Opal Storage Specification. These are data storage devices (read "disk drives") that self-encrypt their contents and can only be de-encrypted by the owner of the device. For a full list of changes, some in-depth explanations, and links to the commits, take a look at this entry on the Kernel Newbies website.

Computer chip maker Intel created the event as an annual reminder that, for most of us, our password habits are nothing to celebrate. Instead, they – and computer professionals like me – hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to "qwerty" and "123456," which are still the most popular passwords. The problem with short, predictable passwords The purpose of a password is to limit access to information. Having a very common or simple one like "abcdef" or "letmein," or even normal words like "password" or "dragon," is barely any security at all, like closing a door but not actually locking it. Watch: Resetting our password habits Hackers' password cracking tools take advantage of this lack of creativity. When hackers find – or buy – stolen credentials, they will likely find that the passwords have been stored not as the text of the passwords themselves but as unique fingerprints, called "hashes," of the actual passwords. A hash function mathematically transforms each password into an encoded, fixed-size version of itself. Hashing the same original password will give the same result every time, but it's computationally nearly impossible to reverse the process, to derive a plaintext password from a specific hash. Instead, the cracking software computes the hash values for large numbers of possible passwords and compares the results to the hashed passwords in the stolen file. If any match, the hacker's in. The first place these programs start is with known hash values for popular passwords. More savvy users who choose a less common password might still fall prey to what is called a "dictionary attack." The cracking software tries each of the 171,000 words in the English dictionary. Then the program tries combined words (such as "qwertypassword"), doubled sequences ("qwertyqwerty"), and words followed by numbers ("qwerty123"). Load Error © Designer491 via Shutterstock.com password.jpg Moving on to blind guessing Only if the dictionary attack fails will the attacker reluctantly move to what is called a "brute-force attack," guessing arbitrary sequences of numbers, letters and characters over and over until one matches. Mathematics tells us that a longer password is less guessable than a shorter password. That's true even if the shorter password is made from a larger set of possible characters. For example, a six-character password made up of the 95 different symbols on a standard American keyboard yields 956, or 735 billion, possible combinations. That sounds like a lot, but a 10-character password made from only lowercase English characters yields 2610, 141 trillion, options. Of course, a 10-character password from the 95 symbols gives 9510, or 59 quintillion, possibilities. That's why some websites require passwords of certain lengths and with certain numbers of digits and special characters – they're designed to thwart the most common dictionary and brute-force attacks. Given enough time and computing power, though, any password is crackable. And in any case, humans are terrible at memorizing long, unpredictable sequences. We sometimes use mnemonics to help, like the way "Every Good Boy Does Fine" reminds us of the notes indicated by the lines on sheet music. They can also help us remember a password like "freQ!9tY!juNC," which at first appears very mixed up. Splitting the password into three chunks, "freQ!," "9tY!" and "juNC," reveals what might be remembered as three short, pronounceable words: "freak," "ninety" and "junk." People are better at memorizing passwords that can be chunked, either because they find meaning in the chunks or because they can more easily add their own meaning through mnemonics. Don't reuse passwords Suppose we take all this advice to heart and resolve to make all our passwords at least 15 characters long and full of random numbers and letters. We invent clever mnemonic devices, commit a few of our favorites to memory, and start using those same passwords over and over on every website and application. At first, this might seem harmless enough. But password-thieving hackers are everywhere. Recently, big companies including Yahoo, Adobe and LinkedIn have all been breached. Each of these breaches revealed the usernames and passwords for hundreds of millions of accounts. Hackers know that people commonly reuse passwords, so a cracked password on one site could make the same person vulnerable on a different site. Beyond the password Not only do we need long, unpredictable passwords, but we need different passwords for every site and program we use. The average internet user has 19 different passwords. It's easy to see why people write them down on sticky notes or just click the "I forgot my password" link. Software can help! The job of password management software is to take care of generating and remembering unique, hard-to-crack passwords for each website and application. Sometimes these programs themselves have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. And some websites block password managers from functioning. And of course, an attacker could peek at the keyboard as we type in our passwords. Multi-factor authentication was invented to solve these problems. This involves a code sent to a mobile phone, a fingerprint scan or a special USB hardware token. However, even though users know the multi-factor authentication is probably safer, they worry it might be more inconvenient or difficult. To make it easier, sites like Authy.com provide straightforward guides for enabling multi-factor authentication on popular websites. So no more excuses. Let's put on our party hats and start changing those passwords. World Password Day would be a great time to ditch "qwerty" for good, try out a password manager and turn on multi-factor authentication. Once you're done, go ahead and have that cake, because you'll deserve it.

Moving on to blind guessing Only if the dictionary attack fails will the attacker reluctantly move to what is called a “brute-force attack,” guessing arbitrary sequences of numbers, letters and characters over and over until one matches. Mathematics tells us that a longer password is less guessable than a shorter password. That’s true even if the shorter password is made from a larger set of possible characters. For example, a six-character password made up of the 95 different symbols on a standard American keyboard yields 956, or 735 billion, possible combinations. That sounds like a lot, but a 10-character password made from only lowercase English characters yields 2610, 141 trillion, options. Of course, a 10-character password from the 95 symbols gives 9510, or 59 quintillion, possibilities. That’s why some websites require passwords of certain lengths and with certain numbers of digits and special characters – they’re designed to thwart the most common dictionary and brute-force attacks. Given enough time and computing power, though, any password is crackable. And in any case, humans are terrible at memorizing long, unpredictable sequences. We sometimes use mnemonics to help, like the way “Every Good Boy Does Fine” reminds us of the notes indicated by the lines on sheet music. They can also help us remember a password like “freQ!9tY!juNC,” which at first appears very mixed up. Splitting the password into three chunks, “freQ!,” “9tY!” and “juNC,” reveals what might be remembered as three short, pronounceable words: “freak,” “ninety” and “junk.” People are better at memorizing passwords that can be chunked, either because they find meaning in the chunks or because they can more easily add their own meaning through mnemonics. Don’t reuse passwords Suppose we take all this advice to heart and resolve to make all our passwords at least 15 characters long and full of random numbers and letters. We invent clever mnemonic devices, commit a few of our favorites to memory, and start using those same passwords over and over on every website and application. At first, this might seem harmless enough. But password-thieving hackers are everywhere. Recently, big companies including Yahoo, Adobe and LinkedIn have all been breached. Each of these breaches revealed the usernames and passwords for hundreds of millions of accounts. Hackers know that people commonly reuse passwords, so a cracked password on one site could make the same person vulnerable on a different site. Beyond the password Not only do we need long, unpredictable passwords, but we need different passwords for every site and program we use. The average internet user has 19 different passwords. It’s easy to see why people write them down on sticky notes or just click the “I forgot my password” link. Software can help! The job of password management software is to take care of generating and remembering unique, hard-to-crack passwords for each website and application. Sometimes these programs themselves have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. And some websites block password managers from functioning. And of course, an attacker could peek at the keyboard as we type in our passwords. Multi-factor authentication was invented to solve these problems. This involves a code sent to a mobile phone, a fingerprint scan or a special USB hardware token. However, even though users know the multi-factor authentication is probably safer, they worry it might be more inconvenient or difficult. To make it easier, sites like Authy.com provide straightforward guides for enabling multi-factor authentication on popular websites. So no more excuses. Let’s put on our party hats and start changing those passwords. World Password Day would be a great time to ditch “qwerty” for good, try out a password manager and turn on multi-factor authentication.

Megan Squire | The Conversation Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Why we choose terrible passwords, and how to fix them Computer chip maker Intel celebrated the first Thursday of May as World Password Day The first Thursday in May is World Password Day, but don’t buy a cake or send cards. Computer chip maker Intel created the event as an annual reminder that, for most of us, our password habits are nothing to celebrate. Instead, they – and computer professionals like me – hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to “qwerty” and “123456,” which are still the most popular passwords. The problem with short, predictable passwords The purpose of a password is to limit access to information. Having a very common or simple one like “abcdef” or “letmein,” or even normal words like “password” or “dragon,” is barely any security at all, like closing a door but not actually locking it. Hackers’ password cracking tools take advantage of this lack of creativity. When hackers find – or buy – stolen credentials, they will likely find that the passwords have been stored not as the text of the passwords themselves but as unique fingerprints, called “hashes,” of the actual passwords. A hash function mathematically transforms each password into an encoded, fixed-size version of itself. Hashing the same original password will give the same result every time, but it’s computationally nearly impossible to reverse the process, to derive a plaintext password from a specific hash. Instead, the cracking software computes the hash values for large numbers of possible passwords and compares the results to the hashed passwords in the stolen file. If any match, the hacker’s in. The first place these programs start is with known hash values for popular passwords. More savvy users who choose a less common password might still fall prey to what is called a “dictionary attack.” The cracking software tries each of the 171,000 words in the English dictionary.

The new Aero 15 features a 15.6-inch FHD (1,920 x 1,080) IPS anti-glare LCD with slim 5mm bezels although there is an option to bump that up to a 4K UHD screen for a bit more coin. Powering the show is Intel’s 7th generation Core i7-7700HQ clocked at 2.8GHz alongside up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM and an Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics card with 6GB of memory. The machine can accommodate up to two M.2 SSDs and has a full complement of connectivity ports including a USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 port, SD card reader, combo audio jack and more. It also includes 802.11 ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, a Kensington lock slot and a full-size backlit keyboard with your choice of Windows 10 or Windows 10 Pro. Despite its slim size (14.0 (W) x 9.8 (D) x 0.78 (H) inches and 4.62 pounds), Gigabyte still managed to cram in a 94.2Wh battery that’s reportedly good for up to 10 hours of use between charges (expect that figure to drop when gaming, of course). The Gigabyte Aero 15 is currently available for $1,899 over on Newegg which includes 16GB of memory and a 512GB solid state drive in your choice of black, green or orange color schemes.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Qualcomm reportedly may try to block iPhone imports into the U.S. Aaron Pressman, Fortune May 3, 2017 8:12 PM Above: The back of the iPhone SE. The Apple logo is cast in stainless steel. Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat The escalating legal battle between Apple and Qualcomm may hit U.S. consumers next. Qualcomm is preparing to ask the agency that polices U.S. imports to block iPhones from entering the country, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing an anonymous source. The International Trade Commission has the authority to restrict imports of goods that violate intellectual property rights. Apple had some older Samsung phones blocked by the agency in 2013, for example, over alleged infringement of two patents. Although the iPhone is designed by Apple, it is manufactured in Asia and must be imported to reach U.S. consumers. Apple and Qualcomm declined to comment when contacted by Fortune. The dispute between the two titans of the mobile business broke out after Apple started using modem chips from Intel in about half of new iPhones last year, instead of buying all its chips from Qualcomm. Apple sued Qualcomm in January, saying Qualcomm’s royalties, imposed on iPhones both with and without Qualcomm’s chip set, were excessive. Qualcomm counter-sued on April 10, accusing Apple of harming its business and breaching deals between the two companies. If Qualcomm seeks to have iPhone imports stopped, the move would follow Apple’s decision to completely stop paying royalties to Qualcomm for the wireless technologies included in the device. Qualcomm disclosed last week that Apple was withholding the disputed fees, which total about $500 million for the second quarter. Over the previous three quarters, Apple had withheld only a portion of the fees, totaling $1 billion. Shares of Qualcomm have lost 16% so far this year, as the dispute with Apple and various regulators around the world have threatened the company’s business. Qualcomm invented many core technologies over decades that are now used in wireless networks and smartphones. The chip maker charges royalties for a portion of the value of every phone sold, whether it contains communications microprocessor chips made by the company or by its rivals, arguing that some of its inventions must be referenced in every chip. But Apple and regulators claim Qualcomm is abusing a dominant market position to extract excessive payments. Qualcomm’s royalty agreements are with Apple’s contract manufacturers like Foxconn, not directly with Apple. Apple has said it had been trying unsuccessfully to negotiate a direct licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years. During a call with analysts on Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook explained Apple’s reasoning for withholding the royalties. “You can’t pay something when there’s a dispute about the amount–you don’t know how much to pay,” Cook said. “I don’t believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that,” he also noted, referring to the possibility that Qualcomm might seek to have iPhone sales blocked. “I think that there’s plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see.” This story originally appeared on Fortune.com.

RUGABER AP Business Writers May 3, 2017 Updated 1 hr ago 0 Marcio Jose Sanchez FILE- In this Oct. 27, 2016, file photo, Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an announcement of new products in Cupertino, Calif. Apple will invest $1 billion to help create more U.S. manufacturing jobs and counter recurring criticism about its reliance on overseas factories to assemble most of its iPhones and other devices. Cook announced the fund during a Wednesday, May 3, 2017, interview on CNBC’s “Mad Money.” (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is getting more aggressive about emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, apparently hoping to counter recurring criticism over its reliance on overseas factories. On Wednesday, Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work, showing that more than half of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. CEO Tim Cook first described the manufacturing fund an interview on CNBC, but didn't say how the money will be disbursed or who will be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Apple's initial billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire "thousands of employees, thousands more in the future" in the U.S., although he didn't specify how quickly that will happen. Apple's U.S. payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 U.S. workers. Cook also said Apple is examining ways to help more people learn the programming skills to make apps. THREATS TO APPLE Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from China, a change that would drive up Apple's costs. That could pressure the company to raise its prices at a time when it is already having trouble increasing its sales of iPhones and iPads. "They are trying to make the case that they really do have a lot of folks working in the U.S.," said technology industry analyst Rob Enderle. "So if want to pick on somebody, you might want to pick on somebody else because they won't be a good example." Cook isn't the only CEO who has been trying to highlight his company's hiring and expansion plans in the U.S. Trump has attacked many companies, frequently on Twitter, for moving jobs out of the U.S. and lavishly praised those who have announced major hiring initiatives. As a result, many companies, including Exxon Mobil, Intel, Charter Communications and Ford Motor, have unveiled big hiring plans, though in many cases they were already in the works before the presidential campaign. "There is a lot of political pressure to create jobs in the United States," Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, said. Chief executives "do not want to show up in a tweet." APPLE IN THE STATES Since 2014, Apple has issued a series of reports intended to underscore its contributions to U.S. jobs and economic growth. Its first report came after years of complaints about labor practices and suicides at Foxconn, one of the company's major contractors in China, drew more attention to Apple's reliance on overseas factories. Apple to also issues a separate "supplier responsibility" report reviewing the labor conditions in those facilities. The Wednesday report on U.S jobs is its fourth update, but the first to include a state-by-state breakdown of Apple employees. Unsurprisingly, the numbers show its highest concentration of workers (36,786) is located in California, home to the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and 53 stores. Apple's second biggest employment center is in Texas (8,407 jobs), where it has a corporate campus and 18 stores. Its smallest pockets of employment are in North Dakota (four jobs), Vermont (six) and Wyoming (seven). Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Apple's decision to provide detailed information about the locations of its U.S. employees could help the company win support from lawmakers eager to protect jobs in their states, Enderle said. "It gives senators something to push back with, recognizing that Apple is a real risky company to target anyway because its products are so popular with people." Besides showing how many of its full-time and part-time employees work in each state, Apple also lists where its 9,000 U.S. suppliers are located. The company says it spent more than $50 billion at its U.S. suppliers last year, helping them employ a total of 450,000 workers. APP ECONOMY The company also cited a study by the Progressive Policy Institute that attributes 1.5 million U.S. jobs to Apple's iPhone "ecosystem." That figure not only includes programmers that work on the apps, but also supporting staff and employees working everywhere from banks to restaurants that have jobs because of the spending generated by apps. Such "spillover" effects are widely recognized, although economists sometimes spar over their magnitude. But for a company to claim credit for all or most of the jobs in a particular industry is a stretch, Swonk said. The vast majority of app developers, for example, also produce apps for Android phones from Samsung and other manufacturers. The Public Policy Institute only found 1.7 million jobs in the entire "app economy" — and 1.35 million of those were associated with Android apps. Most of those overlap with the jobs linked to Apple. ___ Rugaber reported from Washington. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Now, it seems like Microsoft is about to challenge the market that Google once had with the Surface Laptop. When one hears of Chromebooks, the next thing that comes to mind is its cost. Many would know by now that for a struggling student, the Chromebook is the most viable option for a laptop for school use. But now that Microsoft has entered the fray, students will now be able to make a choice on which system to get. But perhaps the main question is, “which one is better?” Cost In terms of cost, Google Chromebooks do come cheap. Some manufacturers even go as low as $199 for a brand new unit. Of course, with that price, one cannot expect a top-notch performance. However, there are some Chromebooks out there that has far superior hardware capabilities but still keep the cost under $500. On the other hand, the Surface Laptop starts at $999. For anyone looking for more “oomph factor,” the specs can be boosted for a few hundred dollars more. Operating system Anyone who has been using a computer for a long time will know that switching operating systems can sometimes be a pain. There is the uncomfortable adjustment period that one has trying to re-learn the nooks and crannies of a new operating system. This is why when choosing a device, it is one of the first considerations that one includes in the list. Microsoft Surface Laptop (via microsoftstore.com) The Surface Laptop and the Chromebook have something in common, they both use a lightweight operating system. These operating systems, while behaving in the completely opposite sides of the spectrum, do share one commonality: they are both tied to an app store. The Windows 10 S is reliant on the Windows Store for all the apps that can be run on the Surface Laptop. If an app is not available in the Windows Store, there is no chance at all to run the application in question without upgrading to a Windows 10 Pro. Meanwhile, the same thing applies for the Chromebook. However, the only good thing about the Chromebook, is that it can also run Android apps that normally run on a mobile phone. Performance When it comes to performance, the Surface Laptop is here to represent. This is due to the fact that the base specs start with an Intel i5 processor with 4GB of RAM and 128 of flash storage. Meanwhile, a Chromebook normally comes with an M series Intel processor with the same amount of RAM and storage. However, there are some Chromebooks that sport an Intel i5 chip like the Acer Chromebook 15 but still keep the cost to well under $500. Acre Chromebook 15 (via acer.com) As mentioned, the Surface Laptop price starts at $999. The top-tier version of the laptop can set anyone back $2,699. But it should be noted that this configuration includes an Intel i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of flash storage. When it comes to choosing between a Chromebook and the Surface Laptop, the first thing to be considered is the budget. If one wants a cheap and cheerful system, then the Google Chromebook is the obvious choice. However, for top-draw performance, the Surface Laptop is the best option.

CDT May 03, 2017 Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, visits an Apple store where third grade children from PS 57 James Weldon Johnson Leadership Academy are learning how to code through Apple's 'Hour of Code' workshop in New York City. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — Apple CEO Tim Cook says his company will invest $1 billion in a U.S. manufacturing fund to boost American jobs, the latest Silicon Valley company to attempt to build bridges to the new administration by responding to President Trump's call to put America first. Trump criticized Apple during the presidential election for manufacturing the iPhone and other products overseas. Amazon pledged to create 100,000 U.S. jobs over the next two years. Intel said it would invest $7 billion in an Arizona chip-making plant. Cook told CNBC in an interview Wednesday that the new fund’s first investment would be in a U.S. venture later this month. He did not name the venture. "By doing that, we can be the ripple in the pond. Because if we can create many manufacturing jobs around, those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them," Cook said. The investment would be the first of several to come from Apple this year, which include increasing the size of Apple's U.S. employee base by thousands and propelling the creation of more mobile apps by teaching people to code, Cook said. Earlier this year Apple said it was investing $1 billion in the SoftBank Vision Fund,  a new fund that will work on developing new, strategically important, technologies. "I think with each administration in every country in the world, there are things you disagree and things you agree, and you look to find common ground and try to influence the things you don't," he said. "If you don't show up, I think that's the worst scenario because then you're quiet and this doesn't do your cause any good or your point of view any good." During the interview with CNBC, Cook also urged the Trump administration to hand tax breaks to companies that repatriate cash from overseas. Apple currently has $239 billion overseas. "To invest in the U.S. we have to borrow. This doesn’t make sense on a broad basis," he said. © 2017 USA TODAY CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS KHOU Live Web Desk Fatal accident shuts down I-45 at Cypresswood Wednesday morning forecast HPD: Father opens fire on home invasion suspects Deacon accused of child sex abuse Why aren't there tornado sirens in Houston?

Tech News | 03 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (0) New Microsoft OS and Laptop Aim at Apple and Google in Education by Julio Ojeda-Zapata Tech titans have clashed for decades in the education market. Early on, Apple had an enviable position in K-12 and higher education, first with the Apple II and later the Mac, but later on lost ground to inexpensive Windows-based PCs. Then came the iPad and an Apple resurgence in the classroom, only to have that challenged by Google and its Web-centric Chromebooks. Meanwhile, Microsoft has been planning its return to the education market. The Redmond tech giant showed its hand on 2 May 2017 in a press event that glossed over the consumer and business realms for once and focused squarely on education. The keynote, brief as these things go, revealed a new Surface laptop intended primarily for use in classrooms, a new flavor of the Windows operating system – again, largely for student use – and a bunch of education-friendly software tools. Let’s break it all down, so those who work with or recommend Apple’s education solutions know what the alternatives are. Surface Laptop -- In education, both the iPad and Chromebooks have their problems. As a tablet, the iPad is a bit awkward for writing because it lacks an integrated physical keyboard. It’s pricey, too. Chromebooks have keyboards and tend to be less expensive but, unlike muscular and nicely constructed iPads, they have a reputation for being underpowered and chintzy. Microsoft aims to lick both problems with its new Surface Laptop, a well-built and powerful PC with a traditional clamshell configuration that’s also relatively affordable. Starting at $999, the 2.76 pound (1.25 kg) Surface Laptop uses beefy 7th-generation Intel Core processors, boasts an advertised 14.5 hours of battery life, and features a 13.5-inch, 3.4-million-pixel touch display with Gorilla Glass 3 for ruggedness (a must in the classroom). Microsoft claims this “PixelSense” display is the thinnest LCD touch screen on any notebook and brags that the laptop has 4 more hours of battery life than a 13-inch MacBook Pro under certain conditions. Aesthetics include anodized metal outside — in an Apple-like move, it comes in a choice of four shades: Burgundy, Cobalt Blue, Graphite Gold, and Platinum. Inside, the Surface Laptop uses warmer materials, including soft-to-the-touch Alcantara fabric surrounding the keyboard and trackpad — the same durable, stain-resistant polyester/polyurethane fabric found on the outside of Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablet keyboard covers. The Surface Laptop, which is 0.57 inches (14.47 mm) at its thickest point, is a notable departure from previous Surface gear that boasts less conventional designs. It’s neither a chunky Surface Book with a weird hinge and removable screen nor a Surface Pro tablet with detachable keyboard and metal flip-out stand. Windows 10 S -- Apple’s iOS and Google’s Chrome OS have a reputation for being simple to use and manage, though in radically different ways. Now Microsoft is offering a third choice, a simplified version of Windows it calls Windows 10 S and intends largely for classroom use. To that end, it’s somewhat limited: it only runs apps from Microsoft’s app store, leaving out many traditional desktop apps. The reasoning is similar to Apple’s with the Mac App Store: apps offered for download have been vetted for security and offer uniformity in how they are used, both of which are music to the ears of classroom tech administrators. But Microsoft has tried app-store-only Windows versions before without much success. Windows 10 S has other notable limitations. Users can’t designate a default Web browser other than Microsoft’s own Edge. Nor can they change the search provider to something other than Microsoft’s Bing. Microsoft announced that full-featured versions of its Office apps would be made available via the app store — until now, its app store offered only limited versions of the Office apps. Microsoft is also adapting its Edge Web browser with students in mind, adding a space for organizing tabs into groups, which could be useful for thematic organization when writing school papers and the like. Tech administrators also get a few goodies, including the option to upgrade any Windows 10 S PC to Windows 10 Pro (after which it cannot be reverted to Windows 10 S) and an option to set up classroom laptops automatically just by inserting a USB flash drive with Windows 10 S configuration specs. Microsoft is not keeping Windows 10 S to itself. In addition to the Surface Laptop, notebooks from the likes of Acer, Asus, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, Samsung, and Toshiba will run Windows 10 S. Some of these machines will reportedly cost as little as $189, putting them squarely in the same price range as cheap Chromebooks. Teams, Minecraft, and More -- Although Microsoft has been expanding into hardware, it’s a software company at its core, so it’s not surprising that Monday’s keynote focused on applications suitable for education. One of these is Microsoft Teams, group chat software initially released for the business market. In now offering it to the education market, the company said it will “make Teams the digital hub for the classroom where teachers and students come to collaborate and learn.” Focusing Teams on education is an important move for Microsoft to make because of the robust collaboration features built into Google’s productivity apps, which are widely used in schools as well as businesses. In addition, platform-agnostic products such as Slack are making group chat an essential part of modern collaboration in both business and education. Microsoft also made an announcement related to Minecraft, the popular world-building software it bought in 2014. It is now building in coding features aimed at students, which is not unlike how Apple positions its Swift Playgrounds coding app (see “Playing Around with Swift on the iPad,” 13 June 2016). These changes will integrate Minecraft with student-coding platforms like Tynker, ScratchX, and Microsoft’s MakeCode, along with grown-up coding technology JavaScript. In this manner, students can write code that makes things happen in Minecraft environments, like building structures. Again, this isn’t far off from what Apple does in Swift Playgrounds, although Minecraft is already hugely popular among the school-age set. Microsoft also announced a renewed push into “mixed reality” with students in mind. Mixed reality refers to a combination of virtual reality (where you strap on goggles to navigate simulated worlds) and augmented reality (which layers digital constructs onto the real world; think Pokémon Go). Gear like Microsoft’s HoloLens headset is intended to facilitate such blended experiences, with more Microsoft mixed-reality hardware said to be on the way (see “Windows Goes Universal… and Holographic,” 23 January 2015, and “On the iPhone, Virtual Reality Is Unofficially Real,” 17 June 2016). In addition, Microsoft announced a deal with education-content giant Pearson, which has pledged to offer mixed-reality content in a variety of topic areas, including health, commerce, history, and STEM (short for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The Third Option -- Despite the continued prevalence of Windows PCs in schools, Microsoft has clearly been feeling left behind by Apple and Google in the education market. To respond, Microsoft has adapted its core products into what it believes is a compelling package for educators and their administration overlords: a powerful, durable laptop that, along with a familiar operating system modified for increased ease of use and security. Also, Minecraft! Naysayers will note that the new Surface Laptop is not exactly education-priced: a starting price of $999 is steep compared to Chromebooks that can be had for as little as $200. Also, Microsoft’s education-focused message gets muddled when it makes comparisons to the MacBook Pro, which may be relevant in higher education, but less so in the K-12 classroom. Critics will also wonder why Microsoft is releasing yet another limited version of Windows. Didn’t it learn anything from the likes of Windows RT and Windows Starter Edition, two previous attempts to push simplified versions of its iconic operating system? But educators who are weary of rickety Chromebooks and keyboard-less iPads may look seriously at Microsoft’s offerings. And if that fosters competition, schools win in the end.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Kateeva President & COO, Dr. Conor Madigan, Addresses Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing to Honor World Intellectual Property Day /EINPresswire.com/ — NEWARK, CA–(Marketwired – May 3, 2017) – Last week, at a special Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington, DC to mark World Intellectual Property (IP) Day, Committee Chair, Senator Chuck Grassley R (IA), and select members heard from executives representing IP-driven US technology companies. The hearing was titled „Intellectual Property — driver of innovation: Making our lives healthier, safer, and more productive.” Kateeva’s President and COO, Dr. Conor Madigan, was invited to join the panel that included representatives from Dupont Pioneer, Intel Corp. and Sproxil, Inc., as well as the Acting Assistant Director for the IP Rights Center at the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. Chairman Grassley opened the session by noting the impact of IP on today’s economy. IP-intensive industries employ more than 40 million Americans, he said, while accounting for 35 percent of the nation’s GDP. The 90-minute hearing covered issues ranging from the business of creating high-value IP, to the challenges of protection and global enforcement. Madigan, who co-founded Kateeva in 2008, told the Committee of the founders’ roots at MIT — one of the nation’s premier research institutions. He characterized IP as the engine that propelled Kateeva from a start-up, to a Silicon Valley employer of 330 people and provider of precision deposition equipment used to mass produce OLED displays. In complimenting the Committee for supporting patent policies that encourage innovation, Madigan also noted the importance of legislation that safeguards the innovations that differentiate US companies operating in the global marketplace. Following the hearing, Madigan and Kateeva Chairman & CEO Dr. Alain Harrus met with congressional representatives on Capitol Hill. Harrus noted that IP is at the center of Kateeva’s inkjet deposition solution for manufacturing OLED displays. „We have filed for more than 250 patents worldwide to protect the many novel innovations embedded in our flagship YIELDjet™ Platform,” he said. „Additional innovations differentiate our YIELDjet™ FLEX product, which today leads the market for OLED Thin Film Encapsulation (TFE) mass production. Given the investment in such technology innovation, the resulting enabling IP must be respected and protected universally. We’re gratified that Senator Grassley and his Committee are such ardent defenders of this principle.” YIELDjet is a trademark of Kateeva, Inc. About Kateeva, Inc. Kateeva makes breakthrough production equipment for manufacturers of advanced electronics technologies.

The debate over his actions has lost none of its intensity in the six months since the election. But the FBI director dealt confidently with tough questioning from senators from both parties.  If Comey did not persuade any critics into his camp, he committed no missteps to deepen his problems. And he gave a fuller explanation than ever before of the bind in which he believed he had been placed during last year’s election season. Comey acknowledged that the realization the bureau could have affected the election’s outcome left him feeling “mildly nauseous.”  But, he added, “honestly, it wouldn’t change the decision.” Comey has been transformed into an unusual kind of political celebrity over the past year, his decisions coming in for sharp criticism from almost every point of the political spectrum.  News reports have cited anonymous sources within the intelligence community casting him as too fond of the spotlight, despite his repeated insistence to the contrary. Whether he sought it or not, Wednesday's Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing was yet another center-stage moment for the FBI director. Cable networks carried virtually uninterrupted coverage of his testimony from the moment he took his seat before a scrum of news photographers.  The hearing had moments of real tension, especially in an exchange between Comey and the panel’s most senior Democrat, Sen. Dianne FeinsteinDianne FeinsteinGOP senators hit Rice for refusal to testify before Senate panel Comey to Congress: No regrets Overnight Cybersecurity: Comey testifies on Clinton probe, surveillance | Officials grilled over financial aid breach | Massive phishing attack hits Gmail users MORE of California.   Comey, who had sat impassively during opening remarks in which Feinstein criticized his behavior during the elections season as “extraordinary,” responded with vigor when it came his turn to speak. The central issue was his decision, less than two weeks before November’s election, to inform Congress that FBI agents had found new emails that they believed could be pertinent to the bureau’s earlier investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonComey to Congress: No regrets Overnight Cybersecurity: Comey testifies on Clinton probe, surveillance | Officials grilled over financial aid breach | Massive phishing attack hits Gmail users Budowsky: A fascist-friendly POTUS MORE.   That investigation sought to determine whether Clinton had handled classified information improperly in using a private email address and server while she was secretary of State. Comey insisted that he was confronted with two unpalatable choices once he learnt of the new emails, which had been discovered as part of a separate investigation into disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.). Weiner is the now-estranged husband of key Clinton aide Huma Abedin. “I could not see a door labeled ‘no action’ ” he said. Instead, Comey asserted, he only had the option of speaking about the discovery — a choice he characterized as “really bad” — or not speaking about it, a course that he viewed as tantamount to concealment. “ ‘Speak’ would be really bad. There’s an election in 11 days. Lordy, that would be really bad," Comey said with an anguished look. But, he added, “concealing in my view would be catastrophic, not just to the FBI but well beyond.” He added to the hushed committee room that, “Honestly, as between really bad and catastrophic, I said to my team, we got to walk into the world of really bad.”  Feinstein’s Democratic colleague, Sen. Patrick LeahyPatrick LeahyComey to Congress: No regrets THE MEMO: Comey commands the stage FBI director to Congress: No regrets MORE of Vermont, accused Comey of a double standard for not confirming the existence of an investigation into possible cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russia, even when his comments on the Clinton email investigation were making headlines. But Comey parried that attack effectively, insisting that there was a consistent principle he had been able to uphold.  “We treated it like we did with the Clinton investigation,” he said. “We didn’t say a word about it until months into it, and then the only thing we’ve confirmed so far about this is the same thing with the Clinton investigation: that we are investigating. And I would expect we’re not going to say another peep about it until we’re done.” Comey also frustrated some of the Republican questioners. He avoided being drawn into comment on media reports that then-attorney general Loretta Lynch had promised to curb the FBI investigation so it did not do excessive damage to Clinton. He also came under questioning from Republicans, including Sen.

MORE (Texas), about why he did not move toward charging Abedin, whom he said had forwarded emails containing classified information to her husband’s computer for him to print out. Comey’s argument was that his agents had not been able to prove criminal intent on Abedin’s part. The finer points of the Clinton investigation might have already been consigned to history were it not for the fact that the two principals in last year’s election continue to litigate Comey’s actions.  Clinton said at an event in New York on Tuesday that she was “on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me.” President Trump for his part tweeted on Tuesday evening that “FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!” Some new details did emerge from the hearing. Comey appeared to obliquely confirm that he was looking into whether FBI agents had leaked information to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Trump ally.  He also displayed, once again, his gift for a telling sound bite, in describing Wikileaks as trafficking in “intelligence porn.”  The organization had acted, he alleged, as a mere “conduit for the Russian intelligence services or some other adversary of the United States just to push out information to damage the United States.” Wikileaks’ Julian Assange shot back on Twitter that the intelligence agencies “now go around proclaiming who is and who isn't a journalist or publisher,” adding, “What nonsense.”  But the day’s key message was that Comey was not backing down from his decisions.   At one point, he said that a junior lawyer in the bureau had asked whether the director should consider that his decision on the new Clinton emails might help elect Trump as president. “And I said, thank you for raising that: not for a moment,” Comey said. “Down that path lies the death of the FBI as an independent institution in America.” The Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald TrumpDonald TrumpChrissy Teigen: ‘So tired’ of Trump admin. ‘I'm gonna have to go on another med’ Stephen Colbert reacts to online backlash over Trump jokes Overnight Healthcare: House to vote Thursday on ObamaCare repeal MORE’s presidency.

Share Tweet Comment The case for investing in high-performance computing By Patricia A. Damkroger May 03, 2017 High-performance computing is essential for a thriving, innovation-based economy -- and sustained government investment is essential for advancing U.S. HPC leadership. If we scale back that investment, we put our economic power, our ability to innovate and our national security at risk. Let me explain. A force multiplier for innovation and efficiency HPC encompasses the computing, communications and networking technologies that go into the world’s most powerful supercomputers. HPC also includes the systems software, applications, tools, algorithms, mathematical models and other elements that turn supercomputers into practical engines of innovation and competitiveness. The next-generation technologies that underlie our nation’s technology infrastructure and drive the national economy forward depend on HPC. The breakthroughs that went into yesterday’s supercomputers are transforming today’s data centers, smart phones and assembly lines. They run the algorithms and applications that make possible everything from highly efficient manufacturing to high-throughput financial trading. HPC is a force multiplier for the U.S. economy, amplifying the impact of American labor and ingenuity. Using HPC innovations, manufacturers design products faster, explore creative approaches more quickly, and produce products more efficiently. They reduce the cost of innovation and price their products more competitively. The investment firm IDC has calculated that each dollar invested in HPC returns an average $514.7 in revenue. Want to drop a new oil or gas well, or get more output from existing ones? You’ll need HPC. Design drugs that cure cancer or Alzheimer’s? HPC. Analyze a new airplane design? Optimize the power grid? Stop the next superbug in its tracks? Manage the nation’s nuclear stockpile? HPC, HPC, HPC, HPC. Expanding our innovation pipeline Just as high-performance computing is a force multiplier for an innovation-fueled economy, the federal government has been a force multiplier for HPC. Starting from the NASA calculation engines that helped put Neil Armstrong on the moon and the DARPA networks that spurred today’s connected economy, federal agencies have been leading users, funders and collaborators in advancing HPC. Today, some of the brightest minds from the nation’s government agencies work alongside tech stars from Intel, IBM, Cray and other companies, and computational scientists from our top universities to create the next generation of HPC technologies and tools. I’ve seen these collaborations from my previous position providing resources to advance HPC-enabled research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and now at Intel, where I help establish direction for next-generation HPC technologies. These partnerships tackle the most difficult HPC design challenges and produce technologies and tools that will keep our economic motor humming for years to come. By extending this collaboration, Congress and the administration can expand the nation’s innovation pipeline, deliver value across the political spectrum and spur growth in virtually every sector of the American economy. Huge opportunities Federal action is especially important now because the opportunities to benefit from HPC are so enormous. Big data, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, cloud computing and other technologies are maturing rapidly. Powered by HPC-enabled digital infrastructure, they’re coming together in ways that will rapidly change how we live, work, and lead in a global economy. One of the most exciting areas is precision medicine. Genomic sequencing is among the fastest-advancing technologies in history new methods for preventing, diagnosing, and treating diseases—methods that can help keep people healthier, eliminate wasteful diagnostics spending, and deliver cost-effective healthcare services to more patients more efficiently. Not only is a healthier population an economic asset to the nation, but leadership in precision medicine will help maintain the United States as a center of life sciences research, clinical and pharmaceutical discovery, and bioscience innovation. It’s not just human health that will benefit. Similar approaches will help agribusinesses increase crop yields and keep their herds healthy—the better to feed a rising population. Automotive and manufacturing innovation are other areas of accelerating transformation. Self-driving or autonomous vehicles—backed by HPC infrastructure, high-speed networks, advanced visioning systems, AI and massive amounts of data analytics—are expected to improve traffic flow, safety and productivity. Similarly, HPC-powered manufacturing automation will transform the industrial sector. AI, machine-to-machine communications, connected sensors, image recognition solutions and other technologies are already beginning to streamline operations, increase factory outputs and improve worker safety. Will the U.S. be ready? The United States is not alone in eying the opportunities created by HPC and the applications that utilize HPC technologies. China, Japan and the European Union are preparing to exploit the opportunities, and are making large investments in HPC. China says it will demonstrate the world’s first exascale supercomputer, capable of making one billion billion calculations per second (and, no, that’s not a typo) in 2017. The machine will use Chinese chips, and China is rumored to plan on using it to develop new nuclear weapons. In periods of disruptive innovation, businesses and nations that fail to adapt can easily see their leadership slip away. So while the opportunities are tremendous, so too are the risks if America does not take advantage of them. Companies can be a sparkplug that ignites the U.S. economy, but the greatest success and the greatest benefit to the nation’s economy will come from continued public/private collaboration—and from sustained federal commitments to high-performance computing. We look to President Donald Trump and Congress to provide that commitment—and to extend American greatness into a new era. About the Author Patricia A.

Qualcomm is preparing to ask the agency that polices U.S. imports to block iPhones from entering the country, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing an anonymous source. The International Trade Commission has the authority to restrict imports of goods that violate intellectual property rights. Apple had some older Samsung phones blocked by the agency in 2013, for example, over alleged infringement of two patents. Although the iPhone is designed by Apple, it is manufactured in Asia and must be imported to reach U.S. consumers. Apple and Qualcomm declined to comment when contacted by Fortune. The dispute between the two titans of the mobile business broke out after Apple started using modem chips from Intel (intc) in about half of new iPhones last year, instead of buying all its chips from Qualcomm. Apple sued Qualcomm in January, saying Qualcomm's royalties, imposed on iPhones both with and without Qualcomm's chip set, were excessive. Qualcomm counter-sued on April 10, accusing Apple of harming its business and breaching deals between the two companies. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. If Qualcomm seeks to have iPhone imports stopped, the move would follow Apple's decision to completely stop paying royalties to Qualcomm for the wireless technologies included in the device. Qualcomm disclosed last week that Apple was withholding the disputed fees, which total about $500 million for the second quarter. Over the previous three quarters, Apple had withheld only a portion of the fees, totaling $1 billion. Shares of Qualcomm have lost 16% so far this year, as the dispute with Apple and various regulators around the world have threatened the company's business. Qualcomm invented many core technologies over decades that are now used in wireless networks and smartphones. The chip maker charges royalties for a portion of the value of every phone sold, whether it contains communications microprocessor chips made by the company or by its rivals, arguing that some of its inventions must be referenced in every chip. But Apple and regulators claim Qualcomm is abusing a dominant market position to extract excessive payments. Qualcomm's royalty agreements are with Apple's contract manufacturers like Foxconn, not directly with Apple. Apple (aapl) has said it had been trying unsuccessfully to negotiate a direct licensing agreement with Qualcomm (qcom) for more than five years. During a call with analysts on Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook explained Apple's reasoning for withholding the royalties. "You can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount–you don't know how much to pay," Cook said. "I don't believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that," he also noted, referring to the possibility that Qualcomm might seek to have iPhone sales blocked. "I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see."

The Surface laptop runs on the Windows 10 S operating system, featuring an Intel Core 7th generation processor, 14.5 hours of battery life, a 13.5 inch PixelSense display, optically bonded Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and a keyboard covered in Alcantara material. The Surface is available in four colors: platinum, graphite gold, cobalt blue and burgundy. It will sell for US$999. Microsoft has begun taking preorders for the Surface laptop, which will be available June 15 in 20 countries, including the U.S. and the UK. The Surface will be available online at the Microsoft Store and at BestBuy.com. The laptop will be available in Canada and China later this year. Microsoft will make Windows 10 S PCs available to students and teachers starting at $189 and bundled with a free one-year subscription to Minecraft: Education Edition; Windows 10 S will be free for schools with Windows Pro PCs. It will offer a free trial of Microsoft Intune for Education, free Office 365 for Education with Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft 365 for education. Late to the Party Microsoft's product launch comes late in the game. Apple initially carved out a niche in education, and Google made its Chromebook devices a centerpiece of its effort to loosen Apple's grip. Microsoft appears confident there's room for one more, however, and it aims to help schools use Windows 10 and Surface to prepare students for the collaborative workforce of the future. "We are under no illusion that technology alone is the answer to transforming education," CEO Satya Nadella told attendees at the Microsoft Education event in New York City, noting that dedicated administrators, great teachers, motivated students and involved parents are at the forefront of building a great education system. "Technology is merely a tool to empower their creativity and their ingenuity." Terry Myerson, vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, introduced the new operating system, which is a stripped down version of the Windows 10 OS. Applications that run on the new OS are downloaded from the Windows Store to a safe "container," and the full Office 365 suite -- including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and other apps -- will be coming to the Windows Store. Specialized lesson plans, including lessons for STEM and a full range of peripherals, such as mixed-reality headsets, will be available to work with the OS, Myerson noted. Partners including Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, Samsung and Toshiba are offering compatible PCs, starting at $189, and they will offer a full range of touchscreen devices and peripherals, as well as Windows Ink, which can be used for on-screen note-taking. Microsoft plans to host STEM Saturdays during the month of May, featuring pop-up STEM classrooms, at Windows Stores in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico and Australia. The company also introduced a feature for Windows 10 called "View Mixed Reality," which allows users to see 3D content move from the screen into the real world as mixed reality, thanks to an RGB Camera. Microsoft announced a partnership with Pearson, one of the world's largest educational firms, to integrate 3D and mixed reality into secondary and university education curricula. By 2018, Pearson will feature health, commerce, history and STEM-related curricula on Windows Mixed Reality devices. Chromebook Dominance "This is definitely an education play," said Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "Most of the features are geared towards the non-power or application specific user," he told the E-Commerce Times. It's noteworthy that Microsoft's announcement comes three months after Google announced the Acer Chromebook Spin 11 and the Asus Chromebook C213 at the annual Bett conference, one of the world's largest educational technology conferences. Chromebook has taken the lion's share of the K-12 education market in recent years. iPads also have been widely used, but Windows adoption as an operating system for that segment of the market has lagged. "The Windows 10 S strategy is interesting," said Jim McGregor, a principal analyst at Tirias Research. "It is targeted at heading off the growing threat from Chromebooks," he told the E-Commerce Times. Chromebooks struggled early on to compete in the enterprise and consumer markets against full-fledged personal computers. They have gained traction in the education space, though, in part due to their lower cost and also due to their appeal as a mobile operating system already familiar to younger consumers. Google estimates that more than 20 million students and teachers use Chromebook. Chromebook dominated the U.S. mobile PC market for the K-12 segment in 2016, with 58 percent of market, according to Futuresource. However, outside the United States, the market is far less settled, and it's still very much anyone's game. David Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey.

A view of the new Microsoft Surface Laptop following a Microsoft launch event, May 2, 2017 in New York City. -- AFP The Surface laptop comes in four colors -- gold, platinum, blue and burgundy -- and ditches a metal area around the keyboard for a softer microfiber lining. It has a 13.5-inch (34.3 centimeter) touch screen, runs the latest Intel processors and gets 14.5 hours of battery life, according to Microsoft. It also will run the new Windows 10S operating system, software the company presented Tuesday that will be faster and offer better security than previous versions. Microsoft is targeting the new operating system and laptop at the education market, where the total value of personal computing device shipments -- including desktops, notebooks and tablets -- has reached $15.6 billion, according to research firm IDC. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and Apple had long dominated the school computing market, but Alphabet, Inc.’s Google has made inroads recently with its low-priced and simple Chromebooks. With the new Surface laptop, Microsoft is hoping to attract college-age buyers who want both a reliable machine and premium design and materials. “We know a lot of students use MacBook Airs and MacBook pros and those are awesome,” Panos Panay, vice-president for Surface Computing, said at the event. But he said the Surface laptop is lighter and thinner with a longer battery life than any MacBook Air or MacBook Pro on the market today. The new device represents Microsoft’s first classic clamshell computer -- previous versions were either a tablet or a hybrid tablet/notebook. The base model includes 128 GB of storage, 4 GB of RAM and runs on an Intel Core i5 processor. More expensive configurations are also available with a faster Intel Core i7 chip, storage capacities up to a terabyte and as much as 16GB of RAM. Core to the new laptop is Windows 10S, which looks and feels like the current operating system but limits the apps users can download to those available only from Microsoft. The company says that extends battery life and makes the laptop faster and more secure. -- Bloomberg E-mail | Print |     From / email :     To :     E-mail (required) :     Message :     Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.  BREAKING NEWS Eastern Visayas leads regional GDP growth ...more    MORE STORIES Microsoft presents $999 laptop in hardware push to rival Apple Peugeot to test-drive robotic cars China to unveil Wikipedia rival in 2018 Opinion: "How the robot apocalypse will actually go down" Top Smartphone vendors Amazon makes a case for cloud migration PHL operations to play crucial role in Oracle + Netsuite global expansion Chinese drone maker taps local distributor Data heartache: Losing memories you love Facebook pushes to augment reality through smartphones    MOST READ    MOST E-MAILED 1.

Before these future flyers can take off, they must learn to play by the rules of the sky. That means communicating with air traffic control and other aircraft, spotting and avoiding threats, and generally knowing what to do when things go sideways. Making all of this happen demands whole new levels of capability—not just from the aircraft, but from the sprawling system that oversees them.

Even though commercial drone technology barely existed a decade ago, regulators are hustling to integrate it into the national airspace. The FAA tapped Intel CEO Brian Krzanich to lead its Drone Advisory Committee, and established seven test sites to explore drone flight management. NASA is supporting the quest with its unmanned aircraft traffic management research program. RELATED: Now Militants Are Using Drones as Projectiles Although everyone is moving fast, they’re shunning the “break things” part of the of the Silicon Valley ethos. Safety trumps efficiency and technological advances. “Our challenge is to find the right balance where safety and innovation co-exist on relatively equal planes,” FAA chief Michael Huerta told the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Symposium in March. “As we move toward fully integrating unmanned aircraft into our airspace, the questions we need to answer are only getting more complicated.” The Current Regime So far, the primary answer has been, no fun for you. Anyone operating a drone for commercial purposes must first pass a test covering traditional pilot know-how like wing load factors and airspace regulations. Drone pilots must keep their flyer below 400 feet, away from crowds and airports, and within their line of sight—restrictions designed to keep drones out of trouble. The FAA occasionally waives some restrictions with an eye toward seeing which rules it could loosen, but some people say overzealous regulation will keep the tech from reaching its potential. “There are so many applications that will benefit from drone use,” says Mark Barker, director of business development and marketing at the Nevada Institute for Autonomous Systems, which the state government created to expand the use of unmanned air systems. “Energy companies can inspect 50 miles of power lines with winged robots instead of human-piloted aircraft. Drones can conduct search-and-rescue, fly filming missions, survey environmental hazards, and act as couriers. They’re more efficient and more cost-effective than human-piloted aircraft.” The FAA sees good reason to move cautiously, given basic questions remain unanswered. How will the aircraft respond when it runs out of power or experiences a failure? How will it communicate with air traffic control to approve a flight path or line up for a landing? And how will it avoid smacking into other aircraft? READ MORE: The Next Great Frontier for Drones Lies in the Ocean Depths “If there’s no pilot in the aircraft scanning the horizon, and it’s not big enough for its own radar, how will they detect other aircraft?” says Ed Waggoner, director of NASA’s Integrated Aviation Systems Program. “How do you get information to the unmanned aircraft or the ground-based pilots-in-command in remote-flying situations to avoid other aircraft that may not be clearly announcing their intentions?” Moving Forward New, miniaturized sensor technology will be key here, particularly the ADS-B positioning systems increasingly common in commercial and civilian aircraft. That technology is approaching approaching drone-friendly dimensions and power requirements, but other problems remain. “In the case of what we call ‘non-cooperative’ aircraft—those flying without those systems either deliberately or because they’re not required to—we need to determine whether ground sensors or airborne sensors in other aircraft represent the best strategy for tracking them,” Waggoner says. Communicating with air traffic control presents its own problems. The FAA must determine how onboard flight management systems will function, and how those data-based, nonverbal systems will “talk” to controllers on the ground. It could be that the systems operate in a hybrid fashion (with human aircraft operators on the ground assisting otherwise autonomous aircraft through certain phases of their missions) or the successful integration might be contingent on the arrival of the next generation of air traffic control technology. That happens to be in the pipeline, as well, via the FAA’s ongoing NextGen modernization program. This concurrent evolution is both a complication and a blessing for planners working to merge unmanned aircraft into the national air system. “We’re working with the FAA to ensure that our own work with UAS integration is forward-looking, so we’ll be ready for how air traffic control will function in the transportation system a decade or more from now,” Waggoner says. “But we also need to be safely testing these systems in a realistic, current environment.” Testing, Testing That’s where the FAA’s seven test sites come in. For instance, later this month, Nevada’s Institute for Autonomous Systems—the largest of the seven, with the ability to operate state-wide—will participate in a “Technical Capability Level” evaluation at its Reno facility. It will test a variety of traffic management systems on fixed-wing airplanes and multirotor copters, with flights up to 1,200 feet altitude and across several miles of approved airspace. (Other test sites around the country will be similarly engaged, running their own tests with various commercial and research partners.) In Nevada, researchers will conduct long-distance aerial survey, package delivery, and emergency response missions. They’ll also try out ground-based sense-and-avoid systems. In January, they’ll throw in “non-cooperative” aircraft—those not identifying themselves—over moderately populated areas. Sometime after that, they’ll expand the test to denser urban areas and explore tasks such as news gathering and package delivery. RELATED: A Drone-Slinging UPS Van Delivers the Future As they move toward full freedom, these aircraft must rival humans not just in skill, but in judgment, knowing what to do with the information they collect. “It’s not just sensing and knowing, but the vehicle needs to know the rules-of-the-road when flying—go left if you’re on a collision track, go over there to avoid contact, plan your path this way, etc.,” says Richard Pat Anderson, director of the Flight Research Center at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. “That requirement is not baked into the current FAA vision for NextGen, so it will need to be there, as well.” When the FAA has finally reached a solution that answers all these concerns—there’s no specified timeline—it will gradually alter the regulations to permit unmanned and autonomous aircraft to zip around the skies, hopefully without causing trouble. Only then will you be able to whip out your smartphone and order some sneakers or whistle up an autonomous electric air taxi to take you to the mall to buy them yourself.

Technologies such as Intel/Micron’s 3D XPoint and HPE’s Memristor – 1,000x faster than the current generation of NAND flash – will be used as cache memory. That means they will reside between RAM and flash storage and be accessed at byte level by applications that will need to be rewritten to do so where they now access back-end storage. Those are the views of Alex McDonald of NetApp’s CTO’s office and solid state storage initiative co-chair of the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA). “We are talking two Olympics away, so seven or eight years until commercial products are available,” he said. “What we’re talking about is ‘persistent memory’, 1,000x slower than DRAM but 1,000x faster than flash, which, in turn, is 1,000x faster than spinning disk.” McDonald said flash as it is currently often sold, in a form factor that mimics that of traditional hard drives and requires storage to travel via the SCSI software stack, is inappropriate for these upcoming persistent memory technologies. “You put in SSDs and its software stack and find SCSI communication takes up microseconds of compute time,” he said. “So, if the software stack takes up half the latency, you need to get rid of it, but you can’t with SSD technology.” Read more on solid state technologies Flash storage has taken the enterprise by storm, but its days are numbered due to an unfavourable combination of technological obstacles and manufacturing economics. Flash storage will hit a wall in development terms by around the end of the decade. But which successor is best placed to replace it: Memristor, MRAM or phase-change memory? Persistent memory would be byte addressable – say, as memory is able to change merely the bits representing characters in a database record – rather than having to address blocks of kilobyte sizes in storage via an I/O software stack. Also, currently, operating systems use context switching to move between tasks as one task engages in I/O to/from storage. But if sufficient persistent memory were moved to a layer above storage, and with latencies of nanoseconds, context switching would not be required. For all these reasons, applications and operating systems would need to be rewritten to deal with the new architecture, said McDonald. But he added that persistent memory would need to be used as cache and near to the CPU because “more than a few feet away starts to place serious latency limits”. The SNIA and NetApp man said a future datacentre of, say, 50PB would comprise 5PB of flash and 0.5PB of persistent memory in a tiered architecture that would comprise DRAM, persistent memory, flash, spinning disk and Glacier/tape.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: AMD Stock Collides With Reality The chip company's comeback won't be easy, and it won't be quick. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) May 3, 2017 at 2:05PM Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soared nearly 300% in 2016 due to nothing but hope. Hope that, after years of losses, a deluge of new products would make AMD competitive in its core markets once again. Hope that, despite intense competition from Intel and NVIDIA, profits would eventually surge to record highs. AMD stock lost 24% of its value on Tuesday as this euphoric optimism collided with reality. The company's first-quarter report simply matched analyst expectations, with revenue growing but losses persisting. Polaris, AMD's mainstream graphics cards, and Ryzen 7, its high-end CPUs, delivered growth. But the company's guidance for the second quarter left a lot to be desired considering the slate of new products. The story of AMD's comeback has fueled the stock over the past year. Now it's time for the numbers to prove that story right or wrong. Image source: AMD. The first quarter AMD grew revenue by 18% year over year to $984 million during the first quarter, with its compute and graphics segment producing 29% growth. This was driven by sales of Polaris graphics cards, which didn't launch until the end of the second quarter last year, and Ryzen 7 CPUs, which launched at the beginning of March. The compute and graphics segment still posted an operating loss of $15 million, but that's a vast improvement over the $70 million loss reported during the first quarter of 2016. Overall, AMD reported a GAAP net loss of $73 million and a non-GAAP net loss of $38 million; both improved compared to the prior-year period. Ryzen 7 drove AMD's highest desktop processor revenue in more than two years, according to CEO Lisa Su. That's not surprising, given that AMD was woefully outmatched in the PC CPU market prior to Ryzen. The comparison is about as easy as it gets. GPU sales rose by a double-digit percentage, with both the ramp of notebook design wins and improved sales of desktop graphics cards driving the increase. Disappointing guidance AMD expects its second-quarter revenue to grow by just 12% year over year. I suspect the steep decline in the stock price following AMD's earnings report was mostly due to this guidance. Here's what the second quarter will contain: A full quarter of Ryzen 7 sales Nearly a full quarter of Ryzen 5 sales A full quarter of Polaris sales Some contribution from Vega Some contribution from Naples Ryzen 5, AMD's mainstream CPUs, launched at the beginning of April. The first Polaris graphics cards didn't become available until late June of last year, deep into the second quarter. Vega, AMD's upcoming high-end GPU, and Naples, AMD's upcoming server CPU, are expected to launch at some point during the second quarter. In other words, the second quarter of last year contained essentially none of the above. The comparison should be incredibly easy for AMD. Given all of these new products, 12% growth simply isn't enough. To be fair, Vega and Naples may not contribute much revenue in the second quarter, depending on when they launch and how long they take to ramp up. But even so, if Polaris and most of the Ryzen desktop lineup can only drive 12% growth, it's no wonder the stock fell off a cliff. There's no question that AMD is more competitive today than it was a few years ago. There's also no question that its revenue will continue to rise in the second half, driven by more product launches. But AMD's comeback won't be easy, and it won't be quick. The idea that AMD is simply going to waltz in and steal significant market share from Intel and NVIDIA, which drove the explosion in the stock price last year, is optimistic to say the least. AMD is playing catch-up everywhere. Investors betting on the best-case scenario need to adjust their expectations. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The hearing was titled „Intellectual Property — driver of innovation: Making our lives healthier, safer, and more productive.” Kateeva’s President and COO, Dr. Conor Madigan, was invited to join the panel that included representatives from Dupont Pioneer, Intel Corp. and Sproxil, Inc., as well as the Acting Assistant Director for the IP Rights Center at the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. Chairman Grassley opened the session by noting the impact of IP on today’s economy. IP-intensive industries employ more than 40 million Americans, he said, while accounting for 35 percent of the nation’s GDP. The 90-minute hearing covered issues ranging from the business of creating high-value IP, to the challenges of protection and global enforcement. Madigan, who co-founded Kateeva in 2008, told the Committee of the founders’ roots at MIT — one of the nation’s premier research institutions. He characterized IP as the engine that propelled Kateeva from a start-up, to a Silicon Valley employer of 330 people and provider of precision deposition equipment used to mass produce OLED displays. In complimenting the Committee for supporting patent policies that encourage innovation, Madigan also noted the importance of legislation that safeguards the innovations that differentiate US companies operating in the global marketplace. Following the hearing, Madigan and Kateeva Chairman & CEO Dr. Alain Harrus met with congressional representatives on Capitol Hill. Harrus noted that IP is at the center of Kateeva’s inkjet deposition solution for manufacturing OLED displays. „We have filed for more than 250 patents worldwide to protect the many novel innovations embedded in our flagship YIELDjet™ Platform,” he said. „Additional innovations differentiate our YIELDjet™ FLEX product, which today leads the market for OLED Thin Film Encapsulation (TFE) mass production. Given the investment in such technology innovation, the resulting enabling IP must be respected and protected universally. We’re gratified that Senator Grassley and his Committee are such ardent defenders of this principle.” YIELDjet is a trademark of Kateeva, Inc. About Kateeva, Inc. Kateeva makes breakthrough production equipment for manufacturers of advanced electronics technologies.

(AMD) Stock on This Overdone Dip Recent Posts: Profit From the Chop in United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) Stock Go Long Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock With Confidence on This Dip Profit From JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Stock No Matter What View All Posts Nvidia Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) 12-month stock performance has been inspiring but not without a few dips like the one in early April. They say nothing goes up in a straight line but for a while NVDA looked like it would have been the first. Source: Shutterstock The earnings season was not kind to the sector mostly thanks to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Wall Street demolished the stock yesterday and took most of its competitors down in sympathy. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was the standout exception, up on the day. NVDA reports earnings next week and after seeing the reaction in AMD, going long into the event will require courage. Buying the stock at face value here without any room for error will be hazardous. Fundamentally Nvidia stock is not cheap at a 40 price-to-earnings ratio. Luckily analyst expectations are distributed among three categories. Although there is no guarantee that there won’t be downgrades, if they come they are not likely to pour in from an overwhelming majority. Click to Enlarge Technically, the NVDA stock range is tightening, with lower highs knocking on the floor boards. So far, the body language of the price action has been bullish. I call this being technically frisky and just below a pivot area of $108 per share. On May 1, NVDA looked like it would break out in two steps to retest $109-plus, but price has since faded back to the trend line. On the flip side, there is technical danger looming below, especially going into a binary event like the earnings. If NVDA loses the $96 neckline area it could invite sellers all the way to $88. After seeing the slaughter in AMD’s stock, one must remain open to that possibility. NVDA Stock Trade Idea The Bet: Sell the July NVDA $80 put for 75 cents per contract, where I have an 85% theoretical certainty that the contract will expire worthless and for maximum gains in my favor. Otherwise I will be put the stock and suffer losses below $79.25 per share. In essence, I am being paid here for the chance to own NVDA stock at a 20%-plus discount. Although this sounds safe enough but after seeing the extreme reaction in AMD I’d rather be safe and buy cheap shorter term May $80 sacrifice puts to cover the crash scenario. This would be a small price to pay for some peace of mind. E-mail sellspreads@gmail.com with questions or join me to learn more about options in a personal 1on1 webinar here.

May 03, 2017 13:00 ET Kateeva President & COO, Dr. Conor Madigan, Addresses Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing to Honor World Intellectual Property Day NEWARK, CA--(Marketwired - May 3, 2017) - Last week, at a special Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington, DC to mark World Intellectual Property (IP) Day, Committee Chair, Senator Chuck Grassley R (IA), and select members heard from executives representing IP-driven US technology companies. The hearing was titled "Intellectual Property -- driver of innovation: Making our lives healthier, safer, and more productive." Kateeva's President and COO, Dr. Conor Madigan, was invited to join the panel that included representatives from Dupont Pioneer, Intel Corp. and Sproxil, Inc., as well as the Acting Assistant Director for the IP Rights Center at the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. Chairman Grassley opened the session by noting the impact of IP on today's economy. IP-intensive industries employ more than 40 million Americans, he said, while accounting for 35 percent of the nation's GDP. The 90-minute hearing covered issues ranging from the business of creating high-value IP, to the challenges of protection and global enforcement. Madigan, who co-founded Kateeva in 2008, told the Committee of the founders' roots at MIT -- one of the nation's premier research institutions. He characterized IP as the engine that propelled Kateeva from a start-up, to a Silicon Valley employer of 330 people and provider of precision deposition equipment used to mass produce OLED displays. In complimenting the Committee for supporting patent policies that encourage innovation, Madigan also noted the importance of legislation that safeguards the innovations that differentiate US companies operating in the global marketplace. Following the hearing, Madigan and Kateeva Chairman & CEO Dr. Alain Harrus met with congressional representatives on Capitol Hill. Harrus noted that IP is at the center of Kateeva's inkjet deposition solution for manufacturing OLED displays. "We have filed for more than 250 patents worldwide to protect the many novel innovations embedded in our flagship YIELDjet™ Platform," he said. "Additional innovations differentiate our YIELDjet™ FLEX product, which today leads the market for OLED Thin Film Encapsulation (TFE) mass production. Given the investment in such technology innovation, the resulting enabling IP must be respected and protected universally. We're gratified that Senator Grassley and his Committee are such ardent defenders of this principle." YIELDjet is a trademark of Kateeva, Inc. About Kateeva, Inc.

Close Samsung joins race to develop self-driving car tech just as Apple prototypes are spotted Viknesh Vijayenthiran May 3, 2017 Follow Viknesh Add to circle Samsung logoEnlarge Photo Samsung has joined the long list of automakers and tech firms racing to develop self-driving cars and the software that controls them. The Korean conglomerate, along with roughly 20 other firms, was recently granted permission to test self-driving cars on public roads in South Korea. Samsung has built its own cars in the past, though in an interview with The Gaurdian a Samsung spokesperson said the company was focused on the technology for self-driving cars as opposed to the actual development and production of a self-driving car. “Samsung Electronics plans to develop algorithms, sensors and computer modules that will make a self-driving car that is reliable even in the worst weather conditions,” the spokesperson said. Apple logoEnlarge Photo It’s a similar strategy to many of Samsung’s rivals in the tech space also known to be working on self-driving car technology. The list includes firms like Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, Intel and Nvidia. The news comes just as a handful of Lexus RX SUVs registered to Apple were spotted driving near the company’s Cupertino, California headquarters with sensors required for self-driving attached to them. Based on information from an industry expert, Bloomberg, which has photos of the SUVs, reports that the sensors appear to be products bought off the shelf from suppliers, rather than Apple’s own designs. The SUVs were spotted just two weeks after Apple was granted permission to test self-driving cars on public roads in California. Part of the rules is that Apple must make public details of the testing, including occurrences when the self-driving system stops working and a human driver needs to take control, a process known as disengagement. Worried about its disengagements being reported on, falsely or not, Apple has sent a letter to the California DMV requesting that certain disengagement occurrences should not have to be reported. It’s thought that Apple intended to develop its own self-driving cars under the Project Titan code name, but later changed its focus to the technology only. The thinking is that this way Apple would have the flexibility to either partner with an established automaker or return to developing its own car once the hurdle of developing self-driving technology is passed.

(AMD) Stock Before It Rebounds to $15 AMD stock reacted as if the company's first quarter was a debacle. It wasn't, and buyers have been gifted a sweet entry point. By Richard Saintvilus, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 3, 2017, 10:01 am EDT Get MSFT alerts: Submit Source: Shutterstock     Popular Posts: Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Will Hit $165 After Earnings Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Before It Rebounds to $15 Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Hit $170 Sooner Than You Think Recent Posts: Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Will Hit $170 Sooner Than You Think Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Before It Rebounds to $15 Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Buy Despite Post-Earnings Rally View All Posts Shares of semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have been crushed recently, with AMD stock falling nearly 25% after the company reported mixed first-quarter earnings that included a miss on revenue. Source: Shutterstock This is what a buying opportunity looks like. After Monday’s market close, investors were hoping for confirmation that AMD’s results would justify the nearly 300% gains shares had made over the past year. However, with merely in-line EPS and a miss on the top line, compounded by conservative Q2 guidance, investors were spooked. AMD stock closed Tuesday at $10.32, falling 24% from Monday’s closed of $13.62, while erasing all of it year-to-date gains. The shares are now down 9% year-to-date, versus a 6.8% rise in the S&P 500 index. There is fear that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could be chipping away at AMD’s recovery, especially with catalyst from its Ryzen chips now out of the way. Indeed, there could be an inflection point with the Ryzen line contribution to financial results. Management could just be playing it safe with their forecasts. In either scenario, I still see this as a buying opportunity in AMD stock from a clear overreaction by the market. The Good With AMD Earnings Momentum traders who were looking for “pie in the sky” results that would propel AMD shares to new highs have opted to exit their positions. Fundamentally, though, Advanced Micro continues to execute on its stated objectives. Revenues grew 18.3% year-over-year to $984 million. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher GPU sales — the company’s bread-and-butter business. What’s more, the company’s Computing and Graphics segment, which includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, accounted for more than 60% of revenues, and grew almost 30% YOY to $593 million. This growth was driven mainly by stronger desktop and graphics processor sales. Meanwhile, the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which includes server and embedded processors, took in the remaining 40% of revenues, climbing 5.1% year over year to $391 million. Notably, AMD achieved higher average selling prices (ASP) in both the Client segment and GPUs. Advanced Micro Devices is set to launch its x86 server CPU, codenamed “Naples,” in the second quarter, combined with its collaboration with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to incorporate the cloud delivery features of Naples with Microsoft’s “Project Olympus” server platform. Now’s the time to own AMD, not sell it. Bottom Line for AMD Stock The quarter wasn’t breathtaking, but there is certainly nothing wrong with Advanced Micro or its direction. With gains coming in from its major revenue segments, AMD remains on pace for a strong finish in 2017. And beyond the launch its Naples chip in the second quarter, AMD will also launch its two other Zen-based chips, so there’s more than one horse driving this car. As such, my crystal ball says AMD stock will regain $15 per share, yielding 45% returns from current levels. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Will the 30,000 plus dead Americans get Congress to laud Trump or impeach him? With a radioactive cloud headed for Juneau would Trump be pushed as a hero of decisive action, or a murderous fool who risked and lost so many lives when it was unnecessary? I really have no idea, but I am sure that one of those narratives will be taken up by the Power Elite and virtually all MSM voices will fall in line behind it quickly. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood May 3, 2017 at 9:02 am “Will the media rally around Trump or denounce him?” Every single MSM stenographer would echo CNN host Fareed Zakaria’s fatuous claim, on the occasion of the Syria bombing, that “Donald Trump became president today.” Stay tuned for the radiation forecast at 11. *cut to Walmart commercial offering incredible deals on gas masks* Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner May 3, 2017 at 9:24 am There hasn’t been a direct military retaliation in so long against the West. Terrorists and a few dead soldiers here and there can be written off, but Somalia and the Marines in Lebanon spring to mind as singular events where reaction was unusual. There was a reason Shrub hid the funerals and caskets, and it was shocking to find out 2,500 U.S. soldiers died in Afghanistan under Obama. Kabul and Kandahar aren’t exactly places people go for travel. Reply ↓ Jonathan Holland Becnel May 3, 2017 at 6:53 pm Pssshaw! Kandahar is famous for two things: 1) The Boardwalk 2) The Poo Pond Reply ↓ voteforno6 May 3, 2017 at 9:29 am It would be nice if the Koreans could have a voice in this scenario, but I suspect that the media would not put much consideration into their opinions on this matter. Reply ↓ cocomaan May 3, 2017 at 9:59 am A conflict with NK would have already happened if it was going to happen, according to Dan Carlin. If you’re wargaming, and the US has its ducks in a row and its troops deployed to the penninsula, NK doesn’t stand a chance of doing anything but “turtling up”, ie, defending their territory. They can, however, strike Seoul before the US gets its forces into position. Now that the US has its forces in position, nobody in the NK military is going to bother. The conflict is probably over. Reply ↓ dcrane May 3, 2017 at 12:01 pm (note that link is to an mp3 audio transcript that autoplays in Firefox) Reply ↓ a different chris May 3, 2017 at 12:02 pm Not understanding why you think the US can stop a strike on Seoul. It might be a suicide strike, but we can’t even get 100% of our most simple missiles (speaking about the 59/60) to an immobile target so I seriously doubt we can shoot down what are by todays standards very short range missiles. I of course doubt NK itself can shoot very straight or effectively themselves, but they can hurt Seoul and I doubt our somehow still vaunted technology will have much effect. (maybe I’m misunderstanding, not clear if you meant we could stop the missiles themselves or maybe that the strike has at this point become so suicidal that they won’t bother… or course they would never bother if we treated them just a little better than dirt) Reply ↓ OpenThePodBayDoorsHAL May 3, 2017 at 4:07 pm I read that deeply dug in and distributed NK conventional artillery can rain something like 500,000 rounds on downtown Seoul in the first hour no matter how many drones the Orange Man wants to fling. It would be national suicide but it wouldn’t be the first time that’s been tried by countries in the region (the guys across the water with the single red circle on their flag come to mind) Reply ↓ UserFriendly May 3, 2017 at 8:34 pm I listen to Common Sense regularly too. I recommend subscribing to the podcast which you can do here. Even though I have a few disagreements with him. The relevant part on NK starts at around 41:00 on episode 315. I don’t think that is what he is saying though. He was saying that if NK sees war as inevitable it makes much more sense for them to just destroy Soul now. But that only makes sense if NK wants to try and win the war. I doubt Kim is that naive. Kim knows just as well as anyone there is no war that ends with him alive. All his nuke chasing has been for the single purpose of keeping him alive and in power so NK can avoid one of our pointless regime change adventures. That all goes to shit as soon as any fighting starts. Reply ↓ Plenue May 3, 2017 at 11:44 am Denounce, ultimately. South Korean culture is too omnipresent in America at this point, including numerous fully bilingual K-pop stars. South Korean suffering would be highly visible, unlike that of Muslim brown people. Reply ↓ Huey Long May 3, 2017 at 12:55 pm I wouldn’t get too excited over the B-1 bomber press releases DoD has been putting out as of late. The thing’s a turkey, so much so that they didn’t even bother deploying it during the first Gulf War. It’d get eaten alive if it flew within range of an integrated air defense system. Currently the USAF uses them as orbiting bomb trucks over notagainistan with a full load of JDAMs to support the grunts on the ground, but it is also capable of launching the AGM-158 JASSM. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood May 3, 2017 at 8:42 am Ten-baggers for the masses! Or not: The SEC on Tuesday approved a request to trade quadruple-leveraged exchange-traded funds, marking a first for the growing market for such products in the US. The request to list ForceShares Daily 4X US Market Futures Long Fund, under the ticker UP, and ForceShares Daily 4X US Market Futures Short Fund, under the ticker DOWN, was filed by the NYSE Arca exchange. One of the funds is designed to deliver 400 percent of the daily performance of S&P 500 stock index futures, while another fund will aim to deliver four times the inverse of that benchmark. That means a fund could go up 8 percent on a day the index it tracks falls by 2 percent. http://uk.reuters.com/article/sec-etfs-idUKL1N1I500R Stock margin lending has been frozen for decades by the Federal Reserve’s Reg T at 50% of the securities purchase price. Leveraged ETFs are an end run around Reg T. Which is not necessarily bad: with few exceptions, brokerage margin lending rates to small investors are usurious — far higher than the effective rate paid by leveraged ETFs using futures. Stock index futures offer about 20-to-1 leverage. But they are separately regulated by the CFTC. Only a few brokers offer integrated stock and futures accounts. Because they rebalance daily, leveraged ETFs suffer from horrendous volatility drag. A leveraged long ETF can lose money even in a year when stocks rise. Most punters would be better off with stock futures, both to dodge volatility drag and for better Sec 1256 tax treatment. But with the Fed, SEC and CFTC all merrily doing their own regulatory thing, chaos prevails. Sentiment-wise, 4X leveraged funds indicate an increasingly speculative mood. Remember 125 percent loan-to-value mortgages during Bubble II? Yeah, me too. :-( Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 3, 2017 at 9:58 am We’re getting closer to bankers’ no-reserve lending equivalent for gambl…check that, investors. Reply ↓ Pat May 3, 2017 at 8:43 am So Shattered showed Clinton ran a dysfunctional campaign which had real problems understanding facts on the ground. Still no one does the logical hypothetical what does this mean for an administration run by someone who screwed up something they were planning for ten years after even having a failed attempt at eight years earlier. Rall points out the obvious thing that Clinton not only doesn’t learn from her mistakes she doesn’t want to, but that is as close to it I have seen. I know it won’t happen, but it would be nice if someone somewhere got that Clinton would have been faced with many of the same Congressional issues that Trump has, would be under constant investigation instead of Russia and have an internal organization just as dysfunctional in a whole different way. But acknowledging that Americans had no choice that would result in a functional representational government without an itchy trigger finger would probably be too honest for the owners. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner May 3, 2017 at 9:08 am I have vague memories of people actually saying this after 2008. This might be why Hillary chose to run as “I am upper class woman hear me road at the waiter who messed up my order” to avoid the incompetence label. Versailles’ favorite was Colin Powell, and little attention was paid to Powell’s emails describing Hillary as incompetent. Of course, everyone might have believed it was a Shrub like situation where they just had to get into the room. Reply ↓ Adamski May 3, 2017 at 10:57 am Now she’s worming her way back into the public eye (hmm, unpleasant mental image) she will get to “screw everything up with hubris” in 2020, baby! Hopefully crashes out at the primary stage, though. Reply ↓ Montanamaven May 3, 2017 at 1:47 pm Hillary on Larry King when 1st Lady Jimmy Dore nails it again.

Reply ↓ Jim Haygood May 3, 2017 at 9:16 am How do you prove you’re an extreme policy wonk? You die with your boots on, still fighting in the political trenches long after your peers have retired to focus on gardening, socializing or traveling. Having run a Permanent Campaign since they were in junior high school, the Clintons just can’t forfeit their obsession with public acclaim. Hillary is the sadder case, resembling the earnest grind who studies six hours a night to become valedictorian, skipping all the extracurricular activities and parties, only to be pipped by a more creative mind who made it look effortless. Typically the future does not go well for such monomaniacal personalities. Reply ↓ Adamski May 3, 2017 at 10:59 am Prove to who, though? Difficult, tax-averse, affluent middle class voters who would vote Republican if the Dems got too liberal? There’s always a need to compromise to win elections, but compromise with who exactly… as Sanders says, the middle class is shrinking Reply ↓ hunkerdown May 3, 2017 at 6:48 pm The DNC has been telling the left to shut up and take it and cheer on cue for quite a long time. I’d be very interested to know why you don’t think oligarchs and liberals need to compromise with the left and why the left shouldn’t run them out of the Party. Reply ↓ Olga May 3, 2017 at 12:46 pm Wow – you almost made me feel sorry for HRC… But then I remembered the extent to which she was disconnected from most in the electorate and for most of her career (e.g., Goldwater girl, cookies, super-predators, deplorables, etc.) . Her sense of privilege seems to be a congenital condition. Bill at least had the appearance of empathy, but she never was able to get “humanized.” Beyond incompetence, this had destructive results within the US (i.e., welfare reform), and was exceedingly dangerous on the international scene (Yugoslavia; we came-we saw-he died psychopathy). One question, though, is how did she ever manage to get the ‘progressive’ label? Is it because of this – l saw a clip of her saying that even if she punished/closed a bank, that would not help a single transgender person live better (or something to that effect, still looking for that clip). Talk about identity politics! Reply ↓ TK421 May 3, 2017 at 12:57 pm I think identity politics is the reason she was seen as progressive. All one needs to do is occasionally give a speech or other lip service about women’s rights or supporting children or some such, and a large crowd of opinion-makers will call that ‘progressivism’. Reply ↓ John k May 3, 2017 at 9:23 pm Did you mean to imply that she at least grew competent with the six hours/night studying, albeit not smooth? I agree she’s not smooth, indeed remarkably coarse, but can’t think of a single thing at which she’s competent other than grift and starting badly thought out ME wars. Now bill was smooth, and competent at serving banks. Plus no ME wars… best pres since Nixon. Reply ↓ Katharine May 3, 2017 at 9:40 am … it would be nice if someone somewhere got that Clinton would have been faced with many of the same Congressional issues that Trump has…. Of course someone does, lots of ones, in fact, just not the ones in power. So that is “all” we need to change, either by pushing malleable politicians or by replacing them, which we need to do anyway. Speaking of which, Dean Baker gave a link to the EPI analysis of “The People’s Budget” put out by the Progressive Caucus and strongly recommended reviewing it. I would suggest that instead of just admitting it stands no chance at present we should all be so unrealistic as to hound our representatives about it, with special emphasis on whichever parts we care about most deeply. http://www.epi.org/publication/the-peoples-budget-analysis-of-the-congressional-progressive-caucus-budget-for-fiscal-year-2018/ Reply ↓ Eureka Springs May 3, 2017 at 10:09 am Thanks for the heads-up on this.

Reply ↓ Katharine May 3, 2017 at 12:22 pm Maryland public colleges have had open admissions for decades, and on the whole this is a good thing. What they too often lack is effective mechanisms for quickly identifying students in need of major remedial work. It is hard on faculty to have students in class who are functionally illiterate or innumerate, and hard on those students as they finally run into the brick wall that says social promotion stops here. Much of the pain could be alleviated if there were swift effective intervention. That something should have been learned ten years ago does not mean it will take ten years to learn, and it is surely a more effective use of resources to bring students up to speed than to leave everyone’s classroom experience to be undermined by some people’s unfortunate lack of background. Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive May 3, 2017 at 10:46 am Seriously? “Universal Public University Admission (lest we create more inequality where some get college for free, some don’t get college at all- because they are not as smart).” Universal Free High School isn’t something that we’ve always done. Should we NOT have Universal Free High Schools because you think some students aren’t smart enough? Oh, and btw, I squeaked out of high school with a 2.0 (I even flunked typing….). I guess than means I should give back my MS in Engineering (with honors) because obviously in your world, I wasn’t smart enough to earn that advanced degree……I am grateful that my local college that was willing to take a chance on an older student with no appreciable academic history…. No, college isn’t just for “smart” people (and I question what your definition of “smart” is – is it only related to GPA?) – it is for people who need to learn more than they are currently taught in public education……and yes it needs to be free too!

Reply ↓ Pat May 3, 2017 at 11:19 am Oh, I know many people here and elsewhere get it about Clinton. Unfortunately we still have a whole lot of the media, including the ladies on the View who still bring up the popular vote again (in fairness one had the sense to point out the popular vote does not elect the President and never has), and they have the largest megaphone. It is still excuses and identity politics and a failure to recognize that both parties, and their leaders, are largely incompetent. I will be contacting my representatives about the budget unfortunately I find a lot to be distressed in this. For instance this section on ‘Strengthening the Safety Net’: Instead, it uses government purchasing power to lower health care costs (health care costs are the largest threat to long-term fiscal sustainability) and builds upon efficiency savings from the Affordable Care Act. ACA? They are going to build on the ACA that allowed the privatization of Medicaid further crapifying that safety net in order to make sure people have Medicare and SS if they live that long? Don’t get me wrong, I know that in the choices we are even allowed to see brought up in our political climate this is about as good as it gets. Still it is a far cry from what a progressive or even FDR school Democratic policy should be. Reply ↓ Katharine May 3, 2017 at 1:53 pm I am assuming the building on the ACA is tactical realism only, because this is a proposed budget that would take effect in less than six months and single-payer in that time frame is not feasible. Considering most if not all of them are now cosponsors of H.R. 676 they cannot possibly think the ACA is a solid basis for a long-term solution. I agree entirely with your last sentence, but I am guessing budget proposals work mostly within the existing legal framework. You can defund an existing department or program but not allocate funds to one that does not exist because its creation would depend on separate enabling legislation (I think–if this is a misconception I hope one of the legally enlightened will tell me). Reply ↓ Pat May 3, 2017 at 2:18 pm True enough. Some of this is a result of many years of watching the Progressive Caucus roll over and then gloss over the resulting neoliberal disaster as anything but what it really is. I find most of the so-called gains of the ACA as far as cost containment to be wishful thinking at best and outright misrepresentation much of the time, so I will continue to be skeptical as to that. As I said I’m sure this is the best of the bad bunch, but there is a whole lot of weasel waffling in that presentation, for instance in the reference to the defense budget.

Reply ↓ Jeff W May 3, 2017 at 1:59 pm Ted Ralls’s arguments are right but irrelevant. It doesn’t matter how dysfunctional the Clinton campaign was or how Clinton couldn’t come up with a reason to be President or any of that stuff revealed in Shattered. (All that just means that she might have been [even] less effective at governing than we might have imagined her to be.) If she had run a flawless, stellar campaign or she had “had the right personality to lead people” or whatever, she’d still be the neoliberal candidate and, if she had won, that victory would do nothing to alter the neoliberal trajectory of the party of the Washington establishment. The reason that it’s good that Clinton lost is that it opens up the space for something other than the establishment/neoliberal/Washington Consensus that has prevailed for the past 30 years. It doesn’t have to do with Clinton herself. If that loss is not seen as a clear repudiation of the dominant philosophy, it’s at least an indication that people are no longer willing to just go along with it.

Reply ↓ allan May 3, 2017 at 10:59 am Does anybody know how to use the Wayback Machine or something similar? Because I swear that the original version of the CNN story that I linked to on the Water Cooler late last night had several things that are now missing from the current version of the story (which is what you get when you click on the link above). 1. There was the text that I included in my WC comment: Fliers will still pay regular economy fares for the 18 seats with two inches less leg room. Two of those three rows of 29-inch pitch will be in the back of the plane and a third farther forward. These seats won’t be part of its new basic economy fares, which sell for less because fliers don’t get access to overhead bins, a seat assignment or frequent flier miles. … 18 lucky duckies per plane. Should definitely help with the morale in steerage. 2. Either a quote from an anonymous airline source, or just the reportorial voice, stating that American was taking measures such as cramming in more seats in order to pay for the modest raises to the pilots and flight attendants that were announced a few days ago. I’m kicking myself for not having cut and pasted that, too. When in doubt, blame labor. Reply ↓ allan May 3, 2017 at 12:58 pm Here, via the Internet Archive, is yesterday’s version of the CNN article, containing the text in item #1 that has now eliminated. Item #2 is as in the current version, namely Airlines have enjoyed strong profits and low fuel fuel prices after a decade of consolidation. They’re adding seats now to help offset rising employee wages. No mention of goosing stock prices, paying for buybacks or justifying executive compensation. Go figure.

Reply ↓ RUKidding May 3, 2017 at 10:42 am I do think Comey played some small part in Clinton’s loss, but the bottom line is that she ran a completely sh*thouse campaign, where she went after wealthier Republican voters, while completely ignoring working class voters in critical swing states like WI, PA and MI.

Reply ↓ Plenue May 3, 2017 at 11:51 am The thing that gets me most about Comey is that there was an actual travesty of justice involved there, but it’s the exact opposite of what Clintonites claim. I well remember how the FBI found clear signs of law-breaking, but then Comey came out and essentially said “but we didn’t find any intent to break the law, so it’s okay”. And then all the liberals patted each other on the back and nodded. “Hmm, yes yes, he’s such a good lawman.” And then new evidence appeared, courtesy of Weiner (and not just randomly out of the blue on Comey’s whim, like liberals try to present it), and Comey reopened his sham investigation, only to close it down a second time, claiming again to have found no ‘intent’ of wrongdoing. It’s breathtaking to watch the Clinton’s vilify one of their toadies.

Perhaps the “gold” FD Roosevelt standard would be 100, & the crap worse possible standard of say a H1tl3r would be a 0. The ratings should be based on actions while in office. For example, 0bama would be receive negative ratings for his ACTIONS killing MedicareForAll & “the Public Option” to comply with the demands of his health industry donors (per Firedoglake/Jane Hamsher’s reporting), despite his WORDS of campaing-promising the Public Option & then blaming the Rs for the Public Option getting removed from consideration. A Top10 list each of positive & negative actions of each President could be included. The most relative economic statistics should be used, e.g. 25-to-54 employment-to-population ratio, not unemployment rate. If debt is used, total debt (including private debt)-to-GDP ratio, not raw public debt without relation to GDP. Median adult values for life expectancy, income, wealth; not mean averages. Etc.

His was the administration that dealt the most with the fallout of the Crash. I think you would need asterisks for some of this. For instance Obama would have to be given a pass for the economic statistics for the first couple of years of his administration, but the continuing recession/depression after might be entirely laid at his feet. Not sure how you divide it up, but that slow moving train thing would apply to more than just more obvious examples.

In addition to wisdom of enacting such a tax in the first place, the larger question may be what exactly constitutes a robot or threat to jobs? The potential threat to jobs isn’t just robots, in the sense that people think of them, but also AI and software. Limiting the tax to physical robots won’t do a lot of good but on the other hand extending it to taxing software could also have some unintended consequences. The challenges arising from increasing automation presents a complicated problem–it’s not as clearcut as “Technology A is bad” and “Technology B” is good–with few easy answers.

A Homework robot can be programmed to perform A+ homework assignments for the rich kid whose parents own it. A mini (in the pocket) robot can even score 100% on all tests. Then, the rich kid can go to UC Berkeley tuition free (in some near future), while the poor ones, the really poor ones, go to private, and not free, colleges. Smart kids, if they are smart, of course opt for free education. And free tuition public colleges graduate smarter graduates. But which is cause, and which is effect?

How “voluntary” will this be for non-union employees I wonder? I can see the slimeball managers at Koch Industries or Renco strong-arming their workers into taking this deal to keep costs down, i.e. if you work OT and don’t take the comp time, your manager blackballs you from further OT. Reply ↓ ambrit May 4, 2017 at 2:05 am More apropos is that this reinforces the managers ability to play games with the employees work schedule. Where I presently toil, there is a sign below the weekly work schedule saying; “Subject to change at any time. Check daily for shift changes.” Now the workers are responsible for managing their own exploitation! So, as an example, a worker has three days “off” a week. With this system, their “free time” is subject to instant cancellation. “Free time” is now a classic “doublespeak” term. I see all the time now instances where so called “hourly” employees are being treated as a lower form of “salaried” employee. (Lower in that they are subject to all of the stresses and abuses of “salaried” work with none of the “benefits” thereof.) In line with standard Naked Capitalism usage, let us refer to this as the “Crapification of Labour.” Reply ↓ Huey Long May 3, 2017 at 1:17 pm RE: Flint Water Bills More on the water crisis in Flint. 8000 people put on notice for unpaid water bills: http://nbc25news.com/news/local/flint-puts-8000-people-on-notice-for-tax-liens-for-unpaid-water-bills I can’t blame these people.

Reply ↓ rich May 3, 2017 at 1:31 pm Readers Pummel New York Times Writer Over His Big Bank Stance By Pam Martens and Russ Martens: May 3, 2017 Sorkin’s latest article was addressing the recent comments by President Trump and his Director of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, indicating that they are taking a look at restoring the Glass-Steagall Act – the depression era legislation that separated banks holding insured deposits from the high risk investment banks that underwrite and trade risky securities. The Glass-Steagall Act protected the nation’s banking system from its passage in 1933 to its repeal in 1999 during the Bill Clinton administration. It took just nine years after its repeal for Wall Street to implode in the same epic fashion as 1929 – 1933. Millions of Americans understand that the unprecedented concentration of deposits, assets and derivatives at four mega banks (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup) which are also key players in the Wall Street casino, is diverting capital into dodgy transactions and away from the real economy. The subpar economic growth of 2 percent or less since the Wall Street implosion of 2008 (when the first three of these banks became even larger by gobbling up their failing peers) is clear evidence that the Wall Street machinery is misallocating capital to the wrong arteries of commerce. But Sorkin sees it differently, writing yesterday: “Viewed through the prism of goosing the economy and creating jobs — as Mr. Trump has pledged his efforts should be viewed — it’s hard to see how breaking up the biggest banks would help, especially in the short term. Indeed, it would most likely have the opposite effect.” Sorkin offers no supporting evidence for this whacky view other than to provide a quote from the former Chair of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, who tersely offers: “I don’t think that Glass-Steagall was a cause of the crisis.” (Presumably, Sorkin is suggesting that Bernanke doesn’t think the repeal of Glass-Steagall was a cause of the crisis.) In reality, anything Bernanke has to say on this score must be taken with a grain of salt. He was Chair of the Fed for the entire period when it secretly pumped a cumulative $16 trillion in almost zero interest-rate loans into the failing carcasses of Wall Street banks and their speculating investment houses. More than a cumulative $2.5 trillion was secretly pumped into the failing Citigroup, despite the fact that the Fed is not allowed to loan to insolvent banks. It took a Federal lawsuit, a legislative amendment and a study by the Government Accountability Office to unearth the details of these astronomical loans by the Fed. Bernanke’s Fed fought disclosure to the public. There are now more than 300 comments under Sorkin’s article at the New York Times, the majority flogging him for his myopia and/or bias. One commenter asks: “Is this an op-ed piece? Ross-Sorkin always seems to want to let the banks do whatever they want to do. Can we get his columns put on the Opinion page, and hire someone with historical knowledge to counter his inside- of- Goldman- Sachs perspective. Please.” Another reader offers this: “…It’s clear that the repeal of Glass Steagall has the US and world economies just one bad bet away from another multi-trillion dollar meltdown that we, the US taxpayers, would pay for just as we did in 2008. Banks should provide bank services, you know, like in the old days following the 1929 Crash — holding deposits, paying interest, making home and business loans. Let the investment banks play their games and when they inevitably screw up due to unbridled greed, let their shareholders — not the taxpayers — take the hit. http://wallstreetonparade.com/2017/05/readers-pummel-new-york-times-writer-over-his-big-bank-stance/ Guessing Sorkin not a fan of Sinclair? Sinclair drew an analogy between journalists and prostitutes, beholden to the agenda, ideology, and policies of the monied elites that owned and controlled the press. It was an integral part of his broader critique of the corruption of U.S. politics and the appalling nature of capitalism: “Politics, Journalism, and Big Business work hand in hand for the hoodwinking of the public and the plundering of labor” (p. 153). http://monthlyreview.org/2002/05/01/upton-sinclair-and-the-contradictions-of-capitalist-journalism/ Reply ↓ Pat May 3, 2017 at 4:01 pm Something I’m sure most here will want to miss this treat, in person or on demand, in order to keep their blood pressure down. http://www.92y.org/event/stripe-approach Yeah, I’m pretty sure that moderating this shows how ‘objective’ Sorkin is, because I know when I think start ups and the economy the first person who comes to my mind is Geithner… Reply ↓ UserFriendly May 3, 2017 at 10:38 pm Yes.

They’re good country folks. They’d sooner take care of themselves than depend on the government.” We would ALL rather take care of ourselves, sometimes we can’t. So we depend on the wider society (expressed by the government) when it just gets too much, like a freaking 100yr flood. Mr. Knaups job is to show up at least virtually thru his subordinates and say “do you need any help, here? No, OK, let us know if you do”.

Reply ↓ rich May 3, 2017 at 1:48 pm Robert Parry Warns – The New York Times is Cheering on Censorship Algorithms The Stratcom center, which oversees information warfare against NATO’s perceived adversaries, is conducting “a hackathon” this month in search of coders who can develop technology to hunt down news that NATO considers “fake.” Sarts, however, makes clear that Stratcom’s goal is not only to expunge contradictory information but to eliminate deviant viewpoints before too many people can get to see and hear them. “State-based actors have been trying to amplify specific views to bring them into the mainstream,” Sarts told the Times. The key thing to understand about this push, is that it has nothing to do with fighting back against actual fake news, i.e. stories that promote total fabrications. The existence of truly fake articles is simply being used as a smokescreen to disappear alternative opinions from the public debate. That is the real intent of the “fake news” meme. With the myth of the “American dream” rapidly being exposed as a sham, the corporate press needs to be able to efficiently propagandize the public in increasingly absurd ways, but the problem is much of the public no longer believes its nonsense. How can corporate media push Americans to support things against their interests and better judgement such more war, billionaire worship, and the surveillance state without silencing the opposition? It can’t, which is why it needs to marginalize intelligent and thoughtful people espousing a different perspective. I know for a fact that the corporate press doesn’t care in the least about “truth” or “fairness” in reporting following my own personal experience with The Washington Post. Recall that last November, in the aftermath of the media’s panic at Hillary’s loss, the paper pushed forth slanderous accusations against 200 alternative websites including Liberty Blitzkrieg. For more on that truly deplorable episode, see: Liberty Blitzkrieg Included on Washington Post Highlighted Hit List of “Russian Propaganda” Websites. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice (which couldn’t find a bank executive to imprison if its life depended on it), is hard at work trying to institutionalize attacks agains the non-corporate press by going after Wikileaks and Julian Assange.

The design appears to call for closing Cornell Drive, a major thoroughfare that runs through Jackson Park, to create a campus-like setting for the presidential center. That is likely to draw fire from thousands of drivers who each day use Cornell, which links South Lake Shore Drive, Stony Island Boulevard and the Chicago Skyway. … “Draw fire” is a really bad phrase to use in talking about the South Side.

 Europe's second-largest automaker is testing self-driving cars in Singapore Edward Taylor, Reuters May 3, 2017, 11:05 AM 408 facebook linkedin twitter email print Peugeot unveiled its autonomous Instinct Concept, pictured above, in February. Newspress French carmaker Peugeot is partnering with Boston, Massachusetts-based tech firm nuTonomy to test self-driving cars in Singapore. NuTonomy's software, sensors and computing platforms will be installed in Peugeot 3008 models as part of plans to develop the technology needed for large fleets of autonomous cars, PSA and nuTonomy said in a statement on Wednesday. The latest PSA Group project seeks to work on "level 5" autonomous capable vehicles, which require no driver input, and will allow both companies to study how an "on-demand autonomous vehicle mobility service" performs, they said. The combination is the latest between technology and automotive companies after Daimler, which owns Mercedes-Benz, last month unveiled an autonomous cars development partnership with supplier Robert Bosch, while BMW has announced an alliance with chip maker Intel and Israel's Mobileye. Autonomous driving in urban areas requires a more radical approach to vehicle design, particularly for software and sensors, to help a car navigate inner city obstacles, said Anne Laliron, Head of the Business Lab at PSA Group. "That is the reason we jump on the opportunity to work with nuTonomy," Laliron told Reuters. PSA Group will use the project to learn about what components make sense, and which suppliers are available, Laliron said. Following the initial phase of this partnership, the companies will consider expanding their on-road AV testing initiative to other major cities. nuTonomy, a software company founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) academics and McKinsey management consultants was the first to begin on the road testing of driverless taxi services in Singapore last year. It raised $16 million last May in a funding round led by Highland Capital Partners and has backing from Singapore government authorities and Samsung Ventures, among others. German auto supplier ZF said in 2016 that it will supply hardware like sensors and cameras for autonomous PSA, which will hit the roads in 2018. Four of PSA's self-driving cars successfully drove 360 miles between Paris and Bordeaux in 2015.

By Sean Murray Wednesday 3 May 2017, 4:13 PM 15 hours ago 47,769 Views 8 Comments http://jrnl.ie/3370821 Share Tweet Email9 Image: Shutterstock/Syda Productions Image: Shutterstock/Syda Productions THREE IRISH UNIVERSITIES have made the grade among Europe’s Most Innovative Universities for 2017. The list, compiled by Reuters, ranks educational institutions on their efforts to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy. The Irish universities that feature are Trinity College (60th place), University College Cork (75th) and University College Dublin (98th) place. Although we only have three colleges on the list, our relatively low population in comparison to the rest of Europe means that Ireland has more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in the continent. Although the likes of Germany, the UK and France have universities appearing higher on the list, “none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities as Ireland on a per capita basis”. Similarly, even though Germany has a GDP 11 times larger than Ireland’s, it only has 7 times as many universities in the list, according to Reuters. Innovation On Trinity, Reuters said: Its current research portfolio has reached a value of more than €520 million, and the university brought in €95 million in new research funding in the last year. Trinity engages with more than 400 industry partners and collaborators, including Intel, which is working with researchers to develop a variety of technologies to help the elderly and infirm live independent lives. It is a world leader in the discovery and exploitation of the new nanomaterial graphene. On UCC, it said: Today the university puts an emphasis on technology transfer. Spinout Alimentary Health Ltd develops and commercializes proprietary microbiome-based and pharma-biotic treatments: One of its discoveries is a probiotic that is useful in the treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Current university research highlights include a push to find antimicrobial alternatives to antibiotics, which are becoming less effective at battling diseases. And on UCD, it said: The school has raised more than €1 billion in research grants during the past decade. UCD maintains more than 250 industry partnerships. In 2016, the university announced a five-year, €17.6 million collaborative research partnership with Irish agri-services company Origin Enterprises to create new crop production models that incorporate real-time data and field-level intelligence. Best in show In first place is a relatively small Belgian university called KU Leuven. The university gained first place for its high volume of influential inventions, its submission of more patent applications that most other universities on the continent and its frequent citation from outside researchers.

(PKGM: OTC Pink Current) | Pocket Games Inc, Bringing in VR to its Idol Hands Engine May 03, 2017 OTC Disclosure & News Service New York, NY – Pocket Games Inc, Bringing in VR to its Idol Hands Engine Idol Hands aims at a piece of the $120bn VR Market Forecast for 2020 New York, N.Y. â€“ (Newswire) â€“May 2, 2017 â€“Pocket Games, Inc. is excited to announce that development of its title Idol Hands will start to go down the â€˜Virtual Realityâ€™ route and work on making the engine VR capable will begin in earnest later in 2017.   According to a recent report by Digi-Capital, the market is being driven by the increasing opportunities created by consumers who are more willing to invest in hardware which is VR capable. Moreover, manufacturers are starting to make a â€˜VR-Specâ€™ the defacto chipset, meaning that consumers will soon no longer need to â€˜choose VRâ€™ as hardware will, by default, be â€˜VR-Readyâ€™.   Originally developed in partnership with Intelâ„¢ and distributed as an OEM title with Creative Labsâ„¢ Senz3Dâ„¢, Idol Hands is a â€˜God Strategyâ€™ Game whereby the player takes the role of a God and gradually takes over a land, populates it with his people and builds farms, temples, workshops, garrisons and houses. Set in a fantastical tropical island world where the player has God-like powers over volcanoes, earthquakes and meteors as well as having the responsibility to make sure his people, the Furlings, grow and prosper when faced with evil Gods from other worlds.   CEO, David Lovatt, stated that: â€œIdol Hands lends itself to VR Gameplay naturally and, in fact, has a history of VR with the special camera it was developed for originally â€“ the Creative Labs cameras and the Intel Senz3D chip that recognized movements. This meant the user did not need to make use of the keyboard, but in fact the camera recognised the users hand movements. The opportunities to explore how we can take this further are exciting not just from a game play point of view, but because the market in VR is set to explode over the coming months and yearsâ€   Pocket Games recently announced that it was relaunching its Kicksend Photo Printing App. The relaunch has been delayed as they await for Facebookâ„¢ to clear the backlog of reviews they have which was caused by a system malfunction. The â€˜glitchâ€™ meant that significantly more than the usual amount of reviews to be thrown into the system leaving a huge delay. Pocket Games expects that this process is an â€˜any day nowâ€™ event and is simply waiting for the review to complete. #facebook72hours   About Pocket Games, Inc.

Micron's new SolidScale storage system uproots SSDs from servers and pushes them into discrete boxes while reducing latency. SolidScale is a top-of-the-rack storage system that will house many SSDs. It will connect to servers, memory, and other computing resources in a data center via gigabit ethernet, and will use the emerging NVMeoF (NVMe over Fabric) 1.0 protocol for data transfers. The new storage system is faster than regular storage arrays, Micron claimed. SolidScale can deliver data more than two times faster than a standard all-flash array. SolidScale is a step in decoupling SSDs from servers and putting them into shared storage in data centers. It also provides a power-efficient way of packing fast storage into tight spaces. Micron's new storage technology is designed for data centers of the future, in which storage, networking, memory, and other resources will be decoupled and boxed together in discrete units. Ideas for similar designs are already floating around. Intel has open-sourced its Rack Scale Design, which has been adopted by major server vendors. Such deployments are flexible for use with various workloads, including the cloud and databases, and can handle a variety of in-memory or storage driven applications. Pooled resources can also reduce electricity costs of data centers by more efficiently using cooling and other resources. Virtualization manages hardware use, and Micron is providing its own SolidScale middleware and management tools. SolidScale fits into such software-defined storage environments and is highly scalable to meet various workloads. The storage system can be pooled across many connections and resources and can offload processing to CPUs on the edge. The storage array also gets direct access to server or pooled memory. Deployments of SolidScale may start by the end of this year or in 2018, said Eric Endebrock, vice president for storage solutions marketing at Micron. Micron already makes SSDs but is trying to break into the lucrative enterprise storage market. The storage system is still being tested by clients, but Micron ultimately hopes to make it available to customers. The NVMeoF 1.0 standard was finalized in June, but kinks are still being worked out.  Many companies buy hyperconverged infrastructures, with server-attached storage from companies like Nutanix or Pure Storage. Integrating standalone Micron SolidScale storage alongside systems like HP's 3Par could be a hardware and software challenge. Micron's Endebrock said the company is investigating integration options going forward. The Future State of the CIO - A Case of ‘Career Is Over’ or ‘Career Is Opportunity’?

Smartphones are losing their buttons while screens of all kinds are losing their bezels. Gigabyte's Aero 15 laptops have jumped on that trend, but without making any major cuts. The new machines pack considerable processing power, gaming capabilities, and the ability to connect an entire array of ultra-high-definition monitors. Buyers can choose between a 1920x1080 IPS panel or a 3840x2160 screen. Either option comes with an anti-glare coating and is wrapped by top and side bezels measuring a scant 0.2" (5 mm). For now, all those pixels get their marching orders from a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB graphics card, though a presumably-less-expensive option with Intel graphics will be available in the future. Those thin bezels factor into the Aero 15's tidy 14.0" x 9.8" x 0.78" (36 cm x 25 cm x 2 cm) dimensions and 4.62 lbs (2.1 kg) weight. Even the supplied 150 W power adapter is pretty slim, measuring 6.6" x 2.5" x 0.87" (17 cm x 6.4 cm x 2.2 cm). Gigabyte still found a way to fit the Aero 15 with a 94 Wh battery, which the manufacturer says is good for 10 hours of productivity away from wall power. For those times when even an eight-megapixel display isn't enough, a pair of 4K (3840x2160) monitors can be attached to the HDMI and DisplayPort jacks, and another pair of 5K monitors can plug into the Thunderbolt 3 ports. The screen isn't the only part of the Aero 15 that can dazzle the eyes, either. The keyboard has per-key programmable RGB LED backlighting. The only CPU option is an Intel Kaby Lake Core i7-7700HQ. Systems ship with either 8 GB or 16 GB of DDR4 memory, upgradeable to a maximum of 32 GB. Making a lithe laptop body requires some compromises, and one of them is the storage. The Aero 15 has no room for any 2.5" drives and offers a single M.2 slot for SATA or NVMe devices. The placement of the webcam is likewise compromised somewhat—it's now mounted under the screen, akin to a Dell XPS 13. Gigabyte's Aero 15 is available now exclusively at Newegg for $1900 with 16GB of RAM, a GeForce GTX 1060 6GB graphic card, and a 1080p IPS display. The machine comes in black, lime green, or orange finishes. Gigabyte offers two-year warranty coverage on the laptop.

PTI  | Posted by Shatabdi Chowdhury  Follow @PTI_News   pti@intoday.com Washington, May 3, 2017 | UPDATED 21:27 IST A +A - Donald Trump (Reuters) Highlights 1 Infosys to hire 10,000 Americans in the next two years. 2 Infosys to open 4 centres in the US to mitigate H1-B visa curbs. 3 Trump administration welcomed the decision as a "political victory". The Trump administration today welcomed the decision by IT giant Infosys to hire 10,000 Americans in the next two years as a "political victory", saying it was the result of the US government's "pro-growth economic agenda." Infosys announced yesterday that it would hire 10,000 Americans in the next two years and open four new centres in the US as part of efforts to mitigate the impact of H1-B visa curbs. The first of the four innovation centres for new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning would open in August in Indiana, the home state of US Vice-President Mike Pence. The White House said the decision was further evidence that companies were renewing investment in the US as a result of the Trump administration's "pro-growth economic agenda." "This announcement by Infosys today adds to similar announcements from Intel, Charter Communications, and Exxon Mobil, all of whom are renewing investment in the US in the wake of the Trump administration's pro-growth economic agenda," Ninio Fetalvo, a White House spokesman told PTI. "We are glad to see companies like Infosys see an opportunity in the American economy again", Fetalvo said. Fetalvo said the announcement was "especially notable in light of the President's signing of the Buy American and Hire American executive order", which ensured that companies hire more Americans for well-playing jobs. H-1B VISA ACCUSATION Earlier, in a statement to The Washington Post, the White House termed the announcement by the Bangalore-based tech firm a political victory for the Trump administration, which has on several occasions accused outsourcing firms of "unfairly" taking jobs away from the US. The US had accused Infosys and its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services of unfairly cornering the lion's share of the H-1B work visas by putting extra tickets in the lottery system. Every year, the US grants 65,000 H-1B visas while another 20,000 are set aside for those with advanced degrees. At a White House briefing last month, an official of the Trump administration said a small number of giant outsourcing firms flood the system with applications, which naturally ups their chances of success in the lottery draw. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialised fields. Indian technology companies depend on it to hire  thousands of employees each year for their US operations. Reforming the H-1B visa system was one of the major election promises of US President Donald Trump. He last month signed an executive order that seeks to make changes to a H-1B visa programme that brings in highly-skilled foreign workers. The White House says the executive order will make it harder for tech firms to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour, and will strengthen rules, barring foreign contractors from bidding on government projects.

Its global headquarters is in Gillingham, U.K. (Photo: Carlos Osorio, Associated Press) 21 CONNECTTWEET 47 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Delphi Automotive is splitting into two and must find a new name either for the new standalone powertrain division or for the remaining company as it continues to transform itself into a developer of electrical infrastructure for autonomous vehicles. The auto supplier said Wednesday it plans to spin off its $4.5-billion powertrain division into a separate publicly traded company by this time next year. That new company, which will have about 20,000 employees globally and 5,000 engineers, will "absolutely" maintain its presence in metro Detroit and may even get to keep the Delphi name, Delphi CEO Kevin Clark said. The decision allows both Delphi's powertrain division and the remaining company to carve out separate, distinct identities, Clark said. Delphi's powertrain division makes components and systems for gasoline, diesel and electric engines while its remaining business specializes in electrical systems and the electrical infrastructure of cars. “I do like the Delphi name. We have created a lot of value for customers, a lot of value for shareholders so there is value in that name," Clark said. "We just think as a management team that given what we are going through, someone is going to have to have a new name ... I quite frankly don’t have a preference one way or the other.” Investors, who will get stock in both companies in the tax-free deal, immediately signaled that they love the idea. Delphi's shares surged $8.56, or 10.9%, to close at $87.01 on Wednesday. Barclays's analyst Brian Johnson said the spin-off "improves Delphi's position in a world of automotive big data" and the company is among the best-positioned to benefit in the coming years as automakers spend more money on systems that manage the data needed by autonomous vehicles to navigate. Delphi, the former parts arm of General Motors, has been shedding conventional automotive businesses ever since it was spun off as a separate company by GM in 1999. Today, Delphi is incorporated as British company in Gillingham, England, but its U.S. operations are based in Troy. The auto supplier also has emerged as a leader in autonomous vehicle technology. It has acquired or made strategic investments in 11 companies that specialize in the electrical architecture and software required by autonomous vehicles and connected technology in cars since 2012.

Those divisions collectively have annual revenue of more than $12 billion with 145,000 employees globally. "(Automakers) are requiring a significant ramp up in computing power .. .and more and faster signals and data distribution in the car," Clark said. "And we are the only supplier in the industry that has both the electrical architecture that controls computing power, controls signal distribution and the software capability to develop the systems for autonomous driving." A 2014 Audi SQ5, outfitted with Delphi Automotive self-driving technology, approaches New York City, after a cross-country road trip in 2015. Ninety-nine percent of the time, the car steered itself; only in very tricky situations, like a construction zone, did drivers take control.  (Photo: Delphi Automotive) Clark emphasized that the powertrain company has been growing and is expected to continue to grow through 2025 even though it is focused on a more traditional part of the industry. "The internal combustion engine is going to be around for a long, long time," and will likely still be the engine in 95% of vehicles sales through 2025, Clark said. "There is all sorts of opportunity within the powertrain segment to develop enhanced technology that improves the internal combustion engine." Clark said both the new powertrain company as well as the remaining company plan to maintain their presence in Troy even though the leadership of the division is based in Luxembourg. "We would expect, quite frankly, that there would not be any significant changes" to the locations of both companies, he said. Liam Butterworth, currently senior vice president and president of Powertrain Systems, will become president and CEO of the new company when the transaction is completed later next year. Timothy Manganello, who serves on the Delphi board of directors, will become non-executive chairman of the new Powertrain company. Previously, Manganello served as chairman and CEO of Auburn Hills-based BorgWarner. Barclay's Johnson, in his note to investors, said the powertrain division's growth has lagged behind Delphi's other divisions in recent years. However, Johnson said the new, standalone company could grow in the future through acquisitions. Also Wednesday, Delphi Automotive reported net income of $335 million for the first three months of the year. Delphi said it had profit of $1.24 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.59 per share. The results beat Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.46 per share. The vehicle parts maker posted revenue of $4.29 billion in the period, also exceeding forecasts. Seven analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $4.13 billion.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 3, 2017 7:30 AM PT Credit: Micron More like this Intel claims storage speed record with first large-capacity Optane SSD Intel's Optane faces threat as Micron chases future QuantX tech Micron's Intel Optane competitor will ship later this year Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD SSDs operate the fastest when inside a computer. Micron's new SolidScale storage system uproots SSDs from servers and pushes them into discrete boxes while reducing latency. SolidScale is a top-of-the-rack storage system that will house many SSDs. It will connect to servers, memory, and other computing resources in a data center via gigabit ethernet, and will use the emerging NVMeoF (NVMe over Fabric) 1.0 protocol for data transfers. The new storage system is faster than regular storage arrays, Micron claimed. SolidScale can deliver data more than two times faster than a standard all-flash array. [ Further reading: We tear apart a hard drive and SSD to show you how they work ] SolidScale is a step in decoupling SSDs from servers and putting them into shared storage in data centers. It also provides a power-efficient way of packing fast storage into tight spaces. Micron's new storage technology is designed for data centers of the future, in which storage, networking, memory, and other resources will be decoupled and boxed together in discrete units. Ideas for similar designs are already floating around. Intel has open-sourced its Rack Scale Design, which has been adopted by major server vendors. Such deployments are flexible for use with various workloads, including the cloud and databases, and can handle a variety of in-memory or storage driven applications. Pooled resources can also reduce electricity costs of data centers by more efficiently using cooling and other resources. Virtualization manages hardware use, and Micron is providing its own SolidScale middleware and management tools. SolidScale fits into such software-defined storage environments and is highly scalable to meet various workloads. The storage system can be pooled across many connections and resources and can offload processing to CPUs on the edge. The storage array also gets direct access to server or pooled memory. Deployments of SolidScale may start by the end of this year or in 2018, said Eric Endebrock, vice president for storage solutions marketing at Micron. Micron already makes SSDs but is trying to break into the lucrative enterprise storage market. The storage system is still being tested by clients, but Micron ultimately hopes to make it available to customers. The NVMeoF 1.0 standard was finalized in June, but kinks are still being worked out.  Many companies buy hyperconverged infrastructures, with server-attached storage from companies like Nutanix or Pure Storage. Integrating standalone Micron SolidScale storage alongside systems like HP's 3Par could be a hardware and software challenge. Micron's Endebrock said the company is investigating integration options going forward. To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Eric Adams Transportation Date of Publication: 05.03.17. 05.03.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am America’s Plan to Somehow Make Drones Not Ruin the Skies Leonid Eremeychuk/Getty Images If you can’t wait for the day drones plop packages on your porch or a flying car whisks you to work, you should know that the hold-up isn’t technological, but technocratic. Before these future flyers can take off, they must learn to play by the rules of the sky. That means communicating with air traffic control and other aircraft, spotting and avoiding threats, and generally knowing what to do when things go sideways. Making all of this happen demands whole new levels of capability—not just from the aircraft, but from the sprawling system that oversees them. The good news is, change is coming. Even though commercial drone technology barely existed a decade ago, regulators are hustling to integrate it into the national airspace. The FAA tapped Intel CEO Brian Krzanich to lead its Drone Advisory Committee, and established seven test sites to explore drone flight management. NASA is supporting the quest with its unmanned aircraft traffic management research program. Although everyone is moving fast, they’re shunning the “break things” part of the of the Silicon Valley ethos. Safety trumps efficiency and technological advances. “Our challenge is to find the right balance where safety and innovation co-exist on relatively equal planes,” FAA chief Michael Huerta told the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Symposium in March. “As we move toward fully integrating unmanned aircraft into our airspace, the questions we need to answer are only getting more complicated.” The Current Regime So far, the primary answer has been, no fun for you. Anyone operating a drone for commercial purposes must first pass a test covering traditional pilot know-how like wing load factors and airspace regulations. Drone pilots must keep their flyer below 400 feet, away from crowds and airports, and within their line of sight—restrictions designed to keep drones out of trouble. The FAA occasionally waives some restrictions with an eye toward seeing which rules it could loosen, but some people say overzealous regulation will keep the tech from reaching its potential. “There are so many applications that will benefit from drone use,” says Mark Barker, director of business development and marketing at the Nevada Institute for Autonomous Systems, which the state government created to expand the use of unmanned air systems. “Energy companies can inspect 50 miles of power lines with winged robots instead of human-piloted aircraft. Drones can conduct search-and-rescue, fly filming missions, survey environmental hazards, and act as couriers. They’re more efficient and more cost-effective than human-piloted aircraft.” Drone Wars Adam Rawnsley So, Bad News: Now Militants Are Using Drones as Projectiles Paul Sarconi The Next Great Frontier for Drones Lies in the Ocean Depths Jack Stewart A Drone-Slinging UPS Van Delivers the Future The FAA sees good reason to move cautiously, given basic questions remain unanswered. How will the aircraft respond when it runs out of power or experiences a failure? How will it communicate with air traffic control to approve a flight path or line up for a landing? And how will it avoid smacking into other aircraft? “If there’s no pilot in the aircraft scanning the horizon, and it’s not big enough for its own radar, how will they detect other aircraft?” says Ed Waggoner, director of NASA’s Integrated Aviation Systems Program. “How do you get information to the unmanned aircraft or the ground-based pilots-in-command in remote-flying situations to avoid other aircraft that may not be clearly announcing their intentions?” Moving Forward New, miniaturized sensor technology will be key here, particularly the ADS-B positioning systems increasingly common in commercial and civilian aircraft. That technology is approaching approaching drone-friendly dimensions and power requirements, but other problems remain. “In the case of what we call ‘non-cooperative’ aircraft—those flying without those systems either deliberately or because they’re not required to—we need to determine whether ground sensors or airborne sensors in other aircraft represent the best strategy for tracking them,” Waggoner says. Communicating with air traffic control presents its own problems. The FAA must determine how onboard flight management systems will function, and how those data-based, nonverbal systems will “talk” to controllers on the ground. It could be that the systems operate in a hybrid fashion (with human aircraft operators on the ground assisting otherwise autonomous aircraft through certain phases of their missions) or the successful integration might be contingent on the arrival of the next generation of air traffic control technology. Related Video This NASA Drone Flies Over Hurricanes For Better Weather Forecasts That happens to be in the pipeline, as well, via the FAA’s ongoing NextGen modernization program. This concurrent evolution is both a complication and a blessing for planners working to merge unmanned aircraft into the national air system. “We’re working with the FAA to ensure that our own work with UAS integration is forward-looking, so we’ll be ready for how air traffic control will function in the transportation system a decade or more from now,” Waggoner says. “But we also need to be safely testing these systems in a realistic, current environment.” Testing, Testing That’s where the FAA’s seven test sites come in. For instance, later this month, Nevada’s Institute for Autonomous Systems—the largest of the seven, with the ability to operate state-wide—will participate in a “Technical Capability Level” evaluation at its Reno facility. It will test a variety of traffic management systems on fixed-wing airplanes and multirotor copters, with flights up to 1,200 feet altitude and across several miles of approved airspace. (Other test sites around the country will be similarly engaged, running their own tests with various commercial and research partners.) In Nevada, researchers will conduct long-distance aerial survey, package delivery, and emergency response missions. They’ll also try out ground-based sense-and-avoid systems. In January, they’ll throw in “non-cooperative” aircraft—those not identifying themselves—over moderately populated areas. Sometime after that, they’ll expand the test to denser urban areas and explore tasks such as news gathering and package delivery. As they move toward full freedom, these aircraft must rival humans not just in skill, but in judgment, knowing what to do with the information they collect. “It’s not just sensing and knowing, but the vehicle needs to know the rules-of-the-road when flying—go left if you’re on a collision track, go over there to avoid contact, plan your path this way, etc.,” says Richard Pat Anderson, director of the Flight Research Center at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. “That requirement is not baked into the current FAA vision for NextGen, so it will need to be there, as well.” When the FAA has finally reached a solution that answers all these concerns—there’s no specified timeline—it will gradually alter the regulations to permit unmanned and autonomous aircraft to zip around the skies, hopefully without causing trouble. Only then will you be able to whip out your smartphone and order some sneakers or whistle up an autonomous electric air taxi to take you to the mall to buy them yourself.

Yet teasing out the last morsel of performance means running system memory at higher-than-default speeds. The gains may well be marginal, truth be told, though the small price premium for, say, DDR4-3,200 memory over DDR4-2,666 should be worth it. This is exactly why memory manufacturers have been pushing 3,000MHz-plus kits for the Ryzen CPU, whose supporting platforms are now far more stable than at launch a couple of months ago. One such company with Ryzen-specific kits is G.Skill, so let's take a closer look at its Flare X line and see if faster memory really is worth it. Flare X is offered in a choice of red or black heatspreaders. Once past the aesthetics, these dual-channel kits range from 16GB (2x8GB) through to 64GB (4x16GB) and, interestingly, are only offered in 2,133MHz, 2,400MHz and 3,200MHz speeds. The sole 3,200MHz kit at present is a 16GB (2x8GB) pack in black. Cynics may argue that DDR4 memory is DDR4 memory, so what works on the more popular Intel Z270 and X99 platforms ought to work on Ryzen. That is true, of course, though G.Skill says it has tested Flare X on at least 16 Ryzen-based motherboards to guarantee compatibility. MSI takes the lion's share of certification with no fewer than 11 qualified boards. It is usual for DDR4 memory scaling beyond 3GHz to have relatively loose timings. Not so in this case, as the Flare X pack ships with 14-14-14-34 timings usually reserved for lower-frequency RAM. Achieving this combination of speed and latency requires a bump to 1.35V, which is entirely normal for premium DDR4, and the modules also feature Intel's XMP 2.0 timings should you wish to use them in another rig. It appears that G.Skill is using Samsung B-die chips underneath. There has been a recent trend in making the heatspreaders larger and more overt. G.Skill sensibly shies away from that and presents Flare X in a standard form factor measuring 40mm high. As usual, the kits are backed with a limited lifetime warranty. Memory prices have been rising steadily since last year, so much so that paying £150 for a 16GB pack of 2,666MHz memory is becoming normal. Being more on the extreme end of matters, particularly for Ryzen processors, the review kit sells for £170. It is almost scary to think that equipping a rig with 32GB of premium memory costs about as much as a Sony PlayStation Pro console, but there you go. Well-built and promising the best possible performance on an AMD Ryzen 7 system, we want to find out whether paying a 20 per cent premium on the memory subsystem is actually worth it. We can answer this question as we fire up the PC and run numbers on a trio of kits offering a combination of different speeds and timings.

File photo. The Trump administration today welcomed IT giant Infosys' decision to hire 10,000 Americans in the next two years as a "political victory", saying it was a result of the US government's "pro-growth economic agenda." Infosys yesterday announced it will hire 10,000 Americans in the next two years and open four new centres in the US as part of efforts to mitigate the impact of H1-B visa curbs. The first of the four innovation centres for new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning will open in August in Indiana, the home state of US Vice-President Mike Pence. The White House said the decision was further evidence that companies are renewing investment in the US as a result of the Trump administration's "pro-growth economic agenda." "This announcement by Infosys today adds to similar announcements from Intel, Charter Communications, and Exxon Mobil, all of whom are renewing investment in the US in the wake of the Trump administration's pro-growth economic agenda," Ninio Fetalvo, a White House Spokesman, told PTI. "We're glad to see companies like Infosys see opportunity in the American economy again," Fetalvo said. Fetalvo said the announcement is "especially notable in light of the President's signing of the 'Buy American and Hire American' executive order," which ensured that companies hire more Americans for well-playing jobs. Earlier in a statement to The Washington Post, the White House termed the announcement by the Bangalore-based tech firm a political victory for the Trump administration, which has on several occasions accused outsourcing firms of "unfairly" taking jobs away from the US. The US had accused Infosys and its larger rival, Tata Consultancy Services, of unfairly cornering the lion's share of the H-1B work visas by putting extra tickets in the lottery system. Every year, the US grants 65,000 H-1B visas while another 20,000 are set aside for those with advanced degrees. At a White House briefing last month, an official of the Trump administration said a small number of giant outsourcing firms flood the system with applications which naturally ups their chances of success in the lottery draw. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialised fields. Indian technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year for their US operations. Reforming the H-1B visa system was one of the major election promises of US President Donald Trump. He last month signed an executive order that seeks to make changes to a H-1B visa programme that brings in highly skilled foreign workers. The White House says the executive order will make it harder for tech firms to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour, and will strengthen rules barring foreign contractors from bidding on government projects.

Amnon Shashua, head of the Israeli technology company that is being bought by Intel Corp for US$15.3 billion, said Mobileye expected to announce deals with carmakers by the end of 2017 for its high definition (HD) maps, bringing in revenues for both the company and its map-making partners. Fully self-driving vehicles are not expected until at least 2021, but carmakers are already offering a variety of semi-autonomous driver assistance systems, such as Tesla's Autopilot system. Mobileye thinks its mapping technology will be needed as these systems become more advanced. "We can enable hands-free driving to levels that are much higher than with any sensor (alone)," Shashua told Reuters, adding semi-autonomous systems still required drivers to remain alert. The Israeli company also believes its mapping technology will be cheaper and more comprehensive than rival systems because of the way it is created. Advertisement Whereas traditional HD mapping requires dedicated vehicles with specialized equipment and hired drivers, Mobileye's RoadBook uses hardware in vehicles to "crowdsource" data. Nissan, Volkswagen and BMW have already signed up to share data from Mobileye's camera-equipped advanced driver assistance systems to generate HD maps for self-driving cars, and Shashua said four more manufacturers were in talks about joining the program. "We hope to have the majority of these four signed by the end of 2017," he said. "Only car manufacturers can contribute ... because they have the cars. This is something that truly separates the car industry from the tech players." The prospect of self-driving vehicles has attracted Silicon Valley giants Google and Apple as well as carmakers, with Goldman Sachs estimating the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles could grow to US$96 billion in 2025 from just US$3 billion in 2015. Based on discussions with automaker and map-maker partners, Mobileye believes revenues from its HD maps will be "quite meaningful," though Shashua said he could not quantify it yet. Once autonomous driving cars are ready, there will be a period of several years where drivers will still be needed for monitoring purposes, Shashua added. "If the expectation is for zero accidents that isn't realistic," he said. He believes society would accept fatalities that are 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than with people-driven cars, meaning a decline to as few as 35 fatalities annually in the United States from around 35,000 today.

Has the Redmond giant learned from the mistakes it made with Windows RT? Is it making a whole set of new mistakes, or is Windows 10 S a credible threat to Google's Chrome OS platform? By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | May 3, 2017 -- 12:10 GMT (05:10 PDT) | Topic: Microsoft Windows 10 S Microsoft has unveiled a new edition of Windows -- Windows 10 S -- that sits alongside the two existing OEM and retail editions, Home and Pro, and has been designed from the ground up to compete with Google's Chrome OS platform. But has the Redmond giant learned from the mistakes it made with Windows RT? Must read: iPhone 8: Here's what we think we know about Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone what's hot on zdnet Windows 10 S: Chromebook killer or the second coming of Windows RT? Hundreds of privacy-invading apps are using ultrasonic sounds to track you High-performance Raspberry Pi alternatives Nissan goes back in time to stop you using your phone behind the wheel On the face of it, Windows 10 S seems a lot like Windows 10, but in reality, they are two entirely different operating systems. While Windows 10 S shares the familiar look and feel or Windows 10, includes a whole raft of Pro features such as Mobile Device Management (MDM) and BitLocker, and will run on anything that will run Windows 10, there are also some key differences. Possibly the most critical difference is that like its predecessor, Windows RT, Windows 10 S won't be able to run regular Windows applications, and it will instead be limited to running what's available in the Windows Store. However, if you just can't live with that restriction, Microsoft will offer Windows 10 S users a free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro this year, and beyond that, an upgrade will cost a very reasonable $50. As a counterbalance to the whole "you can only run apps from the Windows Store" thing, a big upside to Windows 10 S is that it offers significant performance and battery life improvements compared to the regular old Windows 10 platform. So, it's all good, right? Well, maybe not. First off, there's the name. There are well over a billion Windows PC users worldwide, and these people all have a preconceived idea of what "Windows" means to them. Yes, the look and feel is part of that "Windows" experience, but the cornerstone to many of the "Windows" experience is the flexibility to run the applications they want to run on the hardware they want to run it on. Windows RT failed, in part at least, because of brand confusion, and it feels like Microsoft is determined to make the same mistake again. Sure, this time around, users can upgrade the operating system in the event of buyer's remorse, but it doesn't do anything to alleviate the confusion in the first place. Also, it is widely rumored that Microsoft has plans to get back into the ARM-powered laptop market, and right now, Windows 10 S would seem to be the platform to install on that hardware. But that opens the door to a situation where Intel-powered Windows 10 S hardware could be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro while ARM-powered hardware could not. Perhaps Microsoft could add another suffix to the branding to clear things up? After all, that worked with Windows RT... oh wait. Bottom line is that I think that Windows 10 S is going to confuse people, and this is going to continue to be the case until Microsoft can see a future beyond Windows. Another problem is the message. On the one hand, Microsoft is making a huge deal of how lightweight Windows 10 S is, but on the other hand, it chose to debut the operating system on the Surface Laptop, a system that starts at $999. At that price, the Surface Laptop is hardly a Chromebook competitor, although that said, a thousand dollars does only get you a system with 4GB of RAM and a single USB 3 port, with no USB-C or Thunderbolt. Sure, tying Windows 10 S to the Surface Laptop gives the fledgling operating system some instant credibility and prestige, but it also associates it with high-end hardware right out of the gate. As to whether Windows 10 S is a competitor to Google's Chrome OS, I think that debate will only be answered with time. Trying to compare Windows 10 S to Chrome OS (or for that matter macOS or iOS) is pretty pointless since success or failure usually comes down to the factors such as price, ease of use, and the wider ecosystem. Given Microsoft's past Windows RT blooper, combined with how well (comparatively at any rate) Chromebooks seem to be selling, OEMs and buyers alike might just stick with what they already know over taking a leap into the unknown. But with education systems having a starting price tag of $189 -- and that includes a free subscription to the education edition of Minecraft -- it's possible that Chromebooks will start to feel the pinch. Next, we come to the issue of trust. Here's a key question that Microsoft needs to answer: Just how committed is Microsoft to Windows 10 S? I mean, in the wake of the glitz and glamour of product launches, the past decade is littered with costly failures and corporate backtracking -- Kin, Zune, Windows Mobile, Nokia, and Windows RT to name just a few. While tech pundits are usually keen to point how these blunders cost Microsoft billions of dollars, it's also important to remember that these tech clangers also cost consumers, enterprise customers, OEMs, and developers, and eroded a lot of trust in Microsoft. And while on the subject of developers, if Microsoft wants Windows 10 S to be a success, then it needs to encourage developers to populate the Windows Store with high-quality apps. And for developers to want to do that, it's got to be worth their time and effort to do so. This won't be easy to do, especially since Microsoft will be offering frustrated Windows 10 S users a cheap and easy upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, thus allowing them to break free of the Windows Store. Popular Windows "desktop" applications could be made to work with Windows 10 S by repackaging them and making them available through the Windows Store, but it all takes developer effort, and it hands a cut of the sale price over to Microsoft -- all with no guarantee of a return on that investment. How developers react to Windows 10 S could be key to whether it sinks or swims.

He believes society would accept fatalities that are 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than with people-driven cars, meaning a decline to as few as 35 fatalities annually in the United States from around 35,000 today.

Microsoft’s new Surface notebook now arrives in gold, platinum, blue and burgundy colors, has switched from a metal area around the keyboard for a softer microfiber lining, features a 13.5-inch touch screen, runs the latest Intel processors and gets 14.5 hours of battery life, according to Microsoft. The notebook also runs the new Windows 10S operating system, which Microsoft stated would be faster and offer better security than previous versions of Windows 10. Microsoft is presently targeting the notebook and Windows 10S at the education market, which is estimated around $15.6 billion, according research firm IDC. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and Apple had long dominated the school computing market, but Alphabet Inc.’s Google has made inroads recently with its low-priced and simple Chromebooks. Windows 10S will be available on cheaper computers targeted at elementary schools where teachers want predictable, easy to maintain and quick-booting machines. Dell, Samsung and Toshiba, among others, will offer new PCs running Windows 10S from $229 starting this summer. With the new Surface notebook, Microsoft is hoping to attract college-age buyers who want both a reliable machine and premium design and materials. The devices represent Microsoft first classic clamshell computer, whereas previous version were either a tablet or a hybrid tablet/notebook. The base model includes 128GB of storage, 4GB of RAM and runs on an Intel Core i5 processor. More expensive configurations are also available with a faster Intel Core i7 chip, storage capacities up to a terabyte and as much as 16GB of RAM. With Windows 10S, the look and feel is similar to Windows 10, albeit the apps that can be downloaded are only available from Microsoft’s app store. Microsoft has stated that this extends battery life and makes the laptop faster and more secure. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

NuTonomy's software, sensors and computing platforms will be installed in Peugeot 3008 models as part of plans to develop the technology needed for large fleets of autonomous cars, PSA and nuTonomy said in a statement on Wednesday. The latest PSA Group (pugoy) project seeks to work on "level 5" autonomous capable vehicles, which require no driver input, and will allow both companies to study how an "on-demand autonomous vehicle mobility service" performs, they said. The combination is the latest between technology and automotive companies after Daimler (ddaif), which owns Mercedes-Benz, last month unveiled an autonomous cars development partnership with supplier Robert Bosch, while BMW (bmwyy) has announced an alliance with chip maker Intel (intc) and Israel's Mobileye . Autonomous driving in urban areas requires a more radical approach to vehicle design, particularly for software and sensors, to help a car navigate inner city obstacles, said Anne Laliron, Head of the Business Lab at PSA Group. "That is the reason we jump on the opportunity to work with nuTonomy," Laliron told Reuters. PSA Group will use the project to learn about what components make sense, and which suppliers are available, Laliron said. Following the initial phase of this partnership, the companies will consider expanding their on-road AV testing initiative to other major cities. nuTonomy, a software company founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) academics and McKinsey management consultants was the first to begin on the road testing of driverless taxi services in Singapore last year. It raised $16 million last May in a funding round led by Highland Capital Partners and has backing from Singapore government authorities and Samsung Ventures, among others.

The company reported late Monday first-quarter results that were mostly in line with expectations, but analysts expressed concern over the margin outlook. With the stock more than tripling over the past year, Wall Street had set the bar very high. Don’t miss: The AMD of investors’ dreams is not a reality yet. The stock AMD, +0.68%  tumbled 24.4% to $10.30, the lowest close since Jan. 23, 2017. That’ s the biggest one-day percentage decline since it plummeted 26.2% on Jan. 11, 2005. Volume rocketed to 266.6 million shares, which was more than five-times the full-day average and enough to make the stock the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges. Shares slipped further, by 0.3%, in premarket trade Wednesday. Analyst Christopher Rolland at Susquehanna Financial said AMD needed to have a “near perfect” quarter to justify the recent ramp up in share price, but the results fell a bit short. “AMD’s new products are beginning to accelerate growth, but perhaps without all the gross margin benefits we had hoped for,” he wrote in a note to clients. Rolland kept his rating at neutral, and his stock price target at $12, which is now about 17% above current levels. UBS analyst Stephen Chin affirmed his sell rating on the stock and $9 price target, which calls for a further selloff of about 13%, on concerns that the margin expansion story could take more time to develop. “We keep our sell rating on the stock as we see limited EPS growth near term to support its high multiple as it need to invest heavily to keep pace with Intel and Nvidia,” Chin wrote. “We also estimate limited operating margin expansion in the near term.” AMD has a price-to-earnings ratio for next-12-month estimates of 148.6, according to FactSet, compared with Intel Corp.’s INTC, +0.77%  13.0 and Nvidia Corp.’s NVDA, +0.74%  37.0. Analyst Ruben Roy at MKM Partners said AMD appears to be executing largely according to plan, with the shipment of its new Ryzen desktop processors during the first quarter, and the results didn’t change is fundamental view of the company. However, the margin outlook is a concern as the shares appear fairly valued. “While we do not find lumpy gross margin performance all that surprising as AMD transitions into a number of new product launches, we do understand investor disappointment with a step back given the buzz around Ryzen,” Roy wrote. The stock has lost 9.0% year to date, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, +0.34%  has run up 10.8% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.13%  has gained 6.8%.

By Rob Thubron on May 2, 2017, 11:39 AM 11 comments TechSpot Back in November last year, it finally became possible to stream Netflix to your PC in 4K. But in addition to requiring a monitor or TV capable of displaying the resolution, it was revealed that a Kaby Lake processor was a necessity. However, you'll soon no longer need one of Intel’s seventh-generation CPUs to enjoy Netflix content at 3,840 x 2,160 on a PC; a Geforce GTX 10 series graphics card will suffice. Nvidia is testing a new GPU driver that supports UHD playback on its newest series of GPUs. While the CPU in your PC won't matter, you will need a GeForce GTX 1050 card or better with at least 3GB of RAM to stream Netflix’s 4K videos. As there’s only a 2GB version of the GTX 1050, that means the minimum requirement will be a 1050 Ti (unless another version of the 1050 is on its way). Additionally, you’ll need a monitor with HDCP 2.2 copy-protection technology, an internet connection of 25 Mbps or faster, and Microsoft’s Edge browser or the Netflix app from the Windows Store. And the feature won’t work on PCs with multiple graphics cards, so if you’ve got an SLI setup, you’ll have to unlink your GPUs if you want 4K Netflix. “In case of a multi monitor configuration on a single GPU or multiple GPUs where GPUs are not linked together in SLI/LDA mode, 4K UHD streaming will happen only if all the active monitors are HDCP2.2 capable. If any of the active monitors is not HDCP2.2 capable, the quality will be downgraded to FHD,” writes Nvidia. You’ll still need to use Edge, too, as no other browser natively supports Microsoft’s PlayReady v3.0. GeForce 10 cards also support the copy prevention technology and are able to decode 10-bit HEVC video. Right now, the “beta” driver is only available for those on the Windows Insider Program. There’s no word on when it will get a public release.

But the Director of Communications at the Bank Bernard Otabil does not know the owners of Sibton Switch Systems Limited. He stated however that the BoG, as the regulator of the financial sector, conducted enough due diligence before awarding the contract to Sibton Switch Systems Limited. The award of the contract to Sibton has raised serious questions with critics raising issues about the cost, to which the contract was awarded and whether the company has the experience to able to implement the system effectively. Out of three companies that bided to execute the policy Sibton Switch System is reported to have the highest cost for the implementation of the policy. Whilst the tender amount for Sibton Switch was GH¢4,667,414,340.82 two other entities with bids for the same contract- Vas Intel Limited and Mericom Solutions Limited – submitted tender amounts and packages worth GH¢14,094,795.00 and GH¢5,465,396.06 respectively. Apart from the huge tender amount disparity, Sibton Switch System is also reported to be the company with the least experience. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sibton Communications incorporated in August 2015 to run a system to make banks, mobile money platforms and other payment systems interoperable. With a project that is expected to provide a seamless, secured, interoperability of mobile money systems, critics believe a more experienced company with a proven track record of delivery was expected to have won the contract. But speaking on the Super Morning Show, Monday, the Director of Communications at BoG insists due diligence was done. He said the Bank in deciding who won the contract went beyond the tender amounts proposed by the companies and did an evaluation of the technical services and competencies of companies. "As a regulator you are no supposed to chase after the market. You are to lead the market. So in terms of establishing an effective and efficient payment system in your economy there are a number of issues that are to be taken into consideration. That is not only led on price. There are certain technical provisions. That is why in the tender process you want to technically evaluate the proposal that have been submitted to ensure that is a going to full proof, fit for purpose and to ensure the payment system is protected. He said the Bank is only facilitating the process. The award of the contract to Sibton Switch comes as a surprise to many, given that the telecommunication net works have been asked to put a system in place to ensure a smooth interoperability. Some of the critics do not understand why Sibton was selected when indeed the companies have already invested monies to ensure an effective interoperability system but Bernard Otabil his outfit had a responsibility to select an effective and efficient payment system and they did just that. When he was asked who owned Sibton Switch, he said: "I can never tell you who the owner of Sibton Switch really is. In honest truth, I don't know. I have not done any shareholder evaluation to know who is behind it." Checks on the website of the company http://www.sibtonswitch.com did not show names or faces of the management or ownership structure of the company except the services the company render.

This comes just a day before the opening of Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona, Spain; and they chose the venue of the conference to make the declaration. The mobile operators and their technology partners in this noble course include Vodafone, Huawei, Ericsson, AT&T, NTT DOCOMO INC., SK Telecom, Qualcomm Technologies Inc., British Telecom, Telstra, Korea Telecom, Intel, LG Uplus, KDDI, LG Electronics, Telia Company, Swisscom, TIM, Etisalat Group, Sprint, Vivo, ZTE and Deutsche Telekom. The contingent will support a corresponding work plan proposal for the first phase of the 5G NR specification at the next 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) RAN Plenary Meeting, slated for March 6-9 in Dubrovnik, Croatia. Based on the current 3GPP timelines, the earliest 5G NR deployments based on standard-compliant 5G NR infrastructure and devices will likely not be possible until 2020. But the new proposal introduces an intermediate milestone to complete specification documents related to a configuration called Non-Standalone 5G NR to enable large-scale trials and deployments starting in 2019. "Non-Standalone 5G NR will utilize the existing LTE radio and evolved packet core network as an anchor for mobility management and coverage while adding a new 5G radio access carrier to enable certain 5G use cases starting in 2019," the group said in a statement. The supporting companies are further committed to making forward compatibility a key design principle for the standardization of the first release of 5G NR. This will enable in-band introduction of new capabilities and features in subsequent releases critical to enabling yet to be identified industries and use cases and achieving the 5G vision to connect everything to everything. The proposal is consistent with 3GPP's commitment to enabling a flexible evolution and inter-working of the radio access network towards 5G NR and the evolution of the core network towards the 5G System. As proven by the broad industry support, this proposal delivers the ability to address the increasing global demand for enhanced mobile broadband services with 5G NR in 2019, while continuing to address the broader vision for 5G NR in 2020 and beyond. Head of Research and Development and Strategy at Vodafone Group, Luke Ibbetson said: "Standardisation of the New Radio interface will be critical to the successful development of 5G over the coming years. As the industry starts to design and test a new generation of services and applications, a common global standard for the underlying mobile technology will allow innovation to flourish and help us achieve economies of scale." "5G will usher in an era of deep convergence between telecom and vertical industries, meaning 5G standards will apply to multiple scenarios and enable the digital transformation of multiple industries," Yang Chaobin, President of Huawei 5G said: He added that "We need to define a Future-Proof 5G architecture which combining innovative achievements from various industries, to meet the requirements of numerous applications step by step and then to ensure the strategic vision and leading capabilities of 5G." Senior Vice President and Head of Business Unit Network Products at Ericsson, Arun Bansal also said "The faster we commercialize 5G based on 3GPP specifications, the faster we will realize its benefits for the entire industry. We are thrilled to participate in this initiative to accelerate the 5G ecosystem and commercial deployment." AT&T Senior Vice President of for a Wireless Network Architecture at AT&T, Tom Keathley, "Our focus is on prioritizing important specifications in the standards to bring 5G to market as quickly as possible...These accelerated decisions on key components of 5G New Radio standards will allow an earlier start on the development of the infrastructure and devices of tomorrow's 5G deployments." Executive Vice President of Qualcomm Technologies Cristiano Amon said "5G NR technologies will be critical to meet the ever-increasing connectivity requirements for emerging mobile broadband experiences such as virtual reality, augmented reality and connected cloud computing, and we are already seeing the need to bring these technologies to devices globally sooner rather than later. There is great value in accelerating the timeline to commercialization while maintaining the global scale through the proper standardization process in 3GPP." The other partners expressed similar sentiments to buttress their support for the acceleration of standards to expedite the introduction of 5G on a large scale and year ahead of schedule.

The telecoms technology giant said it will be demonstrating the 50 Gigabytes per second peak rate of a 5G mm-Wave base station at Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017 in Barcelona. This release allows operators to deploy these products ahead of time and seize opportunities in the 5G era so that consumers can enjoy the 5G ultimate rate ahead of time. ZTE is also one of several mobile industry giants seeking an expeditious release of 5G New Radio standards to accelerate the deployment and commercialisation of 5G one year ahead of the 2020 schedule. The release of the full range of 5G mmWave and Sub6GHz base stations has therefore paved the way for subsequent 5G pre-commercial tests and deployment by other industry giants. At MWC, ZTE's full range of 5G mmWave and Sub6GHz pre-commercial products confirms its support for 3rd Generation Partnership Projects (3GPP) 5G new radio (NR) new air interfaces and mainstream 5G frequency bands in the industry. The range uses massive multiple inputs, multiple outputs (MIMO), Beam Tracking, beamforming and other key 5G technologies, meeting the 5G pre-commercial deployment requirements in various scenarios. 5G Sub6GHz base stations are the smallest and lightest base stations with the industry's highest level of integration, and their data throughput can reach 10 Gbps. In 2016, ZTE became the world's first vendor to verify the key technologies in the 5G mmWave and Sub6GHz fields and successfully completed 5G mmWave field tests with its strategic Chinese partner, China Mobile. The company took the lead and passed all the tests in the first phase of China's 5G test, and has successfully completed 5G single-point technology and prototype verification and has now entered the 5G solution verification and product research and development (R&D) phase. Senior Vice President of ZTE, Zhang Jianguo said: "ZTE will continue its innovation in the 5G field to meet the product and service needs of customers. ZTE will occupy a place in the world's first 5G commercial market and lay a solid foundation for the future Internet of Things (IoT)." In a related development, ZTE also announced that it has launched the next generation 5G IT baseband unit (BBU) with Intel® Corporation. The IT BBU is the world's first software defined networking/network function virtualisation (SDN/NFV) technology-based 5G RAN solution. By utilising advanced SDN/NFV virtualisation technology, the modular IT BBU is compatible with 2G/3G/4G/Pre5G and supports cloud-radio access networks (C-RAN), distributed-RAN (D-RAN) and 5G central and distributed units (CU/DU), which equips it with a robust ability for future development. Energy efficiency A new generation of modular baseband processing platform, based on Intel® architecture, the IT BBU has a large capacity, high integration, and multi-mode flexible networking features. It can significantly reduce energy consumption with sophisticated algorithms and mechanisms, support vertical business and multi-scene flexible deployment, as well as support 4G and 5G hybrid networks to effectively protect the operator's investment. Traditionally, mobile networks expand scale and functions by increasing hardware, but this method increases energy consumption as well as operation and maintenance complexity. The result is increased total cost of ownership (TCO), which is harmful to a network's long-term development and evolution. "But ZTE's new generation network platform, utilizing  SDN/NFV technologies, can help address these challenges. By virtualising the functions of network equipment, the baseband processing platform can carry diversified network functions more flexibly, thus significantly accelerating network deployment and optimisation, in addition to reducing the overall investment cost," a statement from the company said. Jianguo Zhang noted that Intel technologies power the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices, so ZTE is very pleased to be partners with Intel in the field of 5G "and our deep cooperation will support our two companies' long-term development." "We see Communications Service Providers quickly adopting SDN/NFV technologies as the foundation of 5G networks," said Sandra Rivera, Corporate Vice President of Intel Corporation. She said "Our goal with ZTE is to accelerate commercial, cloud-ready 5G network solutions. By using the latest Intel® architecture processors at the intelligent edge, ZTE has demonstrated that this network transformation can be realized for 5G networks requirements, including ultra-low latency, very high bandwidth and expanded capacity."

From agriculture to commerce, from health care to communications, from manufacturing to education, technology has transformed the human experience. Innovation is the primary driver of technological development and higher living standards. In government we see a need to strengthen the links in the chain in the very complex interactions between diverse public and private actors in our national and regional innovation systems. Effective innovation systems depend on a flow of knowledge and technology between enterprises, universities, and research institutions. The mechanisms that enable this flow of knowledge include joint industry-university research, public-private partnerships, technology diffusion, and movement of personnel. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is our most successful public-private partnership in the science and technology sector. It is a good example of how South Africa is positioning itself as a strategic partner and an attractive destination for global science and technology infrastructure, projects and investment. Multinational companies such as IBM, Cisco and Intel are already showing increasing interest in becoming involved in various SKA spin-offs. The construction of the 64-dish MeerKAT, the precursor to the SKA, is well under way, and scientists from all over the world have already booked time to do research on it. Preparing for the huge amounts of data produced by the MeerKAT and the SKA is also preparing South Africa to play a leading role in big data. As industry you should seize such opportunities. Together we can become a global leader in this emerging field if we make the right interventions now. It’s clear that the current bigdatachallenge requires a wide range of new skills, policies and practices, technologies and legal frameworks. Fast broadband networks, trusted repositories and national accepted practices are required. The scope of big data activity is vast – in the breadth of research possible; broad range and roll-out scale of skills development needed; diversity of applicable technology; wide ranging application domains; and numerous business opportunities. The Department is coordinating its efforts and crafting its own strategic framework in big data to position South Africa as a key global player. Last year we signed a memorandum of understanding with Cisco, centred mostly on the establishment of a Centre for Broadband Communication at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, which will be jointly funded by the DST (through the CSIR Meraka Institute) and Cisco. The centre now plays a significant role in undertaking appropriate research to provide solutions to the broadband challenges faced by South Africa. It also contributes to the achievement of the key objectives outlined in the National Broadband Policy for South Africa (2013). Cisco intends this research to enhance its suite of products and expertise on next-generation networking, particularly in the context of the SKA. There is a growing urgency for business and government to find each other in a wide variety of economic collaborations, but nowhere more important than in increasing South Africa’s gross expenditure on research and development from the current 0,8% of GDP to 1,5% by 2019. While the target is ambitious, we are committed to achieving it. My department is developing a dedicated foreign investment strategy focused on cooperation with partners such as international foundations and philanthropic organisations, which are already investing significantly in South African science, especially in health research. Currently 15% of R&D investment in South Africa comes from foreign partners. We encourageinternational companies to relocate some of their R&D programmes to South Africa. We have some means and instruments – smart investments and incentives – to make South Africa a preferred destination for global R&D. We applaud General Electric, for example, for the announcement of a R500 million investment in a customer innovation centre in Gauteng. We welcome its decision to invest a further R200 million to support South African SMMEs through technology transfer. We also applaud IBM for its announcement of a R700 million investment over 10 years into ICT research and development. The partnership is anchored in the Black Economic Empowerment – Equity Equivalence Investment Programme (BEE-EEIP) of the Department of Trade and Industry. The research programme is centred around the establishment of an IBM research lab in Johannesburg, started in April 2015.  It focusses on advancing smarter decision making, analytics, cloud, and next generation infrastructure. The partnership is significant because it’s the first time an international company has invested in R&D through the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) financial instrument We applaud Cisco, as I said earlier in relation to SKA, which has a three-year partnership worth R66 million to increase the company’s research and development activities in South Africa. Government will continue to work hard to promote relationships with global partners and to leverage foreign investment in science and technology in South Africa. Yet we face a number of challenges in South Africa – high broadband costs, and a lack of innovative economic models for providing connectivity to rural communities. We are not sitting on our hands in this regard. The DST has an ICT Research and Development and Innovation Strategy and a a 10-year Roadmap, that are being implemented by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research’s (CSIR) Meraka Institute. The Meraka Institute has seen some of its R&D programmes graduating into large-scale technology demonstrators. For example, the wireless mesh network project is an alternative model for the deployment of broadband infrastructure and the provision of electronic services in rural areas. In the implementation of the ICT R&D and innovation strategy, collaboration with the IT industry and academia is of profound importance. Our aim is to catalyse the development of an innovative, sustainable and indigenous IT industry that addresses a significant portion of South Africa’s IT needs, as well as attracting investments from global IT corporations in R&D and manufacturing facilities in South Africa. With the increased investment in R&D by both private and public sectors, opportunities exists for bold interventions that will enable South Africa to secure a greater share of global markets in both R&D and manufacturing.

generates revenues of KD 247 million (USD 810 million) for Q1, 2017 03 May, 2017 Mohannad Al-Kharafi: Board to ensure all strategic partnerships and investments are geared towards maximizing shareholder value and driving the business forward Bader Al-Kharafi: Focused on further innovation in digital services and collaboration with leading technology players across the globe EBITDA margin stands at 43.4%, customers served total 46.1 million Data revenues continue to grow, represent 25% of total Group revenues Advertisement Significant currency devaluation in Sudan, continued social unrest in several markets and intense competition in Iraq and Kuwait impacts results Excluding currency translation impact, net income would have grown by 27% The success of Zain Saudi Arabia’s turnaround program highlights the quarter Kuwait – 2 May, 2017 Zain Group, a leading mobile telecom innovator in eight markets across the Middle East and Africa, announces its consolidated financial results for the first quarter (Q1) ending 31 March 2017. Zain served 46.1 million customers at the end of the period, reflecting a 1.4% increase year-on-year (Y-o-Y). Zain Group generated consolidated revenues of KD 247 million (USD 810 million) for the first quarter of 2017, down 11% compared to the same period in the previous year (Y-o-Y). EBITDA for the quarter reached KD 107 million (USD 352 million), down 13% Y-o-Y, reflecting an EBITDA margin of 43.4%. Net income for the quarter reached KD 38 million (USD 125 million), up 3% Y-o-Y reflecting Earnings Per Share of 10 Fils (USD 0.03).  For Q1, 2017, foreign currency translation impact, predominantly due to the 59% currency devaluation in Sudan from 6.4 in Q1, 2016 to 15.6 (SDG / USD), cost the company USD 148 million in revenue, USD 68 million in EBITDA and USD 32 million in net income. Excluding the above-mentioned currency translation impact, Y-o-Y revenues would have grown by 4%, EBITDA by 3% and net income by 27%. Key Operational Notes for three months ended 31 March, 2017: The company held its Ordinary General Assembly on 12 March, and after approving the distribution of a cash dividend of 35 fils (USD 0.11) per share for the financial year ended 31 December, 2016, the meeting saw the election of the Group Board of Directors for the next three years. The new Board appointed Mohannad Mohammad Abdulmohsen Al-Kharafi as Chairman and Bader Nasser Al-Kharafi as Vice-Chairman and Group CEO. Group data revenues (excluding SMS and VAS) increased 4% Y-o-Y, representing 25% of the Group’s consolidated revenues.  The significant currency devaluation impact in Sudan in the beginning of November 2016 affected Zain Group’s Q1, 2017 financial results.  Intense price competition in Kuwait coupled with additional operational costs in network expansion and upgrades severely impacted the operation and consequently Zain Group’s overall financial metrics. The continual social unrest in Iraq, coupled with intense price competition affected all key financial indicators. Similarly, social unrest and currency devaluation impacted Zain South Sudan results. During the quarter, Zain entered numerous agreements with world-leading entities to support its digital lifestyle aspirations. These included the creation of a joint venture with iflix, the world’s leading entertainment service for emerging markets, to bring unlimited video-on-demand services to the MENA region; with Amazon Web Services Partner Network to provide resilient cloud solutions to organizations in the Middle East; and joining the ‘Telecom Infra Project’ to develop next-generation telecom infrastructure in an initiative co-founded by Facebook, Intel, Nokia and others in 2016. Zain also entered into a joint venture with YOYO, one of the most innovative digital start-ups in Turkey, to bring an exciting car sharing club model initially to Bahrain, and later expand across the Zain regional footprint and the MENA region; and also entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Myca Health Inc, an innovative Canadian-based leader in the development of unique proprietary software for scalable IT web based platforms. Commenting on the results, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Zain Group, Mr. Mohannad Al-Kharafi said, "It is an honor to have been appointed Chairman of Zain Group, a pioneering company that has placed Kuwait on the world telecom map and created enormous returns for its shareholders over the years. The new Board is fully committed to building on the solid foundation established by the previous Board members and to work closely with executive management in overcoming the many socio-economic challenges we face in several key markets. There is a concerted focus to ensure all strategic partnerships and investments are geared towards maximizing shareholder value and driving the business forward." Vice-Chairman and Group CEO, Bader Al-Kharafi said, “Our transformation efforts are resulting in sound operational progress across several of our key markets. We are focused on managing unavoidable externalities as much as possible given the impact they are having on our overall key financial indicators, particularly the highly changeable environments we face with regard to the currency issues in Sudan, the continued social unrest in Iraq, and the intense price competition in both our home market of Kuwait and Iraq. We remain optimistic of the improving socio-economic conditions across all our markets.” Mr. Al-Kharafi continued, "We are pleased with the turnaround and improved performance of Zain Saudi Arabia, which recorded its first ever net profit for the quarter and we will continue to grow this key market as the cost optimization program and network upgrades take effect. Sudan continues to grow due to the rollout of 4G services and the subsequent uptake of data services. We also anticipate improved performances in Iraq, where several tax and litigation issues have been resolved and the new leadership there can now focus on driving the business. Jordan continues to perform well maintaining its market leadership on all levels." Regarding Zain’s home market of Kuwait, Mr. Al-Kharafi noted, “We are working closely with the management team in overcoming the intense price competition that has impacted value for all operators, by offering a new range of services that we are confident will drive growth. We are investing heavily in expanding and upgrading our network in Kuwait that will further enhance the mobile experience of our customers.” Mr. Al-Kharafi added, "The data monetization, Enterprise (B2B) and smart city initiatives implemented across our operations are profitable business areas that are growing at impressive rates and we will continue to invest resources to foster these areas. We are also focused on further innovation in digital services and plan to build on the many partnerships we have recently entered into and we will continue to seek and collaborate with innovative technology players across the globe.” The Vice-Chairman and Group CEO concluded, "Zain currently enjoys a strong presence geographically, with a balanced range of markets that are at different stages of growth and continues to be a market leader in five of its eight operations. We are committed to our strategy to leverage our strengths, including our talented people, brand, customer experience, cutting edge technology innovations, and geographic coverage in our bid to become a leading diversified and innovative digital lifestyle operator." Operational review of key markets for the three months ended 31 March, 2017 Kuwait: Maintaining its market leadership, the flagship operation of Zain Group saw its customer base serve 2.8 million in a very challenging period that saw intense price competition coupled with additional operational costs in network expansion and upgrades impact its financial performance for the quarter. Revenues generated for the quarter reached KD 79.5 million (USD 261 million), EBITDA amounted to KD 31 million (USD 101 million) and net income came in at KD 16.2 million (USD 53 million). Zain Kuwait’s EBITDA margin stood at 39% for the quarter, with Zain Kuwait’s nationwide 4G LTE network seeing data revenues (excluding SMS and VAS) form 34% of total revenues. Iraq: Despite the initiation of intense price competition in the market during Q1, 2017, coupled with continuing social unrest, Zain Iraq managed to achieve USD 253 million revenues due to impressive growth in data usage and numerous customer acquisition initiatives in the northern regions of the country. The operation’s efficiency drive saw EBITDA reach USD 86 million, reflecting a 34% margin. Zain Iraq leads the market serving 12.3 million customers. Sudan: In local currency (SDG) terms, the operator continues to perform well, as revenues grew by 38% Y-o-Y to reach SDG 1.7 billion (USD 107 million, down 43% in USD terms) for Q1, 2017. EBITDA increased by 22% to reach SDG 594 million (USD 38 million, down 49% in USD terms), reflecting an EBITDA margin of 36% while net income increased by 32% to reach SDG 258 million (USD 17 million, down 45% in USD terms).

Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Made by Everysight, an Elbit spinoff, the glasses have a map-projection overlay that helps riders navigate new terrain, gives real-time performance metrics and allows cyclists to receive notifications, calls and text messages. Chief Financial Officer Joseph Gaspar said the solution is similar to obstacle-avoidance technology for autonomous cars developed by Mobileye NV, an Israeli company that Intel Corp. bought in March for $14.7 billion. Raptor smartglasses made by Everysight. Source: Everysight “A part of our strategy is to take technologies from the defense market and look for applications in the commercial market, part of which is consumer,” Chief Executive Officer Bezhalel Machlis said in an interview. Israel’s largest publicly traded defense company, Elbit sells air, land, naval and cyber security products, and saw its annual revenue grow nearly 5 percent last year. In the past six months the Haifa-based company’s shares have jumped 16 percent, more than the average of its global peers. Still, the company’s five-year average sales growth of 3 percent lags its peer average of more than 5 percent, and its three-year Ebitda margin is 12.7 percent, compared with its peer average of 13.4 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Spinoffs Machlis said about 1/10 of Elbit’s annual revenue comes from civilian products -- mostly aviation systems -- and the company also has revamped military technology for the autonomous car industry. “We’re trying to adapt to the commercial market, and in 2016 became a strong player in the automotive market,” Machlis said. “Our second area of commercial products is wearables, as seen in Everysight.” The goggles’ heads up display. Source: Everysight Elbit forms strategic partnerships for its spinoffs, providing the technology and bringing in investors and partners with strength in relevant markets. Saban Capital Group, founded by billionaire Haim Saban, is one of the investors in Everysight, whose goggles are expected to hit the market by the end of the year. The cost will be comparable to smartphones and other devices, the company said, without elaborating. “Do they need to create more revenue? If you already have a technology and you can put it to another use, then it makes sense to monetize it any way you can,” Citi analyst Michael Klahr said. Google Glass Gilad Alper, head of foreign equity research at Excellence Nessuah Brokerage Ltd. in Petach Tikva, Israel, said defense companies don’t always do a great job transforming military technologies into commercial products, as the markets are so different.  “There are a lot of reasons to be skeptical, but that doesn’t preclude them succeeding,” Alper said. Everysight said in an e-mail that it expects its device to do better than Google Glass -- Google’s connected eyewear that struggled to attract customers -- in part because its goggles are based on decades of Elbit experience in vision systems and augmented reality. TV Venture A previous venture into consumer products didn’t last long for Elbit: In 1992, the company started making television sets but stopped just two years later, deciding that any future consumer products would stem from core technologies already in use on the military side. These technologies, when developed and ultimately divested, created revenue for Elbit, as with MediGuide, an intrabody navigation system sold to St. Jude Medical Inc. in 2008 for $283 million.   Everysight could also be divested at the appropriate time, Machlis said.  “This is not the core activity of the company,” he said.

NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER Search for: 6 things you need to know about the Microsoft Surface Laptop Microsoft might have singled out students for its first proper laptop, but it’s not quite so simple 03 May 2017 by Stuff Staff Looking for a lightweight, luxurious laptop? That used to mean heading to the Apple Store, but Microsoft has just unveiled a very tempting alternative. The Surface Laptop ditches the detachable keyboards and helpful hinges of the Surface Pro for a no-nonsense form factor, but doubles down on design, performance and battery life to tempt you away from OS X. It’s running a new version of Windows, and has a big focus on education, but this is much more than a premium Chromebook competitor. Here’s everything you need to know. 1) IT’S THE BEST-LOOKING SURFACE YET Tipping the scales at 1.25kg and measuring just under 15mm at its thickest point, the Surface Laptop wants to be the ultimate ultra-portable. You won’t spot any screws, seams or misplaced edges anywhere on the all-metal body, whether you pick one up in Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt Blue or Graphite Gold colours. There’s not even a rubber bumper or plastic frame around the display – something not even Apple’s MacBook Pro can claim. The precision engineering on show is seriously impressive. That applies to the keyboard, too. It’s covered in Alcantara, the same material you’d find on the steering wheel of an Italian supercar, and laser-etched to stop any and all light leaking out from the backlit keys. It stealthily hides the speakers, pumping sound from beneath the keyboard with no visible grilles or holes. Apple used to be at the pinnacle of laptop design, but Microsoft might have just taken the crown. 2) IT’S RUNNING WINDOWS 10 S The Surface Laptop is the debut device for Microsoft’s Windows 10 S, a cut-down version of the ubiquitous OS built specifically for schools. Don’t think of it as a mere Chrome OS knock-off, though: it might only be able to run apps you download through the Windows Store, but it’s got a lot more controls and settings for teachers. That’ll make sure little Timmy isn’t secretly playing games when he’s supposed to be learning his times tables. He could be playing Minecraft, though – or at least the special Education Edition that’s available for all WIndows 10 S users. 3) IT’S GOT ALL THE PERFORMANCE YOU NEED… With Intel’s latest Core i5 and Core i7 mobile CPUs on board, and up to 1TB of PCI-E storage bolted directly onto the motherboard, the Surface Laptop should be seriously quick. Microsoft reckon it’ll outpace a MacBook Pro in certain tests – not bad for something that costs significantly less cash. This is partly down to how the Laptop’s metal frame is directly hooked up to the vapour chamber heat pipes keeping the internal hardware cool, meaning the whole thing acts as a giant heatsink. It keeps everything running to temperature, without burning a hole through your crotch while you’re working on it. Open the lid and the Laptop should boot up in under 10 seconds – that’s Chromebook quick. 4) …AND AN ULTRA-LONG LASTING BATTERY With Intel’s newest Kaby Lake silicon running the show, and Windows 10 S keeping power management in check by stopping any unwanted apps from running in the background, the Surface Laptop should have serious staying power. Microsoft says you’ll be able to get over fourteen and a half hours of battery life from a single charge – and it’ll barely use any power at all when you put it in standby mode. You won’t be charging it over USB-C (there’s a familiar Surface charging adapter in the box instead) but you won’t need to bring it with you for a day of school – on a full tank, you’ll have enough for a full day of classes, and still have power left over for a Netflix box-set binge when you get home. 5) THE SCREEN ISN’T THE STAR Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablet and Surface Book both have stellar screens, but the Surface Laptop doesn’t follow suit – at least when it comes to resolution. It’ll arrive with a 13.5in, Full HD display. It does have a 3:2 aspect ratio, though – which means you’ll be able to squeeze two documents side-by-side for easier multitasking. The lower resolution won’t put as big a strain on the battery, either, so you’ll be able to go for longer between top-ups. The shining star is the touch-sensitive layer, which lets you scribble onscreen with a stylus – or Microsoft’s own Surface Pen. 6) THE PRICE IS TOO DAMN HIGH The Surface Laptop is supposed to be for students, right? It was revealed at Microsoft’s education event, after all. It runs Windows 10 S, too, which is supposed to let teachers keep their pupils under control while they’re teaching at the front of the class. Why then, does it start at an eye-watering US$999? Essentially, it’s because Microsoft has priced it to compete with Apple’s MacBook Air. It matches or exceeds Apple’s cheapest laptop for power, portability, battery life and design. It’s built to an exceptional standard, with hard-wearing materials that are supposed to last from your first day at college right up until graduation, so over a few years, that price doesn’t look so bad. But still, that’s a big price tag if you’re only working weekends at the local McDonalds drive-thru. If the price doesn’t put you off, you can pre-order a Surface Laptop right now, with models starting to ship on the 15th of June.

Many experts had speculated that the phone was to be released last year. However, the Microsoft event has come and gone and still the Surface Phone is nowhere to be found. It has been more than a year since the first news of the Windows phone replacement surfaced the Internet. For a long time now, Windows and Microsoft fans have been fantasizing its release and there have been a lot of supposed leaks for the phone. Surface Phone as Windows Phone replacement A recent SEC filing from Microsoft seems to suggest that the company is finally done with Windows Phone. In fact, the said government filing revealed that the company only generated five million dollars in revenue for anything phone related. This is a stark contrast from the same quarter of the previous year of $735 million. Because of Microsoft’s failed attempts to revamp the Windows Phone line, the company has already written the product off for its upcoming quarter report. Amy Hood, Microsoft’s CFO, even sort of eulogized the said phone and said that the company is not expecting any revenue from mobile sales in the coming months. Nokia Lumia Window Phone (via microsoft.com) To anyone expecting to see the Surface Phone later this year, these pronouncements may seem ominous. For one, the company has already accepted the fact that it will not be selling any mobile device for some months. Secondly, the recent decline in Surface product sales is also somewhat alarming. Compared to the previous quarter, Microsoft’s sales on laptops and tablets fell by 25 percent. This probably has something to do with Microsoft being behind the tech curve when it comes to releasing products equipped with the new Kaby Lake processors. On the subject of Surface Phone, Microsoft did not, however, confirm nor deny anything about its cessation. In fact, the topic was left open ended. What Microsoft said on the legal document is that it will still continue investing in future research and development. Only the bit where the Windows Phone was mentioned on the second quarter of 2017 was omitted on the third quarter. Surface Phone specs For now, the reports about the Surface Phone specifications are varied. Initial reports suggest that the phone will have a Snapdragon 835 on board. There was even a report saying that it might feature a full-fledged Intel Mobile processor. However, the consensus right now is with the Qualcomm-made ARM chip. As for the memory, there are various reports last year that suggest the Surface Phone will come in three different memory variants. The entry-level version will have 4GB of RAM and 6GB for the developer’s edition. On the other hand, the enterprise edition of the phone is said to carry as much as 8GB of RAM. Unfortunately, there are no solid proofs to validate these claims apart from the fact that Microsoft has already ported the Windows 10 operating system to run on a Snapdragon chip. Windows 10 and Snapdragon There is no denying that the efforts Microsoft is putting on the Windows 10 operating system will soon be a game changer. The news already garnered a lot of interest especially to Surface tablet fans. This is due to the fact that during the Microsoft presentation in China last year, the company has demoed a tablet running on a Snapdragon 821 chip. Since the Windows 10 on a Snapdragon chip is not really that far off, there are more circumstantial evidence that the Surface Phone might indeed sport a Snapdragon 835 chip. For a premium Microsoft phone, there is very little merit in having a subpar processor to power its needs. Surface Phone design For months now, the rumor mill about the Surface Phone has been going on. Many images have been leaked pertaining to the actual design of the phone. Some details even go as far as saying the the Surface Phone will sport a foldable OLED display. These rumors were probably brought about by the recent patent filing from Microsoft detailing the design of a foldable mobile device. Unfortunately, that is just what it is, a patent filing. There is no concrete evidence that the company is indeed working on the said design at the moment. Redstone 3 and supposed release date For now, most dates for the supposed release of the Surface Phone point to sometime before the end of 2017. As to when that exactly is, the answers are varied. Some experts believe that Microsoft could possibly unveil the new mobile device in October. This prediction is based on rumors that Microsoft is due to release Redstone 3 during the same month. According to Windows Central, Windows 10 Redstone 3 will introduce a whole plethora of changes on the operating system. One of these supposed changes has a lot to do with Microsoft’s efforts in porting the operating system to ARM ecosystem. As mentioned, Microsoft has already demoed the ARM version of Windows 10. It was done during the last Windows Hardware Engineers Conference in China. In addition to this, there is also that much talked about Project NEON which will bring in fluidity and a bit of flair to the user interface. Project NEON (via mspoweruser.com) Ultimate mobile device With all of these, it may seem that Microsoft is not really in a hurry to release the Surface Phone. One of the tell tale signs is the statement that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella left out back in 2016. According to Nadella, he does not want Microsoft to simply compete with major market players with standard off-the-shelf products. Instead, he envisions that company to develop and release the ultimate mobile device for the consumers. There is still no telling on when the Surface Phone will be out in the market. Microsoft has indeed put a lot of efforts in keeping all the information pertaining to the phone within the company. Perhaps the only thing that can be done now is to wait and see as to what Microsoft has in store for its customers.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Facelifted Tizen OS to Debut with Samsung Galaxy Z4 May 3, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Amazon to Pull Wires Off Android App Program Underground Facebook’s Lite Version of Messenger Gets Global Roll Out Samsung is still pursuing its efforts to expand its in-house multipurpose OS, Tizen, to more devices. As a result, the OS has now undergone a noticeable overhaul with expanded supported for multiple features. Not just that, Samsung is also reported to be lining up a new addition to its Tizen range of smartphones in the form of Galaxy Z4 smartphone, which will mark the debut of Tizen v 3.0. Tizen 3.0 arrives with improved performances in various departments, thanks to the support for new APIs by the OS. On the GPU front, the OS now supports the API Vulkan graphics from Khoronos that will considerably improve the gaming experience inside the Tizen ecosystem. Samsung is also upping the internet browsing experience in Tizen with the newly introduced open-source web runtime Crosswalk. Apart from that, the latest version also comes with the ability to offer support for 64-bit Intel and ARM CPUs. Samsung has also tightened the security with the latest version, with the previous version being reported previously to have packed over 40 never-before-seen exploits. Multiple user profiles can now be set on a single device, and S Voice too gets a jump with the support for voice control in Tizen 3. However, not all of these features can be enjoyed in Samsung Galaxy Z4 despite the device being earmarked for the revamped OS. That’s because Samsung is offering only a base variant smartphone in the form of Z4 so as to expand its reach to wider category. However, it will come with the improved GPU support. On the hardware side, the Galaxy Z4 will be packing a RAM of 1GB that will be paired with an internal storage of 8 GB. The device will have support for 4G LTE along with dual-SIM slots, and it will be featuring a battery of 2050 mAh capacity. The front-facing camera will feature an LED flash, although the pixel counts of the camera setup is yet to be out. Samsung has setup an aim of having Tizen OS installed on over ten million devices by the year end, and the upgrade comes as the first step in that direction. It needs to be seen now whether the OS will be able to catchup with Android and iOS in terms of app availability and basic usability.

By Paul Krill Editor at Large, InfoWorld | May 2, 2017 3:00 AM PT Credit: Shutterstock More like this JVM performance optimization, Part 2: Compilers JVM performance optimization, Part 1: A JVM technology primer MIT-Stanford project uses LLVM to break big data bottlenecks Azul Systems looks to up Java performance with the introduction of Falcon, a just-in-time compiler to be featured in the company's Zing Java runtime. Based on the LLVM compiler platform, designed for server workloads, and optimized for recent Intel and AMD architectures, Falcon bests Oracle's HotSpot Java platform by anywhere from 5 to 250 percent in production performance, depending on the application, according to Azul. It becomes the default compiler in the 17.03 release of Zing, which also features the Zing C4 garbage collector. Falcon is the first new compiler introduced into a JVM in more than 15 years, Azul CEO Scott Sellers said. About four years ago, the company had began pondering how to take the next step in terms of compiler technology and performance; it concluded LLVM was the most modern and most supported infrastructure. With Falcon, Azul becomes the first to use LLVM in a production Java runtime. The company has enhanced LLVM with such capabilities as the ability to provide JIT code replacement and de-optimization. Sellers sees enterprises with applications where performance matters as benefiting from Falcon, including large e-commerce and websites, transaction systems, fraud detection and trading platforms, and risk applications in banks. Azul believes LLVM will offer long-term advantage because its modern compiler infrastructure allows for rapid improvements and optimizations in languages like Swift and Rust. This story, "Azul introduces LLVM compiler to Java runtime" was originally published by InfoWorld.

Now, education. By Rene Ritchie Tuesday, May 2, 2017 at 11:43 am EDT 55 Comments Rene Ritchie has been covering the personal technology industry for almost a decade. Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. What do Microsoft's Windows S and Surface Laptop mean for Apple in the education market? Microsoft is holding an education event today, complete with a new version of Windows and a new Surface. Windows S is a simpler, more secure version aimed at students, while Surface Laptop is Microsoft's ultrabook for education. Windows 10 S is Microsoft's newest edition of Windows 10, with one specific change over previous, "normal" editions of Windows 10. This new edition of Windows 10 is locked to the Windows Store for all your apps and games, meaning if you want to install apps on Windows 10 S, you can only do so if said apps are available in the Store to begin with. Makes it sound almost like iOS, where you lose online sources for apps but gain the trust that comes from a single on-device storefront. Interestingly, if Windows S ever becomes a constraint, you'll be able to upgrade it to Windows Pro. On Mac, you can get similar functionality by turning Gatekeeper all the way up, the adjusting it back down if/when needed. The Surface Laptop appears to be built for higher-education students and professionals who don't need the form factor of a Surface Pro or Surface Book. Sporting a more typical laptop clamshell design, with multiple color options including Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt Blue and Graphite Gold. It's a 13.5-inch PixelSense display, meaning this screen will look crisp and clear much like on any other Surface product. The colors are fun, much like gold and rose gold on MacBook. The processors are Intel's Kaby Lake, which is more recent than Apple's last Skylake update, and core i5 rather than the more anemic coreM. (Which cry every time they see the Apple A9 in iPad Pro.) The lowest end model starts at $999, which is 11-inch MacBook Air territory, though it sports a Retina-style display, which the Air does not. Last time, we saw Microsoft take aim at Apple's traditional pro market with Windows Creative and the Surface Studio. Now Microsoft is taking aim not just at Apple in education, but Google and no-cost ChromeOS and low-cost Chrome Books as well. As Apple has driven increasingly mainstream with iOS and the Mac, both pro and education have been stretched thinner and left to languish longer. Apple has already announced a new Mac Pro will be coming, but not this year. It remains to be seen when Kabylake updates for iMac, MacBook Pro, and MacBook — and anything for Mac mini — come our way. It'll take more than just new chipsets to really recapture the hearts and minds, and budgets, of Apple's traditional niche markets, though. It'll take Apple figuring out a way to scale so it can meet the needs of its new mainstream market without leaving pros and education, among others, behind. It's slightly more complicated for Apple, though. Unlike Microsoft, Apple has a flourishing mobile operating system, as well, in iOS. Plus, iPad did just get updated to a new, more-affordable-than-ever model and a partnership with Logitech to provide discount keyboards at volume for schools. If handled wrong, that story becomes confusing. If handled right, though, iPad and Mac liberate each other to excel at opposite ends of the spectrum, and with some overlap in between. If iOS 11 brings iPad forward the same way iOS 9 did, we might have part of our answer. WWDC 2017 in June, which is often but not always a software-only affair, seems like the next opening for iOS and macOS devices both. What will Apple do with it? And what would you want to see them do? Reader comments Last time, Microsoft targeted Apple's creatives. Now, education. 55 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating Emeroid I’ll take the Windows offering pls. iOS is too restrictive. 0 1 day ago Reply mvpilot172 Windows 10S sounds pretty restricted, like trying to be a chromeOS competitor. Might be an ok OS if their store is robust enough. Most consumer don't need "open" OS's and usually get themselves infected by some malware/virus in trying to circumvent built in protections to get stolen software/music/movies/etc for free. 0 1 day ago Reply Emeroid Yes, but you have the choice to upgrade. The choice. 0 1 day ago Reply Ziich47 For free!! 0 2 hours ago Reply Benyamin Adriyan Just to remember last time I used Windows Laptop & started thinking "For how long I keep worry about virus while doing my work?" That's my momentum to start using OSX at that time (macOS now). 0 1 day ago Reply Emeroid I use Windows everyday and never think that, (Win 10 is a completely different prospect from Windows of old), furthermore if your attitude is that OSX is invulnerable you are exactly the kind of person that malware writers will be targeting. 0 1 day ago Reply DannyJJK macOS used a UNIX-based OS, and many parts have been completely re-written to ensure security stays at a high level. Windows on the other hand has many older parts that still exist in the OS and is known to suffer more from security holes than other OS's. Of course macOS can still get malware, but you're still a lot safer 0 22 hours ago Reply ExcaliburII Is that why year after year the macOS is the first to be cracked? I would definitely feel safer with this:) 0 12 hours ago Reply DannyJJK Do you have proof for this? I've never heard about macOS being the first to be cracked, that's usually Windows 0 11 hours ago Reply Mike Majeski I think they need to get the 12" Macbook down to the $999 price point - $1300 is simply too expensive for what you get and you might as well go for the Pro. Only "affordable" option right now is the Macbook Air ($999, but usually can be found between $799-849) but that is starting to REALLY show its age and the screen is embarrassing at this point. You might still be able to sell K-12 schools on iPads, but I don't think there are any college students going off to school with only an iPad Pro. And for many of those students, $999 is the perfect price point for a high-quality PC that will last all 4 years. 0 1 day ago Reply DannyJJK Depends what those college students are studying, something like linguistics could be done fine on an iPad 0 1 day ago Reply aBadInfuence I'm a college student exclusively using my iPad Pro. My roommate has a trash can Mac Pro so if I absolutely need a PC I jump on his, but it's pretty rare. Most of the time my iPad does every thing I need it to. 0 1 day ago Reply returnmyjedi So basically the best thing to do is to buy an ipad and acquire a roommate with a proper computer? Swell! 0 1 day ago Reply DannyJJK You completely glazed over his comment; he doesn't need his roommate's Mac Pro, it's there as a fallback but not necessary at all 0 22 hours ago Reply cmdacos Many students are just Facebook Pros and Snapchat Pros so iPad Pro will be just fine for them. Otherwise get a laptop/MacBook if you want to do anything serious. Posted via the iMore App for Android 0 1 day ago Reply DannyJJK An iPad is capable of doing many serious tasks, of course it depends on what you're studying as to the programs you need to use. 0 22 hours ago Reply quakerotis All this hype and this is all they delivered? Microsoft is clueless. Apple will be more clueless if they don't respond with an off the shelf product a t a reduced price. 0 1 day ago Reply VAVA Mk2 Really? Please explain. 0 1 day ago Reply jkeitz Its hard to imagine this will lure anyone away from iPad or Macbook. Maybe if they were sub $400 they would do well against the Chromebook market, but at $1000? 0 1 day ago Reply Lych From a MacBook? Probably not if they already have one. Otherwise if you're looking at specs, this one seems better. As for the iPad, realistically that's not really an alternative. I would pick any laptop with a decent resolution and decent spec-sheet over an iPad for school work any day. The iPad lacks a keyboard and their storage options are lacking as well. As capable a device the iPad is, the college daily driver is just not a viable use-case without workarounds and additional investments with it. Your mileage may vary, but I have never seen anyone use an iPad in education as their only device. 0 1 day ago Reply DannyJJK The iPad could easily be used as the only-device in education, although it depends what you're studying. Documents/general work will easily fit on 32GB, plus many people use cloud services to keep their work backed up too. You can easily get a cheap keyboard for the iPad 0 1 day ago Reply Emeroid It could……….depending on………. WTF?? That’s an odd statement. My Mac could be the only computer I ever need depending on if I need a PC. See how ridiculous that is? 0 23 hours ago Reply DannyJJK I mean that there are plenty of students who could use just an iPad for their education, e.g. someone studying linguistics. Obviously the iPad is limited in some areas, and it wouldn't work for someone who is doing programming, but there are plenty of subjects that it works fine for 0 22 hours ago Reply infinihertz Microsoft's partners like Acer just announced, concurrent with this morning's event, $300 laptops with Windows 10 S. Microsoft is deliberately keeping Surface as a higher-priced, lower-volume brand to keep their OEM partners happy but still prod them in the right direction. If they launched at < $400 I'm not sure they'd have a bunch of partners. Now they can sell some of these laptops, and try to fight ChromeOS, iOS and macOS in education with cheap(er) partner devices. I think that was probably the right strategy. 0 1 day ago Reply Ziich47 This is meant to be a reference device. Remember the Chromebook pixel? its kinda like that 0 2 hours ago Reply centosguy You might wish to tell the full history. Yes, Apple dominated the education market in the 80s and early 90s. The Apple II also dominated computer video gaming in that same era. The reason for this was because at the time, the "personal computing" scene was IBM and Apple. IBM - being International BUSINESS Machines - regarded computing to be the province of enterprises, research and on-the-go elite professionals and felt that everything else was an unsustainable fad. That left Apple to focus on "everything else." Then Microsoft and the clone hardware makers, they began to focus on "everything else" too .... Microsoft to increase market share and the clone makers because at the time they could not compete directly with IBM. When that happened, Wintel surpassed Apple in education, video games and even - in terms of raw numbers if not reputation - among creatives. So it is not Microsoft "going after" anything. It is their coming out with new products in a realm where - while Apple may enjoy the reputation (though mostly among Apple fans) - they have had the vast majority of the market share and profits for a quarter of a century. The vast majority of schools buy Windows laptops - or did until the Chromebook - and it is what the vast amount of students own too. For goodness sakes <b>Mac has 10% market share!</b> So the idea that it was the platform of choice for most schools and students - or even most creatives when we are talking about raw numbers here - was self deception. 0 1 day ago Reply returnmyjedi I'm puzzled as to why Rene has neglected to mention the utter car crash that was the eMac. This abomination was the one of the primary reasons why the secondary school and technical college near me abandoned Apple for Windows and Chromebooks. 0 1 day ago Reply Anthony Hernandez7 I think that as of right now Microsoft is beating Apple in computing. If windows can only find out how to make the OS important on phones. It could destroy apple and android. 0 1 day ago Reply DannyJJK The only reason Windows is "important" on desktops is because they got in there early and the only competition they had at the time was the Mac. macOS and Linux are far better OS's than Windows at their core, much more stable, secure and optimized. I got a small netbook for free, that came with Windows 7. The poor thing could barely run Windows, I went and put Linux on it and the thing ran like a dream. I doubt Windows will ever be important on phones, that will always belong to iOS and Android from now on 0 1 day ago Reply cmdacos Microsoft is killing Apple right now on delivering to a target market whether it be Pros/Creatives or in education. Like the new focus from MS to be more aggressive. Posted via the iMore App for Android 0 1 day ago Reply Anthony Hernandez7 Plus these laptops are more powerful that the MacBook 0 1 day ago Reply Nocticis You have to levels of education sectors, Elementary and secondary. With elementary it's about affordablity and durability. Chromebooks has this sector and there is any competition. Apples $300 iPad is still to pricy and add on a keyboard that can be lost when detached is a no go. Same with Microsoft, they don't offer anything that can handle 1st graders Tiny destructive hands at a price point of $150 like chromebooks do. They're not built to be pretty or anything just built to connect to internet and don't care if they feel cheap or plastic. The secondary level of education is really up to the student and their workload. Honestly windows Or macOS will and really comes down to preference and price, where $1000 seems to be the sweet spot. Apple has the "brand" advantage over windows. But by no means can an iPad Pro replace and laptop as of right not. Microsoft could be on to something with the surfaces, but the branding and marketing can't really crack it. Apple is relying on it brand name more than ever and really needs to deliver something to back it up soon. I'm a student and the iPad can't do what I need. A lot of my online classes tell me I cant use my iPad because of lack of flash support or I still need a USB port for transferring information and need to remember to carry adapters. No mouse support. I know about the touch generation and I am one but the education sector is still behind on technology and I need things like a mouse and USB, things that are standard on my Mac. I laugh at the iPad Pro commercials about being a laptop replacement with the added bonus of having cellular. Look. Maybe typing up an paper or reading email could be done on an iPad with ease and could be more suited for a "computer" for a soccer mom, but at school the iPad just doesn't work for me. It's not just the hardware but also the software. iOS can't hack it at some things and that's why the MacBook or even the MacBook Air would be more valuable to a student over a decked out iPad Pro. As of now the iPad is just a toy. That I watch Netflix on after class in bed and don't want a Mac sitting on top of me but don't want to squint my eyes at my iPhone. I'd love to see some sort of hybrid between my MacBook and iPad though like the surface and think Apple is working their way there, but just milking it right now until they figure out the perfect hardware and software for said device. If I was asked on my opinion on what to buy, I'd ask them about what they do. If you're a student or have a job where you need to work from a "computer" I'd say spend the $1000 on a MacBook/iMac depending on further questions into the nature of said schooling and or work. If you're not in school and don't really do a lot of your daily work from a "computer" I'd suggest an iPad, in which I'd then ask questions on what you want/need. Smart connector is nice, but Bluetooth keyboards get the job done. Pencil is neich. However best bang for the buck to me is the 9.7 pro. More so because of the speakers than anything else and if you do ever need/want the pencil it's compatible. 0 1 day ago Reply Emeroid I’d agree with this. If an iPad can replace your computer you never needed a PC, (or Mac), in the first place. 0 23 hours ago Reply DannyJJK "A lot of my online classes tell me I cant use my iPad because of lack of flash support" Well in that case I can't use my Mac either. Yeah I can install the horrible mess that is Flash onto my Mac or use the Chrome sandboxed-but-still-not-safe version, however I value my security and don't wish to use technology that is full of security holes, older than the hills and will drain my MacBooks battery in 5 seconds. "or I still need a USB port for transferring information and need to remember to carry adapters" You can't use an iPad because you struggle to remember things? What kind of reason is that? "No mouse support. I know about the touch generation and I am one but the education sector is still behind on technology and I need things like a mouse and USB, things that are standard on my Mac." No you don't, unless you're talking about Flash (which is just repeating the first point). All non-flash websites work fine on the touch screen. 0 22 hours ago Reply Nocticis I think you'd be surprised at how many people use chrome one there mac, over safari, while at the same time use safari over chrome on their iPad/iPhone. Mouse support is still very much needed and used and at more intuitive that having to use a finger. All this can be fixed though. Give me an iPad with just one USB-C that's used for charging and transferring of data. Build a keyboard with trackpad and allow coding. Swift playgrounds isn't ideal and something a light as Python still need more power. Allow Xcode to exist on the Pro end I have classes where I need to not only turn in a USB with my project but also plug it up to a projector. A dongle can be forgotten or misplaced compared to a Mac where that's less likely to be forgotten and has the USB built in. 0 14 hours ago Reply DannyJJK I've nothing wrong with people using Chrome, but even Chrome is trying to get rid of Flash: https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/9/13903878/google-chrome-block-flash-html5 Mouse support will never happen on the iPad, it's a device that's supposed to be controlled by the touchscreen and Safari on iPhone has allowed web pages to work fine with touchscreen since day 1 of the first iPhone. I would like to see USB-C on the iPhone and iPad, that I agree with. Allowing coding is definitely something that needs to happen too but there won't be a trackpad. Your suggestions are good but mouse support won't happen, and Flash is going away on desktop as well 0 11 hours ago Reply Nocticis Right. Flash is on it's way out, but a lot of education classes still use it. Heck I have two right now. First thing that popped up when starting my online class, literally said "iPads not supported." I don't see why a track pad of some sort can't exist. The Mac is going Touch. I bet the Force track pad becomes the next touch bar with pencil support. In that case why not have it for iPad? If your hands are resting on a keyboard it's more intuitive to navigate from there 0 2 hours ago Reply sdreamer Remember they went after creatives, and just delivered the Studio. what happened with that? Nothing really. The Creators update was more of a SP1 type of update that just had fixes, and ooooh 3D paint. Nothing else that leverages creators or professionals. In the the end, I hate to say it as I love the Surface Studio, but the Surface Studio is just kinda gimmicky and restricted. Inspirational yes, but usable? Not really. Needs better horse power to drive pro apps at that resolution, and it needs pro apps in its store. 0 1 day ago Reply DannyJJK All hype and advertising :) 0 22 hours ago Reply Richard Schembri Sounds like Windows RT all over again. Who's going to pay $999 for a Chromebook competitor, not many people. Give me an iPad and a MacBook anytime!! 0 1 day ago Reply cmdacos Really $3000 in product is better than a $1000 product? Shocking... Posted via the iMore App for Android 0 1 day ago Reply DannyJJK I think he was getting to the fact that Windows S is a gimped OS and you could get a computer with full Windows for the same price 0 22 hours ago Reply Nocticis Right but Rene has also failed to mentioned is for an additional $50 that you can pay at anytime, unlocks the "s" and gives you all of W10. Seems like that could be a good investment down the road. Use the S in school and when you get a job, unlock it for $50. 0 13 hours ago Reply Emeroid Up and down voting on iMore.com seems to be broken these days, or is it just me? 0 23 hours ago Reply DannyJJK Yep it's broken, I assume they're still doing changes to the website as some parts of the design are still in blue whereas they should be yellow now 0 22 hours ago Reply jayzero76 macbook/ ipad is not what the young generation wants. see it on my kids and there friends. was thinking to give them an ipad for christmas and they told me they did not want it because nothing they can do with it. prefered a galaxy note 4. FINALLY AN UPGRADE FROM THERE STUPID IPHONE. talking to other parents that kids are looking more and more in GOOGLE than we think is all about youtube and snapchat. thats the thing apple needs to learn because people wont be able to spend 1300$ for a macbook but 600 for a laptop that is even better (SD card, USB ports...) 0 16 hours ago Reply Richard Schembri This will not be very popular as Microsofts technical support is always terrible, the last time that I had an issue with Windows it took 3 calls and approximately 5 hours of my time to sort it out, also when setting up a business I had various questions for Microsoft regarding Office 365 several calls later still did not get a correct answer and had to sort it out by trial and error, when calling Apple always get the issues sorted out in one quick phone call, teachers and school IT departments don't have the time to sort out all these issues so don't think that this will be very popular in the educational market. 0 16 hours ago Reply quakerotis The new Surface laptop is, well; an average laptop at an inflated price. $999 gets 4GB RAM, minuscule SSD. An operationally equivalent to the current macbook Air will set you back $1299.. You also get to use Bing and Edge only, unless you pay the $50 OS upgrade fee. what a scam. BTW- Microsoft sold 15K Surface Studios. That's really taking over the design world, isn't it? 0 15 hours ago Reply Steve Adams That's 15,000 people who weren't duped by apples imac. 0 13 hours ago Reply DannyJJK Only use Bing and Edge? Hah, can't wait for the monopoly lawsuits to come back again… 0 11 hours ago Reply returnmyjedi It's not quite the same. The search engine can be changed from defaulting to Bing, and the option is there for Google to add their search and Chrome apps to the Windows Store should they wish to. If there's a monopoly lawsuit that should be raised then it should be against Apple for not allowing alternative default browsers on iOS. 0 11 hours ago Reply DannyJJK You're not allowed to set them as default, but you can use them, and they're easily available. I'm sure Apple will allow default apps on iOS soon, especially given that you can now "hide" the Apple built-in ones 0 11 hours ago Reply returnmyjedi I hope they do. The stock mail app is basic compared to others available, and Safari on iOS is far less compliant with Web standards than Chrome for Android is. 0 9 hours ago Reply Steve Adams Free upgrades until Jan 2018. 0 13 hours ago Reply Jorge1170x Nice hardware, but I feel like nobody under 25 will ever voluntarily buy a Windows machine again. Some today still "grin and bear it" if they NEED to use Windows to type out college reports, etc, and others voluntarily suffer through the learning curve since it's the ONLY way to get to the high-end PC Games they want to play (currently the case), but I can vouch that the "way" we interact with Windows, constantly, and very precisely single-clicking, double-clicking, right-clicking looks ancient to youngsters. As soon as there is another affordable, viable, pleasant (Non-Mac) way to "coffee-shop laptop", which I can only assume will be when iOS-Desktop Edition and Android Desktop Edition are mature and widespread, they will abandon Windows in a heartbeat. IMHO Samsung should take advantage of this chasm and release their DeX OS (Windowed Android) on $200-300 laptop and market it as the "Windows" that can Snapchat...now THAT would have legs. 0 8 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Most Popular By Eric Limer May 2, 2017 Today at an event in New York, Microsoft announced the newest product in its Surface line. It's not a crazy transforming laptop, or a giant high-end touchscreen desktop. The new Surface Laptop is something a little simpler. It's just a laptop. Under three pounds with a 13.5-inch, 3:2 display, the Surface Laptop is ostensibly a laptop for students, but with far more fit and finish than a typical Chromebook. Available in four different colors, the Surface Laptop has a soft, felt lining around its keyboard and a nice metallic body that feels sturdy without being heavy. Unlike its transforming brethren, there's nothing particularly crazy about its design. In fact, it's feels and looks an awful lot like a Macbook Air or the new Macbook Pro (the one without the Touchbar) but in Microsoft's signature Surface style: angular and slick. The Surface Laptop starts at $1,000, with that cheapest version sporting Intel's Core i5 processor. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Popular Instead of full Windows 10, the Surface Laptop comes with a free copy of the new Windows 10 S, a barebones version of Windows designed for use in an education setting. Windows 10 S only runs applications from the Windows store, giving it a closed ecosystem that makes it almost more like an iPad. Or, like the Surface RT, Microsoft's failed attempt to make this same sort of gadget a few years ago. Ostensibly, this keeps you safe because any app that's available through the Microsoft store has been vetted for security, but it eliminates thousands of programs that are perfectly safe but not in the app store for other reasons. This move does have actual security advantages, but the much bigger advantage is for Microsoft, not the users—this gives software makers an incentive to make their programs available in the Microsoft Store, where Microsoft will get a cut of sales. For the average user, any benefit in security is bound to be outweighed by the hassle of not being able to use all programs out of the box. Google Chrome, for instance, is currently missing from the Microsoft Store. Fortunately, Windows 10 S also includes the option to be switched over to Windows 10 Pro by an administrator in a classroom setting, or by its owner in the case of a Surface Laptop owner. So there's a full, unfettered version of Windows hiding behind the scenes. For schools, this flip will be free, but for normal students or anyone else who's picked up the Surface Laptop, that upgrade will cost you. At this point, there are enough apps available in the Microsoft Store that using Windows 10 S exclusively might be feasible, but it's certainly not ideal. Thousands of programs—specifically smaller indie applications and many, many video games—are not available in the store. Without an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, the Surface Laptop will, in essence, have one hand behind its back. If you're considering picking one up, it might be wise to just add the cost to untie it to the upfront price, chances are you'll want to.

NuTonomy's software, sensors and computing platforms will be installed in Peugeot 3008 models as part of plans to develop the technology needed for large fleets of autonomous cars, PSA and nuTonomy said in a statement on Wednesday. The latest PSA Group project seeks to work on "level 5" autonomous capable vehicles, which require no driver input, and will allow both companies to study how an "on-demand autonomous vehicle mobility service" performs, they said. The combination is the latest between technology and automotive companies after Daimler, which owns Mercedes-Benz, last month unveiled an autonomous cars development partnership with supplier Robert Bosch, while BMW has announced an alliance with chip maker Intel and Israel's Mobileye . Autonomous driving in urban areas requires a more radical approach to vehicle design, particularly for software and sensors, to help a car navigate inner city obstacles, said Anne Laliron, Head of the Business Lab at PSA Group. "That is the reason we jump on the opportunity to work with nuTonomy," Laliron told Reuters. PSA Group will use the project to learn about what components make sense, and which suppliers are available, Laliron said. Following the initial phase of this partnership, the companies will consider expanding their on-road AV testing initiative to other major cities. nuTonomy, a software company founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) academics and McKinsey management consultants was the first to begin on the road testing of driverless taxi services in Singapore last year. It raised $16 million last May in a funding round led by Highland Capital Partners and has backing from Singapore government authorities and Samsung Ventures, among others.

Anthony Caruana May 3, 2017, 12:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories microsoft windows 10 windows 10 s Share Source: Microsoft Earlier today, Microsoft announced a new Windows PC. Unlike the previous members of the Surface family, the Surface Laptop doesn’t have a detachable keyboard. And it also lacks Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro. Instead, it ships with a cutback version of Windows dubbed Windows 10 S. That means a Surface laptop will be limited to only running apps available through the Windows Store and not desktop apps. What makes this confusing is that an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro is free - for a limited time at least. When the original Surface was released, users had the choice of a heavier, more powerful and more expensive Surface device or the Surface RT, which ran a limited version of Windows 8. Where it differs from Windows 10 S is that Windows RT was made to run on 32-Bit ARM processors whereas Windows 10 S plays nice on the Intel CPUs that power the vast majority of the computers businesses use. It’s clear Microsoft is undergoing a transformation. Slowly but surely, they are moving away from a software company that dabbled in hardware into a more vertically integrated business that delivers the whole widget. In a sense, they are a little like Apple except that they license their operating system software. The Surface Laptop seems to be aimed directly at potential Chromebook and entry-level MacBook Air and MacBook Pro markets. That’s a sweet spot for education users. I can see this as being the kind of device my kids would use for high school and university. It’s inexpensive at US$999, offers decent specs with a Core i5 processor, 4GB of memory and 128GB SSD, and comes in a different colours. It supports the Surface Pen on the 13.5” PixelSense display running at 2256 x 1504. For Australian buyers, there’s no word yet on offical price and availability - just a bunch of “Coming Soon” tags on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/surface/devices/surface-laptop/tech-specs"Surface Laptop website. And The Verge reports that other OEMs have already announced their own Windows 10 S systems. But here’s the thing. That target audience will, almost certainly, want to run desktop apps. I’m hard pressed to think of a scenario where someone buying a $1000 laptop won’t want to run Microsoft office or something similar. Sure - you can run those through a web browser if you’re a Office 365 subscriber but until you upgrade from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro you’re shut out for the apps most people rely on to do their jobs - whether they are students or employees. The good news is that, unlike the dead-end road of Windows RT, there’s an upgrade path from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro. For US$49, you can upgrade from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro (but not Home). And that upgrade is free for the first few weeks of the US release. The good news is Windows 10 S is not a dead-end. The biggest issue with Windows RT devices was that once Microsoft decided to abandon the platform, there were lots of machines left without an upgrade path. As the Surface Laptop runs commodity hardware, I assume it will remain a supported platform for some time. So, the good news is Windows 10 S is not a cock-up. But, the splitting of Windows 10 into a third major fork is a sign that the company is still locked, to some degree, in their old school thinking. When Windows 7 was released, there were six different editions: Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise and Ultimate. By the time we got to Widows 8, that narrowed to four: Windows 8, Pro, Enterprise and the ill-fated RT. And while there are, officially, eight editions of Windows 10, only two are widely available: Home and Pro. Now, with the addition of Windows 10 S, Microsoft is adding complexity that will, most likely, only confuse consumers. There’s a lot to be said for Apple’s approach - one operating system per platform. When you buy a Mac, you get macOS. There is only one version and it doesn’t add or remove features to create artificial product differentiation. For example, BitLocker, Microsoft’s drive encryption tech, is part of Windows 10 Pro but not the Home edition. That makes no sense to me. The error Microsoft is making is one of creating frustration for users. I’ve spent enough time at large retailers asking questions of sales associates who don’t know or understand the difference between the two editions of Windows 10. I can see customers walking into a store, buying a Surface Laptop and Microsoft Office only to discover that running office will require a further $50 or more in order to upgrade the operating system on their $1000 laptop so they can type a document or create a spreadsheet. I’m currently testing a Surface Pro 4 as part of my search for a perfect computer for when I travel. It’s a fine piece of hardware and shows Microsoft can design and build great hardware. But it’s time for them to make life easier and simply release one edition of Windows. Windows 10 S might not be an error of Windows RT proportions but there’s seems little point to artificially differentiating a product and creating confusion for users.

This is the direction we’re headed, according to Larry Smarr, founding director of the California Institute of Telecommunications & Information Technology at UC San Diego. While his expertise lies in computer networks and infrastructure, Smarr has emerged as a de facto leader in quantified health—largely due to his relentless curiosity about his own health. In 2011, Smarr diagnosed his own Crohn’s disease long before he showed any symptoms. Smarr laid out his vision for a looming transformation in healthcare at the recent Xconomy San Diego Forum on the Human Impact of Innovation. The advances making this transformation possible include next-generation genome sequencing (where the cost of sequencing has been dramatically plunging), combined with new biomedical data from a host of sensors and blood tests. Smarr’s work has contributed to a growing realization that the trillions of microbes in the human gut play a crucial role in maintaining human health. In his talk, Smarr dryly noted that the density of information in a fecal sample works out to roughly 1 billion microbes per gram of stool, encompassing a treasure trove of data that can be collected non-invasively every day. (The microbiome collectively contains 3.3 million genes—roughly 100 times more than the 23,000 genes of the human genome.) This massive river of data would overwhelm conventional computing technology, but Smarr said a revolution in machine learning—based on a radically new (non-von Neumann) chip design—is now making it possible to analyze big data streams and monitor human health in unprecedented ways. Google’s first machine-learning chip is 30 times faster than conventional computer processors and graphics processors, Smarr said. As a result, Google and companies like San Diego-based KnuEdge, which is poised to roll out its neural-based AI technology sometime this year, and Intel’s San Diego-based Artificial Intelligence Products Group (headed by former Nervana Systems CEO Naveen Rao) are moving toward the development of what he called “planetary” computers with Web-based AI capabilities. Smarr said the promise of microbiome data as a way to predict chronic disease was demonstrated late last year by scientists at UC San Diego. Using machine learning technology, the team said, they had successfully trained a computer system to tell the difference between a person with a “healthy” intestine from someone with inflammatory bowel disease by analyzing the genetic makeup of the microbes in their gut. Machine learning techniques also are being applied to X-rays and other medical imaging used in medical diagnostics. With such technology, Smarr said, “the worst radiologist with this kind of machine support would be better than the best radiologist without this support.” Following Smarr’s presentation, other luminaries discussed their progress in healthtech: —Jeff Hawkins, vice president for reproductive and genetic health at San Diego-based Illumina (NASDAQ: ILMN), discussed how genome sequencing is being used to analyze fetal DNA in maternal blood samples—providing a more accurate and less-risky replacement for amniocentesis. —Steven Steinhubl, a cardiologist and director of digital medicine at the Scripps Translational Science Institute, gave an overview of a 40-year effort to gather medical and genomic data on 1 million Americans “to better understand what makes each of us unique.” —Clayton Lewis, the co-founder and CEO of Seattle-based Arivale, described how Arivale combines personal genomic and biomedical data with health, nutrition, and fitness “coaching” to help individuals avoid chronic diseases like diabetes. At some point in the future, Lewis said, Arivale will scan individuals for 60 diseases, assess how close they are to the tipping point for each disease, and prepare a plan for treating or reversing disease in a meaningful way. Machine learning was a recurring theme throughout the forum, with Intel’s Urs Köster predicting that AI technology already is transforming healthcare, finance, retailing, transportation, energy, government, and other industries. AI technology also has enabled the robotics technologies behind self-driving vehicles to advance more rapidly than expected, according to Henrik Christensen, director of the Institute for Contextual Robotics at UC San Diego. In a presentation on the roadmap for self-driving cars, Christensen predicted that autonomous, self-driving cars would be driving on U.S. roads by 2025. But significant technology hurdles must still be overcome, including the ability of machine vision systems to “see” through snowstorms and other tough weather conditions. “People are being way too optimistic about self-driving technology, and how quickly it’s going to be in place,” Christensen said. KnuEdge founder and CEO Dan Goldin said he realized a critical need for a new type of machine intelligence while considering a manned mission to Mars during the nine years he led NASA (from 1992 to 2001). The 40-minute lag in communications between the Earth and Mars-bound spacecraft meant “you have no mission control,” Goldin said. After retiring from NASA, Goldin set out to create low-power processing technology that was modeled on the highly efficient neural processes of the human brain. The first KnuEdge chip, built with an older manufacturing technology, features 256 cores—inspired by neuron-like cells—on a single chip. The company, stealthy for more than a decade, said last year it also had developed “LambdaFabric” technology that is ideally suited for massively parallel processing applications. KnuEdge says its fabric, based on neurobiological principles, enables its multicore Hermosa processor to connect to as many as 512,000 other Hermosa processors with a latency (interaction lag) of just 400 nanoseconds. KnuEdge is now preparing to provide cloud-based machine intelligence as a service. As Goldin put it, “We want to enable anyone to provide an AI experience to anyone, anywhere,” and he predicted that San Diego will be at the center of “real machine intelligence” within five years. Asked in an e-mail afterward for an explanation of what he meant by “real machine intelligence,” Goldin declined to elaborate. (Special thanks to Joyce Thorne for providing her notes from the forum.)

Most recently, he served at Xilinx Corporation, the leading worldwide independent provider of FPGA products, and led the marketing of imaging, video and machine learning solutions for Xilinx's industrial, scientific, and medical markets. Business Development The appointment of Robert Beachler positions the Company to capitalize on targeted large addressable markets in artificial intelligence. Mr. Beachler has a proven track record of success in bringing products to market and driving growth. He will build a marketing and business development team in Europe and the United States this year, followed by Asia and Australia in 2018. Mr. Beachler's initial efforts will be to drive revenue growth in markets where the Company has demonstrated success, expand the number of customers in these markets, and introduce the Company's hardware accelerated products to further enhance its position in large-scale deployments. Commercial Surveillance: This market is highlighted by engagements in the gaming industry. The worldwide gaming industry includes approximately 2,600 casinos and over 50,000 gaming tables. In addition to existing deployments, the Company is currently in discussions or trials with 17 casinos including the MGM Group in the United States, the Crown Casino Group in Australia, a Sands China operated casino in Macau and a number of independently operated Native American Tribal casinos including Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, Pechanga in California and Pocono Downs in Pennsylvania. The Company's business model in the gaming industry is based on a fee paid for each active table on a daily basis, thereby creating an ongoing revenue stream from a potentially large and diverse customer base. The Company is in the process of signing another evaluation protocol with the CISCO Innovation Centre of Perth. The CIIC will perform the evaluation of BrainChip's advanced video analytic technologies, aiming at boosting the reliability of access authorization around sensitive areas. This is in addition to the ongoing trials by the CIIC of advanced video analytics for transport safety, which are currently expanding to a national level. Civil Surveillance: The growing threat of terrorism and violent crime is driving demand for real-time video analytics. This is a large and growing market, which includes Homeland Security, Metropolitan Law Enforcement, Airports and Mass Transit.  The market for Civil Surveillance is large, well funded and geographically diverse. The Company serves the challenging requirements for video analytics, including facial and pattern recognition. The Company continues to work closely with the French Department of Homeland Security and Paris municipal law enforcement. Drawing on the success of these relationships, a new trial is set to begin in June with the law enforcement agency in Toulouse, France, which will further inform the Paris municipal law enforcement agency regarding the compelling benefits of the BrainChip video analytic solutions. Additionally, there is another new trial planned in the third quarter of 2017 with the Toulouse passenger rail authority. The Company has opportunities with multiple schools in the United States and is currently in discussions with a school district in the state of New York for a deployment that represents potential revenue of $600,000. The Company has already been selected as their vendor for video analytics and the school district is in a funding process that will enable them to begin deployment. Machine Vision: The desire for highly accurate visual inspection methods is driving demand for artificial intelligence. The Company has partnered with companies such as SAFRAN in Paris, France, which is developing an innovative inspection system for a mission critical manufacturing application. As well, at Airbus in Toulouse, France, the Company has collaborated on a variety of video analytic projects. Other applications include vehicle identification and infrastructure inspection. The Machine Vision market is most notably represented by the automotive industry. As Autonomous Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS) and fully autonomous vehicles become more prevalent the requirements for real-time video analytics become more critical. BrainChip's Spiking Neural Network represents a best-in-class solution for this demanding application. The Company is currently engaged with IniLabs in Switzerland, a developer of DVS cameras that are applicable in autonomous vehicle applications. The Company is also engaged in discussions with Volkswagen. JAST Technology License In March of 2017 the Company acquired an exclusive license to a next-generation neural networking technology developed by CERCO (Brain and Cognition Research Center) in Toulouse, France. The technology has been developed specifically for use with spiking inputs. The advanced Spiking Neural Network and learning rules maximize processing speed while minimizing power consumption. The JAST technology will be implemented on the Company's proprietary SNAP core. This solution will provide compelling advantages in systems where autonomous real-time learning is critical, including but not limited to autonomous vehicles and drones, ADAS and financial technology aimed at improving the speed of trading algorithms. Integration of Spikenet Technologies in an FPGA Platform In March of 2017 The Company made a major achievement by integrating the field proven Spikenet algorithms and software with a hardware core developed specifically for visual applications. The FPGA hardware solution will provide a fast, low-power solution that can run a large number of video streams simultaneously for video analytics including facial and pattern recognition. A multi-core FPGA hardware solution is expected during the second quarter and the Company plans to engage early adopter customers in the third quarter of 2017. The hardware solution will reduce the total cost of ownership in large deployments of surveillance systems and is expected to drive significant revenue growth for the Company. CORPORATE Option and Performance Rights Issue The Company issued 27,100,000 unlisted options during the quarter to newly appointed staff as a part of its incentive program and in order to appropriately align the interests of staff and shareholders. The Company issued 1,500,000 performance rights to Robert Beachler as part of his appointment, which vest subject to various time and performance based hurdles. 1,000,000 unlisted options lapsed in accordance with their terms during the quarter. Quarterly Expenditure Expenditures in the quarter were materially higher than in the previous quarter primarily due to staffing in marketing and engineering, and legal and financial expenses associated with the Company's evaluation of domicile and exchange listing. The Company has made no decision as yet on re-domiciling the Company. The Company had approximately $1.9 million in cash at the end of the quarter. The Board is closely monitoring the Company's funding needs and expects to initiate a capital raise to support future cash requirements including continued engineering on the SNAP technology, and staffing in engineering, sales and marketing to further the Company's engagement with customers and support revenue growth.

The device, aptly named Surface Laptop, is indeed not a hybrid like the Surface Book, and is more reasonably priced. According to Microsoft, the 13.5 inch 3:2 display on Surface Laptop is the ever thinnest in a laptop. This and the fact that everything inside the device has been packed super tight means that at .57" and 2.76 lbs it is both thinner and lighter than even the MacBook Air. The display is said to produce 3.4 million pixels so its resolution (2256 x 1504) is around the traditional QHD but with 3:2 aspect ratio differentiates itself from both the widescreen 16:9 or 16:9 (MacBook Air) laptops as well as the old school 4:3 displays. According to Microsoft's own Panos Panay the Surface Laptop is also more powerful than the competition. With Intel's Core i5 and i7 processors Panay claims it is up to 50 percent faster than MacBook Air. With all that power the promised 14.5 hour battery life (with video playback) seems like a good deal, especially considering the weight. The keyboard is surrounded by alcantara fabric that we first saw on Surface Pro 4 keyboard, and Microsoft has managed to retain a respectable 1.5 mm press depth. The computer comes equipped with Windows 10 S, which is Microsoft's new operating system, essentially a lite version, that allows app installs only from the Windows Store. If you want to install programs outside the app store, you need to invest in an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. The laptop has one USB 3.0 port, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, mini DisplayPort connection as well as SurfaceConnection for further connectivity. Microsoft also unveiled the new Surface Arc Mouse which is a new version of the Microsoft Arc Touch mouse from a few years back. Surface Laptop will come in four colors (platinum, burgundy, cobalt blue, and graphite gold) next month. The shipments will begin on June 15th and the prices start at $999 for the Core i5/4GB/128GB version.

The Surface laptop comes in four colors - gold, platinum, blue and burgundy - and ditches a metal area around the keyboard for a softer microfibre lining. It has a 13.5-inch (34.3 centimetre) touch screen, runs the latest Intel processors and gets 14.5 hours of battery life, according to Microsoft. It also will run the new Windows 10S operating system, software the company presented on Tuesday (May 2) that will be faster and offer better security than previous versions. Microsoft is targeting the new operating system and laptop at the education market, where the total value of personal computing device shipments - including desktops, notebooks and tablets - has reached US$15.6 billion, according to research firm IDC. Microsoft and Apple had long dominated the school computing market, but Alphabet Inc's Google has made inroads recently with its low-priced and simple Chromebooks. Windows 10S will be available on cheaper computers targeted at elementary schools where teachers want predictable, easy to maintain and quick-booting machines. Dell, Samsung Electronics and Toshiba, among others, will offer new PCs running Windows 10S from US$229 starting this summer. With the new Surface laptop, Microsoft is hoping to attract college-age buyers who want both a reliable machine and premium design and materials. "We know a lot of students use MacBook Airs and MacBook pros and those are awesome," Panos Panay, vice president for Surface Computing, said at the event. But he said the Surface laptop is lighter and thinner with a longer battery life than any MacBook Air or MacBook Pro on the market today. The new device represents Microsoft's first classic clamshell computer - previous versions were either a tablet or a hybrid tablet/notebook. The base model includes 128GB of storage, 4GB of RAM and runs on an Intel Core i5 processor. More expensive configurations are also available with a faster Intel Core i7 chip, storage capacities up to a terabyte and as much as 16GB of RAM. Core to the new laptop is Windows 10S, which looks and feels like the current operating system but limits the apps users can download to those available only from Microsoft. The company says that extends battery life and makes the laptop faster and more secure.

This allows attackers "to gain control of the manageability features provided by these products," which "means it is possible for hackers to log into a vulnerable computer's hardware – right under the nose of the operating system – and silently tamper with the machine, install virtually undetectable malware, and so on." AMT has direct access to the networking features of your computer, allowing this to be exploited remotely. It is believed that business and server systems will feel the most pain from this as these systems commonly have the impacted features enabled. Intel has published instructions on how to determine if you system has the features enabled, and you should be sure to check your system.

Engineers, acting as ‘safety drivers’, will accompany select commuters in the first phase of the pilot test. By 2019, the company expects to introduce driverless pods in a small, controlled section of Singapore. Later this year, Delphi will reveal plans for similar pilots in American and European cities. (Photo: Sid Quah for Delphi) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE San Jose, Calif. – — Driverless vehicles are cracking open a door in the staid hierarchy of the auto industry, creating new competitors and giving traditional automakers and suppliers the push to redefine their roles. Tier One supplier Delphi Automotive PLC kicked the door in Wednesday with a restructuring that will spin off its powertrain business, enabling the former parts unit of General Motors Corp. to intensify its focus on autonomous vehicle efforts and the technology that supports them. Over the past decade, the once-bankrupt Delphi has worked to reinvent itself, transforming from a maker of low-margin commodity parts to a purveyor of high-margin technology in areas it calls “safe, clean and connected.” Judging by its surging stock price, Wall Street approves. Delphi to spin off powertrain segment The latest move aims to cash in on what is seen as the next frontier in the auto industry: capturing and monetizing Big Data. Connected and autonomous vehicles are expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue, and the race is on to see who can make it work first. Wednesday’s announcement that the company would spin off its Powertrain Systems operation is just the latest step in a process one analyst described as Delphi morphing into a “Tier Zero-point-five” — something between a supplier of parts and an original equipment manufacturer like General Motors or Toyota Motor Corp. Delphi is making the move to better position the company’s two segments working in the driverless and connected vehicle arena — the Electrical/Electronic Architecture and Electronics and Safety divisions — and to create more value for investors. “We’re seeing more technical convergence between the technologies in those two businesses ...,” CEO Kevin Clark said in conference call. “We think we can position those two businesses as separate, stand-alone businesses to accelerate investment in technology and better serve our customers — with the net result, both companies deliver more value to our shareholders.” Over the past two years, Delphi has exited such historical core businesses as thermal, reception systems and mechatronics even as it rolled out a series of partnerships and acquisitions designed to help the company capitalize on data collection. With good reason: research firm McKinsey & Co. last October estimated “the global revenue pool from car data monetization could be as high as $750 billion by 2030.” Coupled with a strong earnings report, Delphi’s latest move is generating positive reaction from analysts. Barclays described Delphi as “best positioned to be the ‘picks and shovels’ supplier of big data solutions to legacy and new OEMs and predicted it would increase focus on the coming big data (opportunity).” Even before the announcement, analysts noted Delphi’s transition toward something new and far more valuable than traditional suppliers. “Now, they are combining a lot of the pieces that they’ve had before, and adding some new pieces ...,” said Sam Abuelsamid at Navigant Research. “They are putting together turnkey systems that OEMs can take and just drop into their vehicles.” Last month, Delphi announced agreements with three companies offering key technologies for its driverless vehicle data collection systems: ■Valens, based in Israel, specializes in high-speed semi-conductors, or “chip-to-chip” technology, producing connectivity speeds six times faster than the current industry standard. ■Rosenberger Hochfrequenztechnik GmbH & Co., based in Germany, specializes in data transmission and ethernet connectors. ■Otonomo, based in Israel, develops marketplaces for the automakers collecting data. Delphi has purchased minority stakes in both Valens and Otonomo, and has struck a strategic partnership with Rosenberger. Previously, Delphi invested in Ottomatika and Quanery to bolster its autonomous portfolio, and acquired Moviemento, Control-Tec, Unwired and MVL to ramp up work in connected vehicles. It’s a shift that may be necessary for companies given looming challenges for the industry. Vehicle sales are expected to plateau in the 2020s, leaving all of the tiers looking to bolster revenues. Changing focus or re-imagining the company may be what is needed to thrive, says David Cole, chairman of the AutoHarvest Foundation. “The parts business is basically a commodity business — brakes, spark plugs, etc.,” he said. “And for lots of traditional suppliers, global suppliers ... that’s a very tough way to be competitive compared to having leading-edge technology that allows you to be something quite unique.” Pressed to describe what Delphi has changed into, Mary Gustanski, Delphi’s vice president of engineering, said: “We are an integrator.” The fruits of Delphi’s investments and efforts were on display Wednesday in San Jose at Intel Corp.’s Innovation Center. The chipmaker is partnering with Delphi and Mobileye NV, which Intel is acquiring for $15.1 billion, on a driverless vehicle system that will be made available to automakers, as a whole or in parts. Among Tier One companies, Delphi is hardly alone in looking for a new place in the hierarchy. Richard Wallace, director of the Transportation Systems Analysis Group a the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, pointed to the March pairing of Bosch and Nvidia on autonomous computing. “I think the end game of this is really interesting,” he said. “If the car doesn’t need a human driver anymore, and artificial intelligence is doing the driving and making the decisions and all of that, then isn’t whoever makes that Nvidia, Delphi, whoever — aren’t they really the centerpiece of the thing, regardless of what it says on the nameplate?” jlynch@detroitnews.com (313) 222-2034 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2p7JJd2 TOP VIDEOS Patterson concerned about job skills gap 2:51 Mayor Mike Duggan on the new Flex-N-Gate facility 0:47 Ken Lingenfelter on his astounding car collection 2:30 IRS agent warns of tax scams 3:28 GM cars hoisted up to the Comerica Park fountain 0:50 Sen.

The bipartisan legislation would provide clear and equal protections under federal law for all Americans in vital areas of life, like employment, access to public spaces, housing, credit, education, jury service, and federally-funded programs. Today, in a majority of U.S. states (31), LGBT people remain at risk of being fired, evicted or denied services because of sexual persecution for who they are. “No person’s fundamental rights should be determined by which side of a state line they live on,” said HRC President Chad Griffin. “The Equality Act will once and for all end the unacceptable patchwork of non-discrimination laws across this country that leaves LGBT people at risk. Every American should have a fair chance to earn a living, provide for their families, and live their lives without fear of discrimination. And at its core, that’s what the Equality Act is all about.” “Not only is discrimination is a real and persistent problem for far too many LGBT Americans, but this morally repugnant behavior is perfectly legal in most places,” said James Devine, a New Jersey Democratic strategist. “Americans have a right to privacy and deserve to be protected from bigotry.” Devine said polling has confirmed that nearly two-thirds of self-identified LGBT Americans report experiencing discrimination — including people like Carter Brown, a transgender man from Texas who lost his job after he was outed by his colleagues. Currently, 50 percent of LGBT Americans live in states where they are at risk of being fired, denied housing, or refused service because of who they are. There is no federal law explicitly protecting LGBT people from discrimination, and 31 states still lack fully-inclusive non-discrimination protections for LGBT people. Today’s announcement included unprecedented support from the business community: 92 major corporations have now joined HRC’s Business Coalition for the Equality Act. While the overwhelming majority of America’s leading businesses have already started addressing workplace fairness for LGBT employees, these major employers know how important the need is for a federal standard that treats all employees the same no matter which state they live in. The slate of companies endorsing the Equality Act have combined operations in all 50 states, headquarters spanning 23 states, and collectively generate $2.6 trillion in revenue. In total, these companies employ more than 5.8 million people across the United States. The overwhelming majority of Americans support full federal equality for LGBT people. Polling released last year by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) found that support for a bill like the Equality Act topped 70 percent nationally, including a majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents. PRRI’s groundbreaking survey included 42,000 interviews in 50 states and found majority support for the Equality Act in all 50 states. The Equality Act is co-sponsored by 241 members of Congress. It was first introduced in 2015 by Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) and by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Cory Booker (D-NJ). Major corporations that have endorsed the Equality Act include Abercrombie & Fitch Co.; Accenture; Adobe Systems Inc.; Advanced Micro Devices Inc.; Airbnb Inc.; Alcoa Inc.; Amazon.com Inc.; American Airlines; American Eagle Outfitters; American Express Global Business Travel; Apple Inc.; Arconic; Automatic Data Processing Inc.; Bank of America; Best Buy Co., Inc.; Biogen; Boehringer Ingelheim USA Corp.; Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.; Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.; Brown-Forman Corp.; CA Technologies Inc.; Caesars Entertainment Corp.; Capital One Financial Corp.; Cardinal Health Inc.; Cargill Inc.; Chevron Corp.; Choice Hotels International Inc.; Cisco Systems Inc.; The Coca-Cola Co.; Corning Inc.; Cox Enterprises; CVS Health Corp.; Darden Restaurants Inc.; Delhaize America Inc.; Diageo North America; The Dow Chemical Co.; Dropbox Inc.; E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (DuPont); eBay; EMC Corp.; Facebook Inc.; Gap Inc.; General Electric Co.; General Mills Inc.; Google Inc.; The Hershey Company; Hewlett Packard Enterprises; Hilton Worldwide Inc.; HP Inc.; HSN Inc.; Hyatt Hotels Corp.; IBM Corp.; Intel Corp.; InterContinental Hotels Group Americas; Johnson & Johnson; JP Morgan Chase & Co.; Kaiser Permanente; Kellogg Co.; Kenneth Cole Productions; Levi Strauss & Co.; Marriott International Inc.; MasterCard Inc.; McGraw Hill Financial; Microsoft Corp.; Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams; Monsanto Co.; Moody’s Corp.; Nike Inc.; Northrop Grumman Corp.; Office Depot Inc.; Oracle Corp.; Orbitz Worldwide Inc.; PepsiCo Inc.; Procter & Gamble Co.; Pure Storage Inc.; Qualcomm Inc.; Replacements Ltd.; Salesforce; SAP America Inc.; Sodexo Inc.; Symantec Corp.; T-Mobile USA Inc.; Target Corp.; Tech Data Corp.; TIAA; Twitter Inc.; Uber Technologies Inc.; Unilever; Warby Parker; Wedding Wire Inc.; Williams-Sonoma Inc.; and Xerox Corp. “Fairness and equality are core American values. But millions of LGBT Americans are still viewed as less than equal in the eyes of the law today,” said Cicilline. “I’m proud to introduce the Equality Act of 2017 with Senator Jeff Merkley. This bill ensures that every LGBT person can live their lives free from the fear of discrimination. Above all, it’s about honoring the values that have guided our nation since its founding. It’s critical that Congress pass the Equality Act into law.” “For far too long, the door of discrimination has been slammed shut on LGBTQ Americans,” added Senator Merkley. “It’s been slammed shut on equality, it’s been slammed shut on opportunity, and this must end. It’s time to have the Equality Act on the floor of the House and the floor of the Senate for a full debate.” “We cannot grow complacent in the quest for equal rights for all.  Every day it is evident that we still have work to do.  Basic constitutional human rights must be protected in every state,” LGBT Equality Caucus Co-Chair Jared Polis said.  “The Equality Act will finally give all LGBTQ Americans protections from discrimination. Equal rights are what sustain us as a unified nation, as the land of the free, and as an example for the entire world.” Despite significant advances, LGBT people across the country remain vulnerable to discrimination on a daily basis and too often have little recourse. With the advent of nationwide marriage equality, in many states, same-sex couples have the right to marry but have no explicit non-discrimination protections. In most states, this means that a same-sex couple could legally marry one day and risk being fired from their jobs, evicted from their apartment, or kicked out of a restaurant the next. The Equality Act ensures that the same protections already extended to other protected classes are equally available to LGBT Americans. It amends existing federal civil rights laws to explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in education, employment, housing, credit, Federal jury service, public accommodations, and the use of Federal funds. In some of these areas, federal law prohibiting sex discrimination has already been properly interpreted by federal courts and administrative agencies to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The Equality Act affirms that understanding of existing law and makes the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity explicit, in order to provide greater clarity to members of the public, employers, schools, businesses and other affected parties. In areas where sex discrimination is not already prohibited, the bill amends existing law to bar discrimination on the basis of sex, as well as sexual orientation, and gender identity. Cicilline, who also led the introduction of the Equality Act of 2015, introduced the proposal today with more co-sponsors than ever before in the U.S. House. Today also marks the first time that the bill is being introduced as a bipartisan proposal in the House. The full text of the Equality Act can be viewed by clicking here.

Rugaber, Associated Press 10:06 p.m. ET May 3, 2017 On Wednesday, Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work. It also announced a $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. (Photo: Eric Thayer / Getty Images) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE San Francisco — Apple is getting more aggressive about emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, apparently hoping to counter recurring criticism over its reliance on overseas factories. On Wednesday, Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work. It also announced a $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. CEO Tim Cook first described the fund in an interview on CNBC, but didn’t say how the fund will invest that money or who will be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Apple’s billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire “thousands of employees, thousands more in the future” in the U.S., although he didn’t specify how quickly that will happen. Apple’s U.S. payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 U.S. workers. Cook also said Apple is examining ways to help more people learn the programming skills to make apps. Threats To Apple Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from China, a change that would drive up Apple’s costs. That could pressure the company to raise its prices at a time when it is already having trouble increasing its sales of iPhones and iPads. “They are trying to make the case that they really do have a lot of folks working in the U.S.,” said technology industry analyst Rob Enderle. “So if want to pick on somebody, you might want to pick on somebody else because they won’t be a good example.” Cook isn’t the only CEO who has been trying to highlight his company’s hiring and expansion plans in the U.S. Trump has attacked many companies, frequently on Twitter, for moving jobs out of the U.S. and lavishly praised those who have announced major hiring initiatives. As a result, many companies, including Exxon Mobil, Intel, Charter Communications and Ford Motor, have unveiled big hiring plans, though in many cases they were already in the works before the presidential campaign. “There is a lot of political pressure to create jobs in the United States,” Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, said. Chief executives “do not want to show up in a tweet.” Apple In The States Since 2014, Apple has issued a series of glitzy reports intended to underscore its contributions to U.S. jobs and economic growth. Its first report followed years of complaints about labor practices and suicides at Foxconn, one of the company’s major contractors in China. The Wednesday report is its fourth update, but the first to include a state-by-state breakdown of Apple employees. Unsurprisingly, the numbers show its highest concentration of workers (36,786) is located in California, home to the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters and 53 stores. Apple’s second biggest employment center is in Texas (8,407 jobs), where it has a corporate campus and 18 stores. Its smallest pockets of employment are in North Dakota (four jobs), Vermont (six) and Wyoming (seven). Apple’s decision to provide detailed information about the locations of its U.S. employees could help the company win support from lawmakers eager to protect jobs in their states, Enderle said. “It gives senators something to push back with, recognizing that Apple is a real risky company to target anyway because its products are so popular with people.” Besides showing how many of its full-time and part-time employees work in each state, Apple also lists where its 9,000 U.S. suppliers are located. App Economy The company also cited a study by the Progressive Policy Institute that attributes 1.5 million U.S. jobs to Apple’s iPhone “ecosystem.” That figure not only includes programmers that work on the apps, but also supporting staff and employees working everywhere from banks to restaurants that have jobs because of the spending generated by apps. Such “spillover” effects are widely recognized, although economists sometimes spar over their magnitude. But for a company to claim credit for all or most of the jobs in a particular industry is a stretch, Swonk said. The vast majority of app developers, for example, also produce apps for Android phones from Samsung and other manufacturers. The Public Policy Institute, for instance, only found 1.7 million jobs in the entire “app economy” — and 1.35 million of those were associated with Android apps. Most of those overlap with the jobs linked to Apple. CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
