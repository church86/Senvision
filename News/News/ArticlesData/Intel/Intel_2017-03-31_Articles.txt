Gameranx NEWS FEATURES PLATFORMS PC PlayStation 4 Xbox One VIDEOS UPCOMING GAMES GUIDES March 31, 2017 Upgrading to Ryzen: The R7 1700 Reviewed Welcome back to the fight, AMD. Christopher Scott / Features / AMD, featured, hardware / If you’re anything like me, upgrading your computer’s processor isn’t an occasion that happens often. After all, a new processor often means a new motherboard. And depending on how long it’s been since your last upgrade, new memory and a copy of Windows may be additional requirements. I’ve held off as long as I could, but when AMD sent over a sample of their new Ryzen 7 1700 processor (along with a Gigabyte AX370 Gaming 5 motherboard), I jumped at the chance to build a whole new rig and put it to the test against the 3770k that’s kept me these last five years. It’s important to state that I won’t necessarily be demonstrating apples-to-apples comparisons between the Intel and Ryzen builds. Instead, the purpose of this article is to show system upgraders what they can expect from the latter. With that disclaimer out of the way, let’s take a look at our two machines. The Builds As previously mentioned, the Intel system was equipped with a i7-3770k, which has a base frequency of 3.5 GHz and a max turbo frequency of 3.9 GHz. Meanwhile, the Ryzen 7 1700 has a base frequency of 3.0 GHz and boosts up to 3.7 GHz. Both were benchmarked with an ASUS Strix GeForce GTX 1080 running the latest driver (378.92). Both also featured 16 GB of Corsair Vengeance memory. However, recent costs and Ryzen’s less-aged architecture presented the opportunity to run the new build with faster RAM. There just wasn’t a huge push for high-speed memory back in the day, but that’s no longer the case. As such, the Ryzen system tested with DDR4 3200 MHz RAM compared to the Intel’s DDR3 1600 MHz. The i7-3770k kept its stock air cooler, but I opted for the Noctua NH-U12S SE-AM4 cooler to put atop the Ryzen processor. Retail purchases of the 1700 include AMD’s Wraith Spire LED cooler, so you won’t have to buy a third-party solution if you don’t want to. Getting the most out of Ryzen After installing the Ryzen 7 1700 and closing the door on my case, the next step was to determine how best to optimize it for our benchmarks. AMD currently recommends enabling the “High performance” power plan and disabling High Precision Event Timer (HPET). The latter can be done in the BIOS or with a command line prompt in Windows. Disabling simultaneous multithreading (SMT) in the BIOS can improve performance, as well, but the benefits vary between games. I can’t imagine everyone would enjoy changing their BIOS settings each time they want to change what they’re playing, and thus I left SMT to its default enabled state. The benefits of high speed memory with Ryzen, however, are well documented. My own modules operated at 3200 MHz after updating the Gigabyte’s BIOS to version F5d. If you purchase a Ryzen CPU, you’ll want to pair it with the fastest memory your motherboard supports. Of course, the most obvious method to achieve better performance is likely through overclocking. AMD makes the process rather simple with their Ryzen Master software. Within, you can quickly increase core frequency, disable cores, alter voltages, and even adjust memory timings. CPU temperature is displayed in one corner and profiles can be saved and selected toward the bottom. That said, it’s still better to overclock your processor from the BIOS. Now I didn’t run into any stability issues with Ryzen Master, but my games did experience a repeatable audio bug when using the software. I had no trouble pushing the 1700 to its 3.7 GHz boost frequency without increasing the voltage (1.225v). Idle temperatures hovered around 30 degrees and 50 degrees under load in my Fractal Define R5 case. Attaining higher frequencies depends on each individual chip and cooling setup. AMD has stated 1.35v is the safe ceiling for daily use, and that’s what it took for my sample to reach 3.8 GHz. Temperatures increased by about 13 degrees. Benchmarks were completed at default values. Benchmarks I wanted to put the Ryzen 7 1700 through its paces in CPU-intensive situations. Choice locations included Witcher 3’s Novigrad city, where I ran several lengthy laps through its bustling streets, and Rise of the Tomb Raider’s Geothermal Valley village and forests. Other tests included the clashing of armies in Total War: Warhammer and the vast open world of Ghost Recon: Wildlands. Graphical options were all set to the highest presets. Reasons to be optimistic The above numbers are a little disheartening. The 1700 wasn’t too far behind in three of the four benchmarks, but it was still behind. On the other hand, those numbers don’t tell the entire story. First, growing pains aren’t unexpected for a new hardware architecture. There are still optimizations to come from AMD, software partners, operating systems, and motherboard manufacturers. Bethesda Softworks (the publisher) and several developers have already pledged support for AMD’s Ryzen processors. Stardock’s and Oxide Games’ Ashes of the Singularity has been given an optimization pass resulting in a 31% increase in average performance, according to a just released announcement from AMD (the news amusingly arrived in my inbox the minute I finished this article). BIOS updates, depending on the board, are releasing regularly. And a Windows update has reportedly improved Ryzen performance for a number applications. Second, the Ryzen 7 lineup truly shines for productivity usage. The 1700 absolutely crushed the 3770k in Cinebench R15’s multicore benchmarks, seen below, by 900 to 1,000 points in several runs. What that means for the end user is a computer not bogged down by acts of multitasking. For those who edit and encode videos, stream games, or enjoy running other applications in the background, Ryzen’s appeal grows significantly. Finally, the Ryzen 7 1700 is by no means bad for gaming. When I’m not running benchmarks, I’m playing games at the more demanding resolution of 3440×1440. DOOM’s framerate on the Ryzen never went below the mid to high 80s and frequently reached above 130. Battlefield 1’s 64-player matches averaged 90.5 FPS with a low of 75 and a maximum of 109. Mass Effect Andromeda maintained 50-60 frames in demanding scenes while climbing between 77 and 85 frames when traversing certain large environments. All three had maxed out graphical settings. Conclusion AMD’s Ryzen clearly has room to improve when it comes to its gaming performance. Intel continues to lead in that arena. But what the Ryzen 7 1700 does offer is a balanced, versatile processor that retails for a fraction of the price of a comparable product from Intel. The eight core i7-6900K sells for over $1,000. The Ryzen 7 1700 can be had for only $329. And AMD’s upcoming Ryzen 5 lineup is equally competitively priced, with a four-core processor starting at $169 and a $219 six-core/12-thread chip. Much needed competition is returning to this market, and I couldn’t be more excited. Welcome back to the fight, AMD. A review unit was provided by AMD.

Yeah right, when pigs fly. • March Madness 2017 • April Fools • Samsung C34F791 for $850 Kaby Lake Pentiums and Celerons won't support Optane Memory by Jeff Kampman  3:05 PM on March 30, 2017 When Intel's Optane Memory technology launched this week, we overlooked a critical requirement for the platform. Despite seeming ideal for speeding up budget-friendly systems with hard drives as their sole storage devices, Optane Memory apparently won't have support from Intel's most budget-friendly Kaby Lake CPUs: the Celeron G3930, the Celeron G3950, the Pentium G4560, the Pentium G4600, and the Pentium G4620. Lower-power "T" variants of those chips won't work, either. Only Kaby Lake Core CPUs are Optane Memory-compatible, according to Intel's ARK database and the Optane Memory product page. We've gotta say: this is a baffling decision on Intel's part. Assuming ARK is correct, the cheapest CPU one can pair with an Optane Memory device is the Core i3-7100, a $120 part that's $28 more expensive than our budget-favorite Pentium G4620. The Core i3 adds 200 MHz of clock speed and AVX support to the bargain, to be fair. Even so, paying $65 or so in total to get that Core i3 CPU and the 16GB Optane Memory hardware itself seems like a hard sell for the frugal system builder who's already chosen a capacious hard drive. If we play the incremental cost game a bit more, one can get a reputable budget 480GB SSD like Toshiba OCZ's TR150 for $130—not that much more versus the $105-ish extra that one would pay for the 16GB Optane Memory module, the Core i3-7100 CPU, and the WD Blue 1TB hard drive one would need to get our Budget Box's storage subsystem Optane Memory-ready. We'll have to reserve judgment until we've had time with Optane Memory products to be sure, but it seems like those 3D Xpoint-equipped gumsticks and their caching software will need to be quite competitive with SSD performance to be worth the platform cost. We've asked Intel to comment on this matter, and we'll update the post if we hear back. Tags: CPUs Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Brown | AFP | Getty Images Brian Krzanich Intel CEO Intel is the biggest stakeholder in Cloudera ahead of the software developer's IPO, thanks to a $740 million bet the chipmaker placed in 2014. That stake, which valued Cloudera at a whopping $4.1 billion, carries with it some awkward provisions, as laid out in Cloudera's IPO prospectus on Friday. In the filing, Intel is listed as owning 22 percent of the company before the offering. Far from just a financial interest, Intel has been developing and marketing products with Cloudera to bring more big data capabilities to Intel's data center processors. Cloudera's database software, built on open source code, helps businesses perform complicated analysis of disparate data. Its products run on standard hardware, and Intel is aiming to use Cloudera's tools as a draw for big customers. As far as ownership, Intel has limited ability to bolster its control of Cloudera from here and thus determine its future course. show chapters 2017 IPO outlook: Pro    Friday, 17 Mar 2017 | 8:46 AM ET | 03:45 According to Cloudera's prospectus, an agreement that kicks in at the time of the offering restricts "Intel's ability to acquire more than 20 percent of our fully diluted capital stock, which we refer to as the Intel Maximum Percentage." Assuming Intel doesn't sell shares in the IPO, an offering of about 11 million shares to the public would bring its ownership to 20 percent. Lise Buyer, who advises companies as they prepare to go public, said the purpose of the agreement is most likely to reassure potential customers who may be concerned about Intel having undue influence. "It's like saying, you can ride on the bus but you can't drive," said Buyer, the founder of Class V Group in Silicon Valley. "You can't steer the direction of the company." There are two ways Intel can increase its stake. The first would be a full acquisition of the company. The second would be if another investor (excluding a "purely financial investor") buys a percentage that exceeds 20 percent. In that case "Intel's Maximum Percentage shall increase to the percentage held by such Other Strategic Holder." Cloudera's top shareholders Firm Number of shares % ownership before IPO Intel 24.9 mln 22 Accel 18.4 mln 16.3 Greylock 14.2 mln 12.5 Further complicating matters, Intel's operating chief Kim Stevenson left the chipmaker last month and resigned from Cloudera's board of directors. She's now headed to Lenovo, leaving Intel without a Cloudera board member. Cloudera said that the board will nominate a director designated by Intel at the annual shareholders meeting, and Intel will maintain that seat as long as the company holds at least 10 percent of the stock and doesn't breach the collaboration agreement. A Cloudera spokesperson declined to comment as did a spokesperson for Intel.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 31, 2017 at 5:00PM Chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) finally went into quite a lot of technical detail about its upcoming 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. I applaud the company for disclosing this information publicly, I appreciate that it took the time to put it into context for investors, and I genuinely hope that it continues to keep investors abreast of its progress in chip manufacturing technology. Despite some of the impressive work that Intel did to deliver a significant reduction in transistor area with its 10-nanometer technology relative to its prior-generation 14-nanometer technology, there are a couple of things about the technology -- at least in its initial form -- that were quite disappointing. Performance challenges The first problem -- one that I mentioned in the article I linked to above -- is that the first version of Intel's 10-nanometer technology won't deliver as much performance as the 14-nanometer++ technology that the chipmaker is going to start shipping products based on in the second half of this year.

Now, part of this "problem" is because Intel did a very good job of steadily improving the performance of its 14-nanometer technology over the years (Intel's 10-nanometer technology does significantly outperform the first version of its 14-nanometer technology), but this is nevertheless disappointing. Somewhat offsetting this bad news is that Intel intends to boost the performance of its 10-nanometer technology in the second half of 2018 with its 10-nanometer+ technology, which should bring performance almost to 14-nanometer++ levels. That increased performance, coupled with the power and area reduction benefits that the 10-nanometer tech inherently brings over the 14-nanometer++ technology, should make it a much more worthwhile technology than the original 10-nanometer tech is. Furthermore, Intel says that the third iteration of its 10-nanometer technology, which is likely to go into mass production in the second half of 2019, should deliver a clear performance benefit over 14-nanometer++ while at the same time achieving much lower power consumption and much smaller chip area. It's going to be about three years before Intel is fielding a 10-nanometer technology that clearly beats out the 14-nanometer++ technology that it will begin shipping to customers later this year, and that's just disappointing.  Production schedule Intel has spent a great deal of time in its public messaging talking about how its 10-nanometer technology is superior to the 10-nanometer technologies that its main competitors -- Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) are currently producing. What the public needs to keep in mind, though, is that Intel said that it doesn't plan to start mass-producing chips on its first 10-nanometer variant until the second half of 2017. Moreover, Intel executive Murthy Renduchintala indicated that Intel won't start shipping these production 10-nanometer chips until the very end of 2017 or the very beginning of 2018. Intel's 10-nanometer technology may be much denser than competing 10-nanometer technologies, but it's certainly coming to market later and in much smaller quantities than we'll see from both Samsung and TSMC. I continue to maintain that Intel's comparison of its 10-nanometer tech with competitors' 10-nanometer technologies isn't fair. Foolish takeaway I don't want to be too harsh on Intel for opening about key technical aspects of its technology, but at the same time I think the evidence is clear that the company's 10-nanometer technology development has not been smooth and that there are still plenty of issues to work out in the coming years. What I'd like to see from Intel going forward is a tightening up of its execution in chip manufacturing technology development. If I were Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and the company's Board of Directors, I would give Intel's Technology and Manufacturing Group (TMG) whatever resources it needs to be able to speed up and smoothen the development of 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer, and beyond. In the near term, this could mean an increase -- perhaps even a substantial one -- in terms of research and development spending, which would reduce near- to medium-term profitability. However, I would urge Intel's management and board of directors to think about the long term, rather than on trying to maximize short-term profitability. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

If you’ve ever hooked up a Linux computer to a DisplayPort monitor and encountered only a flickering or blank screen, we’ve got good news for you. A graphics kernel developer at Intel’s Open Source Technology Center has solved the problem with a patch that will go into Linux Kernel 4.12. Manasi Navare’s patch modifies Atomic Kernel Mode Setting (KMS) technology to gracefully drop down to a lower resolution to display the image. “Someone had to fix this problem, so I said okay, I have the knowledge and I have the community to help me,” said Navare at the recent Embedded Linux Conference. Manasi Navare explains Linux/DisplayPort handshaking (left) and DP link training at ELC 2017 (click images to enlarge) To hear Navare tell it, the hard part was not so much developing the fix as fully understanding the inner workings of DisplayPort (DP) compliance, the Linux graphics stack, and Atomic KMS. The task of upstreaming the patch was perhaps even more challenging, calling upon the right mix of persuasion, persistence, charm, and flexibility. At the end of the talk, Navare offered some tips for anyone pushing a patch upstream toward an eventual kernel merge.   Negotiating with DisplayPort Navare started by explaining how a computer (the DP source) negotiates with a display (DP sink) to enable the desired resolution and other properties. When you connect the cable, the sink sends a signal that informs the source about the maximum link-outs and link rates supported by the sink. The source then initiates a DPCD (DisplayPort Configuration Data) read on the sink’s AUX channel, performs a calibration routine, and then launches a handshaking process called DP link training. This configures the main link out of the four possible DP links, each of which has different channel capacities. “The first phase is clock recovery, sending out the known training packet sequence onto the main link,” said Navare. “The receiver extracts the block information to find if it can work at that linkage. Next comes channel equalization where the receiver tries to understand the link mapping. If these are successful, the link is ready, and the sink is set to receive the data at a specific link-out and link rate.” Despite all these steps, the link training can still result in a blank or flickering display. “The link training could fail because you haven’t tested the physical capability of the cable until the very end of the process,” said Navare. “There is no way to send this information back to userspace because the commit phase was never expected to fail. It’s a dead end.” DPR-120 To find a solution, Navare needed to test DP compliance. She used a Unigraf DPR-120 device, which has been certified by Mesa. The device sits between the source and sink and requests specific data or video packets to be sent to the DP monitor. “It maps those values onto the AUX channel and monitors all the transactions on the display cables,” said Navare. “It compares that data to the reference values, and if it matches, the device is compliant.” Navare also needed to improve her understanding of the complex Linux graphics stack. The base level consists of an Intel Integrated Graphics Device layer — a hardware layer for rendering the display and doing graphics acceleration. “On top of this sits the Linux kernel with the I19 Intel graphics driver, which knows how to configure the hardware according to userspace commands,” explained Navare. At a higher layer within the same Linux kernel subsystem is the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager), which implements the part of the kernel that is common to different hardware specific drivers. “The DRM exposes the APIs to userspace, which sends information down to the hardware to request a specific display for rendering,” said Navare. Navare shows how her patch fits into Linux graphics stack (left) and explains Kernel Mode Setting (click images to enlarge) Navare also further explored KMS, which, among other things, scans the RGB pixel data in the plane buffers using the cathode ray tube controller (CRTC), which decides whether to generate DVI, HDMI, or DP signals. “The CTRC generates the bitstream according to the video timings and sends the data to the encoder, which modifies the bitstream and generates the analog signals based on the connector type,” says Navare. “Then it goes to the connector and lights up the display.” Once into the project, Navare realized her solution would need to support the new Atomic KMS version of KMS, which implements a secondary process that Navare called the two step. “When you connect the source with the sink, userspace creates a list of parameters that it wants to change on the hardware, and sends this out to the kernel using a DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ATOMIC call. The first step is the atomic check phase where it forms the state of the device and its structure for the different DRM mode objects: the plane, CRTC, or connector. It validates the mode requested by userspace, such as 4K, to see if the display is capable.” If successful, the process advances to the next stage — atomic commit — which sends the data to the hardware. “The expectation is that it will succeed because it has already been validated,” said Navare. Navare’s solution was to introduce a new property for the connector called link status. “If a commit fails, the kernel now tags the connect property as BAD,” she explained. “It sends the HPD back to the userspace, which requests another modeset, but at lower resolution. The kernel repeats the check and commit, and retrains the link at a lower rate.” Link failure mishandling (left) and Navare’s link status solution (click images to enlarge) If the test passes, the link status switches to GOOD, and the display works, although at a lower resolution. “Atomic check is never supposed to fail, but link training is the exception because it depends on the physical cable,” said Navare. “The link might fail after a successful modeset because something can go wrong with the cable between initial hookup and test. This patch provides a way for the kernel to send that notification back to userspace. You have to go back to userspace because you have to repeat the process of setting the clock and rate, which you can’t do at the point of failure.”   A few tips on upstreaming Navare added the new link status connector property to the DRM layer as part of an Upstream I915 driver patch, and submitted it to her manager at Intel. “I said, ‘It’s working now. What can I work on next?’ He replied: ‘Have you sent it upstream?’” Navare submitted the patch to the public mailing list for the graphics driver, thereby beginning a journey that took almost a year. “It took a long time to convince the community that this would fix the problem,” said Navare. “You get constant feedback and review comments. I think I submitted 15 or 20 revisions before it was accepted. But you keep on submitting patch revisions until you get the ‘reviewed by’ and that’s the day you go party, right?” Not exactly. The patch then gets merged into an internal DRM tree, where much more testing transpires. It finally gets merged into the main DRM tree where it’s sorted into DRM fixes or DRM next. “Linus [Torvalds] pulls the patches from this DRM tree on a weekly basis and announces his release candidates,” said Navare. “It goes through the cycle of release candidates for a long time until it’s stable, and it finally becomes part of the next Linux release.” Torvalds finally approved the patch for merger, and the champagne cork popped.   Linus’s Rules Navare also offered some general tips for the upstreaming process, which she calls Linus’s Rules. The first rule is “No regressions,” that is, no GPU hangs or blanks screens. “If you submit a patch it should not break something else in the driver, or else the review cycle can get really aggressive,” said Navare. “I had to leverage the community’s knowledge about other parts of the graphics driver.” The second rule is “Never blame userspace, it’s always kernel’s fault.” In other words, “If the hardware doesn’t work as expected then the kernel developer is the one to blame,” she added. The problem here is that kernel patches require changes in userspace drivers, which leads to “a chicken and egg situation,” said Navare. “It’s hard to upstream kernel changes without testing userspace… You can’t merge the kernel patches until you’ve tested the userspace, but you can’t merge userspace because the kernel changes have not yet landed. It’s very complicated.” To prove her solution would not break userspace, Navare spent a lot of time interacting with userspace community and involved them in testing and submitting patches. Another rule is that “Feedback is always constructive.” In other words, “don’t take it as criticism, and don’t take it personally,” she said. “I got reviews that said: ‘This sucks. It’s going to break link training, which is very fragile — don’t touch that part of the driver.’ It was frustrating, but it really helped. You have to ask them why they think it’s going to break the code, and how they would fix it.” The final rule is persistence. “You just have to keep pinging the maintainers and bugging them on IRC,” said Navare. “You will see the finish line, so don’t give up.” Navare’s Upstream i915 patch documentation can be found here.

There's a chance that shipments of Cannonlake -- Intel's first on the 10-nanometer production process -- may slip into next year. Intel previously said Cannonlake would ship by year end, but that's now uncertain. Whether Cannonlake shipments will happen before or after Christmas is hard to predict, Venkata Renduchintala, president of Intel's PC, IoT, and chip design businesses, said earlier this week at an Intel manufacturing event. "In terms of first shipments, whether it's before the end of the year, or just after the beginning of [next] year, it's too close to call," Renduchintala said. Intel will still deliver Cannonlake to PC makers within an appropriate timeframe, and there is no "perturbation in launch trends," Renduchintala said. The first Cannonlake chips will be targeted at low-power laptops and 2-in-1s. PC makers typically need time to test the chips in laptops, so availability of the chips in mainstream PCs may drag into 2018. Mass production of 10-nm chips will begin in the first half of 2018. Initial production runs of the chips will start in the second half of this year. So don't expect Cannonlake laptops during this year's holiday season. Instead, users will be able to get PCs with 8th Generation Core processors, which are made on the 14-nm process. PCs now are available with 7th Generation Core processors code-named Kaby Lake. Those 8th Generation Core laptops may be more attractive to customers.Â The first 10-nm Cannonlake chips will be slower than 14-nm 8th Generation Core processors. Intel acknowledged the speeds during the manufacturing event, with a chart showing 10-nm chips catching up with 14-nm chip performance in one to two years. In theory, the 10-nm chips should be faster than the 14-nm chips. But the first low-power Cannonlake chips will have fewer transistors, and won't be comparable to the mature 14-nm chips with more transistors. But Cannonlake is expected to beat its low-power Kaby Lake predecessors -- which also have fewer transistors -- on performance. Cannonlake could replace low-power Core M/Y Kaby Lake chips, which are targeted at lightweight laptops and 2-in-1s. By the time Cannonlake ships, it will be competing with AMD's Zen-based chip code-named Raven Ridge, and Qualcomm's ARM-based Snapdragon 835, which will be introduced in low-power Windows 10 laptops and hybrids later this year. The branding of Cannonlake chips hasn't been finalized. But they won't be part of the 8th Generation chip lineup, and will have a separate branding, Intel has said. That could create confusion among PC buyers. In the past, Intel has first upgraded PC chips to new architectures. But as the PC market flattens and the server market grows, Intel is switching priorities and giving server chips first dibs on architectural upgrades. Cannonlake could be the first step in that transition. Intel executives were telling media and analysts at the event to separate Core chips from the manufacturing process, which remains an important factor in advancing performance in processors. "I don't necessarily think our Core generations are going to be synchronized necessarily with process node evolutions that may happen or may not happen," Renduchintala said. Intel once took pride in advancing manufacturing alongside chip architectures, but that's now less of a priority for the company. The 8th Generation Core processors will be the unprecedented fourth chip architecture on the 14-nm process. Intel has typically advanced chips two times with each manufacturing process, which became known as the "tick-tock strategy," but making chips smaller has become challenging. As a result, the company is extending the life of each manufacturing process, with tweaks to cram more transistors and squeeze more performance out of chips. Intel has a goal of delivering a minimum of 15 percent improvement in chip performance on an annual basis.

Intel executives were telling media and analysts at the event to separate Core chips from the manufacturing process, which remains an important factor in advancing performance in processors. "I don't necessarily think our Core generations are going to be synchronized necessarily with process node evolutions that may happen or may not happen," Renduchintala said. Intel once took pride in advancing manufacturing alongside chip architectures, but that's now less of a priority for the company. The 8th Generation Core processors will be the unprecedented fourth chip architecture on the 14-nm process. Intel has typically advanced chips two times with each manufacturing process, which became known as the "tick-tock strategy," but making chips smaller has become challenging. As a result, the company is extending the life of each manufacturing process, with tweaks to cram more transistors and squeeze more performance out of chips.

There's a chance that shipments of Cannonlake -- Intel's first on the 10-nanometer production process -- may slip into next year. Intel previously said Cannonlake would ship by year end, but that's now uncertain. Whether Cannonlake shipments will happen before or after Christmas is hard to predict, Venkata Renduchintala, president of Intel's PC, IoT, and chip design businesses, said earlier this week at an Intel manufacturing event. "In terms of first shipments, whether it's before the end of the year, or just after the beginning of [next] year, it's too close to call," Renduchintala said. Intel will still deliver Cannonlake to PC makers within an appropriate timeframe, and there is no "perturbation in launch trends," Renduchintala said. The first Cannonlake chips will be targeted at low-power laptops and 2-in-1s. PC makers typically need time to test the chips in laptops, so availability of the chips in mainstream PCs may drag into 2018. Mass production of 10-nm chips will begin in the first half of 2018. Initial production runs of the chips will start in the second half of this year. So don't expect Cannonlake laptops during this year's holiday season. Instead, users will be able to get PCs with 8th Generation Core processors, which are made on the 14-nm process. PCs now are available with 7th Generation Core processors code-named Kaby Lake. Those 8th Generation Core laptops may be more attractive to customers.Â The first 10-nm Cannonlake chips will be slower than 14-nm 8th Generation Core processors. Intel acknowledged the speeds during the manufacturing event, with a chart showing 10-nm chips catching up with 14-nm chip performance in one to two years. In theory, the 10-nm chips should be faster than the 14-nm chips. But the first low-power Cannonlake chips will have fewer transistors, and won't be comparable to the mature 14-nm chips with more transistors. But Cannonlake is expected to beat its low-power Kaby Lake predecessors -- which also have fewer transistors -- on performance. Cannonlake could replace low-power Core M/Y Kaby Lake chips, which are targeted at lightweight laptops and 2-in-1s. By the time Cannonlake ships, it will be competing with AMD's Zen-based chip code-named Raven Ridge, and Qualcomm's ARM-based Snapdragon 835, which will be introduced in low-power Windows 10 laptops and hybrids later this year. The branding of Cannonlake chips hasn't been finalized. But they won't be part of the 8th Generation chip lineup, and will have a separate branding, Intel has said. That could create confusion among PC buyers. In the past, Intel has first upgraded PC chips to new architectures. But as the PC market flattens and the server market grows, Intel is switching priorities and giving server chips first dibs on architectural upgrades. Cannonlake could be the first step in that transition. Intel executives were telling media and analysts at the event to separate Core chips from the manufacturing process, which remains an important factor in advancing performance in processors. "I don't necessarily think our Core generations are going to be synchronized necessarily with process node evolutions that may happen or may not happen," Renduchintala said.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Mar 31, 2017 at 1:06PM There may not be a better example of the changing of the guard taking place in tech than what's happening with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). The old guard -- Intel -- remains the largest and most profitable semiconductor company in the world, though Qualcomm has vied for that crown once or twice in the past decade. NVIDIA is the ascendant challenger, though by no means a new company itself. And though NVIDIA's $63 billion market cap remains much smaller than Intel's $167 billion valuation, their more recent trading histories speak volumes about the trajectories of each business. INTC data by YCharts Importantly, Intel's planned $15.3 billion buyout of self-driving-car chip designer Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) changes the outlook for the stodgy chipmaker to a meaningful degree. Even taking that into account, though, NVIDIA still remains a better stock than Intel to own today for long-term tech investors. NVIDIA is just getting started Thanks to its multiple significant growth drivers, NVIDIA appears poised to grow at above-average rates for many years to come. Though its gaming segment contributes the majority of its revenue, NVIDIA's true growth drivers lie in two segments: data center and auto. Its data center platform houses NVIDIA's artificial intelligence (AI) computing chips, which have emerged as the go-to standard among many of the world's foremost developers of AI software -- Alphabet, Baidu, Facebook, and more. Revenue from the data center segment more than doubled last year, and the market is in many regards just taking shape. By 2020, researcher IDC estimates that AI software will have surged to reach $47 billion in sales, and NVIDIA seems like a fairly safe bet to power the majority of this software. In its automotive segment, the company continues to press forward at an impressive clip. Revenue in the segment increased by 52% last year, which, again, low-balls its eventual growth potential. The company has partnered with many of the foremost pioneers in the space -- including Tesla, Baidu, Honda, BMW, and many more -- which should help pave the way for revenue growth to accelerate as autonomous vehicles become increasingly popular in the 2020s. Moreover, NVIDIA continues to improve on its current technologies and forge new partnerships, which should help the chipmaker maximize its market share and profits in future years. In the past several weeks, NVIDIA announced partnerships with Bosch and PACCAR, each of which touch on previously unexploited areas of the automotive industry for NVIDIA. As such, its multiple mass-market growth drivers make NVIDIA a better long-term growth stock than Intel, despite savvy recent maneuvers from the world's largest chipmaker. Image source: Intel.  Intel: Better after Mobileye Up recently, the future seemed increasingly bleak for Intel. The chipmaker derives 55% of its business from chips that power personal computers, a segment that remains in secular decline. For example, IDC expects PC shipments to decline at an average annual rate of 0.8% through 2020. Growth from the company's data center business -- Intel's second-largest segment -- has not been enough to offset the declining fundamentals of Intel's PC business. Gross and operating margins have fallen in each of the past two years. Intel was largely stuck in neutral, even as the technology landscape around it continued to change -- that is, until it announced its Mobileye deal in mid-March. By buying one of the leading component designers for autonomous vehicles -- and paying one heck of a handsome price for it in the process -- Intel showed both its desperation and determination to not miss another transformative technology trend, as it did in smartphones and tablets. In that regard, Intel has acquired an autonomous-vehicle component producer that really only NVIDIA can rival. Mobileye's advanced driver assistance systems are found in over 15 million vehicles worldwide. The company currently has deals with all major tier-1 automotive suppliers and 27 major automakers.  Better still, integrating Mobileye into Intel's processor ecosystem will allow the chip giant to combine in-car computing technology with data center and cloud computing processing that should create an end-to-end autonomous-vehicle computing platform. It's an impressive value proposition that Intel CEO Brian Krzanich argued will make Intel one of the leading players -- alongside NVIDIA -- in what could eventually become a $70 billion total addressable market by 2030.  As impressive as this is, though, particularly considering Intel's outlook before the Mobileye deal, it remains important to note that NVIDIA still enjoys an advantage, given its significant exposure to AI computing and self-driving cars. Because of this twofold upside, NVIDIA remains the better semiconductor stock for long-term growth investors to own today.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Analysis  ⋮  Hardware Ashes of the Singularity Gets Optimized for AMD Ryzen, Achieves Double Digit Performance Gains Of Up To 28% By Usman Pirzada Mar 30, 2017 17Shares Share Tweet Submit Ashes of the Singularity is well on its way to being the most controversial title for followers of the Intel-AMD-NVIDIA trio (which is pretty much all of us) and now it seems that they are also the first ones to roll out a ‘Ryzen optimized’ build which significantly improves gaming performance on Ryzen processors. This is something that is a hopeful sign to those who are worried about gaming performance on AMD’s spanking new processors. Ryzen processors need optimized code for every gaming title to run at full potential The new and improved Ashes of the Singularity build was able to achieve double digit frame rate growth by using the newly optimized (for Ryzen) code. The results of publications have varied, as is the norm, but the range we have seen is in the16-28% band, depending on the preset and configuration you are using. I have taken the liberty to add a benchmark showcasing this effect taken from TomsHardware.com: Related Rumor: AMD Working on 16 Core/32 Thread Ryzen CPU To Take The Performance Crown In The HEDT Spectrum Benchmark courtesy of TomsHardware.com It does raise some interesting questions though. If optimization is necessary on a title to achieve Intel-like performance for Ryzen processors then it means that the underlying problem isn’t being solved but is rather being worked around. This would further imply that the problem isn’t something which can be fixed with a magical software patch but rather something that has to do with how AMD has implemented SMT in their new architecture. Advertisement Since the company has been using the CMT approach for the past few years, it is not surprising that we are seeing some less than perfect performance in a specific application segment. This in itself, does not mean that the problem is a defect of any kind (in terms of microarchitecture), just that it is an approach that is different enough from Intel’s method that conventional gaming applications are struggling with it. Intel’s long run of being the supreme leader in the field of processors has left its mark on the ecosystem, and it shows. It also means that we should not expect indie or small time developers to take the time out to optimize their code for AMD CPUs, which could be something that might validate the Intel premium and allow it to continue without slashing prices further. Big studio devs and upcoming AAA titles however, should be able to give very comparable performance to Intel by optimizing their code for Ryzen. That said, we can expect gaming performance on Ryzen processors to eventually achieve parity with Intel counterparts over the course of time as the industry gets friendly with the Zen architecture. It might take a few years, or it might be done before the year ends, it would be hard to say for sure without knowing details about how much time it took for Stardock and Oxide Games to optimize their build for Ryzen and level of difficulty involved.

There's a chance that shipments of Cannonlake -- Intel's first on the 10-nanometer production process -- may slip into next year. Intel previously said Cannonlake would ship by year end, but that's now uncertain. Whether Cannonlake shipments will happen before or after Christmas is hard to predict, Venkata Renduchintala, president of Intel's PC, IoT, and chip design businesses, said earlier this week at an Intel manufacturing event. "In terms of first shipments, whether it's before the end of the year, or just after the beginning of [next] year, it's too close to call," Renduchintala said. Intel will still deliver Cannonlake to PC makers within an appropriate timeframe, and there is no "perturbation in launch trends," Renduchintala said. The first Cannonlake chips will be targeted at low-power laptops and 2-in-1s. PC makers typically need time to test the chips in laptops, so availability of the chips in mainstream PCs may drag into 2018. Mass production of 10-nm chips will begin in the first half of 2018. Initial production runs of the chips will start in the second half of this year. So don't expect Cannonlake laptops during this year's holiday season. Instead, users will be able to get PCs with 8th Generation Core processors, which are made on the 14-nm process. PCs now are available with 7th Generation Core processors code-named Kaby Lake. Those 8th Generation Core laptops may be more attractive to customers.Â The first 10-nm Cannonlake chips will be slower than 14-nm 8th Generation Core processors. Intel acknowledged the speeds during the manufacturing event, with a chart showing 10-nm chips catching up with 14-nm chip performance in one to two years. In theory, the 10-nm chips should be faster than the 14-nm chips. But the first low-power Cannonlake chips will have fewer transistors, and won't be comparable to the mature 14-nm chips with more transistors. But Cannonlake is expected to beat its low-power Kaby Lake predecessors -- which also have fewer transistors -- on performance. Cannonlake could replace low-power Core M/Y Kaby Lake chips, which are targeted at lightweight laptops and 2-in-1s. By the time Cannonlake ships, it will be competing with AMD's Zen-based chip code-named Raven Ridge, and Qualcomm's ARM-based Snapdragon 835, which will be introduced in low-power Windows 10 laptops and hybrids later this year. The branding of Cannonlake chips hasn't been finalized. But they won't be part of the 8th Generation chip lineup, and will have a separate branding, Intel has said. That could create confusion among PC buyers. In the past, Intel has first upgraded PC chips to new architectures. But as the PC market flattens and the server market grows, Intel is switching priorities and giving server chips first dibs on architectural upgrades. Cannonlake could be the first step in that transition. Intel executives were telling media and analysts at the event to separate Core chips from the manufacturing process, which remains an important factor in advancing performance in processors. "I don't necessarily think our Core generations are going to be synchronized necessarily with process node evolutions that may happen or may not happen," Renduchintala said. Intel once took pride in advancing manufacturing alongside chip architectures, but that's now less of a priority for the company. The 8th Generation Core processors will be the unprecedented fourth chip architecture on the 14-nm process. Intel has typically advanced chips two times with each manufacturing process, which became known as the "tick-tock strategy," but making chips smaller has become challenging. As a result, the company is extending the life of each manufacturing process, with tweaks to cram more transistors and squeeze more performance out of chips. Intel has a goal of delivering a minimum of 15 percent improvement in chip performance on an annual basis.

Flynn was first contacted by the Justice Department’s National Security Division on Nov. 30, according to an internal DOJ spreadsheet which lists sensitive, high-profile agency matters. The unclassified DOJ document, which is dated Jan. 27, was sent via email to then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates. A read-out was provided to The Daily Caller in response to a Freedom of Information Act request for Yates’ correspondence regarding Flynn. According to the spreadsheet, which was dispersed to other DOJ officials, a pro-Turkey editorial Flynn wrote on Nov. 8 and subsequent media coverage sparked the agency’s reach-out to the retired lieutenant general. “In light of that editorial and reports in the media about potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey, on Nov. 30, NSD requested additional information from Lt. Gen. Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc.,” the spreadsheet reads. It had been unclear exactly why Flynn decided to register, though his unusually detailed filing did suggest that he was compelled by government forces to disclose the work. In his March 7 disclosure, filed with the National Security Division under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), Flynn revealed that his firm, Flynn Intel Group, was paid $530,000 for three months of work on behalf of a small Dutch company operated by a Turkish businessman with close ties to Ankara. Flynn Intel initially registered with the Senate as a lobbyist for the firm, Inovo BV. And according to the New Yorker, Flynn’s firm reportedly considered registering under FARA at the time but decided against it. Flynn’s company filed a termination report for the lobbying contract on Dec. 1, a day after DOJ first contacted Flynn. That disclosure stated that Flynn Intel received less than $5,000 from Inovo BV, far less than the firm’s actual take. The DOJ memo also says that Flynn’s lawyers responded to the Justice Department on Jan. 11 and advised that Flynn and Flynn Intel would “probably register under FARA.” The registration could happen “imminently and will be made public,” the spreadsheet reads. After Flynn registered under FARA this month, it emerged that his attorneys informed the White House’s general counsel both before and after Trump’s inauguration that Flynn would likely be registering as a foreign agent. Sally Quillian Yates testifies in Washington July 8, 2015. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque Flynn’s work for Inovo BV was first reported by The Daily Caller on Nov. 11, just days after the Trump adviser published a peculiar op-ed in The Hill praising Turkey’s president and calling on the U.S. government to extradite one of Turkey’s main enemies, a self-exiled cleric named Fethullah Gulen. (RELATED: Michael Flynn Is Lobbying For Obscure Dutch Firm With Ties To Turkish Government) “On November 8, Lt. Gen. Flynn published an editorial in The Hill expressed views that were criticial of the Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen similar to those previously expressed by the president of Turkey and other Turkish officials,” reads the DOJ document. The op-ed was part of Flynn Intel’s PR effort to help push the issue of Gulen’s extradition. The firm also agreed in its contract with Inovo BV to conduct research of Gulen and to potentially make “criminal referrals” to federal agencies. (RELATED: As Foreign Agent For Turkey, Flynn Agreed To Form Elite Investigative Team, Seek ‘Criminal Referrals’) Flynn and other officials with Flynn Intel also had a meeting in New York City on Sept. 19 with Turkey’s foreign minister and energy minister. During that meeting, the idea of conducting an extrajudicial removal of Gulen was discussed, former CIA director James Woolsey claimed last week. (RELATED: Former CIA Director Says Flynn Discussed Kidnapping Turkish Cleric) As an unpaid adviser for Flynn Intel, Woolsey attended some of the meeting and said he was disturbed by what he heard. Flynn has denied that the idea of kidnapping Gulen was discussed during the meeting. As for Yates, it is unclear whether she was involved in the negotiations over Flynn’s registration as a foreign agent. But the Obama appointee was a central figure in another scandal involving Flynn. Yates reportedly informed the White House just days into the Trump administration that Flynn was not entirely truthful about his conversations during the presidential transition period with Russia’s ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. Flynn had denied discussing anything of substance with Kislyak when they spoke by phone in December, but it later emerged that the pair talked about sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed against Russia for its cyber attacks during the presidential campaign. Trump fired Flynn on Feb. 13. The reason given by the White House was that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Kislyak. Pence said in several interviews in January that Flynn did not discuss sanctions with the Kremlin diplomat. Yates, who was fired on Jan. 30 after refusing to comply with Trump’s executive order banning travel from seven majority-Muslim nations, may have other incriminating information about Flynn. She also reportedly warned that he had made himself vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians. (RELATED: White House Says Yates ‘Betrayed Her Office’) Yates was set to testify to the House Intelligence Committee earlier this week about the Russia investigation, but the hearing was cancelled. Democrats accused the White House and Republican committee chairman, Devin Nunes, of attempting to prevent Yates from spilling the beans on Flynn. White House press secretary Sean Spicer denied those claims, saying that the White House hopes Yates will testify. A request for comment submitted through Yates’ lawyer was not returned.

Intel's speed-boosting Optane Memory won't work with Celeron and Pentium PCs Intel's new Optane Memory is aimed at non-enthusiast users, but only those with at least a Core i3. Ian Paul (PC World (US online)) on 01 April, 2017 02:47 0 - - - - print email IDG Intel’s revolutionary new non-volatile Optane Memory wants to make hard drives as fast as SSDs, but apparently not if you bought a PC on the cheap. The super-fast Optane Memory M.2 drives announced Monday not only require a Kaby Lake processor, but a Core one at that, as first spotted by The Tech Report. According to Intel’s ARK database and Optane website, Kaby Lake-based Celeron and Pentium processors aren’t supported.  That’s puzzling because these new Optane Memory drives target mainstream PCs rather than enthusiast systems, supercharging the performance of traditional hard drive. With an Optane M.2 drive installed, Intel promises speeds close to that of an SSD in some scenarios. The Optane Memory does this by caching your regular tasks, such as launching a particular program or game. The launch time then gets faster with each successive operation. It’s an interesting idea, and one that appeared easy to implement in Intel-controlled tests we performed at Optane’s launch event. But if this first round of Optane Memory is aimed at speeding up non-enthusiast PCs, why not support Celeron and Pentium? Non-enthusiasts often buy cheaper PCs that are likely to be running these lower grade processors (and traditional hard drives) rather than the more expensive Core CPUs. Nobody's reviewed these Optane cache drives yet but this restriction seems likely to narrow their potential audience. Why this matters: While this first release of Optane Memory may not excite hardcore gaming enthusiasts, the future for the technology could still be bright. When Intel and Micron first announced 3D XPoint—the technology that Optane products use—the companies promised nothing short of a revolution. 3D XPoint could function as both volatile and non-volatile memory with 1,000 times the performance and endurance of NAND-based SSDs, they claimed. This first effort for consumer-grade Optane gear doesn’t come close to that. But with Optane SSDs for servers rolling out in 2017, who knows what the future will bring? The idea of a full-blown, standalone Optane SSD is still tantalizing indeed. Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 More from Microsoft Windows 10 Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel: Not all 10nm chips are equal (and ours are better than yours) 03/29/2017 at 11:13 AM by Brad Linder 6 Comments Samsung and Qualcomm may be some of the first chip makers to bring 10nm processors to market, but Intel wants you to know that not all chips built using a 10nm process are the same… and that its upcoming 10nm chips will be “a full generation ahead” of the competition. Basically the idea is that a move to a new node should result in doubling the transistor density, improving performance and efficiency. Intel says it’s doing that with the move from 14nm chips to 10nm chips… but claims that competitors are not. Overall, Intel says its upcoming 10nm chips will offer up to 25 percent better performance and use 45 percent less power than equivalent chips manufactured using 14nm technology… and that’s before you account for other features Intel is baking into its upcoming chips that should boost performance even more. Intel This doesn’t mean that the latest chips from Qualcomm or Samsung, or upcoming MediaTek processors won’t benefit from the transition to 10nm. But the gains might be more modest in some situations. Of course, this is largely a discussion of transistor density. There are plenty of other differences between Intel’s upcoming 10nm chips for laptop, desktop, and server computers and the 10nm ARM-based chips for smartphones and other mobile devices that mean comparing an Intel Cannonlake processor and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chip might be like comparing bananas and plantains (sure, there are similarities, but you generally eat them in very different ways).

Now all I need is to do is find a use for all those floating point adders and dozen mov instructions, vectorize and unroll all my loops with pure assembly and rewrite everything else in C++ since only templates has any hope at taking advantage of all those proprietary instructions. RISC always had less logic transistors then CISC. That’s the whole point of using fewer and more generic instructions. To free up space for cache and allow flexible and generic programming and easier branch prediction. It’s literally the text-book answer… Honestly, who comes up with this stuff?

There are other advantages to RISC and CISC on RISC. But since space is less of a limitation, maybe it’s time to start reexamining RISC. Computer engineers come up with this stuff. Did you actually not know that? Do you think reduced power consumption is not worth it?

Both GCC and VisualC++ fail to unroll most loops. If they could, we’d all be using EPICItaniums by now and your GPU would still be a VLIW instead of a RISC. As for floating point adders, there’s plenty of studies doing statistical analysis on general purpose code showing those are under-used 80% of the time outside of server farms. It’s why you won’t find too many of those on mobile SoCs or even desktops to some extent. >Do you think reduced power consumption is not worth it? That’s 45% off Intel’s equivalent 14nm. Compared to their competition they’re still behind by a long stretch.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. I did check GCC output meticulously when writing my data processing programs. It did unroll loops properly where I needed them. Like I said, if you’re not doing float math, give the adders to me. I’ll make use of them. So… because they’re behind the competition… progress isn’t worth it? Might as well give up and just throw all the other performance advantages in the bin? Ok.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 31, 2017 at 12:15PM In the second half of this year, processor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to launch the first of its next-generation family of computer processors, marketed as eighth-generation Core. The first products to roll out are expected to be a family of chips currently code-named Kaby Lake Refresh, with products code-named Coffee Lake (for higher-end/higher-performance systems) following in the first half of 2018. Kaby Lake Refresh will be what Intel calls a "U" series processor. U-series chips tend to be Intel's highest-volume runners, targeting the bulk of the notebook personal computer market, as the slide below illustrates: Image source: AnandTech via WCCFTech. The Kaby Lake Refresh parts will come in what Intel refers to as a "4+2" configuration, meaning that it will have four processor cores paired with a graphics processor in a GT2 configuration (the "middle-of-the-road" graphics configuration from Intel). At Intel's recent Technology and Manufacturing Day, the company let slip some details about the upcoming Kaby Lake Refresh products. Let's take a look. Confirming core count, talking about frequency Intel executive Murthy Renduchintala showed the following slide: Image source: Intel. The purpose of this slide was to show investors that Intel is committed to improving its manufacturing technology performance and product designs to deliver better stuff each year. In the fine print found at the bottom of the slide, Intel provides details about the system configurations used to generate the claims with respect to chip performance. Intel's headline claim is that its eighth-generation Core processor family will deliver ">15% better performance" compared to its current-generation seventh-generation Core chips. Of course, the devil is in the details (or, in this case, the fine print). First, the fine print confirms that the chip will pack four cores, up from the two cores present on the company's current Kaby Lake-U series chips. Furthermore, Intel says that the upcoming Kaby Lake Refresh 4+2 chip will run at a maximum single-core turbo speed of 4GHz (+2.56% from the top Kaby Lake-U 2+2 part, though there is a 2+3e part currently available that offers 4GHz single-core turbo ). The combination of more cores and ever-so-slightly higher-frequency cores appears to allow Intel to deliver upon its claimed ">15%" performance improvement. It's worth noting, however, that Intel says that this performance estimate is a pre-silicon estimate (meaning that the number comes from simulations and not from measuring an actual chip) and that pre-silicon estimates have a "+/- 7% margin of error." Also, Intel explicitly says that these performance comparisons refer to the "top bin" (that is, the best chips) parts within each respective product family, so the gains elsewhere in the product stack might not be as large as those being claimed here. This is how Intel is leveraging 14-nanometer++ In a previous article, I went over Intel's claims about the 14-nanometer++ technology that will be used to manufacture the eighth-generation Core processor family. Intel claims that its 14-nanometer++ technology offers 26% better performance than its original 14-nanometer technology and so, by extension, it delivers roughly 12.5% better performance than its current 14-nanometer+ technology. What Intel seems to be doing is using these more powerful/power efficient transistors to boost the number of cores that it can cram into a low-power notebook processor. This is an interesting design choice, as Intel has spent many years focusing on trying to improve the per-core performance of its notebook and desktop processors (through a combination of frequency boosts and architectural gains) while keeping core counts stagnant. More cores should allow for dramatically higher performance in applications that can take advantage of multiple cores and should also serve to improve multi-tasking performance. It will be interesting to see if "more cores" ultimately proves to be a successful marketing point in the segment into which Intel will be selling Kaby Lake Refresh. Foolish takeaway At the end of the day, Intel wants to deliver new chips at a predictable annual cadence because Intel's own customers -- the companies that design and market personal computers -- really want new chips to build new systems around. What Intel is doing with its eighth-generation Core processors is leveraging improved manufacturing technology to be able to stuff more processor cores into a given thermal design power. This is a reasonable move given that the Kaby Lake Refresh/Coffee Lake were probably "late" additions to the company's product road map, but Intel can't rely on core count increases indefinitely.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Intel’s enhanced 10nm tech to bring up to 40 percent performance boost over 14nm Intel’s enhanced 10nm tech to bring up to 40 percent performance boost over 14nm Matthew Wilson 14 hours ago CPU, Featured Tech News Earlier this week, Intel held its own ‘tech day’ during which it went over various technologies it is currently working on. One of the major points of the presentation was the upcoming 10nm process node, which Intel claims is a ‘full generation ahead’ of the 10nm technology competing chip makers are using, including Samsung, TSMC, Qualcomm and others. So what is so different about Intel’s 10nm tech compared to its rivals? Well for starters, it uses third-generation FinFET technology, but there is a bit more to it than that. One of the key focusses for Intel when it comes to 10nm is Hyper Scaling, which allows Intel to “continue the benefits of Moore’s Law economics by delivering transistors that are smaller and have lower cost-per-transistor”. We can see Intel’s example of this in the graph below, which was published as part of the press materials for this event. With Intel’s 10nm node, the company claims it can deliver a 2.7x improvement in transistor density compared with its 14nm products. This is achieved due to the ‘minimum gate pitch’ shrinking from 70nm down to 54nm and the minimum metal pitch coming down from 52nm to 36nm. This enables a logic transistor density of 100.8 mega transistors per mm squared, which is estimated to be double that of competing 10nm chips. Aside from that, Intel’s jump from 14nm to 10nm will bring further improvements. The latest process node is said to deliver up to 25 percent better performance at a 45 percent lower power draw. An upcoming enhanced version of the 10nm process known as ’10++’ will boost this performance benefit by an additional 15 percent, while reducing power draw by a further 30 percent. KitGuru Says: While other companies might already be out of the gate with 10nm products, it sounds like Intel’s own node is much more refined. If Intel’s 10nm CPUs can really deliver those performance advantages, coupled with reduced power draw, then this could end up being a big generational leap.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags 10nm Intel news Previous Head down to MSI’s fan day and you could win some big prizes Check Also Mad Catz has ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy After a year or so of struggling financially, laying off staff and even getting delisted … CNFUZD Guys, april fools is only tomorrow, and no one is falling for the 40% performance increase joke anymore, anyway. It stopped being funny long ago 😛 Alex Ray its easy though, they release the CPU they’ve kept in storage for years since AMD has been garbage until recently. plus, they add the secret sauce, half way decent thermal paste under the lid. CNFUZD Remember, coffee lake (end of this year or some such) is still 14nm, so this 10nm is not something we’ll see for at least another year if not more. If they want to stop AMD from taking back market share, they better bring the secret sauce and all that jazz with coffee lake, not in another 12-16 months, by then the damage is done.

By Ian Paul Contributor, PCWorld | Mar 31, 2017 8:47 AM PT Credit: Intel More like this Intel's Optane: What users can expect in PCs and when it will ship Intel claims storage speed record with first large-capacity Optane SSD Intel's silence on Optane SSDs raises questions about launch and focus Video Let's Play Thimbleweed Park Intel’s revolutionary new non-volatile Optane Memory wants to make hard drives as fast as SSDs, but apparently not if you bought a PC on the cheap. The super-fast Optane Memory M.2 drives announced Monday not only require a Kaby Lake processor, but a Core one at that, as first spotted by The Tech Report. According to Intel’s ARK database and Optane website, Kaby Lake-based Celeron and Pentium processors aren’t supported.  That’s puzzling because these new Optane Memory drives target mainstream PCs rather than enthusiast systems, supercharging the performance of traditional hard drive. With an Optane M.2 drive installed, Intel promises speeds close to that of an SSD in some scenarios. The Optane Memory does this by caching your regular tasks, such as launching a particular program or game. The launch time then gets faster with each successive operation. It’s an interesting idea, and one that appeared easy to implement in Intel-controlled tests we performed at Optane’s launch event. But if this first round of Optane Memory is aimed at speeding up non-enthusiast PCs, why not support Celeron and Pentium? Non-enthusiasts often buy cheaper PCs that are likely to be running these lower grade processors (and traditional hard drives) rather than the more expensive Core CPUs. Nobody's reviewed these Optane cache drives yet but this restriction seems likely to narrow their potential audience. Why this matters: While this first release of Optane Memory may not excite hardcore gaming enthusiasts, the future for the technology could still be bright. When Intel and Micron first announced 3D XPoint—the technology that Optane products use—the companies promised nothing short of a revolution. 3D XPoint could function as both volatile and non-volatile memory with 1,000 times the performance and endurance of NAND-based SSDs, they claimed. This first effort for consumer-grade Optane gear doesn’t come close to that. But with Optane SSDs for servers rolling out in 2017, who knows what the future will bring? The idea of a full-blown, standalone Optane SSD is still tantalizing indeed. To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

No Creds in Intel (Image by George Eliason)   Permission   Details   DMCA - Advertisement - The Vault 7 expose' by WikiLeaks neglected to mention the most important part of the disclosure. Sure, the CIA has all these tools available. Yes, they are used on the public. The important part is; it's not the CIA that's using them. That's the part that needs to frighten you. The CIA, by the definition of its mission, cannot use the tools in Vault 7, and definitely not on Americans. All the tools are unclassified, open-source, and can be used by anyone. It makes them not exactly usable for secret agent work. That's what makes it impossible for them to use Vault 7 tools directly. Because of the possible exposure for the agency, use of the tools was farmed out. - Advertisement - Instead, they are there for subcontractors to use. Are you worried about your TV watching you? Has your car developed the habit of starting itself in the morning? If these tools were solely in the hands of a US agency, you would be much safer. The agencies have limits on what they can do and agencies have oversight providing protections. Instead, intelligence and counterterrorism tools are in the hands of people that make most of their money pushing political agendas forward. And there is no oversight for what they are doing with the tools. In March 2015 , I started writing about private NSA guns for hire. These hired guns work in the revolving door between government Intel and counterterrorism and private intel and counterterrorism. What it showed was the same people that worked for US agencies and trained them were using the same tools and methods on Americans that they used for terrorist hunting. And they brag about it in social media. - Advertisement - The same people that take counterterrorism measures against Al Qaeda, are free to use those tools on you. According to CNN, Aaron Weisburd models his methods on the no-holds-barred Al Qaeda model. From CBS News -"sources close to U.S. intelligence as saying that "hackers knocked out Al Qaeda's online means of communication, thus preventing them from posting anything to commemorate 911 anniversary." The paper also said Western intelligence suspects two hackers were responsible: Aaron Weisburd from Internet Haganah and Rusty Shackleford from the web group My Pet Jawa." According to Sputnik News "As much as 80 percent of the US National Security Agency's (NSA) budget is privatized, demonstrating the merger between Washington and corporate organizations, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said Tuesday." This means that up to 80% of that budget is going to people in the private sector that are also working on other agendas, including their own. That's why we see more headlines like "NSA staff used spy tools on spouses, exlovers:watchdog." or "The Crazy Emails That Took Down NSA Spook John Schindler." Both articles show contractors use Vault 7 tools for their own domestic spying or revenge. In May 2015, the Nation published an article that is a must read to grasp how dangerous this has become. I've written intensively on how these tools are used to create news and policy from a ground and company level for NGO's and lobbyists. This article ratchets it up by looking at the policy makers and former agency heads that go into the private Intel and policy crafting business for hire. According to The Nation "These are the people--often referred to as "intelligence professionals"--who do the actual analytical and targeting work of the NSA and other agencies in America's secret government. Over the last 15 years, thousands of former high-ranking intelligence officials and operatives have left their government posts and taken up senior positions at military contractors, consultancies, law firms, and private-equity firms. In their new jobs, they replicate what they did in government--often for the same agencies they left. But this time, their mission is strictly for-profit." What does this have to do with overhauling the ODNI and 17 Intel agencies? Everything. From oversight to policy, the level of non-partisan professionalism needed to conduct unbiased intelligence work is no longer there. The Vault 7 leak could well be an inside attempt to address these issues. - Advertisement - "In the intelligence community in the United States, there are certain disgruntled individuals [concerned] about the way operations are being run, and it's obvious that material has come out that was felt by some of these individuals needed to be discussed," Kampmark explained." The ODNI and its agencies descent into shambles have been three presidencies in the making. Why a shambles? When intelligence is based on political agendas, rumor, or speculation instead of facts, it's in trouble. All of it was done in the name of getting faster intelligence and making actionable Intel available to members of Congress that had no business getting involved with classified, need to know basis intelligence.

Governments paid them and gave them a license known as a letter of marque to murder, pillage and rape enemies of the state. In the last few decades, with the binge of privatization of government functions, the pirate industry has been booming. From Blackwater to Booz Allen Hamilton, privateers are running amok doing the dirty work of governments that would be illegal if the government itself did it. Modern pirates work hand in glove with the government, corporations and oligarchs. With a wink, a nod, and a multimillion dollar contract modern pirates can literally get away with murder and they will not be reported, investigated and prosecuted. Anyone who becomes an enemy of the state should be worried. That especially means political dissidents, activists, protesters and political mavericks. Google, Apple and Comcast are watching you. They are doing it for marketing reasons and to squeal on you to the deep state for big bucks. With plenty of information about you from technology, and not too much imagination anyone can be dragged from their home by the law, jailed, prosecuted and imprisoned by creatively connecting the dots to make anyone look like a subversive, terrorist and a danger to the "domestic tranquility", as mentioned in the preamble to the US Constitution. That goes double for politicians who cross the deep state. Honey traps, charges of corruption and being a Russian spy are not coincidences for troublemakers. I don't believe in coincidences anymore, whether it is Antony Weiner, Eliot Spitzer, Gary Webb, Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, David Petraeus, Donald Trump, Devin Nunes, or YOU.

Why? Because the legal cover they work under is the old privateer laws. Literally. They get paid for the amount of damage they inflict on reputation, income, or costs of internet property repair. Another side of it offline is taking the information and getting people fired by naming them security threats to the state and threatening the business people work for. These operators threaten the ISPs that carry your service.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Intel claims three-year advantage on 10nm, wants to redefine process nodes Intel claims three-year advantage on 10nm, wants to redefine process nodes By Joel Hruska on March 31, 2017 at 9:27 am Comment Intel had a tech day this week to discuss the future of its own 14nm and 10nm chips, and it laid out some impressive claims in the process. It also laid out what it believes is a better metric for calculating process nodes in the future, though we suspect TSMC, Samsung, and GloFo may all disagree. Intel’s presentation focused mainly on two related topics: The strength and characteristics of its 10nm node, and its proposal for a new (or rather, a return to an old) method of calculating process node scaling. Intel drives “hyperscaling” at the 10nm node Intel is claiming that its 10nm node will deliver a 2.7x improvement in transistor density compared with its 14nm products. That’s a significant jump over its 14nm products, and it’s not just the result of the improvements to various semiconductor manufacturing metrics. Intel has improved its 10nm scaling compared with 14nm through the use of two specific new technologies — single dummy gate, and contact-over-active-gate. Typically, logic cells use a pair of what are called “dummy gates” to isolate each cell from its neighbors. Intel has found a method of using just one dummy gate instead of using a pair of them, and has managed to recover significant space savings as a result. Each gate has multiple contacts that connect to the metal layers within a CPU. Typically, these contacts are offset from the gate. At 10nm, Intel is moving the contact to directly under the gate, which frees up additional transistor space. All of these advantages combined is why Intel is claiming such significant improvements compared with 14nm. The slides below includes visualizations of these improvements and how they collectively improve Intel’s 10nm process node. All slides can be clicked on to expand them in a new window. The general thrust of Intel’s argument is that these new technologies will give it a significant lead over its rivals and competitors in the foundry space. Intel vs. everyone at the 10nm node One major point of Intel’s presentation is actually something we’ve discussed before: When TSMC, Samsung, GlobalFoundries and Intel talk about 14nm, the process nodes they discuss are not identical. Each foundry has implemented different feature sizes and each of their nodes (16nm/12nm for TSMC, 14nm for Samsung and GF) has its own distinct characteristics. To some extent, the modern definition of a node has become “The bucket of technologies we periodically dump in to improve some aspects of transistor density, power consumption, and performance enough to justify moving to a new number.” The problem, at least for Intel, is that when a company like Samsung announces 10nm production, that’s actually roughly equivalent to Intel’s 14nm, which debuted in 2014. To get around this issue, Intel has described a method for calculating process node size that would weight certain factors differently than they are weighted today. Intel’s Process Architecture and Integration Director, Mark Bohr, described the formula in an editorial published by Intel: One simple metric is gate pitch (gate width plus spacing between transistor gates) multiplied by minimum metal pitch (interconnect line width plus spacing between lines), but this doesn’t incorporate logic cell design, which affects the true transistor density. Another metric, gate pitch multiplied by logic cell height, is a step in the right direction with regard to this deficiency. But neither of these takes into account some second order design rules… At the other extreme, simply taking the total transistor count of a chip and dividing by its area is not meaningful because of the large number of design decisions that can affect it – factors such as cache sizes and performance targets can cause great variations in this value. It’s time to resurrect a metric that was used in the past but fell out of favor several nodes ago. It is based on the transistor density of standard logic cells and includes weighting factors that account for typical designs. While there is a large variety of standard cells in any library, we can take one ubiquitous, very simple one – a 2-input NAND cell (4 transistors) – and one that is more complex but also very common: a scan flip flop (SFF). This leads to a previously accepted formula for transistor density: (The weightings 0.6 and 0.4 reflect the ratio of very small and very large cells in typical designs.) Every chip maker, when referring to a process node, should disclose its logic transistor density in units of MTr/mm2 (millions of transistors per square millimeter) as measured by this simple formula. Reverse engineering firms can readily verify the data. Measuring process node metrics in this fashion would give Intel an obvious advantage over all of its rivals. As such, it’s hard to imagine they’ll ever endorse it. Whether its TSMC with a new “12nm” node or potential future gaps between the various pure-play foundries at 7nm, nobody but Intel will substantially benefit from measuring process nodes differently, even if Intel’s method is more accurate. The slides below steps through some of Intel’s transistor density comparisons against its competitors’ nodes, as well as how it compares against them on specific metrics and how large it expects the gaps to be at 10nm. We can’t speak to the accuracy of Intel’s projections for its competitors at 10nm, but the company’s general projection matches what we’ve seen at the 14nm node. With Intel taking on more foundry customers (or trying to), it doubtlessly sees this as a potential barrier to those efforts. What’s the point of calling a node “10nm” (from Intel’s perspective) if that artificially inflates the value of what your competitors’ are selling and diminishes your own value? The other interesting question is how much these advantages will practically matter going forward. When Intel intended to break into the tablet and smartphone markets to compete directly against ARM, it had an obvious rationale for comparing its own performance against Samsung, GlobalFoundries, and TSMC. Today, Intel and the pure-play foundries once again move in different circles — but that could change in the future if Intel can land some significant foundry deals. The other reason foundry die shrinks aren’t as interesting as they used to be is for the simple reason that they don’t deliver much in the way of improved performance any more, at least not outside specific market segments. Six years ago, the Core i5-2537M was a Sandy Bridge-era core clocked at 1.4GHz base / 2.3GHz Turbo with a TDP of 17W. Today, Intel’s Core i5-7300U is a 15W chip with a 2.6GHz base clock and a 3.5GHz Turbo. It’s TDP is 15W. Intel, in other words, improved the base clock by 1.86x and the boost clock by 1.52x all while trimming the TDP. But in the desktop space, performance gains have been rarer, overclocking headroom has shrunk, and frequency gains have been doled out very sparingly. Intel has absolutely made progress over this time, but not at anything like a quick pace. Again, that’s not the company’s fault — it’s related, as we’ve said before, more to the difficulties with scaling silicon than anything — but with AMD surging back into the CPU fight, Intel may find itself under increased pressure to demonstrate that its 10nm hardware can do more than look impressively futuristic in a variety of graphs.  Intel’s full presentations are available for download, if you’d care to flip through them yourself.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 31, 2017 at 10:30AM In the middle of 2017, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to launch its next-generation processor family targeted at the server market, based on its Skylake server architecture. These chips promise to deliver significant improvements in both processor performance and efficiency while also delivering a lot of new platform-level features as well. These new chips, per website ServeTheHome, will be manufactured using Intel's 14-nanometer+ manufacturing technology. This technology, Intel has said, delivers a 12% performance boost relative to the company's first-generation 14-nanometer technology that's used to manufacture its current generation Broadwell-based server processors. Image source: Intel. That process technology enhancement, coupled with the significant architectural/design improvements that Intel plans to bring with the new Skylake Server chips, should make for a compelling improvement to the chipmaker's data center processor product line. What's interesting, though, is that at the company's Technology and Manufacturing Day hosted on March 28, Intel executive Murthy Renduchintala said that the company intends to update all its product lines at an annual cadence. Presumably, this includes Intel's data center processor lineup. Here's how I expect Intel to refresh this product line next year. What comes after 14-nanometer+? At the Technology and Manufacturing Day, Intel said that it plans to go into production on a new variant of its 14-nanometer technology, known as 14-nanometer++, later this year. This technology will first be used to build the company's eighth-generation Core processors for personal computers later this year, and it promises to deliver roughly a 12.5% performance enhancement over the company's 14-nanometer+ technology. Image source: Intel. Since it is unlikely that Intel's 10-nanometer or 10-nanometer+ technologies will be in good enough shape to build enormous server processors next year -- and considering that Intel has publicly said that its 10-nanometer and 10-nanometer+ technologies will offer lower performance than its 14-nanometer++ technology -- Intel is more likely to update its server processor product line by migrating it to the 14-nanometer++ technology. Bigger, but better, chips Intel has said that the transistor gate pitch of its 14-nanometer++ technology is 84-nanometers, up quite a bit from the 70-nanometers of its 14-nanometer and 14-nanometer+ technologies. In a nutshell, this means that Intel not only won't see an area reduction in moving from 14-nanometer+ to 14-nanometer++, but it could see chip area grow somewhat. That said, data center customers aren't buying chip area, they're buying performance and power efficiency. Ideally for said customers, Intel would be able to offer the better-performing (and slightly larger) chips for the same prices as the prior-generation products; in that case, the slight chip size increase would be completely irrelevant to Intel's customers (though this could potentially mean slight margin erosion for Intel). However, even if the chip size increase drives up prices a smidgen -- perhaps commensurate with any cost structure increase Intel would incur from the larger chip sizes -- data center customers might not care too much if the performance increase is compelling enough. Better than nothing The bottom line is this: Even if Intel delivers "just" a manufacturing technology improvement to its data center product line in 2018 without any significant changes in the architecture, core count, and so on, then that's still better than delivering nothing at all. What will be interesting to see, then, is what Intel brings to this market in the 2019 time frame and beyond. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Happily, Rex Tillerson, former ExxonMobil CEO and Donald Trump's Secretary of State, passed his early-hours test – it happened in impoverished Yemen. But the jury is out on his emails. There is a tantalising probe into the extent to which ExxonMobil misled shareholders on the impact of their products on climate change that bubbles along in New York and which may, or may not, prove embarrassing for Tillerson. The Yemen business was a try-on by a Yemeni prime minister who, after three days of haggling in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, had struck a big-ticket energy deal with the young Tillerson – or so Tillerson believed. Related Content Rex Tillerson and James Mattis in charm offensive to reassure worried US allies Tillerson urges other countries to cough up more for war on IS An exhausted Tillerson had crashed, sleeping ahead of a 6am flight home to Texas. But his phone rang at close to 3am – it was the PM, demanding an immediate reopening of the negotiations. Tillerson hauled himself back to the government bunker – the Yemeni played hardball, Tillerson didn't blink. "The Prime Minister tried to retrade the deal and Rex just basically just said 'No,'" Politico magazine was told. And this, a Tillerson associate explained, was proof that "Rex can say 'No', and do so in a way that is not offensive and doesn't create unnecessary battles – the government of Yemen wasn't going away and we needed to deal with it." Advertisement The gist of the email business is this – ExxonMobil is accused of replicating the tactics of big tobacco, funding climate change deniers, despite knowing its energy products contributed to climate change, just as the tobacco giants covered up that their products were killing their customers. Responding to a demand for documents by New York State Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman, ExxonMobil reluctantly revealed the existence of a trove of Tillerson's emails, sent as CEO but under the alias "Wayne Tracker", which had been "lost" for reasons the company insists are innocent. Schneiderman is plugging away and ultimately ExxonMobil and Tillerson may be cleared, but for now the optics are a messy reminder of Clinton's obsessive and ill-judged need for secrecy in the saga of her emails.

It's early days and he does have strong defenders. But in switching from being his own master to serving Donald Trump, from being answerable to 2.5 million narrowly focused shareholders to being accountable to more than 300 million citizens of all views and opinions, Tillerson is widely criticised for failing to project himself and his issues; of being cowed by a bullyboy President and his inner circle; and of failing to grasp, or to be even mildly interested in, the survival essentials of bureaucratic and political life. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Beijing. Photo: AP The new Secretary of State is cast as the hermit of Foggy Bottom, a cognomen the State Department takes from the DC quarter in which it is located. Some of Tillerson's senior management walked out even before his Senate confirmation and on arriving he showed more the door. The White House refuses to allow him to make his own senior appointments, and, something of a sacrilege in Washington, he shuns the media. "He's isolated and he's not using the leverage of his office," Ilan Goldenberg, of the Centre for a New American Security, told Fairfax Media. "He's fundamentally disconnected – people at the State Department don't know what's happening on the seventh floor." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link A North Korean soldier taking a photograph while Rex Tillerson visits the border of South and North Korea. Photo: AP If Tillerson is strangely absent from the brightly lit Washington stage, he is mentioned only obliquely in wonkish assessments of the Trump national security team, which, generally, focus on the role in government of Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, of National Security Adviser General H. R. McMaster and of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. As with other Washington portfolios, the self-styled "wrecking ball" Trump is disruptive when it comes to foreign policy. He'll happily take out his angst with the world on Twitter, thereby requiring his cabinet appointees to wind back positions more in keeping with the challenging credo of the Bannon-Miller axis, than they are with the more conservative, establishment thinking of the likes of Mattis, McMasters and Tillerson. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Rex Tillerson with US President Donald Trump at a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. Photo: AP In January, Team Trump hailed Tillerson's nomination, claiming it would "help reverse years of misguided foreign policies and actions that [had] weakened" the standing of the US in the world. But the new man is no carbon copy of his leader and neither is he as two-dimensional as depicted in some media profiles. While Trump was leaning towards lifting sanctions on Moscow, imposed after his annexation of Crimea, Tillerson told his Senate confirmation hearing that the West should be alarmed by Russian aggression; unlike Trump, he voiced strong support for the US commitment to NATO and he endorsed US arms for Ukraine, to help it to repel Russia's push into its territory. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link China's President Xi Jinping with Rex Tillerson in Beijing. Photo: AP In Beijing earlier this month, Tillerson displayed more realpolitik than Trump belligerence in his dealing with Chinese officials – to the point of using Chinese phraseology, which was read in the Chinese capital as his endorsement of the Chinese belief that Washington should embrace China's stand on the South China and East China Seas and Taiwan and on human rights in Tibet and Xinjiang. ExxonMobil is defending its record on climate change. But Tillerson can claim that it was on his watch as CEO that the energy behemoth embraced scientific arguments on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change – which anchors him more in scientific reality than Trump. And philosophically, he's a global free trader – again putting him at odds with the President. In a conference speech in 2007 he declared: "Energy made in America is not as important as energy simply made wherever it is most economic." As national president of the Boy Scouts in the US, it was through Tillerson's advocacy that the movement agreed to accept gay members. And he is a former director of the United Negro College Fund, a group that funds scholarships for black students and supports historically black colleges and universities in the US. Still, Steve Coll sees great irony in Tillerson's appointment. The author of Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power, Coll writes in The New Yorker: "Some of the Exxon executives I interviewed spoke about Washington with disdain, if not contempt. They regarded the State Department as generally unhelpful, a bureaucracy of liberal career diplomats who were biased against oil and incompetent when it came to sensitive and complex oil-deal negotiations. They managed Congress defensively, and as just one capital among many in the world, a place more likely to produce trouble for Exxon than benefits. "In nominating Tillerson, Trump is handing the State Department to a man who has worked his whole life running a parallel quasi-state, for the benefit of shareholders, fashioning relationships with foreign leaders that may or may not conform to the interests of the United States government." Tillerson is a unique appointment. His entire career has been in the service of ExxonMobil and he takes office having done neither government nor military service. But he knows his way around the world and he knows how to cut a deal – though the manner of some have raised eyebrows. Trump did not go into specifics on the appointment, but some analysts have picked on the President's narrow focus on the intersection of foreign policy and US economic interest – as borne out in Trump's "take the oil" claim on Iraq and his short-lived willingness to use Taiwan as a bargaining chit with Beijing. On one level, Tillerson is a novice. On another he's not. In running ExxonMobil, he presided over a global staff of 75,000 with operations in as many as 200 countries and constantly having to finesse deals with the likes of Vladimir Putin in Russia; Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, Idriss Deby in Chad and Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen. "Those early assignments where I worked internationally and the things I learned there have served me well ever since," Tillerson told an interviewer in 2007. It remains to be seen how he'll get along with Baghdad, given a 2011 oil development deal he cut with the Iraqi Kurds – he left the central Iraqi government out and undercut Washington's support for a national deal under which Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis would benefit from the country's vast oil reserves. He became very close to Putin who awarded him Order of Friendship in 2013. Some analysts are troubled by Tillerson's settling-in at the State Department. They see no push-back against a White House takeover – Trump wants to cut Tillerson's budget by about 30 per cent; Trump, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and strategist Stephen Bannon are seen to be running a parallel "State Department" from the White House; Tillerson is locked out on the appointment of envoys; and Trump has twice embarrassed Tillerson while he has been abroad – blasting China via Twitter for not doing enough to ease the North Korea crisis while Tillerson was in Beijing; and crowing about how he'd be getting rid of "bad dudes" from the US while Tillerson was in Mexico City. Inside-the-beltway conspiracy theorists speculate that Bannon is calculatedly attempting to sideline the State Department, citing as proof the very public warning by now sacked National Security Adviser Mike Flynn that Iran was "on notice" not to attempt further missile tests, and the quashing of Tillerson's move to appoint former Bush official Elliott Abrams as his deputy. Tufts University's Professor Daniel Drezner is scathing. He told Fairfax Media: " It's possible [Tillerson] will learn the lie of the land and be competent, but there is zero evidence. Beyond Trump's [belated] adherence to the One China policy, I've seen nothing [Tillerson] has done that is constructive ... and he seems to be willfully alienating the State Department." Henry Kissinger, the grandee of Republican foreign policy, was diplomatic after meeting Tillerson. "The normal tendency when you come into that job is to increase your visibility and to show that you are present and in charge," he told The New York Times. "[But] he wanted to first inform himself of all the nuances. I was impressed by the confidence and self-assurance that he showed." Tillerson is seldom seen and not often heard – he shuns public appearances; is absent from media coverage of Trump's meetings with foreign leaders; and is seemingly resigned to the White House making the final decision on who is to work at State and to Trump's plans to hack into his budget. Theories on his low-key arrival are many – he wants to lock in key administration relationships before committing himself on policy; he's waiting for the dust to settle in the factional wars at the White House; and that at the end of the day, he's an energy CEO – you cut a deal, you go home and you say as little as possible. Some foreign diplomats and former officials reject the intensity of media criticism of Tillerson, and particularly of his reluctance to have the press travel with him. Former senior Obama appointee and Asia policy expert Evan Medeiros told Politico: "that's Washington navel-gazing. That's not what the region is preoccupied with ... [The Chinese in particular] like to deal with people that are cool, careful, discreet — but very credible interlocutors. And I think right now they see Tillerson like that." Explaining himself in a rare interview, Tillerson said: "I'm not a big media press access person. I personally don't need it ... When I have something important and useful to say, I know where everybody is and I know how to go out there and say it. "But if I don't because we're still formulating and we're still deciding what we're going to do, there is not going to be a lot to say." Suzanne Maloney, a former ExxonMobil staffer now at the Brookings Institution, rushed to Tillerson's defence on Twitter: "Oil folks know stuff: anyone who manages multibillion-dollar, multi-decade projects needs deep, nuanced understanding of political context … Tillerson rose to top of a company that prizes technical excellence, rock-solid financials, hard work and integrity. State could do a lot worse." But a worry, as expressed by Thomas Wright of the Brookings Institution, is though Trump may be getting boxed in on much of the foreign and national security agenda by the establishment sensibilities of Mattis, McMasters and Tillerson, at age 70 this President is not likely to change, because he feels vindicated by winning the election "after a lifetime of howling at the moon". So how will Trump respond when, inevitably, he gets the 3am call? Will his national security team get time to reel him in, or might they have conditioned him in time to be as measured as Americans need him to be when the balloon goes? What will be Tillerson's role in all that? Trump picked this Secretary of State on the recommendation of former defence secretary and CIA director Robert Gates – a Bush appointee kept on by Obama. This is how Gates celebrated Tillerson's credentials in January, during the latter's Senate confirmation hearing: "Against a backdrop of having known, or worked with 12 secretaries of state, I believe Mr Tillerson is superbly qualified ... He is deeply knowledgeable about the international scene and geopolitics. And importantly, would be an informed and independent adviser to the President."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News Why Intel Now Has a Huge Advantage in Self-Driving Cars Tech analysts will tell you that chip giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it’s a big player in personal computers, which isn’t exactly a growth market . And it has been seen as lagging rivals in the emerging artificial-intelligence space. But it took a huge step into autonomous vehicles when it announced a $15.3 billion deal to acquire Mobileye N.V. (NYSE: MBLY) earlier this month. I think that makes it worth a closer look. Here’s why. Mobileye’s co-founder, Amnon Shashua, announcing a partnership with Intel and BMW last year. Image source: Mobileye N.V. Why Intel paid a fortune for Mobileye Intel is paying $15.3 billion for Mobileye, seemingly a huge price for a company that generated just over $358 million-with-an-m in revenue last year. Why? The key is that Mobileye is the closest thing to a pure play in self-driving vehicles, at least among public companies. Mobileye makes chips and software that process images and that are designed from the ground up to be used in cars. They’re already critical components of today’s advanced driver-assist systems, and they’ll be critical to tomorrow’s self-driving vehicles as well. Put another way, Mobileye has proven technology that will have an important role in the autonomous vehicles of the near future. It also has something else, which might be just as valuable: Credibility with automakers. Mobileye’s current client list includes nearly all of the world’s automakers. That’s important because the auto industry can be a tough market for a technology company to crack. But Intel won’t have to crack it, because Mobileye has already done so. And rather than folding Mobileye into Intel, the chip giant plans to go the other way, keeping Mobileye’s sales force and management team intact while expanding its range of offerings to include Intel’s products. Mobileye opens up a huge new market for Intel So how big is the opportunity for Intel here? As Intel sees it, it’s huge. CEO Brian Krzanich thinks of self-driving cars as „data centers on wheels,” with good reason. The computer processing power that will be required in cars with the most basic Level 4 self-driving systems is roughly a hundred times the computing power in today’s most advanced cars, Krzanich said in a recent presentation. How Intel’s CEO sees the growth opportunity from self-driving cars. Image source: Intel Corporation. That’s a big opportunity for Intel to sell additional hardware to Mobileye’s established client list. How big? Krzanich thinks the total addressable market for vehicle systems will be over $20 billion a year by 2020, and could be $70 billion a year by 2030. On top of that, Krzanich sees a second, related opportunity in the actual data centers that will be needed to provide the „cloud” for all of these interconnected self-driving cars. That won’t be a big new market soon, but it could be up around $40 billion a year by 2030. Whatever its other flaws, Intel is now in a prime position to grab a big piece of that. What Mobileye does for Intel as an investment These new autonomous-vehicle markets could represent substantial top-line growth for Intel. Consider that the chip giant generated $59.4 billion in revenue in 2016. If the markets materialize as Krzanich anticipates, and Intel can take even a third of them…then the $15.3 billion that Intel is paying for Mobileye might look like a bargain in time. As plenty of analysts have pointed out, Intel’s fundamentals today aren’t very exciting. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is just over 12, with a forward dividend yield of 3.1% and a payout ratio of 49%. That’s all decent but not exceptional. What might be exceptional about Intel is that it’s buying itself a gateway to significant future growth. That’s worth a closer look. 10 stocks we like better than Intel When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But the path to do it involves knocking out conservative firebrand Ted Cruz in Texas. Democratic Rep.

But it’s not that easy. Democrats are defending 25 seats, including 10 in states President Donald Trump carried. They would have to hold onto all of those seats and pick up three more held by the GOP—Arizona, Nevada and Texas are the best targets —to take back the majority. ‘A suicide mission’: “I know Beto. And he’s a good guy. But I think this is a suicide mission,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, another Texan and a two-time chairman of the party’s Senate campaign arm. “We haven’t elected a Democrat statewide since … 1994.” If Democrats can legitimately put Texas in play — still an if — it could help propel voter turnout and be a boon for fundraising. “People want to win and they want to play offense. And Texas represents that,” O’Rourke said. Much more from Burgess and yours truly: http://politi.co/2oG1rUU ‘I’M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT CRAZY’ — To score any major legislative wins in the House, Trump will need to convince either a wing of Freedom Caucus members or Democrats to join with Republicans. The president has attacked both groups on Twitter recently, just another example of behavior Democrats say gives them no incentive to offer the White House a helping hand anytime soon. Kind keeping it real: “I do come from a district that did flip to Trump this time but I don’t think they should be reading that as a slam dunk,” said Rep. Ron Kind, one of 12 Democrats sitting in Trump-won House seats. “I’m not going to support crazy up here.” GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin has tried to facilitate outreach between the White House and some moderate Democrats, with mixed success. “Will they attract one or two Democrats on whatever piece of garbage they want to offer? Maybe,” said New Dem Chairman Jim Himes, who is open to sitting down with Trump’s team. But early talk from the White House about corralling a few Democratic votes has to stop, Himes added. “They better leave the ‘picking off’ language behind and start talking about what we would need.” Much more from Kyle and yours truly: http://politi.co/2nRYzai FLYNN SEEKS IMMUNITY DEAL — Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has made a pitch to the FBI and the House and Senate Intel Committees: He’s willing to be interviewed about Russia in exchange for immunity from prosecution. “He has made the offer to the FBI and the House and Senate intelligence committees through his lawyer but has so far found no takers, the officials said,” reports the Wall Street Journal’s Shane Harris, Carol Lee and Julian Barnes. Flynn’s lawyer acknowledged the former Trump aide is seeking “assurances against unfair prosecution” from the House and Senate panels. But a spokesman for the House Intel Committee on Thursday night said that the panel had yet to receive any such request from Flynn. Austin Wright, Josh Meyer and Martin Matishak with more: http://politi.co/2np2315 Limits to that request: “Congress has the power to grant only limited ‘testimonial’ immunity, which means prosecutors cannot use witnesses’ testimony against them in any prosecution. Ultimately, it is Justice’s decision whether to grant immunity from prosecution for any underlying conduct that is discussed, or other matters that don’t come up in testimony,” explain Adam Entous and Ellen Nakashima for the Washington Post. WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS GAVE NUNES INTEL — Three senior White House officials, including a top lawyer for the National Security Council and a former House Intel aide, helped facilitate the sharing of intelligence reports with House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes about Trump associates' communications, reports the New York Times and the Washington Post.

THIS IS FINE, EVERYTHING IS FINE — It was hard to keep track of which Republican was attacking whom as GOP infighting exploded into the open Thursday, drowning out any last ditch efforts to salvage their Obamacare repeal before heading home for the weekend. Trump went after Freedom Caucus leaders Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan and Raul Labrador specifically over the repeal collapse and also more generally threatened to primary members of the caucus on Twitter. ** A message from USP: How do you ensure drug quality in a global economy?

The support from the two red-state Democrats isn’t enough to stave off an all-but-guaranteed filibuster next week. But their endorsement could give other Democrats political cover to vote for Trump’s nominee. Now, some Senate Democrats are complaining Gorsuch is declining to meet with them, Elana and Seung Min report. Coming to a screen near you: The conservative Judicial Crisis Network followed Heitkamp and Manchin’s announcement by rolling out a $1 million ad buy aimed at pressuring the remaining Democratic fence-sitters: Sens. Michael Bennet, Joe Donnelly, Jon Tester, and Claire McCaskill. http://politi.co/2oFUoMe McCaskill’s no-win situation: McCaskill has stopped talking publicly about the battle to confirm Gorsuch. But behind closed doors, she said she is mortified about where the Senate is headed if Gorsuch is blocked and GOP leaders change the filibuster rules, Burgess reports. "I am very comfortable voting against [Gorsuch], but I’m very uncomfortable being part of a strategy that’s going to open up the Supreme Court to a complete change,” McCaskill said at a Missouri fundraiser, in audio first obtained by the Kansas City Star.

Johnny Isakson to the Capitol Thursday – he’s been out for weeks recovering from surgery — to help swing a tied vote targeting funding for Planned Parenthood. Vice President Mike Pence also had to come to the Hill to break the tie. More from Seung Min and Brianna Ehley: http://politi.co/2oEIVfF Johnny’s back: Isakson said that he’d likely be back again next week for the epic fight over the Supreme Court (“I wouldn’t bet against it,” he said with a grin) but he faces a long road to recovery. The genial Georgian seemed in high spirits on Thursday but put it bluntly when asked how long his road to recovery is after two back surgeries: “I have eight more weeks of physical therapy,” he said. GEORGIA ON MY MIND — Republicans are getting nervous that a crowded GOP field could hand Democrats an unexpected win in Georgia’s 6th District, the seat previously held by HHS Secretary Tom Price. “We know that Ossoff is real,” NRCC chairman Steve Stivers told Elena Schneider.

ITSHOW 2017 Search for: Home > News > ASRock Fatal1ty Z270 Gaming K6 Motherboard review News ASRock Fatal1ty Z270 Gaming K6 Motherboard review James Seaton March 27, 20170167 Today we are reviewing the ASRock Fatal1ty Gaming K6 motherboard. On paper, the K6 looks like a really nice board. Its got a nice design and is packed with the latest technologies and gamer oriented features including dual LAN, eight SATA6Gb/s ports, two M.2 slots, RGB lighting and USB 3.1 Type-A and Type-C. Not bad for a more budget oriented board. While Kaby Lake didn’t blow us away with spectacular performance improvements over Skylake, it has allowed motherboard manufacturers to release a new range of motherboards. Though they are not fundamentally different from their predecessors, at least we know they should be optimized and have the bugs ironed out since the underlying architecture is the same. It allowed motherboard manufacturers to go back and fix any mistakes in layout that they could not fix with a BIOS update. Our expectations are high. Here is a look at some of the key specifications. The full specifications can be found here   A quick Z270 & Kaby Lake overview Firstly, lets take a look at an overview of the Z270 platform. There are really only two improvements found with Z270 over Z170. The first of which is an extra 4 PCIe 3.0 lanes coming from the chipset itself. Z170 motherboards often had quite messy scenarios where if you used x M.2 slot, then y SATA port would become unavailable, or z PCIe slot would not function. The extra 4 lanes go a long way to alleviating these issues, allowing more devices to function without compromise. There are limits however, with some motherboards equipped with up to 3x M.2 slots or U.2 ports all requiring PCIe lanes, so careful attention will need to be paid to the individual motherboards specification and lane allocation to ensure it fits your desired needs, especially with multi GPU setups.   The other significant, though for now largely unknown benefit is support for Intel’s Optane technology.  The ultimate market implementations of Optane are pretty much unknown at this point, with unexciting small cache type devices likely to be the first to market,  but whispers indicate there are some pretty cool things in the pipeline. Overall, there really is no need to select a Z170 board over a Z270 board if you are buying new, but on the flipside there is little need to upgrade to Z270 from Z170 unless you require an updated storage feature set. Z270 brings the latest motherboard options right up to date, with M.2, U.2 and some things like updated Realtek ALC 1220 audio. While were talking platform comparisons, lets talk a little about Skylake vs Kaby Lake. The most notable improvement for Kaby Lake over Skylake lies with the improved 14nm+ FinFET process. This has allowed Intel to obtain higher clock frequencies without increasing power. Compared to the 6700K, the 7700K brings a gain 200MHz on the base clock and an impressive 300MHz max turbo frequency whilst keeping the TDP at the same 91W. It’s clear that the 14nm+ process is a very good thing. For Intel to deliver the clock speed improvements with the 7700K whilst maintaining the 91w TDP is significant given the gradual TDP increases we’ve seen from previous generations. These benefits don’t just apply to the top chip. Like for like Kaby Lake/Skylake chips bring a clock speed bumps across the range whilst keeping the power usage at the same level. With a clock speed improvement getting most of the attention, there is a significant architectural change found in Kaby Lake; The addition of a new media engine that includes fixed function HEVC 10bit and VP9 decoding. In this era of 4K and the increasing prevalence of H.265 encoded media, this is significant for something like a small form factor HTPC and power efficiency. Notebooks will see battery life benefits from this.   A Closer Look Lets get to the board itself, starting off with the packaging. The box is quite subtle really, and the red and black theme reflects the Fatal1ty branding that ASRock have been using for several generations on their gaming oriented boards. The rear of the box covers all the major features of the board as well as specs so buyers will know what they are getting before purchase.         Once you remove the outer box we see the inner box which has two sections. All the accessories and documentation etc are found in the top section, while motherboard is securely packed in the bottom section. One of the key things to mention is the way ASRock package their motherboards. After removing the board from the anti static bag, we note how ASRock further secures the motherboard in foam shell secured with zip ties. It is so well packed that we’re sure the motherboard should survive the roughest of handling, and the most careless of couriers. This is a good little peace of mind feature that we’ve seen on many ASRock motherboards in recent years.   As for the accessories themselves, we have a fairly standard bundle mostly, with a driver installation disc, a case badge, user and software guides, four SATA 6Gb/s cables, I/O shield and then there’s the really nice addition: a High Bandwidth SLI bridge. These are sold separately for $20 or more for the blinged up RGB ones, so for ASRock to include this is a real value add.   Now we move onto the motherboard itself. Say hello to the ASRock Fatal1ty Z270 Gaming K6! We like the PCIe layout, with dual slot GPU’s given room to breathe. We also like how there is no M.2 slot beneath the primary GPU slot. M.2 drives can get very hot and begin to throttle and this is only exacerbated when sandwiched under a hot GPU with limited airflow. We’re pleased to see five fan headers located around the board, and all can be run in PWM mode with 4 pin fans. The large heatsinks are all screwed down with actual screws. Good bye push pins! There are three RGB lit locations on the board. The first is the clear strip just underneath the Intel logo, the second is the Sound Blaster Cinema logo on the left, and the final spot is a ring around the chipset heatsink. A full range of colors can be applied along with effects such as strobing, blinking, waves etc. Very nice if you wish to bling up your system a bit! The four pin header to the left of the leftmost PCIe slot is for connecting RGB strips which can be controlled via the ASRock BIOS or RGB control app.   ASRock, along with most other manufacturers on their Z270 boards, have adopted a Realtek ALC 1220 codec a the heart of their audio solutions. Some people automatically think  ‘oh no… Realtek..’ but actually integrated codecs have advanced a lot in recent generations and the implementation has a significant affect on the overall quality. The ALC 1220 starts with a very nice 120Db signal to noise ration which addresses one of the common criticisms of Realtek controllers in times past. The Gaming K6 brings Nichicon Gold Series electrolytic capacitors, PCB isolation to prevent electromagnetic interference and a dedicated Texas Instruments N5532 headphone amplifier. While not as comprehensive as some competing vendors solutions, our brief subjective tests with Bose QC35 headphones presented a clear and punchy sound with the dynamic range in film soundtracks being particularly noticeable. The Creative Labs software suite is also a nice addition and easy to use, though we tend to like a purer audio signal free of any embellishments.     The entire bottom edge of the board is packed with headers. Moving from right to left, we have the case headers, a chassis fan/water pump header, a COM port (though serial type devices still exist, we don’t think they are the market for this board) trusted platform module for security and cryptography purposes, then three USB 2.0 headers. Further to the left are connectors for a Thunderbolt add in card, then a connector for adding a RGB extension cable. Then we have a switch to select DRAM XMP on or off, a clear CMOS header and finally the front panel audio connector. Phew!   The board has the usual four DIMM slots offering support for up to 64Gb of DDR4 memory in dual-channel with unofficial support up to 3866Mhz. You can go higher than this of course with a good CPU memory controller and if the BIOS has been updated with support for the kit itself. As mentioned, the board supports XMP, so if you have high speed memory, a single bios selection will  automatically set it to its maximum clock speed and recommended voltage. We also see here the power and reset button on the right which are really helpful for us reviewers!   The Gaming K6 features an all-digital 12-phase CPU power design with an Intersil PWM controller. The MOSFETS are cooled by the hefty red heatsinks connected via a heatpipe. In our testing these can get quite warm, so case airflow is important if you intend to push the CPU hard. Four phases power the integrated graphics portion of the processor, and the remaining eight for everything else like the Vcore, VCCSA, and VCCIO.   The Gaming K6 comes with 8 SATA ports, six of which are supported from the chipset with support for RAID 0, 1, 5 and 10, as well as Intel RST and smart response technologies. The other two ports are controlled by a ASMedia ASM1061 chip.Note that SATA-Express appears to be still born. No devices ever appeared outside of tech demonstrations, and its bandwidth has been left behind by PCIe NVMe solutions. We also have two USB 3.0 headers here which is nice to see. Finally we take a look at the rear I/O panel. from left to right: Space for WiFi antennas PS/2 keyboard/mouse port, 2x USB 3.0 ports DVI and DSUB connectors HDMI 1.4 port LAN, USB 3.1 Type-A & Type-C ports LAN, 2x USB 3.0 ports Optical S/PDIF Out connector 5 x analogue audio ports While the I/O is pretty much packed, We have to say that we’d prefer a couple of extra USB ports here and VGA doesn’t really belong on a 2017 Gaming spec motherboard. A Display Port would be more appropriate. Behind the WiFi antenna cutouts is a E-Key M.2 slot which is suitable for common WiFi/bluetooth controllers and some rarer devices such as cellular cards. We would really like to have seen the WiFi card included, then the board would have had just about every realistic feature ticked off. The two Gigabit LAN ports are controlled by Intel I219V and I211AT chips. This is very nice to see on a motherboard that is not high end.         BIOS Overview The ASRock Z270 Gaming K6 uses the layout that will be familiar to ASRock users over recent generations. The first page we see when entering is the default ‘Ezy Mode’ which displays a host of relevant information and settings options such as the boot priorities and temperatures. Basic things on this page such as fan speed controls and the XMP setting are designed for the set and forget user who has no need for obscure BIOS controls.     Pressing F6 takes you to the familiar layout which we see below, starting with the Main page where some basic information can be seen.   The OC Tweaker page is where the magic happens. ASRock’s traditional method is to split the CPU, DRAM and Voltage configuration options into different sub menus. User profiles can also be seen here along with the auto OC settings. We’ll go into OC a bit later.   The first of the three main sub pages are the CPU configuration options. Here the major parameters such as the CPU and cache multipliers can be found, as well as controls for things like Intel’s Speedstep and Turbo parameters.   The second of the three OC sub menus is the DRAM configuration page. Here, basic things like SPD information and XMP can be applied, but it doesn’t end there. There are page after page of timing options that the tweakers will love. We look forward to what a potential Z270 OC Formula board might have if this is just the ‘gaming’ board.   The third and final OC sub menu is the Voltage control page. Its quite self explanatory. High speed memory users may have to visit this page and tweak System Agent and IO voltages in order to get their RAM running stable at high speeds. The page also has a very good explanation of how the various load line calibration (vdroop) settings work in a simple to read graph.   Moving away from the OC page, we come to the ‘Advanced’ page. There are a ton of system related settings to be found here, mainly to do with the various devices and integrated peripherals and their configurations. Key settings include SATA/M.2 controls, CPU feature options and onboard device options.   The ‘Tools’ page contains the important BIOS flashing function (which we used with no problem) as well as a cool tech support feature and the AURA RGB control page.   We tested the RGB settings and found they worked exactly as advertised across the board itself, but also with a Phanteks RGB strip connected to the header located under the bottom PCIe slot. This also worked perfectly both with the color applied and the various flashing/strobing effects etc.   The next page is the hardware monitoring page. All the key parameters are seen here, with voltages, fan speeds and temperatures monitored as well as the configuration options for the fan speed hysteresis and headers.   Next up is the security page, Not much to say here really.   The boot page is again pretty self explanatory.   Ditto for the exit page, where you can load the system defaults.     Software Overview We like to get our motherboard software and drivers online at the time of installation rather than rely on often outdated and obsolete software on the driver disk. For this purpose, ASRock have an all in one software call the App Shop, where all the motherboard drivers and utilities can be downloaded in one place. It functions quite well and we think If ASRock really wanted, they could add some really cool content for user to download, but then that would add cost and brings all sorts of licensing headwinds that may make it easier said than done.   ASRock have chosen Creative’s Sound Blaster Cinema software suite to bring an extra layer of control and customization over and above the default Realtek suite. Like most 3rd party audio control suites, there are an extensive range of configuration options for headphones and speakers with equalization, profiles, virtual surround and all the other goodies you might want. We still prefer to keep the audio signal as unadulterated as possible though, preferring to keep the original source as intact and pure as possible, but that’s just us.   ASRock’s RGB LED app is identical to the control page found in the BIOS. A quick play showed it is working well. We all know RGB lighting makes your PC faster right! 😀 We do think that maybe ASRock could have gone with a more neutral board color scheme, perhaps with black heat sinks and remove the red silk screening on the PCB. This would remove any possible coloring conflict that may occur. In the contrasting darkness of a case vs the light given off by the LEDs, you would hardly see any red anyway though to be fair. Generally we find the software to be a touch lacking. What is here works well, but some other vendors are going all out with their software packages.   Test Setup & Benchmarks Our test setup configurations can be seen below. Comparing different CPU’s and platforms can get a bit tricky. Our method is to apply the highest turbo modes, set them to all cores and disable SpeedStep to keep frequencies constant. In this case the 7700K is at a flat 4.5Ghz, the i7 6700K at 4.2Ghz and the i7 5960x at 3.5Ghz.               We expect every benchmark run with a 7700K to be within a fraction of each other and this is what we see across our tests. The 7700K is king in single threaded performance, with the 6700K behind only due to its lower clockspeed. There are no architectural reasons. the 5960x rules multithreaded benchmarks with its eight cores despite its clock disadvantage. Also note that the Z170 OC Formula is pretty much the same performance wise as the Z270 boards. Perhaps a bit of bios tweaking could make up that tiny gap, but the difference is so negligible its not likely to happen on a superseded product. Note that MSI board clocks itself a few Mhz higher via a tiny bclk increase, which is a little cheeky. Despite this few Mhz clock disadvantage, the ASRock acquits itself well and wins its share of tests anyway.   Overclocking Lets start with the automatic overclocking feature. ASRock have been fine tuning the options with our test 1.3 BIOS being less aggressive with its automatic voltage and clocking. Our CPU is a bit of a potato. Not the worst around, but far from the best with 5Ghz stability being next to impossible to achieve without uncomfortable levels of Vcore. 5ghz with AVX is simply impossible. We tried the most aggressive 4.9Ghz option, but could not achieve stability due to the applied Vcore being lower than what we expect from our CPU. 4.7ghz though with a CPUZ reading of 1.296v under load does appear to be a nice sweet spot for this CPU, with temperatures under control. Manual overclocking is always a hit and miss lottery, with our CPU producing different results to what others might. The truth is, a modern motherboard with a decent PWM will not struggle to OC a K CPU to its limits on air/watercooling as you will run into thermal limitations long before the motherboard breaks a sweat. Our CPU can reach stability at 4.9, but AVX has to be offset to achieve this. at 4.9Ghz the voltage requirements for our sample increase sharply with 1.345v needed to be stable. This behavior is seen with other motherboards too so this is not any reflection on the motherboard. Our test RAM is a very sexy set of G.Skill DDR4-3866 C18 2x8Gb. This uses the top shelf Samsung B-Die chips which overclockers are using to run at ridiculous settings of 4000Mhz 12-12-12 and beyond. As we found in our pre release testing, getting XMP to run with very fast RAM was very difficult. The Gaming K6 was not able to post on the 1.10 BIOS, but was able to on the 1.30 BIOS. High speed RAM is difficult to get to work properly at the best of times, especially on four DIMM motherboards. Boards such as the Asus Maximus IX Apex or ITX boards with dual slots are going to have an easier time. Try as we might, we could not get DDR4-4000 to boot on the Gaming K6. Benchmarking above 5Ghz is certainly possible if your CPU is good enough and thermals allow it. As always, your mileage will vary depending on your CPU core quality, memory controller quality and ambient temperatures. If you have a good sample, we are positive the Gaming K6 will run it to its maximum on air and water cooling. We’d also like to note that the board recovered extremely well if we pushed too hard with our memory overclocking trials. Some boards will just loop to a 55 post code and not stop, but the Gaming K6 would try a few times, and then boot to default settings allowing you to try again. Overclockers know how frustrating repeated clear CMOS operations can be, so this is a small thing we definitely appreciate.   Conclusion The ASRock Z270 Gaming K6 is a great value mid range offering with a compelling feature set. Its BIOS is easy to navigate and gave us no apparent bugs in testing. It also appears mature with a great level of performance. It is available for about $170 USD making it quite a steal given its impressive feature set. Its overclocking performance has improved significantly with newer BIOS, both with auto OC and with memory. DDR4-4000 isn’t quite there, but that’s asking a lot of any motherboard. Some unpolished boards struggle even to boot at 3600 Mhz still. The layout is great, allowing multiple graphics cards to breathe, plus the ports and connectors are in the right locations. You get dual LAN, eight SATA ports, plenty of USB 3.0 (though not on the back panel) and dual M.2 which we’d expect on more expensive boards, but not necessarily a mid range one. ASRock are always near the top in any price/performance comparison and this continues with the Z270 Gaming K6. If you want a good performing board with great features and reliability, a refined BIOS and decent OC, you should give it a look! Pros: Mature and easy to navigate BIOS Great feature set unexpected of a mid range motherboard Later BIOS brings much improved memory OC. Beefy PWM Super secure packaging Excellent failed OC BIOS recovery HB SLI bridge inclusion   Cons Software packages are a bit lacking Rear I/O needs a couple more USB ports VGA connector?

When we first heard about Optane it was all about offering faster than SSD performance - existing in the space between SSD and DRAM - but these limited capacity modules are targeted at the "79 per cent of desktop PCs," still using HDDs as primary storage. It might be fair to assume that a good proportion of these are utilitarian pre-built systems, many using Pentium or Celeron processors. But that's a snag… It was already well publicised that Optane requires an Intel Kaby Lake processor / 200 series motherboard and motherboard makers have been updating BIOS downloads to support the new 'memory' devices this week. However, there is another caveat, as spotted by the TechReport. In the official list of requirements to support Optane technology Intel states users must have a Core i3, i5 or i7 Kaby Lake processor equipped. This leaves non-Core processors like Pentiums and Celerons, lower power 'T' chips, and even the Core-Y series laptops in the cold, even if they are indeed seventh generation processors. This lack of compatibility isn't a promotional website blurb oversight, as it's backed up by individual processor ARK database entries. Since Intel is actively marketing the new consumer 'Optane Memory' cache drives as ideal for boosting budget-friendly mainstream systems with hard drives as their sole storage devices, it seems to have shot itself in the foot. If building a new system with Optane cached HDD primary you will have to budget for at least a Core i3-7100 which adds $65+ to your build price, says the TechReport. It suggests dropping the entry level 16GB Optane M2, the Kaby Lake i3, and 1TB HDD in favour of something like an OCZ SSD with 480GB of storage. However, as with any PC build decisions there are almost endless permutations to consider. click to zoom and read small print Unfortunately, as yet, we at HEXUS haven't had any time with these new 'Optane Memory' caching products in order to assess them and see if they are worth considering. It is hoped that any Micron produced 3D Xpoint consumer drives don't include processor family restrictions.

Posted by EvilCycle - Fri 31 Mar 2017 13:31 It's not great, but in reality how many people with a CPU in a lower tier than an i3 (or even an i5 in most cases) are really going to be considering one of these? Posted by DanceswithUnix - Fri 31 Mar 2017 13:35 EvilCycle It's not great, but in reality how many people with a CPU in a lower tier than an i3 (or even an i5 in most cases) are really going to be considering one of these? Possibly quite a few. If you can afford a top end CPU you probably have a 1TB SSD and little use for any piffling cache technology. If you are on a budget, you are more likely to have spinning rust that will benefit from a cache SSD, and if a spending a bit more gets you a better cache SSD perhaps you will stump up for it? Can only guess, I think Optane is a waste of money, I'm clearly not the target market. Posted by Dashers - Fri 31 Mar 2017 14:23 Agreed, cache drives are for people on low-end systems who want a bit of oomph. High end systems already have NVMe drives. I'm interested in seeing 500gig Optane drives.

That said, it looks like the company, allegedly, hasn't been completely honest to the press. A report from SemiAccurate calls the company's behavior "unacceptable and unethical", which are pretty strong statements. You might ask what Intel actually did to be labeled as such, so let's examine the evidence. On March 15, the company held a press briefing about its Optane technology, specifically the two products mentioned above. Delivered by webcast, this contained several slides full of fine print and data points, giving off the impression of much better performing products than they were in reality. While that might be excusable in the eyes of some, the next step Intel took is anything but. When the decks were sent out to the press later, they lacked several important slides from the P4800X presentation, and over half of the ones from the Optane Memory one. Worse still, the latter's absent slides showed testing data, configurations used and other information necessary to support the claims Intel made in its webcast. Upon being confronted about this issue via email by SemiAccurate, the company's response was simply "We did not share all the slides that were presented. Sorry.". Thanks to screenshots taken by the folks over at the publication, we do have access to the slides that seemingly vanished into thin air: These slides have a few key standout points beyond their mere strange layout. On the first slide, the numbers provided are not actual benchmark results, thus throwing out the window any possibility of conducting an independent test and later comparison. What's more, in both these slides, the configurations used are left very vague, going so far at to drop spec from the first slide entirely, then omit the RAM frequency on the second one. Obviously thinking this was not enough to go on, Intel then provided "more details" in its next missing slide. Except it really did not. As opposed to the previous slide, this lists the CPU as a Core i5, instead of a Core i7, and the memory of the first system is now 16GB of DDR4 instead of 8GB of DDR not specified. Of course, this wouldn't be a complete presentation without covering the pricing aspect, and potential savings, and Intel did do that. Except it did not provide any data to back that up. The slide in its pristine form read: One final aspect emphasized by SemiAccurate was that testing of its Optane products was never done against any sort of other SSD. While this is perhaps understandable due to the fact that the technology is meant to be used in conjunction with slower storage media, it does not excuse this omission.

The Linux Foundation If you’ve ever hooked up a Linux computer to a DisplayPort monitor and encountered only a flickering or blank screen, we’ve got good news for you. A graphics kernel developer at Intel's Open Source Technology Center has solved the problem with a patch that will go into Linux 4.12. Manasi Navare’s patch modifies Atomic Kernel Mode Setting (KMS) technology to gracefully drop down to a lower resolution to display the image. “Someone had to fix this problem, so I said okay, I have the knowledge and I have the community to help me,” said Navare at Embedded Linux Conference. To hear Navare tell it, the hard part was not so much developing the fix as fully understanding the inner workings of DisplayPort (DP) compliance, the Linux graphics stack, and Atomic KMS. The task of upstreaming the patch was perhaps even more challenging, calling upon the right mix of persuasion, persistence, charm, and flexibility. At the end of the talk, Navare offered some tips for anyone pushing a patch upstream toward an eventual kernel merge. Negotiating with DisplayPort Navare started by explaining how a computer (the DP source) negotiates with a display (DP sink) to enable the desired resolution and other properties. When you connect the cable, the sink sends a signal that informs the source about the maximum link-outs and link rates supported by the sink. The source then initiates a DPCD (DisplayPort Configuration Data) read on the sink’s AUX channel, performs a calibration routine, and then launches a handshaking process called DP link training. This configures the main link out of the four possible DP links, each of which has different channel capacities. “The first phase is clock recovery, sending out the known training packet sequence onto the main link,” said Navare. “The receiver extracts the block information to find if it can work at that linkage. Next comes channel equalization where the receiver tries to understand the link mapping. If these are successful, the link is ready, and the sink is set to receive the data at a specific link-out and link rate.” Despite all these steps, the link training can still result in a blank or flickering display. “The link training could fail because you haven’t tested the physical capability of the cable until the very end of the process,” said Navare. “There is no way to send this information back to userspace because the commit phase was never expected to fail. It’s a dead end.” To find a solution, Navare needed to test DP compliance. She used a Unigraf DPR 120 device, which has been certified by Mesa. The device sits between the source and sink and requests specific data or video packets to be sent to the DP monitor. “It maps those values onto the AUX channel and monitors all the transactions on the display cables,” said Navare. “It compares that data to the reference values, and if it matches, the device is compliant.” Navare also needed to improve her understanding of the complex Linux graphics stack. The base level consists of an Intel Integrated Graphics Device layer -- a hardware layer for rendering the display and doing graphics acceleration. “On top of this sits the Linux kernel with the I19 Intel graphics driver, which knows how to configure the hardware according to userspace commands,” explained Navare. At a higher layer within the same Linux kernel subsystem is the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager), which implements the part of the kernel that is common to different hardware specific drivers. “The DRM exposes the APIs to userspace, which sends information down to the hardware to request a specific display for rendering,” said Navare. She also further explored KMS, which, among other things, scans the RGB pixel data in the plane buffers using the cathode ray tube controller (CRTC), which decides whether to generate DVI, HDMI, or DP signals. “The CTRC generates the bitstream according to the video timings and sends the data to the encoder, which modifies the bitstream and generates the analog signals based on the connector type,” says Navare. “Then it goes to the connector and lights up the display.” Once into the project, Navare realized her solution would need to support the new Atomic KMS version of KMS, which implements a secondary process that Navare called the two step. “When you connect the source with the sink, userspace creates a list of parameters that it wants to change on the hardware, and sends this out to the kernel using a DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ATOMIC call. The first step is the atomic check phase where it forms the state of the device and its structure for the different DRM mode objects: the plane, CRTC, or connector. It validates the mode requested by Userspace, such as 4K, to see if the display is capable.” If successful, the process advances to the next stage -- atomic commit -- which sends the data to the hardware. “The expectation is that it will succeed because it has already been validated,” said Navare. Yet even with Atomic KMS, you can still end up with a blank screen. Navare determined that the problem happened within Atomic KMS between the check and commit stages, where link training occurred. Navare’s solution was to introduce a new property for the connector called link status. “If a commit fails, the kernel now tags the connect property as BAD,” she explained. “It sends the HPD back to the userspace, which requests another modeset, but at lower resolution. The kernel repeats the check and commit, and retrains the link at a lower rate.” If the test passes, the link status switches to GOOD, and the display works, although at a lower resolution. “Atomic check is never supposed to fail, but link training is the exception because it depends on the physical cable,” said Navare. “The link might fail after a successful modeset because something can go wrong with the cable between initial hookup and test. This patch provides a way for the kernel to send that notification back to userspace. You have to go back to userspace because you have to repeat the process of setting the clock and rate, which you can’t do at the point of failure.” A few tips on upstreaming Navare added the new link status connector property to the DRM layer as part of an Upstream I915 driver patch, and submitted it to her manager at Intel. “I said, ‘It’s working now. What can I work on next?’ He replied: ‘Have you sent it upstream?’” Navare submitted the patch to the public mailing list for the graphics driver, thereby beginning a journey that took almost a year. “It took a long time to convince the community that this would fix the problem,” said Navare. “You get constant feedback and review comments. I think I submitted 15 or 20 revisions before it was accepted. But you keep on submitting patch revisions until you get the ‘reviewed by’ and that’s the day you go party, right?” Not exactly. The patch then gets merged into an internal DRM tree, where much more testing transpires. It finally gets merged into the main DRM tree where it’s sorted into DRM fixes or DRM next. “Linus [Torvalds] pulls the patches from this DRM tree on a weekly basis and announces his release candidates,” said Navare. “It goes through the cycle of release candidates for a long time until it’s stable, and it finally becomes part of the next Linux release.” Torvalds finally approved the patch for merger, and the champagne cork popped. Linus's Rules Navare also offered some general tips for the upstreaming process, which she calls Linus’s Rules. The first rule is “No regressions,” that is, no GPU hangs or blanks screens. “If you submit a patch it should not break something else in the driver, or else the review cycle can get really aggressive,” said Navare. “I had to leverage the community’s knowledge about other parts of the graphics driver.” The second rule is “Never blame userspace, it’s always kernel’s fault.” In other words, “If the hardware doesn’t work as expected then the kernel developer is the one to blame,” she added. The problem here is that kernel patches require changes in userspace drivers, which leads to “a chicken and egg situation,” said Navare. “It’s hard to upstream kernel changes without testing userspace… You can’t merge the kernel patches until you’ve tested the userspace, but you can’t merge userspace because the kernel changes have not yet landed. It’s very complicated.” To prove her solution would not break userspace, Navare spent a lot of time interacting with userspace community and involved them in testing and submitting patches. Another rule is that “Feedback is always constructive.” In other words, “don’t take it as criticism, and don’t take it personally,” she said. “I got reviews that said: ‘This sucks. It’s going to break link training, which is very fragile -- don’t touch that part of the driver.’ It was frustrating, but it really helped. You have to ask them why they think it’s going to break the code, and how they would fix it.” The final rule is persistence. “You just have to keep pinging the maintainers and bugging them on IRC,” said Navare. “You will see the finish line, so don’t give up.” Navare’s Upstream i915 patch can be found here, and the documentation is here.

Intel still has ambitions for Optane in client PCs, but competing with NAND SSDs on both a speed and capacity basis would prove prohibitively expensive given Optane's roughly $4-per-gigabyte cost right now. Instead, Intel is taking a different tack for the moment: improving the performance of hard-drive-only systems for a reasonable cost. The company says that people considering desktop PCs want three things above all: performance, security, and storage capacity. Right now, hard drives tick the capacity box, but anybody who's used an SSD knows that spinning rust doesn't perform anything like flash. Hard drives still make up the vast majority of storage devices shipping in today's PCs, however, and Intel anticipates that'll continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. Enter Optane Memory. Intel's first client Optane product uses a hardware-and-software stack that purports to cache a user's most commonly accessed files on a fast slice of PCIe 3.0 x4-connected storage. Its reliance on newer tech aside, Optane Memory as a whole sounds similar in principle to what Apple does with its Fusion Drive-equipped iMacs. It also sounds similar in principle to Intel's own Turbo Memory technology, a small slice of NAND on a riser card that did basically nothing for system performance when it debuted in some notebooks back in 2005. Given Intel's history with elaborate solid-state caching layers, I was skeptical about the prospects of another take on the idea. Optane has some fundamental differences that promise a better showing this time around, however. For one, Optane doesn't need a large number of dies to achieve maximum performance like most NAND devices do, so one Optane die (as one will find on Intel's 16GB Optane Memory device) or two dies (as found on the 32GB gumstick) should offer enough parallelism to deliver a performance increase over devices with small amounts of NAND on board, like SSHDs. Even more importantly, Optane Memory devices enjoy the same class of high QD1 performance that the SSD DC P4800X does, so they can offer maximum performance at the low queue depths typical of desktop workloads. For its part, Intel thinks Optane Memory will boost system responsiveness above all—the major beef with hard-drive-only PCs. Using the Sysmark benchmarking suite, the company claims only minor increases in application performance, but the suite's responsiveness test comes away with twice the performance of a system with a hard drive alone. To bolster the point that QD1 performance matters most for desktop users and that Optane is ideally suited to boosting system responsiveness, Intel shared some internal data about the read and write queue depths for the synthetic PCMark Vantage benchmark and some demo workloads from its labs. Intel also performed trace analysis for the launch performance demands of several commonly-used applications one might find in the typical workplace. Finally, Intel collected application traces from a number of its employees' PCs to show the queue depth demands of more productivity-focused workloads. The point of these graphs is clear: most random desktop workloads level off at about QD4, and the majority of accesses happen at QD1 or QD2. Given those characteristics, Optane Memory seems ideally suited to speed up application launches and perhaps to lessen the wait for commonly-accessed files, at least so long as those accesses are primarily random. Presuming that's the case, Optane Memory seems much better poised to offer some kind of speedup to a user's commonly-used applications than a small NAND cache like Turbo Memory might have. Optane Memory isn't much good without its companion software, an unobtrusive utility that sits in the system tray. Intel says this application will render the Optane cache transparent to the user experience. The only storage device that should show up with an Optane Memory system is the user's primary system drive (along with any other non-Optane Memory storage devices that may be installed). There's a lot of black-boxiness to how the app's caching algorithm works, but Intel suggests Optane Memory won't be caching entire applications like games on the Optane device itself, simply because they'd often be too large to fit in 16GB or 32GB of space. Instead, I got the impression that the Optane Memory app will look for common files (like shared libraries and operating system files) that are often accessed by many programs and cache those instead.

After years of being relegated to the budget segment due to poor performance, is AMD finally offering Intel serious competition again? Basically, yes. The reviews (Ars Technica, PC Gamer, PC World, AnandTech,Tom's Hardware) are mostly positive, with a big caveat: The gaming performance is significantly lower than would otherwise be expected based on the CPU's performance in other areas. In the days and weeks following the launch, speculation raged as to the cause of the lackluster gaming performance. AMD themselves debunked a number of fan theories, before announcing a few weeks later optimizations for DOTA 2 and Ashes of the Singularity that boost frame rates in those particular games. Ryzen is based on AMD's all-new "Zen" microarchitecture, replacing their earlier "Bulldozer" microarchitecture, which was widely regarded as underperforming and even led to AMD being sued over the definition of a "core." For those interested in CPU architectures, David Kanter of Real World Technologies has written a very nice overview of the Zen microarchitecture and gave a wide-ranging interview to PC Perspective discussing Zen prior to the launch. This launch comes as PC sales saw their fifth consecutive year of decline after peaking back in 2011. Eyeing the server market, where Intel has >99% market share, AMD has announced their Zen-based "Naples" line of 32-core server processors, positioned to compete against Intel's Xeon line of server CPUs. AMD desperately needs Zen-based products to succeed in the marketplace after posting losses of $660 million in 2015 and $497 million in 2016. Those numbers are a big deal to a company of AMD's size, which "only" took in $4.3 billion in revenue in 2016, compared to Intel's $59.4 billion. posted by jcreigh (29 comments total) 10 users marked this as a favorite   As "exciting" as Ryzen is, it's coming at a time when CPU computing power seems to be fading to irrelevance. The biggest advance in CPU power came with the Sandy Bridge generation in 2011. Ever since then, every annual release has barely eked out an incremental 5% in compute speed. You could say that it's because Intel had no competition, or they had hit the limits of Moore's law, or that there was simply no need for faster compute speed for the majority of users, but the reality is that an i5-2500K from 6 years ago is a perfectly usable CPU for almost any kind of gaming you want to do nowadays. Ryzen has "caught up" to Intel, but even Intel users are looking at something like a 5 year upgrade cycle (instead of the 3 year upgrade cycle in the past). Contrast that to how fast GPUs are advancing - a single generation, say the GTX 980 to the GTX 1080 in the span of 18 months, has nearly doubled its graphics processing power from 4 to 8 teraflops. Arguably, most of the decline in PC sales would be on the lower end machines, which have never generated much revenue for manufacturers in the first place. Gamers building their own PCs don't get counted here, because they buy parts piece-meal! NVIDIA revenues jumped from 4.5 billion in 2014 to 7 billion in 2016. Intel revenues are flatter, but still an increase from 56 billion to 59 billion over the same period. Part of this I believe is linked to the much faster pace of improvement in GPUs which encourages users to get on a 3 year upgrade cycle (you can get 100% performance increase every generation, about 18 months, so buying upgrades is compelling) and a slower one on CPUs (which only gives you a 5% performance increase each generation which is 12-18 months, no one is running to the store to buy the latest CPU) posted by xdvesper at 11:41 PM on March 30 [6 favorites] I just built a new computer based around the 1800X, and I've been happy with it - though to be fair, I haven't really pushed it hard yet. As for the whole "controversy" over gaming performance, the reality is that it will perform quite well on modern games - it just won't beat Intel's offerings aimed directly at gamers. But in exchage, you get a chip that can compete with Intel's $1000 workstation offerings at half the price. posted by NoxAeternum at 11:47 PM on March 30 [2 favorites] Every generation gets its "AMD kicks ass!" moment. posted by rhizome at 12:32 AM on March 31 [10 favorites] Yeah I have an i7 from around 6 years ago that is still running like a champ.

Every time I think about upgrading I don't because it just hasn't been necessary, and the truth is that the new CPUs aren't that much better anyway. posted by uncleozzy at 3:05 AM on March 31 [1 favorite] Oh boy do I remember my last Radeon. 30 seconds into any game and the variable speed fans would ramp up like a 747 at take off. If you turned this off it would go above 100c alarmingly fast. I'd end up turning the sound way up, not even to drown it out the fans, but just to understand the dialogue. Then when they went quiet during normal use, I'd play an mp3 and very hastily turn it down, not realising how loud I had to turn it up just to hear people talk over the fans. Complaining online in chat I had a lot of people saying 'mine too', didn't seem to matter which manufacturer. Mine was a Gigabyte but I heard the same about Asus and MSI, which aren't exactly brand-x. I became so accustomed to this that when I replaced it with a Geforce it was so whisper quiet that for weeks I found myself checking the temperature and peering into the case, thinking it was too quiet. The fans mustn't be working! posted by adept256 at 3:10 AM on March 31 [4 favorites] Lack of competition in the CPU market has definitely kept Intel CPU prices high in the new AND used market. Last year I was shopping for a used CPU from a couple generations back on ebay and was amazed at how high the prices were. I ended up picking up a Haswell Refresh i5 for what I thought was quite a bit of money considering it was a 2+ year old CPU. I welcome AMD back to the market. posted by LoveHam at 4:26 AM on March 31 [1 favorite] Are y'all telling me that Moore's Law has ended with a whimper? posted by clawsoon at 5:31 AM on March 31 Sounds like it ended with a broken gpu fan grinding. posted by notyou at 5:41 AM on March 31 [3 favorites] adept256, how long ago was this? I had an R9-280x for a long time that produced a quite reasonable level of noise. And I just recently picked up an RX-480 that's pretty damned quiet. The older Radeons definitely did have overheating problems, though. Anyway, I'm not in the market for a new CPU for a while, since that would require a whole motherboard and RAM overhaul as well. But I'm glad that Zen is competitive and that it's offering a sort of orthogonal approach to Intel. Go to Intel for the best single-core performance, go to AMD if you want just a ton of cores. I mean, that's been the case for a while, but Zen has brought the single-core performance up to a competitive level as well, even if Intel still has them beat there. posted by tobascodagama at 6:05 AM on March 31 AMD discovered, after following McKinsey & Company's advice to cut a third of its work force, that things can't get done if you have no people to do them. That said, it is encouraging to see AMD succeed after pursuing failure for so many years. I plan on upgrading my desktop this year and will likely lean towards AMD. posted by Jessica Savitch's Coke Spoon at 6:14 AM on March 31 [4 favorites] Every time I think about upgrading I don't because it just hasn't been necessary, and the truth is that the new CPUs aren't that much better anyway. It's not just about the CPU, though. The Summit Ridge platform adds support for things like DDR4 RAM, M.2 PCI-E SSDs, and other latest and greatest components like that. posted by NoxAeternum at 7:12 AM on March 31 [3 favorites] Are y'all telling me that Moore's Law has ended with a whimper? No. Moore's law is often misunderstood/misquoted as "CPU power doubles every two years." What he actually said (and I'm still paraphrasing) is that the number of transistors on a chip will double every two years. In 2014 a 15-core Xeon fit about 4 billion transistors onto a 550mm2 size chip. In 2016 the 22-core Xenon fit 7 billion transistors on the same real estate. Moore's 50 year old prediction stands, which is pretty damn amazing. The Intel 8088 (released in 1976, and powered the original IBM PC) had 29,000 transistors on 33mm2. That's not a typo. In 40 years CPUs have gone from tens of thousands of transistors to billions. What's changed in the last 5 years or so is that the doubling of transistors no longer doubles performance, at least in the consumer CPU market. posted by Frayed Knot at 7:12 AM on March 31 [10 favorites] Lack of competition in the CPU market has definitely kept Intel CPU prices high in the new AND used market. I have also been looking at old computer parts on Ebay. It seems to me a lot of 7-to-10-year-old junk (motherboards, all makes of CPUs, GPUs) I would expect to be sold by the pound turns out to be $50-$100 each instead. I suspect a myriad of market conditions have combined to make repairs and upgrades (as opposed to replacement) much more attractive than they were ten years ago. I think that's going to continue. posted by Western Infidels at 7:43 AM on March 31 [1 favorite] Wasn't AMD being kept alive by Intel for antitrust reasons, or is that only my paranoid suspicion? posted by benzenedream at 8:16 AM on March 31 Like xdvesper says, the real competition these days is in GPUs. For gaming AMD/Radeon is still holding its own in the middle of the market, but is being squeezed from the bottom and the top. But AMD managed to entirely miss the market for machine learning usage, NVidia and CUDA got a huge head start in the market. It sounds specialist, but cloud computing providers like Amazon and Google are currently buying 100,000s of GPUs for machine learning applications. Not to mention end users like Apple, Google, etc. It's a whole new market AMD is lost on. Ryzen looks like a nice product though, catching up with and maybe barely overtaking Intel. Meanwhile the laptop and desktop CPU market is super close to being completely overturned by AMD designs, I give it five years at most. I want AMD to succeed, I've liked them ever since I bought their 287 clone in 1991 and made Mandelbrot sets render super fast. We need competition. But they sure missed a few years' opportunity and maybe a whole market in machine learning. posted by Nelson at 8:26 AM on March 31 [1 favorite] Re, fans... If you can install flashing neon LED strips on the sides of the 3d printed skull you use for a case, you can certainly install a water cooling system. More seriously, I think GPUs are driven at least as much by learning problems and giant data center use as by games at this point... posted by kaibutsu at 9:08 AM on March 31 Think I'm going to pull the trigger on a new computer soon and will be going with a Ryzen build. I've always had a soft-spot in my heart for AMD and my gaming habits are not cutting edge so the lesser performance vs. Intel doesn't bother me too much. posted by snwod at 9:16 AM on March 31 [1 favorite] The big issue I had with mine was motherboard availability, especially if you're looking for an X370 (high end) board. I basically got lucky and caught Newegg having the MB I wanted on sale (Nowinstock is your friend here.) posted by NoxAeternum at 9:28 AM on March 31 I'm very interested to see what the landscape looks like once they have the full desktop lineup out. Ryzen 5 is coming out next month, Ryzen 3 sometime this year. But Ryzen 5s are just Ryzen 7s with disabled cores, so we have a pretty good idea already of how they will perform, and the choice is between, say, a 4 core/4 thread i5-7500 for ~$200 or a 6 core/12 thread Ryzen 5 1600 for $220...it's gonna be hard to pick Intel unless you really want that last drop of single-threaded performance. posted by jcreigh at 9:40 AM on March 31 Ugh when I said laptop and desktop CPU market is super close to being completely overturned by AMD designs I meant ARM. Customized ARM processors, like what's in an iPad or iPhone. Apple's rumored to be playing with offloading some laptop work to ARM already for powersavings. The stupid touchbar in the new Macbook Pro has an ARM processor in it. But I have to imagine the big companies are experimenting with fully ARM computers. posted by Nelson at 9:52 AM on March 31 [2 favorites] ARM still sucks for desktop. They have low power parts for mobile, cheap low-end processors for stuff like Chromebooks, and new massively multicore chips hoping to find use in web servers. But I haven't seen much for anything that cares about per-core performance.

I'd attribute it to the lack of new Windows 7 machines. posted by MikeWarot at 6:07 PM on March 31 But I have to imagine the big companies are experimenting with fully ARM computers. After the Windows RT fiasco you'd think Microsoft was done with it, but no, they're back to planning Windows for ARM, and with emulation so it can run x86 software too. posted by JHarris at 6:52 PM on March 31 But I have to imagine the big companies are experimenting with fully ARM computers. After the Windows RT fiasco you'd think Microsoft was done with it, but no, they're back to planning Windows for ARM, and with emulation so it can run x86 software too.--JHarris And that's actually the second time Microsoft tried this. Back in the 1990s there was something called the ACE Consortium, and people could compile their programs for Windows NT to work on Intel 386, IBM Power PC, Digital Alpha, and MIPS processors and you could include the executables for these on your release disks. No one did this, and it flopped. Third time's a charm! posted by eye of newt at 7:28 PM on March 31 I'm skeptical of the notion that ARM is going to take over the desktop market. It's questionable how big the ISA advantage is, and x86 is very well entrenched. People have been forecasting its demise for decades, and it keeps on trucking, a horrible homage to backwards compatible hacks. posted by jcreigh at 11:59 PM on March 31 « Older Mona   |   Ronaldo or Bust Newer » You are not currently logged in.

She accused those dozen MPs - including Eric Abetz, Kevin Andrews, Andrew Hastie, Trent Zimmerman, James Paterson, Dean Smith and Tim Wilson - of effectively not trusting Australia's own legal and political system to block extradition to China when a person set to be sent there faced, for example, torture or the death penalty. Mr Abbott on Friday intervened in the debate over the treaty, which has been shelved, much to the embarrassment of the Turnbull government, providing News Corp details of a briefing note from his former Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, dated December 19, 2014. Related Content Julie Bishop condemns colleagues over China extradition treaty collapse Turnbull pulls plug on China treaty under pressure from Labor The note stated that Australia should not ratify the treaty because of problems with China's legal system, Mr Abbott claimed, and that China would be notified by Australia that ratification could not proceed. Ms Bishop and Justice Minister Michael Keenan had also agreed, in September and October 2014 respectively, that Australia would not move to ratify. In his most pointed comments since losing the prime ministership, Mr Abbott said he released the document to "set the record straight" after senior government sources claimed he had backflipped on previous support for the treaty.

"It is a very, very bad practice for senior members of the government to start blaming everyone but themselves when things go wrong.

"There was plenty of official advice that we should not do this."  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The Turnbull and Abbott forces are at war, again; this time it's over China. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen Mr Abbott added: "The job of government is to solve people's problems, the job of government is to explain why the policies of the government are right and necessary. "It's not to go around trashing colleagues.  "Hopefully they will finally learn the lesson that briefing against colleagues - that cowardly anonymous briefing against colleagues - is very destructive to a team and very counterproductive to a government." Mr Abbott's decision to release details of a high-level briefing note has prompted an immediate, furious response from high-level sources in the Turnbull government, underscoring the still-lingering tensions over the leadership. "What Mr Abbott has omitted to mention is that there was subsequent advice in May 2015 from the Department of Foreign Affairs that recommend the government ratify the treaty. That advice was supported by [then ambassador to China] Frances Adamson," the source said. After a delay because of the leadership change [in September 2015] the Foreign Minister and Justice Minister wrote to the Prime Minister and provided this advice. The government then moved to ratify the treaty. The intervention from Mr Abbott and response from within government, means that - unusually - high-level bureaucratic advice that normally remains confidential has now been placed on the public record. The tit-for-tat leaking of information from supporters and opponents of ratification has, effectively, become a proxy war for internal supporters and opponents of Mr Turnbull and Mr Abbott. Senator Abetz, one of the government members who threatened to cross the floor, told Fairfax Media that Ms Bishop - and all other MPs - should show respect over such a sensitive issue. " In matter such as this, it's important to have mutual respect and I would advise those in government who don't share our views, to treat me and other colleagues with respect," he said, pointing to the plight of Professor Chongyi Feng, who is currently being held in China. "Men and women of good faith can come to different conclusions on the same matter." " I have great confidence in our judicial system; it's the Chinese system that concerns me." Labor's deputy chair of Treaties Committee, Michael Danby, said the Foreign Minister was "bullying her colleagues to pass this extradition treaty" and that that "shows she doesn't understand widespread Australian concern, including those in her own party, about the 99.6 per cent conviction rate in China or about its human rights record".

The Gravy Equations → Sundance Untangles the Roots Posted on March 28, 2017 by Bill QuickMarch 28, 2017   First, this for background: The Case Against FBI Director Comey Grows – Intel Committee Chair Devin Nunes Explains Need for White House SCIF Visit… | The Last Refuge All intelligence information is viewed within a SCIF, a Sensitive Compartmented  Information Facility.  The originating entity for the intel information is the proprietary host for their intelligence within their database.  The databases are not connected.  The SCIF in congress does not contain the same information as the SCIF in the executive (or any other intelligence community). The congressional oversight committee asks each Intel Agency to transmit their originating intel to the congressional SCIF.  The NSA has been cooperative in complying with the Intel Committee’s requests to share the NSA database of their information.  The FBI has NOT been cooperative in sending their proprietary originating intelligence information to Congress or the Intel Committee. Obviously the information Nunes needed to see (Eisenhower building SCIF) related to the executive office (Obama administration) and their coordination with the FBI (Dept. of Justice).  Hence, only the executive office SCIF database would hold the information because the FBI was/is refusing to send it to the House Intel Committee. Then the meat of the matter: Occam’s Razor – If You Listen To Every Nunes Public Statement in Sequence… | The Last Refuge The “tipster” source is unknown. However, the actual intelligence report(s) he reviewed, which contained the unmasked surveillance information, was simply President Obama’s daily intelligence Briefing(s). It appears, most likely, someone (aka mysterious tipster), simply told Nunes which dates to review.  Hence the Executive Branch SCIF was utilized.  The ACTUAL intelligence product itself was the Executive Office Presidential Daily Intelligence Briefing. Most likely a Clapper (ODNI), Rogers (NSA), Comey (FBI Counter Intel), and Brennan (CIA) work product.  Remember, President Obama preferred written intel briefings which he reviewed from his secure iPad. Reconciling the intelligence report that Nunes reviewed was actually the Presidential Daily Briefing (intel work product) also explains all the variant political concern angles. Which means that the Trump White House probably already knows where the unmasking was done.

John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Mar 30, 2017 at 7:07PM Tech analysts will tell you that chip giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's a big player in personal computers, which isn't exactly a growth market. And it has been seen as lagging rivals in the emerging artificial-intelligence space.  But it took a huge step into autonomous vehicles when it announced a $15.3 billion deal to acquire Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY) earlier this month. I think that makes it worth a closer look. Here's why. Mobileye's co-founder, Amnon Shashua, announcing a partnership with Intel and BMW last year. Image source: Mobileye N.V. Why Intel paid a fortune for Mobileye Intel is paying $15.3 billion for Mobileye, seemingly a huge price for a company that generated just over $358 million-with-an-m in revenue last year. Why?  The key is that Mobileye is the closest thing to a pure play in self-driving vehicles, at least among public companies. Mobileye makes chips and software that process images and that are designed from the ground up to be used in cars. They're already critical components of today's advanced driver-assist systems, and they'll be critical to tomorrow's self-driving vehicles as well. Put another way, Mobileye has proven technology that will have an important role in the autonomous vehicles of the near future. It also has something else, which might be just as valuable: Credibility with automakers. Mobileye's current client list includes nearly all of the world's automakers.  That's important because the auto industry can be a tough market for a technology company to crack. But Intel won't have to crack it, because Mobileye has already done so. And rather than folding Mobileye into Intel, the chip giant plans to go the other way, keeping Mobileye's sales force and management team intact while expanding its range of offerings to include Intel's products.  Mobileye opens up a huge new market for Intel So how big is the opportunity for Intel here? As Intel sees it, it's huge. CEO Brian Krzanich thinks of self-driving cars as "data centers on wheels," with good reason. The computer processing power that will be required in cars with the most basic Level 4 self-driving systems is roughly a hundred times the computing power in today's most advanced cars, Krzanich said in a recent presentation.  How Intel's CEO sees the growth opportunity from self-driving cars. Image source: Intel Corporation. That's a big opportunity for Intel to sell additional hardware to Mobileye's established client list. How big? Krzanich thinks the total addressable market for vehicle systems will be over $20 billion a year by 2020, and could be $70 billion a year by 2030.  On top of that, Krzanich sees a second, related opportunity in the actual data centers that will be needed to provide the "cloud" for all of these interconnected self-driving cars. That won't be a big new market soon, but it could be up around $40 billion a year by 2030. Whatever its other flaws, Intel is now in a prime position to grab a big piece of that. What Mobileye does for Intel as an investment These new autonomous-vehicle markets could represent substantial top-line growth for Intel. Consider that the chip giant generated $59.4 billion in revenue in 2016. If the markets materialize as Krzanich anticipates, and Intel can take even a third of them...then the $15.3 billion that Intel is paying for Mobileye might look like a bargain in time.  As plenty of analysts have pointed out, Intel's fundamentals today aren't very exciting. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is just over 12, with a forward dividend yield of 3.1% and a payout ratio of 49%. That's all decent but not exceptional.  What might be exceptional about Intel is that it's buying itself a gateway to significant future growth. That's worth a closer look.

Some have queried whether it was maybe a little too thus. For example the anecdote in Rolling Stone that Pence calls his wife "mother," and the story that before Pence proposed Karen carried around a gold cross in her handbag with the word 'yes,' engraved on it. Oh and that they have twin treadmills so that they can workout together.   Now a certain anecdote about the Pence marriage has resurfaced in a profile of Karen about how Mike Pence never eats alone with any woman other than his wife, and that he won't attend events with alcohol without his wife by his side.

More videos Pence says Congress 'just wasn't ready' US Vice President Mike Pence reiterated President Trump's words that Congress 'wasn't ready' to replace Obamacare and that the healthcare law would 'continue to explode'. He told the Hill in 2002,  it was about "building a zone around your marriage." "If there's alcohol being served and people are being loose, I want to have the best-looking brunette in the room standing next to me." Related Content Beside the vice-president, a 'prayer warrior' stands The comments, which are embedded into a profile that looks at Karen's influence on her husband and the tightness of their union ("You can't get a dime between them," says Ken Blackwell, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council and a senior domestic policy adviser on the Trump transition team) have stoked comment on social media. Some, such as conservative blogger Matt Walsh, thought the idea to be perfectly sound. Advertisement Seriously what's the appropriate reason for a married person to go out for a meal alone with a member of the other sex (outside of family)?— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) March 30, 2017 The response to Walsh was swift, with commenters offering up reasons for dining with a member of the other sex including because they were hungry, questioning whether soup was akin to adultery and others straight-up making fun of the situation.

That is - people still think it's a bit weird for men to dine with female co-workers, that many business deals are made on the golf course among blokes, that women are so often told that they're wearing the wrong thing or acting the wrong way (too little, too much) and so it's best they stay at home out of trouble, that women are either an ambitious temptress or a good wife and that men are impossibly easy to sway. This isn't about mocking Pence for his lifestyle, it's about women being denied access to professional opportunities powerful men control.— Faine Greenwood (@faineg) March 29, 2017 The revolting thing about Pence's no-meals-with-women rule isn't prudishness. It's that he's limiting key professional opportunities to men.— Ian Millhiser (@imillhiser) March 30, 2017 As Jill Filipovic noted on Cosmopolitan, "If Pence can't eat alone with a woman – which also implies he's not allowed to be alone with a woman – the end result is that he's going to work with, mentor, and promote men over women. In politics, after-work dinners and drinks are where meetings are routinely held, strategies are hashed out, career advice is doled out, information is shared, and relationships are built. If men like Pence won't engage with women one-on-one in informal settings, it's the women who miss out – because it's still men who run the show. It would be awfully hard for a woman in any high-powered industry to have a same-sex-only dining rule, because there are simply so few women at the top of their fields in politics, business, technology, and law. Ladies-only lunching (or dining of any kind) would mean the inability to meet individually and informally with the overwhelming majority of leaders in your field." So who are we to judge a man that's committed to his marriage, who does a "gut check" with his wife on all decisions and shares a mutual faith in something? Well, none of us. But it's right to question a blanket rule that perpetuates stereotypes about both sexes and in doing so, holds everyone back. It may be true that there's no such thing as a free lunch, but sometimes, well, lunch is just lunch.  Advertisement Most Popular Goodie girl holds the phone Is it time to ditch your soap?

Newly arrived from Sydney, I found it startling. This was how far the Chinese consumer had catapulted into the digital future. When I last signed an apartment lease in Beijing, over a decade ago, cash was king.  House hunters were forced to act like gangsters, clutching bags stashed with ridiculously thick wads of money to pay the standard deposit of three month's rent up front to secure somewhere to live. The deal was signed with an ancient tradition – the red-ink seal. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The smartphone simply offered convenience, which had been badly lacking in a society long bound up in red tape and rules. Photo: AP But that burdensome cash society is fast disappearing. Queuing for groceries at the supermarket this week, I was the only person reaching into my wallet to pay. I clumsily shuffled fingers to pick the right notes, then waited for change as the till was opened, and a receipt printed. Advertisement Speedy Beijing shoppers simply flash their smartphone at the cashier. She scans the Quick Response (QR) code generated on screen by their A-P-P, and they're off.  Many bring their own shopping bag, to avoid the small fee charged for an environmentally unfriendly plastic bag. Beijing is like that now. Eco-conscious and convenient. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link When Beijing's pollution level soars on the smartphone A-P-P, children are kept indoors, air purifiers switched on, and filter masks donned. Photo: Bloomberg How did a communist capital, once notorious for its bureaucratic processes, become so convenient? Last time I lived here, shopping in department stores required patience and multiple queues: to select a product and have it wrapped, take a ticket to a separate cashier's office and receive a stamped payment receipt in triplicate, which was duly carried back to the sales assistant to secure the release of the purchased goods.  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Beijing apartment prices outstrip those in Sydney, despite average wages being far lower. Photo: Bloomberg But the grand department stores of Wangfujing, old Beijing's first shopping street, sit comparatively empty now as the real business of buying stuff takes place online. Mini delivery carts zoom around the city streets bearing the logos of online shopping destinations. Shared bicycles sit waiting at busy street corners, ready for young commuters to unlock and pay with smartphones (another QR code) and pedal off to work. Taxis are almost impossible to hail, unless you have the A-P-P. The QR code is ubiquitous, from restaurants to market stalls. There are 900 million Wechat users in China, and 800 million are using its mobile payment service. Rival Alipay is even bigger, with its QR codes used in about half of the $US5.5 trillion in mobile payments made each year in China, according to analysts. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said last week the Chinese had become the world's biggest mobile payers because the population had a higher willingness to embrace change. I think it's more likely the smartphone simply offered convenience – something that had been so badly lacking in a society long bound up in red tape and rules. Digital innovation is creating freedom from bureaucracy in everyday life. But red tape continues to be heaped on life's biggest purchase – a home. Much like Sydney, housing affordability is the talk of the town. Ten years ago, my young Chinese colleagues were focused on buying apartments in Beijing, as construction boomed in the lead-up to the Olympics. Today a young worker would have little chance as a first home buyer, without help from the "bank of mum and dad". Luckily, in China, it is the bank of mum, dad and two sets of grandparents. The One Child Policy, which ended last year, has produced a generation of young Chinese who can call on the combined wealth of two families for a leg-up in life. Beijing apartment prices outstrip those in Sydney, despite average wages being far lower. In February, Beijing home prices surged another 22 per cent year on year. The government has slapped down rules to stop property speculation (ie, the kind of serial acquisition of apartments that is national sport among Australian Baby Boomers). Mortgages of more than 25 years are banned in Beijing from this week. Buying a second home requires a 60 per cent deposit. Divorcees must wait a year before they are no longer classified as second home buyers.  The central bank explained there had been a boom in families divorcing in order to beat the rules on second home purchases. Beijing residents without a "hukou" or family registration in the city must also have paid tax here for five years before qualifying to buy an apartment.

Newly arrived from Sydney, I found it startling. This was how far the Chinese consumer had catapulted into the digital future. When I last signed an apartment lease in Beijing, over a decade ago, cash was king.  House hunters were forced to act like gangsters, clutching bags stashed with ridiculously thick wads of money to pay the standard deposit of three month's rent up front to secure somewhere to live. The deal was signed with an ancient tradition – the red-ink seal. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The smartphone simply offered convenience, which had been badly lacking in a society long bound up in red tape and rules. Photo: AP But that burdensome cash society is fast disappearing. Queuing for groceries at the supermarket this week, I was the only person reaching into my wallet to pay. I clumsily shuffled fingers to pick the right notes, then waited for change as the till was opened, and a receipt printed. Advertisement Speedy Beijing shoppers simply flash their smartphone at the cashier. She scans the Quick Response (QR) code generated on screen by their A-P-P, and they're off.  Many bring their own shopping bag, to avoid the small fee charged for an environmentally unfriendly plastic bag. Beijing is like that now. Eco-conscious and convenient. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link When Beijing's pollution level soars on the smartphone A-P-P, children are kept indoors, air purifiers switched on, and filter masks donned. Photo: Bloomberg How did a communist capital, once notorious for its bureaucratic processes, become so convenient? Last time I lived here, shopping in department stores required patience and multiple queues: to select a product and have it wrapped, take a ticket to a separate cashier's office and receive a stamped payment receipt in triplicate, which was duly carried back to the sales assistant to secure the release of the purchased goods.  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Beijing apartment prices outstrip those in Sydney, despite average wages being far lower. Photo: Bloomberg But the grand department stores of Wangfujing, old Beijing's first shopping street, sit comparatively empty now as the real business of buying stuff takes place online. Mini delivery carts zoom around the city streets bearing the logos of online shopping destinations. Shared bicycles sit waiting at busy street corners, ready for young commuters to unlock and pay with smartphones (another QR code) and pedal off to work. Taxis are almost impossible to hail, unless you have the A-P-P. The QR code is ubiquitous, from restaurants to market stalls. There are 900 million Wechat users in China, and 800 million are using its mobile payment service. Rival Alipay is even bigger, with its QR codes used in about half of the $US5.5 trillion in mobile payments made each year in China, according to analysts. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said last week the Chinese had become the world's biggest mobile payers because the population had a higher willingness to embrace change. I think it's more likely the smartphone simply offered convenience – something that had been so badly lacking in a society long bound up in red tape and rules. Digital innovation is creating freedom from bureaucracy in everyday life. But red tape continues to be heaped on life's biggest purchase – a home. Much like Sydney, housing affordability is the talk of the town. Ten years ago, my young Chinese colleagues were focused on buying apartments in Beijing, as construction boomed in the lead-up to the Olympics. Today a young worker would have little chance as a first home buyer, without help from the "bank of mum and dad". Luckily, in China, it is the bank of mum, dad and two sets of grandparents. The One Child Policy, which ended last year, has produced a generation of young Chinese who can call on the combined wealth of two families for a leg-up in life. Beijing apartment prices outstrip those in Sydney, despite average wages being far lower. In February, Beijing home prices surged another 22 per cent year on year. The government has slapped down rules to stop property speculation (ie, the kind of serial acquisition of apartments that is national sport among Australian Baby Boomers). Mortgages of more than 25 years are banned in Beijing from this week. Buying a second home requires a 60 per cent deposit. Divorcees must wait a year before they are no longer classified as second home buyers.  The central bank explained there had been a boom in families divorcing in order to beat the rules on second home purchases. Beijing residents without a "hukou" or family registration in the city must also have paid tax here for five years before qualifying to buy an apartment. Green tape, by contrast, appears to be welcomed by Beijingers. Residents here care deeply about solving air pollution.  On a blue-sky day in spring, cutting edge architecture gleams in the city, as office towers bend and curve across the skyline. Blossoming peach trees line city roads, and magnolias unfurl sturdy white and purple blooms.  On the weekend, the public parks are vibrant with family kite-flying as residents ignore signs forbidding them to walk on the grass. When the pollution level soars on the smartphone A-P-P, children are kept indoors, air purifiers are switched on, and filter masks donned. There are ways to live around it. Air-purified playrooms have sprung up at glitzy shopping malls, asking a hefty price ($50 to $100) to keep children driven stir-crazy at home amused for a few hours. Inflatable domes have been erected over sports fields in upscale apartment compounds. But it doesn't beat those vast Beijing parks, with their public gardens, lakes, and cheap amusements, at just $1 entry. Beijingers want more of those blue-sky days.

Yeah right, when pigs fly. • March Madness 2017 • April Fools • Samsung C34F791 for $850 New game and BIOS updates promise to boost Ryzen performance by Wayne Manion  12:30 PM on March 30, 2017 The value proposition of AMD's Ryzen 7 lineup of eight-core processors in highly-threaded workloads is pretty clear-cut. It's harder to say the same about the CPUs' bang-for-buck in gaming when compared to Intel's Kaby Lake offerings. AMD has promised to work with game developers to improve performance of popular titles on Ryzen chips, and the company says progress has been made on this front. Additionally, AMD says it will soon ship microcode updates to motherboard vendors that should improve performance and prevent system instability in certain conditions. On the software front, AMD says it has worked with Stardock and Oxide Games to improve performance in technology-demo-slash-real-time-strategy-game Ashes of the Singularity, and with Valve Software to increase minimum-FPS performance in Dota 2. Setting aside the incomplete picture of performance provided by average FPS and minimum FPS figures, AMD says its tweaks increase average FPS in Ashes on Ryzen by somewhere between 15-30% depending on the type of test. Ryzen minimum frame rates in Dota 2 rose by almost 15% after some optimization work. PC Perspective tested the Ashes patch and saw performance jumps similar to AMD's claims on Ryzen chips. The patch didn't change performance on an Intel Core i7-6900K tested for comparison. We must note that Intel's chips still deliver the highest performance figures in Ashes, though, even after the Ryzen-focused update. AMD will soon issue a 1.0.0.4 microcode update for Ryzen CPUs, as well. This revision claims to decrease DRAM latency by up to 6 ns, prevent system instability when Ryzen chips execute "unusual FMA3" code, correct a clock speed reporting bug, and eliminate the need for the High-Precision Event Timer when using AMD Ryzen Master. AMD says BIOSes incorporating the new microcode will start showing up in early April, though update times will vary from boardmaker to boardmaker. The company goes on to say that another microcode update scheduled for release in May will "focus on overclocked DDR4 memory," which has been something of a sore spot for the platform.  If AMD can unlock similar performance gains in a wide variety of titles to those it's achieved in Ashes of the Singularity, the value proposition of all Ryzen chips in gaming workloads could improve quite a bit. Similarly, if the company can deliver on improved performance, stability, and compatibility through microcode updates, Ryzen will only become more appealing. Time will tell.

The manufacturer announced on its Edge Up blog page that BIOS updates for 35 different models with B250, H270, Q270, and Z270 chipsets will enable Optane compatibility. As we noted in our previous coverage, these devices will only work with Intel Kaby Lake Core i3, i5, and i7 CPUs with 200-series and C236 chipsets. Users with Kaby Lake chips on 100-series motherboards or Skylake processors on 200-series mainboards are left out of the Optane party. Owners of Kaby Lake Pentiums and Celerons are similarly disqualified. What we know about the first wave of consumer Optane models suggests that owners of the lower-end chipsets paired with old-school spinning-rust storage devices will see more benefits from the new technology than those with ROG Maximus IX Extreme Z270 boards paired with cutting-edge NVMe SSDs. Intel has a list of Optane-compatible boards from a number of manufacturers here. As a reminder, the 16 GB model is expected to sell for $44 and the 32 GB model will go for $77.

Yeah right, when pigs fly. • March Madness 2017 • April Fools • Samsung C34F791 for $850 DDR5 will boost bandwidth and lower power consumption by Wayne Manion  10:30 AM on March 31, 2017 Memory standards tend to stick around for a long time. The DDR3 RAM still supported by the memory controllers inside Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs first hit the scene all the way back in 2007, though the speeds have increased and the operating voltage and power consumption went down in the intervening years. A brisk three years after DDR4 hit the market, JEDEC has announced that it's working on a specification for DDR5 memory, and expects to publish the design standards sometime in 2018. The organization says that DDR5 memory will offer double the bandwidth and density of DDR4 along with increased power efficiency. Given the trend of increasing  core counts and the difficulty and expense of adding additional memory channels to motherboards, DIMM bandwidth seems set to become more important in the future. The standards body is also working on a specification for NVDIMM-P, the next-generation of the NVDIMM standard for memory modules that retain their contents after power loss. The NVDIMM standard could face competition from Intel's datacenter Optane products. Optane offers much lower latencies than even the fastest NVMe storage, along with the same non-volatile operation. For perspective, JEDEC first started talking about DDR3 in May 2005 and products started hitting the market in 2007. The pattern was similar for DDR4, whose final spec arrived in September 2012 and was supported by CPUs released in the second half of 2014. We would expect a lead time at least that long for the first DDR5 products. JEDEC says more information should be available at its Server Forum event in June.

Wall Street Daily Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us WSD Team Contact Us Archives Ensure Email Delivery Frequently Asked Questions Broker Listing CEOs Hunt Down New Takeover Targets Published Thu, Mar 30, 2017  |  Jonathan Rodriguez, Senior Analyst A storm is brewing in the stock market, and it has nothing to do with the failure of Trumpcare. Right now U.S. corporations are sitting on nearly $2 trillion in cash here at home. And according to Capital Economics, American firms have another $2.5 trillion stashed overseas. Combine that with low interest rates and tepid earnings growth and you’ve got the perfect recipe for merger mania this year. But what should you look for in a takeover target, and more importantly — which companies make the grade? Senior Analyst Jonathan Rodriguez breaks it all down for you below… Ahead of the Tape, Louis Basenese Chief Investment Strategist, Wall Street Daily Why Takeovers Are Such a Big Deal If you’ve followed the financial news over the last few years, you’ve likely seen a lot of coverage on mergers and acquisitions. And if you weren’t following closely, you might wonder why M&A is such a hot topic… Well, in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 — and fueled by ultralow interest rates — corporate earnings took off in a way not seen since the dot-com boom of the 1990s. But after years of eye-popping earnings growth, the gravy train finally hit a speed bump in 2015. A slowdown in consumption overseas — particularly in China and Europe — hit multinational corporations hard here in the U.S. But many firms were already hoarding mountains of cash — and had access to even more easy money with cheap credit. So what do you do as a loaded company when growth slows down and you’re not sure when it’s going to pick up again? You create growth by acquiring your rivals and pocketing their cash flow. What followed in 2015 was a record-breaking year for M&A. Around the world, $4.3 trillion of merger deals were made, according to Dealogic. The Early Bird Gets the Worm Now, you might be wondering what this means for the average shareholder. In short, if you happen to be one of the fine people holding shares of a takeover target, you could be in line for a big payday. Acquiring companies will often pay for targets in cash, stock and/or debt. And they can offer investors a premium to the current share price anywhere from 20–60%. For instance, semiconductor giant Intel Corp. announced a deal this month to purchase Israeli tech firm Mobileye N.V. — for $15.3 billion. Intel offered to buy Mobileye shares at $63.54 in cash, which represented a 34% premium to the latter’s closing price the day before the announcement. On March 13, the day news of the deal broke, shares gained 28%. As you can see, the rewards of owning a hot takeover target before it’s scooped up are big — and can come swiftly. How to Snag Your Pot of Takeover Gold As you can imagine, the criteria for an acquisition vary based on the kind of business a company operates. But many takeover targets display similar traits… For starters, look for companies with a high cash balance and low level of debt. Acquiring firms love to see a high cash balance in targets. After all, the acquirer is going to pocket the loot once the deal goes through. In fact, a company’s enterprise value (EV) can be a very useful figure for investors hunting for M&A gold. EV is simply a firm’s market capitalization plus debt, minus cash — and it represents a company’s theoretical takeover price. Investors can also divide this number by a company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to give them an even more powerful tool. EV/EBIDTA, better known as the enterprise multiple, allows investors to compare a target with other firms on a relative basis. Some analysts even consider EV/EBITDA to be a superior measure of earnings than the price-earnings ratio. In the context of takeovers, though, the lower an enterprise multiple… the better a value the target is. Above all, a company sporting a valuation below that of the broader market (i.e., price-earnings, price-to-sales, etc.) is more likely to be acquired than a company with an excessive valuation. Bottom line: The combination of slow growth, low interest rates and high corporate cash balances will likely fuel a resurgence of mergers and acquisitions this year. And keeping a keen eye out for “cheap” companies with lots of cash and little debt could make you rich in the event of a takeover.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) By Marisa Kendall | mkendall@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 31, 2017 at 5:14 pm | UPDATED: March 31, 2017 at 11:54 pm PALO ALTO — Offering more proof that the IPO market is rebounding, big-data startup Cloudera on Friday filed to raise up to $200 million in its long-awaited public debut. Related Articles After worst IPO year since recession, Silicon Valley hopes for brighter 2017 Snap IPO: Shares soar in first day of trading Silicon Valley startups follow Snap to the public market The Palo Alto-based company is the latest in a string of enterprise tech companies to indicate plans for an initial public offering, ending the dry spell that had analysts fretting last year. The filing also comes on the heels of Snap’s massive IPO in early March, which saw a first-day pop of 44 percent that Silicon Valley investors hoped would tempt other tech companies to the public market. Cloudera, which provides an open source data analysis platform to other companies, brought in $261 million in revenue in the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, up 57 percent from $166 million the year before, according to the document the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. The company’s net losses were $187.3 million last fiscal year, and $203.1 million the year before. “We have a long history of losses, and we may not become profitable in the future,” the company wrote in the filing. The company, which was incorporated in 2008, had 1,470 full-time employees in January. A spokeswoman for Cloudera declined to provide additional comments Friday. The company has raised about $1 billion and was last valued around $4 billion as a private company. Cloudera plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CLDR.” Intel is one of Cloudera’s major investors and partners, pouring $741.8 million into the startup in 2014, and holds 22 percent of the company’s shares — making it the largest outside shareholder. Cloudera also has optimized its software for use with Intel processors. That deeply involved relationship could be a blessing and a curse, Cloudera’s Friday filing revealed. “Intel could have considerable influence over matters such as approving a potential acquisition of us,” Cloudera wrote. “Intel’s investment in and position in our company could also discourage others from pursuing any potential acquisition of us, which could have the effect of depriving the holders of our common stock of the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over the prevailing market price.” After 2016 proved to be a slow year for tech IPOs, 2017 so far has seen increased activity. Following Snap’s much-watched debut, San Francisco-based software company MuleSoft and Irvine-based data analytics company Alteryx went public, and San Francisco startup Okta and New York-based Yext have filed for IPOs. Okta is expected to price its IPO next week. Snap’s March 2 debut marked the first tech IPO of 2017. San Francisco-based software startup AppDynamics had been poised to break the ice with a $156 million IPO in January, but instead sold to Cisco for $3.7 billion two days before it was set to price the offering.

House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said in an interview earlier today that the reports about White House officials helping provide him the information he read on White House grounds are “mostly wrong.” The New York Times reported yesterday that two White House officials––Ezra Cohen-Watnick and Michael Ellis––“played a role” in helping Nunes view the intelligence he saw on White House grounds last week. The Washington Post followed that up with its own report saying that “at least three senior White House officials, including the top lawyer for the National Security Council, were involved in the handling of intelligence files” Nunes reviewed. The chairman stated that he wouldn’t get into “sources and methods,” but added, “Those reports are mostly wrong.” He said they’re full of “innuendo” and while there were people who were probably aware of him being on White House grounds, “that doesn’t make them the source of my information.” Bloomberg View columnist Eli Lake wrote yesterday that Nunes had “misled” him by saying his source of information was an intel official and not a White House staffer: The chairman told me Thursday that elements of the Times story were inaccurate. But he acknowledged: “I did use the White House to help to confirm what I already knew from other sources.” You can watch the video above, via KSEE.

Rugged, spill-proof exterior. 2-in-1 convertible form factor. Support for Google for Education administration and features. Cons Low-resolution screen. No USB-C ports. Bottom Line The Dell Chromebook 3189 is a durable convertible laptop, with a long-lasting battery, a multimode hinge, and enough processing juice to help power online and classroom learning. By Joel Santo Domingo As its name implies, the Dell Chromebook 3189 Education 2-in-1 (starts at $349; $389 as tested) is a convertible laptop made with students in mind. It delivers all-day battery life, and is built tough enough to handle all the abuse that school-age children can dish out. And since it supports school-administered Google for Education accounts, this reasonably priced chromebook can be shared among students and managed by teachers or school IT staffers, making it a welcome addition to the classroom. //Compare Similar Products Compare Asus Chromebook Flip (C302CA-DHM4)   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell Chromebook 11 Non-Touch   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook 15 (CB3-532-C47C)   %displayPrice%%seller% CTL J5 Chromebook   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkPad 11e Chromebook   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook 14   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook 14 for Work   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Chromebook 13 G1   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo N22-20 Touch Chromebook   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook R 13 (CB5-312T-K5X4)   %displayPrice%%seller% Hanging Tough The Chromebook 3189 has a rounded edge surrounding its black, polycarbonate exterior, but is otherwise devoid of any design flair. It measures 0.8 by 12 by 8.2 inches (HWD) and weighs 3.16 pounds. That's a bit thicker and heavier than the Asus Chromebook Flip, our top pick for chromebooks, but the Chromebook 3189's rugged construction is the reason for the added heft. View All 10 Photos in Gallery Since it's MIL-STD 810G tested and rated, the Chromebook 3189 can withstand extreme temperatures, rapid changes in altitude, blowing sand and dust, shock and vibration, and drops up to 30 inches onto a wooden surface. The rounded edges are rubberized, and there are two long rubber strips on the bottom panel to help prevent the laptop from sliding around. The chiclet-style keyboard is sealed against liquids, and the top lid is scratch-resistant. This chromebook is designed to survive all day in the classroom, as well as trips back and forth from home in a school bag packed with textbooks along with school and sports supplies. Made to Touch The 2-in-1 convertible form factor means that you can pivot the screen 360 degrees around its dual hinges, allowing you to use the touch screen in traditional Laptop mode, Tent mode (with the keyboard pointed away, and the hinge pointing upward), Stand mode (with the keyboard flat on the table, and the screen angled in front), or Tablet mode (with the keyboard folded away 360 degrees, and the screen up and exposed). The touch screen is responsive, and comes in handy for both data entry and on-screen drawing and note-taking. The 11.6-inch display has a low 1,366-by-768 resolution, which is the minimum required for chromebooks. Full HD screens, like the one on the Asus Chromebook Flip and the Acer Chromebook 14, are still rarities, and we don't consider full HD an absolute necessity for use in a school setting. Using a lower-resolution screen on the Chromebook 3189 eases the strain on the Intel Celeron N3060 processor, since it doesn't have to process the extra pixels. Native 720p and downscaled 1080p videos displayed smoothly on the panel in our tests, though downscaled 4K videos stuttered and paused often for processing. In addition to easing the burden on the processor, the lower-resolution screen also uses less power than a full HD or 4K screen, leading to better battery life. Like its predecessor, the Dell Chromebook 11 Non-Touch, the Chromebook 3189 has a multicolored Dell Activity Light on the top-right corner of the lid, that a teacher can use to make sure all students in the class are on the same page, are online, or are ready (say, for an exam to start). Or it can be used by a student to signal the teacher in lieu of a raised hand. An API for the light is available online, so you can integrate various colored lights into your teaching programs. The keyboard is optimized for Chrome OS. That means that instead of the standard F1-F12 keys, the top row of function keys are labeled with icons for forward/back, reload, full-screen, toggling Overview mode (to show all windows at once), screen brightness, screen lock, and volume controls. There's a dedicated Search key in place of the Caps Lock key, since you would likely use the search function more often in the web-based Chrome OS. Key action is smooth, and the keyboard itself is very sturdy. There's no keyboard flex at all, something that will help the laptop survive being shared among grade-school students. Like the keyboard, the one-piece touchpad is also sealed against spills. There's a good selection of connectivity ports, including a headset jack on the right side of the laptop, as well as an HDMI port, a microSD card reader (which accepts up to 256GB cards) for extra local storage, a power connector, and two USB 3.0 ports on the left panel. There are no USB-C ports, which are pretty rare on chromebooks right now. Integrated 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 handle wireless connections. Like all chromebooks, this laptop runs the stripped-down ChromeOS operating system. It basically uses the Chrome browser as its main interface to the web, eschewing storage-space-filling programs like Microsoft Office. On the flip side, if your school uses Windows programs developed in-house, or off-the-shelf apps, you may be out of luck trying to run them on ChromeOS. Also, the Chromebook 3189 doesn't yet support Android apps, though compatibility could be added in the future, as ChromeOS automatically updates itself over the internet when available. A Look Inside Our review configuration has 32GB of fast SSD storage. There are also Chromebook 3189 models available with 16GB ($329) and 64GB ($409) SSDs. We think 32GB of storage is large enough for Chrome OS, because students will likely save their work in the cloud-based Google Drive that comes with each Google for Education account. As long as your school has more than four users, Google includes unlimited storage online, or 1TB each for one to four users. Google for Education is free to all accredited nonprofit education organizations. The 4GB of RAM, which is standard for all three versions, isn't expandable, but it should be sufficient for basic web and office app functions. In testing, we were able to keep a half dozen actively updated websites and a streaming audio site running simultaneously. The Intel Celeron N3060 is the only processor available on the Chromebook 3189, and it is fast enough for tasks like browsing education sites, light drawing and coloring in grade-school art classes, and viewing videos from sites like PBS.com. It might be a little light on power compared with, say, the Intel Core m3 chip in the Asus Chromebook Flip, but the Chrome OS and browser runs well on this budget-priced CPU. We weren't able to run our Windows-based benchmark tests on the laptop, but it felt snappy while leading and navigating between websites. We could easily edit a letter in Google Docs, stream music from Spotify, and chat in Slack simultaneous, for example. As long as you keep the number of active tabs below 12, you should be fine. Windows systems in this price range are likely to have Celeron or lower-power processors, like the Intel Atom CPU in the Asus Transformer Mini (T102HA-D4-GR). Our Editors' Choice budget Windows 2-in-1 convertible, the Lenovo Yoga 710, goes for $549, and like the Asus Chromebook Flip comes with a speedier Intel Core m3 processor. See How We Test Laptops The 42WHr battery pack is sealed into the chassis, and can't be swapped out. That's not likely to be an issue, though, since the Chromebook 3189 lasted an impressive 11 hours and 39 minutes in our battery rundown test. When fully charged, the laptop will last an entire school day, and still have enough juice for homework afterward. It's still an hour longer than the Asus Chromebook Flip (10:23), which has a higher power drain from its full HD screen, but there are other chromebooks that returned longer run times, including the Acer Chromebook 15 (14:17) and the CTL J5 Chromebook (12:21). Ready for School The Dell Chromebook 3189 Education 2-in-1 is an attractive choice for the school environment, thanks to its relatively low price, decent feature set, durable construction, and long-lasting battery. For non-students, we still prefer the Asus Chromebook Flip, our Editors' Choice chromebook, since its metal exterior, faster processor, and larger full HD screen make it a better fit in a home-entertainment capacity. If you're willing to give up the convertible hinge, the $230 Lenovo N22-20 Touch Chromebook is a utilitarian clamshell chromebook that will save you a few bucks. And if you absolutely must have Windows, the Asus Transformer Mini is a decent (if slowish) alternative for about the same price. That said, if you're filling out a purchase order for a few dozen (or a few hundred) units at a time for your educational institution, the Chromebook 3189 should be on your short list.

AUTOMATION DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNET TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVES INSIGHTS GOVTECH.COM FutureStructure_Grey FutureStructure Many Aspects of Autonomous Tech Need Perfecting Before AVs Become Mainstream For starters, sensors must shrink, improve their range and become less expensive, while mobile networks must eliminate transmission delays so vehicles can communicate instantly. by Mike Freeman, The San Diego Union-Tribune / March 31, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) -- Back in 1995, the NavLab 5 team at Carnegie Mellon University launched an autonomous vehicle on a trip from Pittsburgh to San Diego. The vehicle navigated itself, without intervention from a human driver, for 98 percent of the 2,800 mile journey. It averaged speeds above 60 mph. So if self-driving technology worked on a cross-country trip 22 years ago, why aren’t roads filled with autonomous cars today? RELATEDNervousness About Autonomous Vehicles PersistsFinding Trust and Understanding in Autonomous TechnologiesAn Autonomous Future is Dawning in Nevada The reason is the technology remains closer to the research lab stage and is not ready for prime time, say experts. It’s not good enough or affordable enough yet for widespread use. Sensors must shrink, improve their range, particularly in bad weather, and become less expensive. Mobile networks must eliminate transmission delays so vehicles can communicate instantly -- not only with nearby cars but also with the internet cloud to process data. Costs for very precise, real-time, three-dimensional map technology to guide self-driving cars must come down. Artificial intelligence software must be nimble to handle the unexpected – ranging from predicting behavior of nearby drivers to figuring out when an object in the road is a harmless plastic bag or an undercarriage-crushing rock. And perhaps most importantly, the driving public needs to come to grips with what it wants from autonomous vehicles, which hold the promise of reducing accidents and fatalities but may not be perfect. In May 2016, a man died when his Telsa crashed into a big rig while operating in the car maker’s self-driving software mode known as Autopilot. U.S. regulators determined that Telsa’s software functioned properly in the Florida accident but Autopilot requires full-driver attention at all times. In March, Uber briefly suspended autonomous car testing after a crash in Arizona, which officials said wasn’t the fault of the self-driving vehicle. It occurred when a nearby motorist failed to yield. “We really expect our autonomous cars to do much better than us, otherwise we are not going to use them,” said Gabriel Rebeiz, an electrical and computer engineering professor at UC San Diego. “That is a very high bar.” These hurdles don’t mean that the march toward self-driving cars has stalled. If anything, it’s gaining momentum. Nearly all automakers are working on autonomous vehicles programs. Google and Uber are testing robotic car technologies on the road. Big technology companies including Qualcomm and Intel have targeted automotive technology as a major growth market. It is part of the rationale behind Qualcomm’s pending $38 billion acquisition of automotive chip outfit NXP Semiconductors and Intel’s recent $15 billion buyout of automotive sensor/software outfit Mobileye. Work on autonomous vehicles has been going on since the early 1980s, said Takeo Kanade, a computer vision professor and winner of the 2016 Kyoto Prize for Advanced Technology, during a recent event in San Diego. The cross-country trip between Pittsburgh and San Diego was a milestone achievement for Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon and the advancement of self-driving vehicles. One advantage to automation is the potential to reduce accidents and save lives. Vehicle crashes kill more than one million people globally each year and injure millions more. Cutting the number of wrecks would bring down medical and insurance costs. “What happens when a child chases a ball onto the road? As a human you can slam on the brakes and stop car. But machines will react much faster than humans,” said Chris Mi, chair of electrical and computer engineering department at San Diego State University. Coupled with connected smart infrastructure, autonomous vehicles also could traverse highways and streets more efficiently, limiting traffic jams and reducing carbon emissions. And self-driving cars free up time for motorists to do other things on their way to the office, boosting productivity. To get there, data from on-board cameras, radar and lidar sensors is being fused together to create a picture of what’s around the car. Lidar, which can cost $60,000 or more, works like radar but uses light instead of radio waves. At International CES in January, Ford demonstrated a pickle-jar sized laser lidar, mounted near the side-view mirror on a prototype self-driving sedan. (Not long ago, lidar systems were the size of a suitcase.) It pinpointed people and objects around the car — creating a very detailed dynamic view of its surroundings. But it also required a trunk full of powerful computer servers to process the data — which probably isn’t practical for real life self-driving vehicles. High-speed 5G mobile networks could be critical for autonomous vehicles – providing a way to off-load the hefty computer processing demands to the internet cloud. 5G also is expected to reduce transmission delays — known as latency — in wireless networks, paving the way for connected cars to make split second decisions required on the road. 5G networks could roll out as early as 2019. There are other roadblocks facing autonomous vehicles, such as legal questions of who is responsible if a self-driving car causes an accident. Cybersecurity experts worry about connected cars being hacked and wrecking havoc. But advocates of autonomous technology believe these barriers eventually will be pushed aside. With today’s self-driving prototypes, a driver is obligated to be ready to take control at any moment. But in about a decade, autonomous cars where a human driver’s attention is not required could begin showing up on the road. The arrival of these autonomous cars might be different than we expect, said consultant Sven Beiker, a former BMW technologist and ex-director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford. “There is lot of work on these automated robo-taxis, where it operates within 20 city blocks -- maybe to the airport -- but you can’t take it to the next city,” said Beiker. “So it might not be the Toyota or Chevrolet or Volkswagen that I buy, push a button and it drives me home automatically. Maybe it’s I wait for my Uber, and when it arrives there is no driver.” In the meantime, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems will incrementally boost automation and safety in cars. Already, lane monitoring technology in some vehicles will automatically correct drifting. Several automakers offer automatic braking in new models. Adaptive Cruise Control will automatically adjust speed to maintain a safe distance between vehicles. At CES, BMW demonstrated a sedan that parked itself. “It is going to take time,” said Rebeiz, the UCSD professor. “But we have the electronics. We have the know-how. It’s just going to take time before we integrate it all together.” ©2017 The San Diego Union-Tribune Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 April 2017 by Military News Berkeley Lab Researchers Make NWChem’s Planewave “Purr” on Intel’s Knights Landing Architectures A team of researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Intel are working hard to make sure that computational chemists are prepared to compute efficiently on next-generation exascale machines. Recently, they achieved a milestone, successfully adding thread-level parallelism on top of MPI-level parallelism in the planewave density functional theory method within the popular software suite NWChem.  “Planewave codes are useful for solution chemistry and materials science; they allow us to look at the structure, coordination, reactions and thermodynamics of complex dynamical chemical processes in solutions and on surfaces,” says Bert de Jong, a computational chemist in the Computational Research Division (CRD) at Berkeley Lab. Developed approximately 20 years ago, the open-source NWChem software was designed to solve challenging chemical and biological problems using large-scale parallel ab initio, or first principle calculations. De Jong and his colleagues will present a paper on this latest parallelization work at the May 29-June 2 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium in Orlando, Florida. Multicore vs. “Manycore”: Preparing Science for Next-Generation HPC Since the 1960s, the semiconductor industry has looked to Moore’s Law—the observation that the number of transistors on a microprocessor chip doubles about every two years—to set targets for their research and development. As a result, chip performance sped up considerably, eventually giving rise to laptop computers, smartphones and the Internet. But like all good things, this couldn’t last.  As more and more silicon circuits are packed into the same small area, an increasingly unwieldy amount of heat is generated.  So about a decade ago, microprocessor designers latched onto the idea of multicore architectures—putting multiple processors called “cores” on a chip—similar to getting five people to carry your five bags of groceries home, rather than trying to get one stronger person to go five times faster and making separate trips for each bag.  Supercomputing took advantage of these multicore designs, but today they are still proving too power-hungry, and instead designers are using a larger number of smaller, simpler processor cores in the newest supercomputers. This “manycore” approach—akin to a small platoon of walkers rather than a few runners—will be taken to an extreme in future exaflop supercomputers. But achieving a high level of performance on these manycore architectures requires rewriting software, incorporating intensive thread and data-level parallelism and careful orchestration of data movement. In the grocery analogy, this addresses who will carry each item, can the heavier ones be divided into smaller parts, and should items be handed around mid-way to avoid overtiring anyone—more like a squad of cool, slow-walking, collaborative jugglers.  Getting Up to Speed on Manycore The first step to ensuring that their codes will perform efficiently on future exascale supercomputers is to make sure that they are taking full advantage of manycore architectures that are being deployed. De Jong and his colleagues have been working for over a year to get the NWChem planewave code optimized and ready for science, just in time for the arrival of NERSC latest supercomputer Cori. The recently installed Cori system at the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) reflects one of these manycore designs. It contains about 9,300 Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Landing) processors and according to the November, 2016 Top500 list, is the largest system of its kind, also representing NERSC’s move towards exascale.  de Jong and his colleagues were able to gain early access to Cori through the NERSC Exascale Science Applications Program and the new NWChem code has been shown to perform well on the new machine. According to de Jong, the NWChem planewave methods primarily comprise fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms and matrix multiplications of tall-skinny matrix products. Because current Intel math libraries don’t efficiently solve the tall-skinny matrix products in parallel, Mathias Jacquelin, a scientist in CRD’s Scalable Solvers Group, developed a parallel algorithm and optimized manycore implementation for calculating these matrices and then integrated that into the existing planewave codes. When trying to squeeze the most performance from new architectures, it is helpful to understand how much headroom is left—how close are you to computing or data movement limits of the hardware, and when will you reach the point of diminishing returns in tuning an application’s performance. For this, Jacquelin turned to a tool known as a Roofline Model, developed several years ago by CRD computer scientist Sam Williams. Jacquelin developed an analysis of matrix factorization routine within a roofline model for the Knights Landing nodes. In a test case that simulated a solution with 64 water molecules, the team found that their code easily scaled up to all 68 cores available in a single massively parallel Intel Xeon Phi Knights Landing node. They also found that the new, completely threaded version of the planewave code performed three times faster on this manycore architecture than on current generations of the Intel Xeon cores, which will allow computational chemists to model larger, more complex chemical systems in less time. “Our achievement is especially good news for researchers who use NWChem because it means that they can exploit multicore architectures of current and future supercomputers in an efficient way,” says Jacquelin. “Because there are other areas of chemistry that also rely on tall-skinny matrices, I believe that our work could potentially be applied to those problems as well.” “Getting this level of performance on the Knights Landing architecture is a real accomplishment and it took a team effort to get there,” says de Jong. “Next, we will be focusing on running some large scale simulations with these codes.” This work was done with support from DOE’s Office of Science and Intel’s Parallel Computing Center at Berkeley Lab. NERSC is a DOE Office of Science User Facility. In addition to de Jong and Jacquelin, Eric Bylaska of PNNL was also a co-author on the paper.  CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Next-Generation Software Supports Explorations Beyond the Nanoworld into the Intramolecular Picoworld Next PostNext 2017 “U Text.

NVIDIA's amazing stock price run in 2016 has paused lately. Here's what's going well for the chipmaker, the threats it faces, and what the future is likely to bring for shareholders. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Mar 31, 2017 at 3:33PM NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently completed fiscal year was one for the history books. The company's stock price in its fiscal 2017 skyrocketed 229% as the chipmaker strengthened its position in its core GPU gaming segment, and expanded further into artificial intelligence (AI), data centers, and driverless car tech. But despite a stellar fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report in early February, the company's stock price is down about 3% over the past three months (at the time of this writing). Investors may be wondering if that stock price sputter is just a blip on the long-term radar, or if NVIDIA's growth days are really over. To get a better picture of what's happening, let's take a look at the chipmaker's current prospects and problems: Image source: Getty Images. What's going right NVIDIA brought in about 62% of its revenue in Q4 (which ended Jan. 29) from its GPU gaming segment, and revenues from that business increased 66% year over year. That's great news for the company, which holds more than 70% of the discrete desktop GPU market share right now. The company's ability to maintain its commanding position in the GPU market and continue growing those revenues is crucial to its stability -- and so far, it's pulling those feats off quite well. But NVIDIA is doing much more with its processors than just enhancing computers for gaming. The company's chips also power its Drive PX 2 self-driving car supercomputer, and sit at the heart of robust machine-learning data centers. NVIDIA's automotive revenue grew 37% year over year in Q4, and data center revenue shot up by 205%. The company believes that these two markets will be major growth drivers going forward, with the autonomous car market expected to hit $77 billion by 2035 and NVIDIA's GPU-powered data centers and products -- like its DGX-1 supercomputer -- giving it a total addressable market in AI of $5 billion. What could be problematic  I recently highlighted three potential problems NVIDIA may face in another article, and it's worth reiterating them here. First of all, its strong position in gaming GPUs will be challenged a bit more when rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) releases its new high-end GPU architecture, called Vega, later this year.  Vega is expected to go head-on against NVIDIA's popular GTX-1080 card, and marks a shift of focus for AMD from mid-range GPUs to the higher-end market. It's still unclear how much this will impact NVIDIA -- if at all -- but it's certainly something investors should keep an eye on. Additionally, NVIDIA's position in the driverless car technology market will face increased pressure after Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently announced its plan to buy self-driving tech leader Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) for $15.3 billion. Mobileye holds about 70% of the worldwide market for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and that dominant position, paired with Intel's processors, could pose a challenge to NVIDIA's automotive plans. If all that weren't enough, Intel is also targeting the AI market. The company holds about a 99% market share in the server market right now, and it doesn't want to cede any of that to NVIDIA. That's why Intel has made several AI purchases recently, among them a company called Nervana Systems that Intel expects will help it achieve a 100-fold increase in neural network performance over the next three years. Final verdict So are NVIDIA's growth days over? In short, probably not. The company still holds a very strong position in its core business --  GPU gaming -- and even rising competition from AMD won't take that away any time soon. It's also early in the game for both driverless car technologies and AI, and NVIDIA has just as much potential to excel in both as rival Intel. But investors should be conservative in how much they expect NVIDIA to grow. The company is already trading at forward P/E of 32, which makes it a bit expensive compared to the average P/E ratio of 26 for tech sector overall. A large share of NVIDIA's stock price gains in 2016 were driven by investors' excitement over its future opportunities (and, of course, its strong earnings reports), but that means a lot of optimism is now baked into the stock. Thus, 2017 could produce more tempered share price gains for NVIDIA.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Nvidia.

"The First to Crack?" was the headline at Axios, where Mike Allen warned, "Flynn is a loose cannon with nothing left to lose. The Trump camp should be worried. "The Flynn Ultimatum" splashed across the Huffington Post front page. Related: Is Nunes Toast? White House Struggles to Explain Who Leaked Intelligence On Bloomberg television, anchor Tom Keene declared that "the weathervane changed last night for the president," and reporter Kevin Cirilli agreed, calling Flynn's move "a devastating blow" to the Trump administration. Across the media, people were gleefully repeating Flynn's own words from an interview with NBC's Chuck Todd last year when he suggested something sinister behind immunity requests from people with connections to Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. "I mean, five people around her have been given immunity, to include her former chief of staff. When you are given immunity, that means you have probably committed a crime." Others reminded us that President Trump, as a candidate, told a rally last year that immunity requests were basically proof of wrongdoing. "The reason they get immunity is because they did something wrong. If they didn't do anything wrong, they don't think in terms of immunity," he said. "If you are not guilty of a crime, what do you need immunity for, right?" Related: House Intel Chair Says Intel Agencies May Have 'Spied' on Trump But the idea that Trump's inner circle is about to turn on him with devastating revelations about Russian interference in the election and collusion with the Trump team is probably just wishful thinking on the part of the president's political opponents. A retired US Army Lieutenant General, Flynn has been under intense media scrutiny since he was fired as National Security Adviser less than a month after taking the job. He was let go after it was revealed that he had not disclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador that appear to have undercut the Obama administration's efforts to punish Moscow for what US intelligence agencies insist was a Kremlin-backed effort to damage Clinton's candidacy. Under the circumstances, legal experts say, it makes perfect sense for Flynn to seek assurances that he won't be put in legal jeopardy, even if he doesn't believe he has actually done anything wrong. Indeed, that's the exact argument his attorney, Robert K. Kelner, made in a statement Thursday. His client, Kelner said, "has a story to tell and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit." Related: Former Trump Campaign Chair Worked to 'Benefit the Putin Government' However, he added, "Notwithstanding his life of national service, the media are awash with unfounded allegations, outrageous claims of treason, and vicious innuendo directed against him. He is now the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated. No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution." Trump made the case somewhat less delicately on Twitter Friday morning, writing, "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!" On the LawNewz blog, run by ABC chief legal affairs correspondent Dan Abrams, writer Rachel Stockman polled various well-known criminal defense attorneys, and the general verdict was that the immunity request was a simply evidence that Flynn's attorney knows what he's doing. The request was "fairly standard," white collar criminal defense attorney Elkan Abramowitz told her. "I can't imagine if I were his lawyer that I wouldn't ask for immunity regardless of whether he did anything illegal or not," said attorney Mark Zaid, who specializes in government whistleblower cases.

"I can't imagine if I were his lawyer that I wouldn't ask for immunity regardless of whether he did anything illegal or not," said attorney Mark Zaid, who specializes in government whistleblower cases. This is not to say that Flynn hasn't done anything wrong, or that he definitely won't provide damning information about the Trump campaign and its relationship to Russia. But the simple fact that he has requested immunity isn't proof of either.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement MSI launches Trident 3 VR-ready, console-sized gaming PC 03/29/2017 at 4:00 PM by Brad Linder 7 Comments MSI is following up last year’s Trident gaming computer with a new model called the Trident 3. Like its predecessor, the new model is about the size of an Xbox or PlayStation game console, but under the hood it’s a full-fledged gaming PC. What’s new is that the Trident 3 swaps has an Intel Kaby Lake CPU rather than Skylake. It’s available from retailers including Amazon, B&H, Newegg and Walmart for around $900 and up, depending on the configuration. And this week MSI unveiled a new Trident 3 Arctic white model for folks looking for something a bit brighter than the standard black version. The Arctic model features an Intel Core i7-7700 quad-core processor, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 graphics, 16GB of RAM, a 256GB solid state drive, and a 1TB 7200RPM hard drive. That model should be available in April for $1500. Looking for a cheaper option? MSI’s Trident 3 with a black case has the same basic design, but that model has NVIDIA GeForce 1060 graphics and comes in several different configurations: Core i5-7400/8GB/1TB HDD for $900 Core i7-7700/8GB/128GB SSD + 1TB HDD for $1100 Core i7-7700/16GB/256GB SSD + 1TB HDD for $1300   Both the Trident 3 and the Trident 3 Arctic are the same size. The computer’s case measures about 13.6″ x 9.2″ x 2.8″ and the PC features a USB 3.1 Type-C port, three full-sized USB 3.1 ports, 4 USB 2.0 ports, two HDMI outputs and one HDMI input, Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi, and Bluetooth. via BetaNews Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 7 Comments on "MSI launches Trident 3 VR-ready, console-sized gaming PC" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member zdanee Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Linux 4.11 brings improvements for Intel Atom PCs (Bay Trail and Cherry Trail) 03/29/2017 at 5:00 PM by Brad Linder 7 Comments If you’ve tried installing Ubuntu or other GNU/Linux-based operating systems on a computer with an Intel Atom Bay Trail or Cherry Trail processor, there’s a decent chance you ran into problems with WiFi, audio, or other hardware. But Ian Morrison notes that the upcoming Linux 4.11 kernel fixes one of the last remaining issues: HDMI audio. Since Ubuntu 17.10 and other operating systems set to launch later this year will probably use the new kernel, that means there’s a better chance that you’ll be able to use the official install images to get Ubuntu (or other Linux-based operating systems) up and running with minimal fuss. Until then, Morrison has a workaround. Intel has pretty much given up on producing new Atom chips for low-power laptops, tablets, and notebooks. But if you’ve already got a Bay Trail or Cherry-Trail powered device that you’d like to use as a Linux PC rather than a Windows or Android machine, the latest kernel should be helpful. Among other things, it’ll let you let you plug your device into a TV using a single HDMI cable. Previously you would have either needed to apply a software patch or use a separate audio cable to deliver sound to a TV. Morrison has released a script that lets you build your own Ubuntu disc image by patching the official ISO with the latest Linux 4.11 kernel release candidate. It’s not quite as simple as downloading a pre-built disc image, and the script only runs on a computer that’s running Linux. But it provides more flexibility than simply downloading one of Morrison’s existing disc images, since you can choose pretty much any version of Ubuntu (including newer and older releases and different flavors including Lubuntu and Xubuntu). You can also find some additional scripts to get Ubuntu working with common WiFi and Bluetooth hardware used in Atom-powered systems at Morrison’s website.     Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 7 Comments on "Linux 4.11 brings improvements for Intel Atom PCs (Bay Trail and Cherry Trail)" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member Dan Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

"Hanging over everything Trump does is the ongoing Russia investigation, and in the House, the investigation is led by the Republican chairman of the intelligence committee, Devin Nunes," Meyers said, "who has basically done everything he can to delay or interfere with his own investigation, raising the question of whether he is investigating Trump, or working for Trump." As for the latest revelation that two White House officials leaked info to Nunes that he then relayed to Trump, Meyers said, "That means Nunes went to the White House to brief Trump from information he got from the White House. It's like when you send yourself an email reminder and two minutes later go, 'Oh, a new email!'" Stephen Colbert started out talking about Trump and Nunes as well, before pivoting to Mike Pence and his very strange rules about dining with women. "Let's take a break from Trump for a moment, can we do that?" he said. "Let's talk about someone who has no power in Washington: Mike Pence." Why does Pence reportedly never allow himself to eat alone with any woman who isn't his wife, or attend events featuring alcohol without her? "One Amstel Light, and he's dry humping the bread basket. Oh there's snow on the roof, but there's a fire in the furnace," Colbert said. "He is so naughty, if you left him alone with a bottle of whiskey, he might try to have sex with it. And Jim Beam and Jack Daniels are both dudes, and he's not into that scene, alright? He has to pray away the Mount Gay."

On paper, pairing former Kentucky wide receiver Jeff Badet with Oklahoma seems like a perfect match for his one year left of eligibility. We’ll see if the paper is right. Badet announced earlier this week he is going to be a graduate transfer for the Sooners and eligible to play for OU during the 2017 season. Give a lot of credit to OU coaches Cale Gundy, Dennis Simmons and Lincoln Riley for this one. They did a fantastic job during Badet’s visit was really breaking down why OU should be the spot for him. Badet had visits planned for Virginia Tech and Oregon, but those obviously won’t occur now. The coaches constructed charts detailing how OU compares rather favorably with some of the other schools Badet was considering. Gundy is always the first contact, and Badet said he had been in touch with Gundy as much as possible throughout this process, but it was key for Riley and Simmons to make their pitch, too. Simmons holds a lot of cache right now as the man who helped develop Dede Westbrook into OU’s first Biletnikoff Award winner, given to the nation’s best receiver. So it made a lot of sense for Badet to consider the Sooners, and then flip it and see it’s the right move for OU to consider Badet. Badet is someone who can stretch the field. The thought of having Badet and Marquise Brown on the field at the same time should give defenses a cause for concern. You can try to lock down one, but stopping both of them from using their speed doesn’t sound possible. You look at Badet’s numbers of 31 catches for 670 yards and four touchdowns and what you see is the right guy at the wrong place. Averaging more than 21 yards per catch is impressive no matter what level, but averaging more than 21 yards per catch means you should be receiving more looks. Now it’s hard to say whether it was Kentucky’s scheme or its quarterback play as to why Badet’s numbers didn’t leap off the page, but it shouldn’t be the case for the Sooners. Add in Badet to the arsenal of weapons for quarterback Baker Mayfield, and it’s makes all the sense in the world for OU fans to be excited and for OU to take this graduate transfer gamble one more time. It worked with Justin Brown. It worked with Geno Lewis. OU is hoping for the trifecta with Badet, who won’t arrive at OU until after the spring semester. He was used in a variety of ways with the Wildcats. Screens, reverses, deep balls. They knew his potential, and now OU is in a spot where it can maximize it.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Keyshawn Embery still open to OU In this corner...

The Sooner Intel, created by Bob Przybylo in 2011, is an inside look into Oklahoma football and basketball recruiting and is solely for Sooners Illustrated subscribers. It is a sneak peek into what’s happening with OU recruiting and is not to be distributed anywhere else. It’s too early to say it, but it’s not too early to wish for it. If Oklahoma has its way, it won’t have to leave Bradenton (Fla.) IMG Academy to find its running backs for the 2018 and 2019 classes. Step one was completed last weekend when T.J. Pledger, No. 20 in the Scout 100, committed to OU. Good news continued this week for Pledger as he was officially invited to The Opening on Thursday evening. Step two is still too far off, but the Sooners have made a great early impression on 2019 running back Noah Cain. http://www.scout.com/player/202007-noah-cain?s=146 Originally from Denton (Texas) Guyer, Cain transferred in the winter to IMG just like Pledger did to give IMG a lethal one-two punch in the backfield. “Me and T.J. Pledger, OU sits high with us because they're just real down-to-Earth guys and good people," said Cain to Scout earlier this week. “I just want to check it out again.” Cain has been to OU a couple of times, dating back to his days at Denton Guyer. He is the only running back for the 2019 class offered by OU at this point. He returns Friday, fresh off a trip to Texas earlier in the week. Cain has had some impersonal trips the first time around. He’s looking for more with this visit. “I know they have new facilities going on, plus I just want to meet with the coaches again to get more of a personal visit because the last times I've been have been games and junior days and stuff like that,” Cain said. “They've still shown me love, but I just want to go there for a more personal visit because I'm going up there with my mom, so we'll just be up there checking it out.” It sounds arrogant to say, but any time OU makes an offer at running back it does feel like it’s noteworthy. The Sooners simply don’t offer many and usually because they don’t have to with the way the spot has produced on a yearly basis. The kids used to say Adrian Peterson, but now the trend has gone to Demarco Murray and might even be Joe Mixon and Samaje Perine here in a short time. In other words, OU’s success speaks for itself at the position. It’s something running backs coach Jay Boulware recognizes and is not afraid to use when it comes to recruiting. “This is Oklahoma. This is Running Back U,” said Boulware when discussing the young group of backs at OU right now. “So I mean, there’s no patience for continuing to make the same mistakes over and over and over again. You’ve got to grow, and that’s the conversation I just got done having with them. You’ve got to continue to grow every single day. You’ve got to get better. That’s what I expect. That’s what we expect. That’s what this university expects. “You’ve got a long line of great runners that have been here and played at this university. Either you’re going to be up here at that level or somebody’s going to come in here and beat you out.” Cain was electric in his two seasons at Guyer, rushing for 2,741 yards. Last season? He rushed for 1,683 yards with 22 touchdowns, averaging more than eight yards per carry. OU has laid the foundation with Pledger. The Sooners are building it with Cain and hope Friday is another step in the right direction.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Keyshawn Embery still open to OU In this corner...

Mike FreemanContact Reporter A look at the state of self-driving cars, and when they might show up for everyone. Back in 1995, the NavLab 5 team at Carnegie Mellon University launched an autonomous vehicle on a trip from Pittsburgh to San Diego. The vehicle navigated itself, without intervention from a human driver, for 98 percent of the 2,800 mile journey. It averaged speeds above 60 mph. So if self-driving technology worked on a cross-country trip 22 years ago, why aren’t roads filled with autonomous cars today? The reason is the technology remains closer to the research lab stage and is not ready for prime time, ay experts. It’s not good enough or affordable enough yet for widespread use. Sensors must shrink, improve their range, particularly in bad weather, and become less expensive. Mobile networks must eliminate transmission delays so vehicles can communicate instantly -- not only with nearby cars but also with the internet cloud to process data. Costs for very precise, real-time, three-dimensional map technology to guide self-driving cars must come down. Artificial intelligence software must be nimble to handle the unexpected – ranging from predicting behavior of nearby drivers to figuring out when an object in the road is a harmless plastic bag or an undercarriage-crushing rock. And perhaps most importantly, the driving public needs to come to grips with what it wants from autonomous vehicles, which hold the promise of reducing accidents and fatalities but may not be perfect. In May 2016, a man died when his Telsa crashed into a big rig while operating in the car maker’s self-driving software mode known as Autopilot. U.S. regulators determined that Telsa’s software functioned properly in the Florida accident but Autopilot requires full-driver attention at all times. In March, Uber briefly suspended autonomous car testing after a crash in Arizona, which officials said wasn’t the fault of the self-driving vehicle. It occurred when a nearby motorist failed to yield. “We really expect our autonomous cars to do much better than us, otherwise we are not going to use them,” said Gabriel Rebeiz, an electrical and computer engineering professor at UC San Diego. “That is a very high bar.” These hurdles don’t mean that the march toward self-driving cars has stalled. If anything, it’s gaining momentum. Nearly all automakers are working on autonomous vehicles programs. Google and Uber are testing robotic car technologies on the road. Big technology companies including Qualcomm and Intel have targeted automotive technology as a major growth market. It is part of the rationale behind Qualcomm’s pending $38 billion acquisition of automotive chip outfit NXP Semiconductors and Intel’s recent $15 billion buyout of automotive sensor/software outfit Mobileye.   Google is among the companies testing self-driving cars Google is among the companies testing self-driving cars Work on autonomous vehicles has been going on since the early 1980s, said Takeo Kanade, a computer vision professor and winner of the 2016 Kyoto Prize for Advanced Technology, during a recent event in San Diego. The cross-country trip between Pittsburgh and San Diego was a milestone achievement for Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon and the advancement of self-driving vehicles. One advantage to automation is the potential to reduce accidents and save lives. Vehicle crashes kill more than one million people globally each year and injure millions more. Cutting the number of wrecks would bring down medical and insurance costs. “What happens when a child chases a ball onto the road? As a human you can slam on the brakes and stop car. But machines will react much faster than humans,” said Chris Mi, chair of electrical and computer engineering department at San Diego State University. Coupled with connected smart infrastructure, autonomous vehicles also could traverse highways and streets more efficiently, limiting traffic jams and reducing carbon emissions. And self-driving cars free up time for motorists to do other things on their way to the office, boosting productivity. To get there, data from on-board cameras, radar and lidar sensors is being fused together to create a picture of what’s around the car. Lidar, which can cost $60,000 or more, works like radar but uses light instead of radio waves. At International CES in January, Ford demonstrated a pickle-jar sized laser lidar, mounted near the side-view mirror on a prototype self-driving sedan. (Not long ago, lidar systems were the size of a suitcase.) It pinpointed people and objects around the car — creating a very detailed dynamic view of its surroundings. But it also required a trunk full of powerful computer servers to process the data — which probably isn’t practical for real life self-driving vehicles.   Computers in the trunk of a Ford prototype self-driving vehicle process sensor data Computers in the trunk of a Ford prototype self-driving vehicle process sensor data High-speed 5G mobile networks could be critical for autonomous vehicles – providing a way to off-load the hefty computer processing demands to the internet cloud. 5G also is expected to reduce transmission delays — known as latency — in wireless networks, paving the way for connected cars to make split second decisions required on the road. 5G networks could roll out as early as 2019. There are other roadblocks facing autonomous vehicles, such as legal questions of who is responsible if a self-driving car causes an accident. Cybersecurity experts worry about connected cars being hacked and wrecking havoc. But advocates of autonomous technology believe these barriers eventually will be pushed aside. With today’s self-driving prototypes, a driver is obligated to be ready to take control at any moment. But in about a decade, autonomous cars where a human driver’s attention is not required could begin showing up on the road. The arrival of these autonomous cars might be different than we expect, said consultant Sven Beiker, a former BMW technologist and ex-director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford. “There is lot of work on these automated robo-taxis, where it operates within 20 city blocks -- maybe to the airport -- but you can’t take it to the next city,” said Beiker. “So it might not be the Toyota or Chevrolet or Volkswagen that I buy, push a button and it drives me home automatically. Maybe it’s I wait for my Uber, and when it arrives there is no driver.” In the meantime, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems will incrementally boost automation and safety in cars. Already, lane monitoring technology in some vehicles will automatically correct drifting. Several automakers offer automatic braking in new models. Adaptive Cruise Control will automatically adjust speed to maintain a safe distance between vehicles. At CES, BMW demonstrated a sedan that parked itself. “It is going to take time,” said Rebeiz, the UCSD professor. “But we have the electronics. We have the know-how. It’s just going to take time before we integrate it all together.” Caption Virgin America will disappear into Alaska Airlines in 2019 Virgin America will be fully absorbed by Alaska Airlines by the end of 2019.

It’s almost certainly the last piece of Dark Souls 3 content From Software will ever produce, and an extensive, enthralling adventure in its own right – one that represents all that’s best and worst about the Souls series. When I say “worst”, I don’t want to suggest that this is in any way a disappointing piece of DLC, just that it won’t do anything to convince non-Souls fans to finally pick up that controller and, in the words of Bandai Namco’s marketing team, "prepare to die". This is more of the same challenging, user-unfriendly action RPG stuff we’ve seen in previous Souls games – and unlike the somewhat curtailed previous piece of Darks Souls 3 DLC, Ashes of Ariandel, there’s plenty of it. Size isn’t an indicator of a game’s quality, but I’d estimate that The Ringed City is about twice as big as Ashes of Ariandel: there are four boss fights compared to Ariandel’s two, and the DLC’s world is physically larger. There’s a lot more meat on The Ringed City’s bones – more places to explore, more monsters to fight, more gear to discover and more to think about, plot-wise – and that’ll come as welcome news to anyone who found themselves polishing off Ariandel’s challenges in five hours or so. I also found it a lot harder than Ashes of Ariandel, being designed for veterans who have already reached the late game of the main Dark Souls 3 campaign. In fact, the DLC can only be accessed from two places: a bonfire right before the main game’s final boss encounter; and a bonfire that appears after killing the final boss of Ashes of Ariandel. You’ll need a character that’s battled through at least that far to even get started. Related: Best PS4 games The only appropriately levelled character I had in my Dark Souls 3 save files was, unfortunately for me, a spell caster build – a metaphorical “glass cannon” that could deal high ranged damage but generally died in a couple of hits if the enemies got close. Not the best for venturing into unknown, deadly late game DLC territory, I soon discovered. Time after time, I was presented with the old familiar “YOU DIED” message and not just during the DLC’s boss battles, although these are tough as nails – one in particular, albeit an optional encounter, might just be the hardest Souls boss I’ve ever fought. There are two long sequences in the game where a combination of environmental hazards and sheer weight of mob enemy numbers caused me to turn the air of my living room a dark, dark shade of blue, many many times. I can only apologise to my neighbours for whatever they may have heard me holler, but here’s the thing about The Ringed City: like the best bits of previous Souls games and its spiritual brother Bloodborne, these frustrating deaths are actually lessons. The game is teaching you how to play it well by killing you, and the feelings of achievement and sheer joy when you do get through those sections, or when you fell a boss that’s murked you ten times in a row… well, it’s a rare one in modern video games that is to be treasured. Related: Best PC games Feeling stuck? You can, of course, summon in other players and AI-controlled NPCs to help you out at key points, and other players can invade your world to make things even tougher. Aside from one new covenant and some new arenas, though – and one clever boss-related player-versus-player mechanic that’s making its Dark Souls 3 debut with this DLC – The Ringed City doesn’t drastically change the multiplayer part of the base game. If you pick up your controller to relax, you may not value From Software's approach quite so much, or the obtuse way the RPG tells its story. When the likes of Mass Effect: Andromeda or The Witcher III: Wild Hunt don’t leave much to interpretation plot-wise, Dark Souls has always revelled in its vagueness. You’ll have to read the descriptions of items, examine the environment carefully or pore over seemingly trivial lines of dialogue if you want to form any sort of cogent theory on what’s going on in The Ringed City. And even if you do, nobody at From is ever going to come out and tell you you were right. I like it that way, but appreciate it’s an acquired taste. For fear of spoilers, I won’t go into details of characters’ motivations or the story, but suffice it to say that The Ringed City delivers a suitably Souls-esque conclusion to the series. There’s no tying everything up in a neat, satisfying bow, for every answer given you can expect another, new question. Related: Best Xbox One games Verdict The Ringed City is a must for Dark Souls fanatics, and not just because it’s almost certainly the final chapter in what has become a cult classic series. It’s a great piece of DLC in its own right, with thrilling boss fights, gorgeous locations and an appropriately sad, mournful ending. If you count yourself among the hordes of gamers who adore these games for what they are, then you’ll find this last jaunt through a perilous, dying world where everything wants to kill you over and over again a joy.

Creative Commons Zero In today's stupendous roundup, we will dig into the beloved lshw (list hardware) and lsusb (list USB) commands. This is a wonderful rabbit hole to fall down and get lost in as you learn everything about your hardware down to minute details, without ever opening the case. lshw The glorious lshw (list hardware) command reveals, in excruciating detail, everything about your motherboard and everything connected to it. It's a tiny little command, weighting in at a mere 639k, and yet it reveals much. If you run lshw with no options you get a giant data dump, so try storing the results in a text file for leisurely analysis, and run it with root permissions for complete results: 
$ sudo lshw | tee lshw-output.txt
 The -short option prints a summary: 
$ sudo lshw -short
H/W path   Device     Class     Description

                      system    To Be Filled By O.E.M.

/0/b/1                memory    8GiB DIMM DDR3 Synchronous 1333 MHz (0.8 ns)
 I assembled this system, so there is no OEM description. On my Dell PC it says "Precision Tower 5810" (0617). This abbreviated example displays the hardware paths, which are the bus addresses. The output is in bus order. /0 is system/bus, your computer/motherboard. /0/n is system/bus/device. You can see these in the filesystem with ls -l /sys/bus/*/*, or look in /proc/bus. The lshw output tells you exact locations, like which memory slots are occupied, and which ports your SATA drives are connected to. The Device column displays devices such as USB host controllers, hard drives, network interfaces, and connected USB devices. The Class column contains the categories of your devices, and you can query by class. This example displays all storage devices, including a USB stick: 
$ sudo lshw -short -class storage -class disk

 Use -volume to show all of your partitions. In the first example I see my motherboard model, H97M Pro4, but I don't remember anything else about it. No worries, because I can call up excruciatingly detailed information by omitting the -short option: 
$ sudo lshw -class bus
  *-core                  
       description: Motherboard
       product: H97M Pro4
       vendor: ASRock
       physical id: 0
       serial: M80-55060501382
 Check it out, the serial number, vendor, and everything. Consult the fine man page, man lshw, and see Hardware Lister (lshw) for detailed information on what all the fields mean. lsusb The usbutils suite of commands probes your USB bus and tells you everything about it. This includes usb-devices, lsusb, and usbhid-dump. openSUSE and CentOS also package lsusb.py, but don't include any documentation for it. My guess is it's obsolete as it was last updated in 2009, so let us move on to the freakishly useful lsusb: 
$ lsusb
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:8001 Intel Corp. 
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:8009 Intel Corp. 
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 148f:5372 Ralink Technology, Corp. RT5372 Wireless Adapter
Bus 003 Device 004: ID 046d:c018 Logitech, Inc. Optical Wheel Mouse
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
 This may be all you ever need to verify what USB devices are connected to your system, and whether it is seeing all of them. It also tells us a lot of interesting details, starting with bus assignments. The above output is on an older system that includes both 3.0 and 2.0 controllers, which may seem odd because USB standards are always backwards-compatible. But some 2.0 devices had problems with 3.0 controllers, so it made sense to have both. There are only two external USB devices in the above output, a Ralink wi-fi dongle and a USB mouse. What are all those other things? The root hub is a virtual device that represents the USB bus. Its device number is always 001, and the manufacturer is always 1d6b: Linux Foundation. The device ID tells us the USB standard, so 1d6b:0002 is a USB 2.0 bus, and 1d6b:0003 is USB 3.0. In the above output there are two physical host controllers: 8087:8001 Intel Corp. USB 2.0) and 8087:8009 Intel Corp. (USB 3.0). On this system this is the Intel 9 Series Chipset Family Platform Controller Hub (PCH). This particular controller manages all I/O between the CPU and the rest of the system. There are no North and South bridges as there were in in the olden Intel days; everything is managed in a single chip. The architecture is rather interesting, and you can read all the endless details in the 815-page datasheet. The pertinent bits for this article are as follows. There are two physical EHCI host controllers (USB 2.0), and one xHCI host controller (USB 3.0). You can see this more clearly with the tree view: 
$ lsusb -t
/:  Bus 04.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/6p, 5000M
    |__ Port 4: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Mass Storage, Driver=usb-storage, 5000M
/:  Bus 03.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/14p, 480M
    |__ Port 5: Dev 13, If 0, Class=Vendor Specific Class, Driver=rt2800usb, 480M
    |__ Port 12: Dev 4, If 0, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 1.5M
/:  Bus 02.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=ehci-pci/2p, 480M
    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/8p, 480M
/:  Bus 01.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=ehci-pci/2p, 480M
    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/6p, 480M
 This reveals all manner of fascinating information. It displays the kernel drivers, the USB versions of the connected devices (1.5M = USB 1.1, 480M = USB 2.0, and 5000M = USB 3.0), classes, busses, ports, and device numbers. There are four buses because the xHCI controller manages both USB 2.0 and 3.0 devices. lspci more clearly shows three physical host controllers: 
$ sudo lspci|grep -i usb
00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 9 Series Chipset Family
USB xHCI Controller
00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 9 Series Chipset Family
USB EHCI Controller #2
00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 9 Series Chipset Family
USB EHCI Controller #1
 The physical USB ports that you plug your devices into are supposed to be color-coded. 3.0 is blue, and 2.0 ports are black. However, not all vendors use colored ports. No worries, just use a 3.0 device and lsusb to map your ports. You may query specific buses, devices, or both. This example queries bus 004 and displays detailed information on the bus and connected devices: 
$ sudo lsusb -vs 004:
 You may query by vendor and product code: 
$ sudo lsusb -vd 148f:5372
 Update the ID database: 
$ sudo update-usbids
 You can also update the lspci database: 
$ sudo update-pciids

Lange for The New York Times Air and fuel heaters at General Electric’s Gas Turbine Technology Lab in Greenville, S.C. G.E.’s chief has been outspoken about clean energy. Jeffrey R. Immelt, General Electric’s chief executive, says climate change is real, a position at odds with the Trump administration. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 72.08 +0.49 +0.68% Intel Corp INTC ▲ 36.07 +0.32 +0.90% General Electric Co GE ▼ 29.80 -0.07 -0.23% PepsiCo Inc PEP ▼ 111.86 -0.32 -0.29% As a member of a White House manufacturing advisory council, he also has President Trump’s ear. And environmentalists are counting on Mr. Immelt, and other executives close to the president, to use that access to argue for policies to combat global warming when the White House is rolling them back. Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter The companies’ business objectives and credibility are also at stake. Elon Musk of Tesla, another member of Mr. Trump’s council, is building an energy business intended to avoid the need for fossil fuels in favor of solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles. Doug McMillon of Walmart, the retail giant, has committed his company to a sharp reduction in the planet-warming gases it emits, as has Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, the food and beverage company. BlackRock, the world’s largest publicly traded money manager — whose chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, sits on Mr. Trump’s council — has pledged to press companies to address the effects of climate change on their businesses. And Intel, Johnson & Johnson and Campbell Soup were among hundreds of businesses that urged the United States after Mr. Trump’s election to stick with last year’s Paris climate agreement and its commitment to reduce carbon emissions. “Mr. Trump says the business perspective is especially important, so hearing the business voice is critical,” said Kevin Moss, of the World Resources Institute, an environmental research group in Washington. “The companies are demonstrating that it’s in their business interest to take action on climate,” he said. “The more they’re willing to say that and take action, the stronger the message comes across.” Those hopes have become increasingly urgent as Mr. Trump — against the warnings of scientists, environmentalists and even the government’s own research — has moved to nullify the Obama administration’s efforts on climate change. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump directed the Environmental Protection Agency to start withdrawing and rewriting Mr. Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which would have closed hundreds of coal-fired power plants. In a joint statement after the order, a group of technology companies, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, urged Mr. Trump to stay the course. “Strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change,” they said. That action also spurred Mr. Immelt to write a blog post to G.E.’s 300,000 employees in which he criticized the rollback. “We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted,” said the post, first reported by Politico. “This is just the beginning of what will be a long process” of a repeal, he said, but “no matter how it unfolds, it doesn’t change what G.E. believes.” Jennifer Friedman, a General Electric spokeswoman, declined to say whether Mr. Immelt intended to relay his thoughts to Mr. Trump personally. Many other companies also declined to commit their executives to intervening with the president on climate-related policies. But Ms. Friedman emphasized that Mr. Immelt was outspoken, and she cited G.E.’s focus on clean energy, including Current, a subsidiary that focuses on products and services in energy efficiency, renewable generation and energy storage to large customers. “He’s pretty out there and clear,” he said. “That’s his position in every conversation he has.” A PepsiCo spokesman, Jay Cooney, said the company believes that “combating climate change is critical to the future of our company, customers, consumers and our world.” Kevin Gardner of Walmart, said its environmental commitments were “embedded in our business.” Thomas Hushen, spokesman for Campbell Soup, said the company supported “continued U.S. participation in the Paris agreement and the continuation of low-carbon policies and investment in a low-carbon economy.” Campbell’s chief executive, Denise Morrison, participates in Mr. Trump’s advisory council because “we believe it is important to have a voice on matters that will affect our industry, our company and our employees.” Mr. Hushen said. Corporations, especially those with strong consumer brands, have been increasingly responsive to customer and shareholder concerns about climate change. And the global nature of their businesses means many of their customers are in countries where there is a greater acceptance of the science behind climate change, and the need to tackle it. Walmart, Intel, General Motors and Lockheed Martin — all of which have senior executives on Mr. Trump’s business councils — have signed on to the principles of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofit groups working to make corporate purchases of renewable energy easier. Last year, General Motors said it would generate or procure 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050. Dell, another company with the president’s ear, says it expects to reduce the energy intensity of its products by 80 percent by 2020. “In many cases, I think businesses disagree with the administration,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a nonprofit group that uses shareholder resolutions to advocate for greater corporate environmental and social responsibility. “People still care about climate change,” she said. “The administration may not, but they do have consumers and employees and reputations to uphold.” Some corporations’ positions on climate change are not as clear-cut as they may seem. Intel joined in a plea for the United States to honor its Paris commitments but was also among companies that submitted comments critical of the carbon pollution regulations in the Clean Power Plan. Environmentalists also worry about the influence of companies that have opposed climate regulations. General Motors and Ford, for example, successfully advocated a review of stringent federal regulations on vehicle pollution. And at least six companies with seats on Mr. Trump’s advisory boards — JPMorgan Chase, Walmart, Boeing, IBM, Dow Chemical and Lockheed Martin — also participate in the Business Roundtable, which in mid-February gave Mr. Trump a wish list of 16 rules it wanted killed, including the Clean Power Plan. (Walmart declined to address the discrepancy between that group’s demands and its climate commitments, and Intel did not respond to requests for comment.) Then there is the former ExxonMobil chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, now secretary of state. Mr. Tillerson has publicly disparaged the Clean Power Plan, calling it “an unfortunate example of E.P.A. exceeding its authority” in a 2015 speech. But Exxon has also urged the Trump administration not to retreat from the Paris agreement and has supported a tax on carbon emissions. Businesses are pushing for policies to fight climate change “because of a well-balanced economic judgment of whether or not they should,” said Hervé Touati, a managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental research group. He added that sentiment among corporate executives had, after the 2009 global climate conference in Copenhagen, shifted away from the belief that fighting climate change would be too expensive. “In Paris, there was a very significant number of business leaders that had changed their minds and considered that it was going to hurt the economy if we don’t do something,” he said.

More videos Mars mission plans unveiled Head of SpaceX Elon Musk has outlined his plans for an interplanetary rocket that can transport people and cargo to Mars. Phil Larson, a space policy adviser to former US President Barack Obama who worked for SpaceX and is now at the University of Colorado, has called the mission a "Wright Brothers moment for space." Much of the expense of space travel lies in building engines, capsules and other equipment only to be used once and then discarded. Billionaires including Musk and Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos are racing to make rocket reusability - once derided as a crazy idea - into a reality that will dramatically lower costs. Related Content SpaceX rocket launched from historic NASA pad in Florida SpaceX successfully launches rocket SpaceX has built the Falcon 9 as well as the rocket's Merlin engines in-house, taking a Silicon Valley approach to constant improvements and a tight collaboration between design and manufacturing. The rocket SpaceX was attempting to re-fly on Thursday first took off and landed successfully on an unmanned drone ship bobbing in the Atlantic Ocean in April 2016. The company has recovered eight rockets in total, three by land and five by sea. Advertisement Recovering and refurbishing the used rocket booster that flew on Thursday took SpaceX roughly four months, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said earlier this month. Eventually, that turnaround time will drop to a single day as the company aims to refly rockets much in the way airplanes operate today. "I think Elon's given us 24 hours, maybe, to get done what we need to get done," said Shotwell. "That vehicle needs to be designed to be reflown right away." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link SpaceX says it can save considerable time and money by reusing the big, expensive parts of its Falcon 9 rockets. Photo: Bloomberg SpaceX has successfully launched four rockets this year and aims to fly 20 to 24 missions in 2017. The California-based company has contracts with the NASA valued at $US4.2 billion ($5.5 billion) to resupply the International Space Station using its unmanned Dragon spacecraft and later ferry astronauts there with a version capable of carrying crews. Musk announced last month that SpaceX plans to send two private citizens who paid "significant deposits" on a week-long flight circling the moon late next year. The chief executive officer of electric car and batteries maker Tesla founded SpaceX 15 years ago with the goal of one day creating a human colony on Mars.

Laverty The cost of a Falcon 9 launch is roughly $US62 million, according to SpaceX's website, with modest discounts available for contractually committed, multi-launch purchases. SES, which has flown with SpaceX twice before, was the first commercial satellite operator to launch with the company back in 2013. The reused rocket was first flown on April 8 with the CRS-8 mission, a cargo resupply mission to the space station. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Musk's vision is to establish a full-fledged city on Mars and thereby make humans a multi-planetary species. Photo: AP SES, as SpaceX's first commercial customer, now expects its own piece of space flight history as a memento. "Gwynne has promised us parts of the rocket," said SES Chief Technology Officer Martin Halliwell. "We want them for the SES board room." 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Devin Nunes Briefs Reporters At The White House On Intelligence Cmte Russia Investigation (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)    Nunes Did Nothing New By Viewing Raw Intel At The White House Richard Pollock Reporter 9:31 PM 03/30/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5564886 There is nothing new about House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes leaving the panel’s secure room beneath the Capitol Building and heading to the White House complex or a related facility nearby to view raw intelligence, The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group has learned. For years, intelligence committee chiefs have trekked to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue or to an intelligence agency to view such super sensitive intelligence material, because the congressional secure room can’t handle such material. Former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Pete Hoekstra told TheDCNF that “if someone was going to present me with raw intelligence or unfinished intelligence or with intelligence which was designed for use by another part of the government, yeah, it’s very reasonable to expect that I would have to go somewhere else.” The Michigan Republican chaired the intelligence panel from 2004 to 2007. Nunes has been harshly criticized by congressional Democrats for his decision to travel to the White House executive complex to view raw intelligence delivered by a whistleblower about allegations the Obama administration spied on then President-elect Donald Trump and his transition aides. Nunes’ actions amount to collusion with the Trump White House, according to Democrats, led by California Democrat Adam Schiff, the intelligence committee’s ranking minority member. The New York Times Thursday went further, identifying two White House National Security Council (NSC) officials who assisted Nunes. The NYT concluded the unmasking of the NSC officials “is likely to fuel criticism that the intelligence chairman has been too eager to do the bidding of the Trump administration.” But Col. (Ret.) Jim Waurishuk, who served at the NSC, told TheDCNF such viewings are “routine,” especially at the White House complex. “Speaking from my experience, I talked to members of both sides of the aisle,” he told TheDCNF. “I’ve done that a thousand times. I say that’s routine because that goes on all the time when you’re dealing with the intelligence committee or the armed services committees. We regularly obliged them. Cleared committee chairmen would go over the White House once or twice a week.” Waurishuk was also deputy director for intelligence at the U.S. Central Command, and is now vice president of OPSEC, a nonpartisan group of retired special forces and intelligence officials. “The Members of Congress don’t get to see raw information,” Fred Rustmann, a 24-year CIA veteran, told TheDCNF. “They get to see finished information that has to be disseminated through normal channels.” Members of the “Gang of Eight” — chairmen and ranking minority members of the Senate and House intelligence committees, plus top House and Senate leaders — cannot rely on getting real-time intelligence, raw intelligence or unfinished intelligence by sticking with their limited computers. They instead must travel elsewhere to access this highly sensitive information. The congressional intelligence chiefs usually go to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to view the data. The complex is not in the White House itself, but sits next to it in an ornate 19th century building built in the French Second Empire style. The building contains the world’s most elaborate secure facilities known as Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities. Congressional officials can review raw intelligence at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., the National Security Agency in Ft. Meade, Md. and at 15 other intelligence agencies “In the agency [the CIA], the computers are hooked up so the intelligence won’t go out of the agency,” Rustmann said. “Members of Congress would be forced to go to the CIA to view that information.” Cooperation between the intelligence agencies and the congressional committees has not always been smooth. Relations between the CIA and the Senate Intelligence Committee nearly collapsed in rancor and discord during the Obama administration when senators and staffers were accused of stealing sensitive CIA information from a clandestine CIA facility. Members of the Senate committee, led by then-chairman Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, reviewed information about interrogation techniques at a secret CIA location in Virginia. Mistrust by both sides erupted when printed portions of materials somehow left CIA custody, then turned up in a safe in a second-floor Senate building, according to The Guardian. Critics wonder why raw intelligence can’t be viewed on Capitol Hill computers, but intelligence officials told TheDCNF that classifications would have to be downgraded before they could transmit some of the nation’s most sensitive documents to the less capable congressional computer systems. This would also greatly expand the number of people entitled to view the classified documents or tapes. The raw intelligence issue exploded recently when in the final days of the Obama administration, the president expanded the sharing of raw satellite communications, phone calls and emails collected by the National Security Agency to 16 other intelligence agencies without the previous safeguard protections. Waurishuk, who said he has routinely helped Democrats and Republicans view raw intelligence since 1990, called the recent Democratic attacks “temper tantrums.” “I wish they would grow up and become adults,” he mused.

But the congressional official said investigators were unwilling to broker a deal with Flynn – who resigned last month for misleading White House officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States – until they are further along in their inquiries and they better understand what information Flynn might offer as part of a deal.

Separately, the White House figures behind the disclosure to Republican House intelligence chairman Devin Nunes of documents suggesting Trump had been picked up in surveillance were revealed, giving insight into a development that has stalled progress in the investigation of links between Trump and Russia. The revelations rocked Washington even as experts testifying in the Senate described the sustained influence campaign mounted by Russia during the US election. Related Content US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigns Michael Flynn a dramatic early casualty in Trump administration Flynn's lawyer, in a statement on Thursday evening US time, confirmed discussions with the House and Senate intelligence committees about possible testimony by his client. The lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not provide specifics about the terms under which Flynn would testify, but said that "no reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicised, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution".

The Wall Street Journal reported Flynn's offer to testify.

Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 31 March 2017 The New York Times reported on Thursday that two White House officials played a role in providing Nunes with documents the Republican committee chairman cited to show Trump and his associates were swept up in surveillance by US intelligence. Several US officials identified the White House officials as Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a lawyer who works on national security issues at the White House Counsel's Office and formerly worked on the staff of the House Intelligence Committee. Trump said Nunes' comments about the surveillance helped justify his insistence, made without evidence, that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower in New York, his campaign headquarters.  As investigations into personal links between the Trump campaign and Russia continues, the Senate committee pressed ahead as well. 'Propaganda on steroids' Russia mounted a campaign of "propaganda on steroids" seeking to influence the 2016 US presidential election, Senator Mark Warner told an intelligence committee hearing on the allegations. The top Democrat on the US Senate Intelligence Committee listed several areas of concern about possible links to Republican Donald Trump's campaign. In Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin again denied that Russia tried to influence the election, but in doing so he made reference to the wrong US president in answering a question at an Arctic forum. "Once, Reagan, while discussing, I think, taxes, told the Americans: 'Read my lips: 'No!'" His reply recalled what George H.W. Bush told Americans during his 1988 presidential election campaign, "Read my lips: No new taxes." Bush later raised taxes. Trump has dismissed suggestions of links with Moscow as Democratic Party sour grapes about his surprise November defeat of the party's candidate, Hillary Clinton. US intelligence agencies said Russia hacked emails of senior Democrats and orchestrated the release of embarrassing information to hurt Clinton's campaign. "I will not prejudge the outcome of our investigation," Senator Mark Warner told an intelligence committee hearing on the allegations. "We are seeking to determine if there is an actual fire, but so far there is a great, great deal of smoke." Putin also said on Thursday that contacts Russian diplomats had made in the United States were merely part of routine work. At the hearing, lawmakers warned of the danger that Russia could interfere in elections in France and Germany this year and in future US campaigns. Cyber security experts at the rare day-long public hearing detailed what they described as the dissemination of disinformation and cyber attacks on both Democratic political operatives and Republicans. Lawmakers and cyber experts mentioned stories that were being spread to discredit German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And they said Britain's "Brexit" vote last year on leaving the European Union should be examined. Clinton Watts, a security consultant and former FBI agent, told Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican committee member, that he may have been a victim of Russian activity during his unsuccessful campaign for the 2016 Republican nomination against Trump. Rubio later said he would not comment. But he told the hearing that in July 2016, after he announced he would run for re-election to the Senate, former members of his presidential campaign team were targeted by an unsuccessful cyber attack from Russia. He said former campaign staffers were also targeted unsuccessfully from within Russia within the past 24 hours. "We're all targets of a sophisticated and capable adversary," said Senator Richard Burr, a Republican who heads the intelligence committee. Democrat Warner, who was a technology executive before entering politics, described a sweeping Russian campaign using trolls and botnets, or networks of hacked or infected devices, to spread large amounts of disinformation. The campaign of "fake news" was particularly targeted at traditionally Democratic-leaning states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Trump defeated Clinton by narrow margins that were not predicted by opinion polls, he said. "This Russian 'propaganda on steroids' was designed to poison the national conversation in America," Warner said. Citing concerns to be addressed in the committee's probe, Warner listed the prediction by a Trump associate about the release of hacked emails weeks before they were released, a change in the Republican Party's platform to water down language on Ukraine, and Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and other Trump associates being forced to step down over ties to Russia. A separate investigation in the House of Representatives into the intelligence agencies' allegations of a Russian role in the US election has become mired in controversy over accusations that its Republican chairman, Trump ally Nunes, is not impartial. Nunes and Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House committee, met on Thursday to discuss their investigation. Schiff said the two had discussed obtaining documents before deciding which witnesses to call in.

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (15) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   READERS LIKE YOU!

Is your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar getting less battery life per charge than you think it should? The culprit could be applications that are forcing it to use the high-performance graphics processor. Here’s how to tell which GPU is in use and which applications to close to switch to the integrated processor. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply Troy T  2017-03-19 22:55 I've used this utility for years and continue to be happy with it. As it isn't maintained, it's less helpful in shifting sources of video drivers, but it continues to flawlessly show when the system is using discrete graphics and which apps are forcing its use. As long as gfxCardStatus still reports what's going on with the video circuitry, I'll strongly recommend it for anyone who is interested in stretching their battery capacity. Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU. Reply Brian Harvey  2017-03-28 00:43 More a question than a comment.

I seem to have a lot of spinning beach balls. I cut they system down to only a few add ons such as SwithcResX. I still frequently get the spinning beach ball with Safari and iTunes. I even get the ball with the MBP native resolution with no external monitor attached. Anyone seen this happening? Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-28 04:55 I have seen a lot of spinning beach balls of late - maybe since Sierra 10.12.3? MacBook Pro 15" with Thunderbolt Display and lid closed.

That doesn’t mean we allow uncleared members from the media to come and look at this,” Spicer said during the White House press briefing on Thursday.  The House Intelligence Committee's ranking member, Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSchiff views docs at WH, calls for them to be given to committee Top Intel Dem: 'A grave and momentous step' for Flynn to request immunity The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (D-Calif.), agreed to examine the materials at the White House earlier in the day. But Schiff also said this invitation "raises far more questions than any it answers."   House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) has been under fire for meeting with the president without conferring with his committee, and publicly announcing that Obama administration inadvertently collected surveillance on President Trump's transition associates during a broader intelligence probe, based on reports he had seen. Nunes said he privately reviewed the documents on White House grounds "to confirm what I already knew” before making his announcement. Nunes has also refused to identify his sources or the agency the information came from, claiming it would scare other potential sources from disclosing sensitive information.  It's not clear if the documents Spicer was referring to are the same that Nunes saw.  Some critics accuse Nunes of working for the White House and have called for him to recuse himself from the investigation, concerned that he is trying to give Trump cover for his allegations of wiretapping against former President Obama.  Tags Adam Schiff   View the discussion thread.

View Latest Posts >>> NEO – London Attack: Policeman Murdered by the Mainstream Media By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on March 30, 2017 by  Seth Ferris,  … with New Eastern Outlook,  Moscow “For those who can remember” [ Editor’s note: As he often does, Seth Ferris absorbs an event for a while before writing about it, avoiding the rush to claim the “who dun it” prize on day one, a national pastime for Internet Dick Tracys. Frankly, after the France and Germany truck terror assaults, I had expected a much larger wave of copycat attacks. But I love to be wrong on things like that. Seth goes into an area that most have not, on how the vast media coverage of such events is a bigger inspiration that whatever ISIS does on line, which miraculously all the Intel orgs seem powerless to stop; and this smells a bit suspicious me, the untrusting soul. I was also wrong about expecting suicide bombers in shopping malls after 9-11. The number of soft targets are uncountable, so I thought it was a given they would happen. But what we learned is that they were not really here; their absence gave birth to all the FBI sting operations to keep their terror budget funding going. It was only years later that the copycat killers began to emerge, with some questionable cases as to their real motivation. The British have me baffled. They seem to have no law to pick people up who have gone to the Middle East for Jihad, so they are left with “watching them”, a huge waste of limited counter terrorism manpower, when a long stretch for aiding and abetting would be cheaper and safer. To be fair, we would have to give the same treatment to those in the British Establishment who have aided State proxy terrorism, which the Brits are old hands at, which might be why there are no laws to pick people up. But they are taking action against some Brits who have gone to serve in the Israeli Army. Go figure that… Jim W. Dean ] Jim’s Editor’s Notes are solely crowdfunded via PayPal – JimWDean@aol.com This includes research, needed field trips, Heritage TV Legacy archiving, and more – Thanks for helping out _________ First published March 2017 As the world knows, on March 22nd a 52-year old man drove his car through a crowd of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing some and injuring many others, before crashing the car into the railings of the Houses of Parliament complex and stabbing a policeman to death. He was then shot dead himself before anyone could find out who he was and why he had done this. Armed police rush towards Parliament’s gates after the officer was stabbed The Metropolitan Police and the emergency services immediately responded to the incident by declaring it a terrorist attack. This is a laudable precaution, but as the police said at the time, “we are treating it as a terrorist attack until we know otherwise”. When a person goes to hospital with a particular medical condition it is common to test for other, more serious, conditions as a precaution against these sitting there undetected or developing later. At no time did the police state that this was a terrorist attack—simply that it could be, and would therefore be treated as such as a precaution. But what have we seen? Practically every media outlet immediately assumed it was a terrorist attack – in other words, that it had been planned and executed by an organised group regarded as”terrorist” by those governments who claim to be fighting terrorism. Politicians from the UK and all over the world rushed to condemn terrorism and declare their defiance of these fanatics. Though some voices pointed out that we didn’t yet know this was a terrorist attack, this didn’t matter. Politicians and media outlets had an agenda to pursue, so that was that. It turned out that the perpetrator was Khalid Masood, who had previously been known as Adrian Elms and Adrian Ajao. He was an English convert to Islam and wasn’t white, so this got alarm bells ringing. When ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack this assertion was given wide publicity, despite the fact it always claims responsibility for any terror attack it agrees with, and its statement made clear that it had not actually directed the attack or even known who the attacker was. The London attack is a classic example of that old mainstream journalism maxim – “to hell with the facts, get on with the story”. It is a story we have heard time and again from different governments. These are the same governments which claim that we live under a terrorist threat whilst arming those terrorists from the US and allied countries by issuing fake end user certificates for the shipments, recruiting and training their “militants” in the Pankisi Gorge and other places and sending them from one conflict to another on fake Georgian passports, funding them by taking over the oil and drug smuggling routes and ensuring only terrorists can use these and using those same terrorists as their own intelligence agents – which is why we know a lot about them after an atrocity is committed, but no one had been able to use this information to prevent the atrocity. So what actually happened in London? Who was really behind it? At the time of writing no one can say for certain. But where does RESPONSIBILITY for these events lie? Exactly where the media doesn’t want us to look – for a very obvious reason. _________ False Opposition State-sponsored terror against itself – A history of complicity in terror attacks? The UK is used to terrorism. Not only Northern Ireland but the UK mainland endured 30 years of it during The Troubles. This is why people can no longer pretend to be Prime Minister by having their photographs taken outside 10 Downing Street as they once did – the street is closed to the general public as a result of a serious IRA attack in the 1980s, protected by a gate and patrolled by guards. During those days UK politicians also routinely said that they would never give in to terrorism. We now know however that successive UK governments had a range of unofficial dealings with Republican terrorists, and that Unionist terrorists were actively assisted by policemen acting with the tacit approval of the UK government. This is why so many people lined up to pay tribute to former IRA terrorist Martin McGuinness after his recent death – their descriptions of him as a man of peace may have been genuine, but also driven by an understanding of what terrorists can still reveal about those who said them. It has long been asked why these contacts existed if the UK government really wanted to stamp out terrorism. This question has particular relevance to the citizens of Birmingham, where homes have been raided in connection with the London attack. In November 1974, 21 people were killed by two bombs planted in Birmingham city centre pubs. In the wake of these six Irishmen living in Birmingham were jailed for 16 years for bombings which the police and security services knew from the beginning they had not committed, as were eleven other innocent people in two contemporaneous cases. In all of these cases, credible suspects have been suggested by people who were apparently connected with these bombings, and some convicted persons have admitted their role in them. But no one has been prosecuted, and in the case of Birmingham the files have been sealed until everyone mentioned in them is dead, an action only taken when there is something deeply embarrassing to hide. It is therefore disingenuous, to say the least, for the British government to say that it is on one side and terrorists are on the other. But the spectre of terrorism is raised at every opportunity, to justify actions such as high defence spending in a rich country where hundreds of people live off food banks, colluding with human rights abusers such as Saudi Arabia to gain intelligence and invading Iraq and Syria after helping South American dictatorships inflict equal or greater terrorism on their populations. If the UK government wanted to prevent terrorist attacks it would, in many cases. Instead it colludes with terrorists and gives them constant publicity to encourage others to follow their example. The family of PC Keith Palmer, the policeman murdered by Khalid Masood, has reason to ask whether this is even intended to be the right approach. _________ One of Us People are endlessly fascinated by criminals. The UK government even goes so far as to collude with terrorists and gives them constant publicity to encourage others to follow their example At the time of writing, the police are still saying that, as far they can see, Masood acted alone. Several people have been arrested in connection with the case, but as yet no one has been charged with assisting Masood, let alone being a member of a terrorist organisation. It appears that Masood had a history of criminal convictions for offences involving violence, and particularly knives. His murderous attack on PC Palmer is consistent with his known history. It is however rather amateurish for a terrorist conducting a planned operation. Are we supposed to believe that anyone planning a raid on the British parliament would draw attention to themselves by randomly murdering people in his car, then try and burst through parliamentary security single-handed, armed with no more than a couple of knives? No other person was arrested elsewhere in the vicinity of parliament, despite the security operation which moved swiftly into place. It is doubtful whether any of the government ministers responsible for counter-terrorism measures, let alone the police, actually believe such a story. The fact that Masood was a convert to Islam raises eyebrows. There are many reasons why people adopt a new religion, or abandon the one they have. But as with political affiliation these are as much to do with that person’s psychological makeup as ideology. Sammy Davis Jr. famously converted to Judaism despite being African American, with no apparent ties to that faith. According to Jerry Lewis, Davis felt the Jews were an oppressed people in the same way African Americans were, but had developed a whole theology around this in the way his own people hadn’t. This was the basis of a genuine commitment to Judaism which Davis retained for the rest of his life. The British press has long gone out of its way to associate the terms “Islam” and “terrorist”. Masood may not have been part of a terrorist group, but he did have a history of violence, despite neighbours describing him as personally inoffensive. If he was attracted to this faith by the violent extremism ascribed to it, which we can infer from the fact he had previously been investigated for links to such extremism, this would explain why he seems little known amongst practising Muslims the police have spoke to in connection with the attack. British politicians say they do not agree with equating Islam with terrorism, using London’s Mayor, the Muslim Sadiq Khan, as a poster boy of such campaigns. However they are not lining up to condemn those US politicians who are justifying crime by saying it is “the will of God“. Again, the families of Khalid Masood’s victims might wonder why this is so, if you don’t really want people to think that Islam and crime are the same thing, and be prepared to act accordingly. _________ He Got it From Someone Else The politicians and mainstream media have an answer to this however. Knowing that it may be discovered that Masood was acting alone they have a ready quote to hand. As the police did not know whether he was a terrorist or not, they justified their response to the attack by saying that Masood was “inspired by terrorism”. Having seen what these awful people do, he had decided to try and do something similar on his own, rather than actually join a terrorist group. This assertion will make all the claims about this being a terrorist attack accurate. Even if he wasn’t a terrorist he must have wanted to emulate what he had heard, seen, read or been told about. So terrorists must be responsible at the end of the day, and the war on terror, and the profits it makes for some, can continue as before. If Masood was inspired to emulate terrorists by a particular person, that person will be arrested and charged in relation to the London attack. We are told that the security services have extensive files on radical Muslims who might want to commit terrorist offences, and that Masood had not been under suspicion of such links for several years. People are therefore asking how Masood managed to carry out this attack without the security services knowing, whilst ignoring the obvious answer. If Masood was “inspired by terrorism”, but had no known links with any radical terrorists, his inspiration must have come from the media. We have all seen how the likes of Tatarkhan Batiashvili, who was invalided out of the Georgian Army, are promoted around the world as fearsome jihadists whose rise and crimes are unstoppable. The US and UK have TV talent shows called things like Pop Idol and American Idol. They might as well have another one called Terror Idol, given the glamourisation of “popular” terrorists in the Western media. Mainstream media outlets will doubtless say that anything they report about terrorists is nothing to do with the government because they are independent. The Western world prides itself on its free press. However the London attack came less than a week after George Osborne, David Cameron’s Chancellor of the Exchequer who lost his job when Theresa May took over, had been appointed the new editor of the Evening Standard, the main London newspaper. Osborne has the right to pursue a new career at any time. But he has stated that he will be doing no such thing – he intends to remain an MP, representing his constituents when his duties at the newspaper allow. Apparently the Evening Standard, this bastion of the independent, free press, does not feel its independence is compromised by having a serving MP, from the governing party, as its editor. On the contrary, it feels it brings it closer to the news, or rather the stuff it wishes to print. _________ No excuse Western governments have armed, trained and created terrorists for many years. They have geo-strategic reasons for continuing to do this, regardless of a human cost which would have them all in jail if they were called Nazis, Serbs or Khmer Rouge. As part of this programme, terrorists are promoted as invincible warriors which only vast resources will defeat. Russia demonstrated the nonsense of this when it bombed the ISIS positions in Syria and cleared out the militants in one raid. But as long as Western governments continue with this policy there will be terrorist atrocities in their own countries, to remind the population that they might be victims themselves at any time, and so cannot question the use of their taxes on allegedly fighting these people. George Osborne with despatch box The mainstream media has done all it can to facilitate this process with its scare stories. A free press should safeguard the public from government schemes of this kind. But here it is insisting that a man with a history of violent crimes who did the same again must be a terrorist, and if not be “inspired by terrorism” to justify this allegation. Police Constable Keith Palmer was murdered by Khalid Masood. But if Masood was really inspired by terrorism it is the mainstream media, and its refusal to do its job, which is ultimately responsible for his death. It has glorified the Western-created terrorists and said that Masood acted on these stories. By its own admission, the London attack would not have happened without it. A public fund to compensate PC Palmer’s family raised £500,000 within 24 hours of opening. We should all look forward to the day when editors such as George Osborne return all that money to its donors, and replace it with their own.

We can't talk about how Ryzen 5 CPUs perform yet, but we can show you what we'll be using to test them. It's a box. There's a pair of CPUs in it. The Ryzen 5 1500X has a Wraith Spire cooler in the box with it, hence the much larger package. Here's the Wraith Spire in its non-RGB LED form, next to a Haswell or similar-era Intel stock cooler. AMD also sent along the Wraith Max RGB LED-illuminated cooler. You can't buy this cooler or get it with a CPU in stores, but prebuilt Ryzen systems with fancier CPUs inside will probably come with this heatsink installed. This is Gigabyte's handsome AB350-Gaming 3 motherboard, our B350 pick for AM4 CPUs from our most recent System Guide. AMD also sent along a kit of this outrageously-tall GeIL EVO X DDR4-3200 RGB LED-illuminated RAM. Critically, these are DDR4-3200 single-rank DIMMs rated for 16-16-16-36 timings. Ryzen CPUs can't reach those high memory speeds with dual-rank DIMMs right now. Seriously, look at how big these things are. I'll probably be seeing a lot of them as I test this Ryzen 5 duo.

Advertisement Become a patron of breaking LGBTQ news Chip in $4 go Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, increasingly under attack after running to protect President Donald Trump rather than perform his required role of investigating and providing oversight, is now refusing growing calls to resign or recuse himself from investigations related to Russia and the Trump campaign, transition, and administration. The Democrats on Nunes' Intelligence Committee have called for him to recuse himself after his mysterious behavior and refusing to share information with anyone – even Republicans – on the Intel Committee. They also cite Nunes' statement that he has a duty to protect President Trump, a stunning statement. Nunes is close to Trump and was on the trump transition team – which should automatically disqualify him from leading any investigation into anything Trump. Asked if he will recuse himself, the Associated Press has just reported Rep. Nunes responded by asking, "Why would I?" "I don't think he can just recuse himself and still chair the committee," Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier, who also sits on the Intel Committee, told CNN Tuesday morning. "I think that the writing is on the wall. It might make a good spy novel. It doesn't make a good investigation."

Bennett @John T. Bennett Trump Again Veers Into House, Senate Intel Investigators’ Lane Meadows, Jordan Hammered on Twitter by Trump Over Health Care Bill Trump Ready to Fight House Freedom Caucus Save for later The White House was on the defensive from multiple controversies at the end of its 10th month under the presidency of Donald Trump.(Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call File Photo) John T. Bennett @John T. Bennett Posted Mar 31, 2017 4:45 PM Save for later The Trump White House on Friday ended the week in a manner that has become routine: embroiled in controversies that staffers struggle to explain and that threaten the president’s legislative agenda. The beginning of the week mirrored the pattern of most of the nine of Donald Trump’s presidency that came before it — recovering from a setback, this time in the form of the collapse of the GOP-crafted health bill’s failure.  Trump held meetings with Cabinet officials, manufacturing executives, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the prime minister of Denmark, led a “women’s empowerment panel” in the ornate East Room, received daily intelligence briefings, and signed a long-awaited executive targeting the Obama administration’s rules to combat climate change, the Clean Power Plan. All indications suggested the president and his senior team were aiming for a quiet week after the health bill in the face of House Republican opposition. Then, Thursday happened. And it bled into Friday. The president began and ended his working day Thursday attacking House Republicans on Twitter, using evening tweets to call out House Freedom Caucus leaders by name. He blamed them for wrecking the health bill and, jarringly, also a tax overhaul package that has yet to be crafted. Trump was back at it on Twitter the Friday morning, seeking to influence two congressional investigations into possible ties between Russia and his campaign associates. [Trump Again Veers Into House, Senate Intel Investigators’ Lane] The White House was deluged with questions about Russia and the White House’s handling of outstanding questions about alleged ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign. Presidential aides struggled to deal with House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., acknowledging he received from Trump administration officials intelligence reports he said shows Trump associates were “unmasked” in some Obama-era reports — documents he briefed Trump about the next day. There were the reports that Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, once worked secretly to advance Russian President Vladimir Putin’s interests. There were plenty of efforts by the White House to gain some policy traction. There was the energy executive order, a meeting to kick start the tax overhaul push, another order on trade —- a top Trump issue — and an effort to explore a second try at a bill to repeal and replace Barack Obama’s 2010 health law. And the White House explained how it went about ensuring staffers divested financial holdings that could have created conflicts of interests — and release disclosure forms a few days earlier than the Obama White House did in 2009. All should have been welcome news for Republicans, especially Trump’s base. Yet, any momentum from those moves was canceled out by another week’s slide from routine to controversial. One former adviser to several top national Republican officials said Friday that no president and White House senior staff can find operate effectively under the Trump pattern. “The problem with distraction is that — by definition — they’re distracting, and every White House only has so much bandwidth,” said Michael Steel, a former senior aide to former Speaker John A. Boehner and 2016 GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush. “Time and effort put into dealing with these distractions is time and effort that can’t go into health care or tax reform or infrastructure or any other priorities,” Steel said. [(VIDEO) White House Watch: White House Looks for Traction After Health Bill Failure] Trump’s approval rating climbed into the low 40s (41 percent) by the middle of last week. (His high is 49 percent earlier this month.) But as he failed to lock in a deal on the health bill with members of his own party, Gallup’s daily tracking poll found his approval rating again falling into the 30s as the number of Americans who disapprove of his performance again approaches 60 percent. As the Russia controversies and brewing civil war with his own party intensified, Gallup put his approval at a new low, 35 percent, and his disapproval level at a new high, 59 percent, by midweek. They had improved slightly, to 38 percent and 56 percent, respectively, by week’s end. To be sure, those numbers are being dragged down by the looming Russia questions. “The issue of whether or not Trump or his associates, his campaign, had colluded with Russia in the elections is an issue of incredible consequences,” independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate said Thursday. “Why it is that President Trump has only positive things to say about this authoritarian figure?” Sanders said on CNN, referring to Putin. “What hold does Russia or might Russia have over the president? It appears, at least from media, that Russian oligarchs lent Trump and his associates money. Does that have anything to do with Trump’s relationship with Russia?” Sanders asked. He continued: “These are issues that must be thoroughly investigated. The American people want to know that our president is representing the best interests of the American people — not Russian oligarchs or the Russian government.” Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSchiff views docs at WH, calls for them to be given to committee Top Intel Dem: 'A grave and momentous step' for Flynn to request immunity The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (D-Calif.) said he viewed materials at the White House with his staff director that were presented as "precisely the same materials" given to Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) last week. "While I cannot discuss the content of the documents, if the White House had any concern over these materials, they should have been shared with the full committees in the first place as a part of our ordinary oversight responsibilities," Schiff said in a statement. "Nothing I could see today warranted a departure from the normal review procedures, and these materials should now be provided to the full membership of both committees," he said. The White House invited the leaders of the House and Senate intelligence panels to view the material after Nunes' trek to White House grounds last week caused a stir.  The GOP chairman visited White House grounds a day before he returned to brief President Trump, saying he learned the U.S. intelligence community incidentally collected information on members of Trump's transition team. Democrats slammed his decision to brief Trump on the information before committee members, and a number of top Democrats called for him to recuse himself, which he rebuffed. The New York Times reported Thursday that two White House officials helped Nunes acquire the information that he later used to brief Trump. "The White House has yet to explain why senior White House staff apparently shared these materials with but one member of either committee, only for their contents to be briefed back to the White House," Schiff said Friday.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search WinX DVD Ripper Platinum V8.5.0 Free License Giveaway [Sponsored] By Sponsored on March 31st, 2017 The DVD industry is declining, which can be seen from the dramatic decrease of Netflix DVD subscribers. However, most people are really concerned about their possession of movies and music they purchase. For them, only if they get a physical disc filled with wanted media, they own it verily. In the meantime, they also desire for a digital copy for flexible playback or other good reasons. Instead of re-buying their digital counterparts, some people would rather rip copies off DVDs directly. Such seemingly weakening yet solid demand for DVD ripping has inspired Digiarty to refine its WinX DVD Ripper Platinum constantly for the past years. This program is the strongest DVD ripper featuring the unparalleled ability to convert home and strictly encrypted DVDs to all popular formats at fast speed. Visit this page to get a FULL license for free (time-limited) >> Meanwhile, Digiarty offers a huge discount on its all-in-one media software pack that facilitate DVD ripping, DVD to DVD backup, media download, video convert and playback. Learn more about the all-in-one media software Pack >> What is WinX DVD Ripper Platinum? WinX DVD Ripper Platinum is a Windows-based software capable of converting content from DVD to digital formats. Since its debut in 2009, WinX has been often intimated by others, in the design of user interface, features, and even marketing. Despite that, Digiarty always stays ahead, keeping WinX DVD Ripper Platinum in the top position in its field all the time. And, it is further lifted after upgrading to version 8.5.0. In this new edition, hardware acceleration is added to utilize Intel QSV and NVIDIA (CUDA) NVENC, thus boosting DVD conversion process up to 32x real time faster. It is also rebuilt with new DVD title analysis mechanism, making it the strongest for ripping 99-title DVDs, workout DVDs and even damaged DVDs. About the Giveaway: Several days ago, Digiarty held a giveaway of WinX DVD Ripper Platinum V8.5.0 on Giveaway of the Day (aka. GOTD), a popular free licensed software distribution site. However, a large number of people failed to score a free license, possibly because GOTD installer is incompatible with certain anti-virus software. Luckily, here comes a new chance to get free license! Digiarty rolls out an official giveaway of WinX DVD Ripper Platinum V8.5.0 – the newest version, as a remedy. Time is limited. Step right up now and scoop up a professional DVD ripper for Windows 10, 8, 7 and lower, without a penny. A look at WinX DVD Ripper Platinum V8.5.0 In March, this top-notch DVD converter goes through two breakthrough updates: The first refinement announces the full support for new DVDs, 99-title DVDs, workout DVDs, and Japan DVDs. These DVDs are badly intractable for almost all DVD rippers in the market. But Digiarty takes the lead in killing them. It rebuilds DVD title checking mechanism, aiming to detect the correct main DVD title in those DVDs for further smooth DVD ripping. Digiarty made it. Besides, it adds the support for new DVD disc file (ISO) systems, covering ISO 9600 file system (Compact Disc File System), non-UDF (Universal Disk Format) system and so on. Thereafter, some Japanese DVDs can be ripped flawlessly. You can read more tips on ripping 99-title DVDs. And the second goes to the addition of hardware acceleration which is already mentioned above. Specifically speaking, this technology employs Intel QSV and NVIDIA (CUDA) NVENC on users’ computers to accelerate DVD conversion speed. Testings show that the speed of DVD to MP4 (H.264) now can reach up to 500 FPS, with this technology applied. That is to say, a feature-length DVD movie can be converted to MP4 within 5 minutes only, 2x faster than previous techniques. So far, WinX DVD Ripper Platinum has been armed with GPU/CPU hardware acceleration, Multi-core CPU (up to 8 cores) utilization, Super Encode Engine based on MMX- SSE & 3DNow! and Hyper-threading technology. All these techniques are used to guarantee fast DVD ripping speed. This article introduces the mystery of MP4 and related guides on ripping DVD to MP4. Now get a free license code of WinX DVD Ripper Platinum V8.5.0, if you want to back up your DVDs to digital formats (MP4, AVI, WMV, MOV, etc.) or devices (Apple iPhone, iPad, Android Samsung, Huawei, Kindle Fire, Windows Phone, Sony, etc). Visit this page to get a FULL license for free (time-limited) >> The last thing, it isn’t legal to rip copy-protected DVDs in some countries. So, you’re suggested to refer to DVD copyright laws in your country in advance and don’t distribute DVD copies for commercial use. JOIN THE DISCUSSION Tweet   DID YOU KNOW?

Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSchiff views docs at WH, calls for them to be given to committee Top Intel Dem: 'A grave and momentous step' for Flynn to request immunity The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (Calif.) acknowledged the Thursday offer from Flynn's lawyer in a statement, but said, "We should first acknowledge what a grave and momentous step it is for a former National Security Advisor to the President of the United States to ask for immunity from prosecution." "We will be discussing the matter with our counterparts on the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Department of Justice," Schiff said, adding that while Flynn's testimony was "of great interest" to his panel, it would consult the Department of Justice. ADVERTISEMENT The offer from Flynn's lawyer that he would be willing to testify before the House and Senate Intelligence panels to avoid "unfair prosecution" drew attention Thursday given his past comments on those seeking immunity.  Flynn commented last September around the time of reports that aides of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonGrassley asks State for details on Clinton's security clearance Top Intel Dem: 'A grave and momentous step' for Flynn to request immunity Medicaid saved ObamaCare from repeal, not the Freedom Caucus MORE had been granted immunity to talk freely to the FBI amid its probe into her use of a private email server while secretary of State. “When you are given immunity, that means you probably committed a crime,” Flynn, who at the time was a top aide on Trump's campaign team, said on “Meet the Press.” Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, argued Thursday that "no reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch-hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution." The House and Senate panels investigating ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia during last year's presidential election have thus far not accepted Flynn's offer.

The company, which helps other businesses install and use complex data analysis software, indicated Friday that it plans to raise $200 million, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That figure, used to calculate filing fees, may change as the company approaches its offering date. Cloudera lost just over $187 million on $261 million in revenue for the year ending Jan. 31. That’s an improvement over the previous year, when the company posted a $204 million loss on $166 million in revenue. TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Business news first: Sign in for newsletters Intel holds a 22 percent stake in Cloudera, largely the product of a $740 million investment the Santa Clara chipmaker made in 2014 as part of a funding round that netted Cloudera $900 million and valued it at $4.1 billion. In addition to established database providers like Oracle and IBM, Cloudera’s competitors include Hortonworks, a Santa Clara company that went public in 2014. Abhey Lamba, a senior technology analyst with Mizuho Securities in San Francisco, said that Cloudera is regarded as the largest independent distributor of Hadoop, the data storage and analysis software that Cloudera and Hortonworks help companies use. Lamba said the $261 million that Cloudera booked in revenue last year puts the company “a year ahead” of Hortonworks, which he said is expected to bring in $240 million this year. Investors and market analysts expect the volume of IPOs this year to grow after a sluggish 2016, particularly for technology companies. Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, went public in March, as did San Francisco’s MuleSoft, which makes software for businesses. Okta, a security software company in San Francisco, is also on deck to go public. On Monday, the company announced plans to price 11 million shares between $13 and $15 per share. That would make for a $160 million offering if the shares price at the midpoint of that range. Dominic Fracassa is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The Wall Street Journal as well as other media reported on Friday that Flynn had offered to be questioned by US federal investigators and Congress in exchange for immunity from prosecution. However, USA Today published the actual letter by Flynn’s attorney Robert Kelner, which reads different from the media reports. "He [Trump] believes that Mike Flynn should go testify," Spicer stated on Friday. "He thinks that he [Flynn] should go up there and do what he has to do to get the story out." The White House is not concerned that Flynn has any negative information about Trump, his administration, his campaign in the investigations into Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 US election, Spicer said. When asked by a reporter if, "the White House is concerned that Flynn has damaging information about the president, his aides, his associates, about what occurred during the campaign with respect to Russia," Spicer responded, "Nope." © AP Photo/ Drew Angerer / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA How Ex-Advisor Flynn Can Strike Back at Trump AdministrationOn February 13, Flynn announced his resignation after media reported he misled the Trump administration about the extent of his talks with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergei Kislyak. However, Flynn conceded no wrongdoing in his resignation letter. Both houses of the US Congress are investigating possible links between Trump's team and Russian officials amid allegations Moscow sought to influence the 2016 election. Russian officials have repeatedly denied the claims. On March 15, US House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said the committee had no evidence of communications between Trump’s campaign staff and Russian officials. ...

But China, with its nearly $350 billion trade surplus with the United States in 2016, will be at the top of the list for review.” “[A] draft proposal circulating in Congress shows strong attention to “Buy American” and tariff provisions. The administration would allow a Nafta nation to reinstate tariffs in case of a flood of imports that cause “serious injury or threat of serious injury” to domestic industries. And rules of origin—the share of a product that must be produced in Nafta countries—would be set to support “production and jobs in the United States.” A seeming compromise between trade hawks and moderates, the document could change, and it doesn’t take into account proposals Canada and Mexico might seek. So far, however, the approach may amount to an update rather than a full rewrite” [Wall Street Journal]. “TRUMP NAFTA RENEGOTIATION DRAFT NOTICE EXPOSES AN ALL-TALK NO-ACTION PLAN” [Sierra Club]. “Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune released the following statement: ‘For all his grandstanding and bluster, Trump failed to put forth a plan to renegotiate NAFTA in the American people’s interest. As a candidate and now in office, Trump promised a serious renegotiation that would put American workers first and end corporate giveaways, but this plan fails to keep that promise and instead looks an awful lot like the TPP deal defeated by a movement of millions and decried by Trump himself. The American people deserve a real renegotiated NAFTA that will protect our workers, our communities, and our environment, not the same broken deal with Trump’s logo printed on it.'” It’s all going pear-shaped… Politics New Cold War “What Devin Nunes Knows” [Kimberly Strassel, Wall Street Journal]. Why Nunes left his cab: Around the same time, Mr. Nunes’s own intelligence sources informed him that documents showed further collection of information about, and unmasking of, Trump transition officials. These documents aren’t easily obtainable, since they aren’t the “finished” intelligence products that Congress gets to see. Nonetheless, for weeks Mr. Nunes has been demanding intelligence agencies turn over said documents—with no luck, so far. Mr. Nunes earlier this week got his own source to show him a treasure trove of documents at a secure facility. Here are the relevant details: First, there were dozens of documents with information about Trump officials. Second, the information these documents contained was not related to Russia. Third, while many reports did “mask” identities (referring, for instance, to “U.S. Person 1 or 2”) they were written in ways that made clear which Trump officials were being discussed. Fourth, in at least one instance, a Trump official other than Mr. Flynn was outright unmasked. Finally, these documents were circulated at the highest levels of government. To sum up, Team Obama was spying broadly on the incoming administration. Mr. Schiff’s howls about Mr. Nunes’s methods are bluster; the Republican was doing his job, and well. It would be interesting to know if this was still going on. And from the other side of the aisle: RETWEET if you want a complete #Russiagate primer in just THREE Twitter threads (attached). pic.twitter.com/siRfLpFEFq &mdash; Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 28, 2017 Readers, those of you who can endure tweet storms and clicked through, what do you think of these three? “The Senate Intelligence Committee turned down the request by former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s lawyer for a grant of immunity in exchange for his testimony, two congressional sources told NBC News” [NBC]. “Russians used ‘Bernie Bros’ as ‘unwitting agents’ in disinformation campaign: Senate Intel witness” [Raw Story]. You knew this was coming, right? The story is just as sloppy and misleading as the headline. For example: “Over time the anti-Clinton online faction became known by the nickname ‘Bernie Bros.'” Note lack of agency in “became known”; #BernieBro was in fact propagated by Clinton supporters. And then there’s this: “‘Senator, I think what they were trying to do was drive a wedge within the Democratic Party between the Clinton group and the Sanders group,” said [Retired Gen. Keith Alexander — former director of the National Security Agency]. “And then in our nation between Republicans and Democrats.'” Where to begin? Can Alexander really mean that Sanders and Clinton supporters wouldn’t be in conflict if it weren’t for the evil Russkis? Or Republicans and Democrats? I hope when Alexander analyzes Lower Slobovia he does a better job. Trump Transition “In four weeks Republicans must pass a funding bill to keep the government operating, either with the votes of the GOP conservatives Trump is targeting or with Democrats. Trump and his team have talked a lot — since members of the Freedom Caucus brought the Obamacare replacement bill down last week — about the need to reach across the aisle. But the time to woo Democrats has likely come and gone” [RealClearPolitics]. “The problem for Schumer and his caucus is this: Republicans are not bluffing when they say Gorsuch will be on the court one way or another. The squishes, the institutionalists, even the erstwhile “Gang” members are unwavering in their support. Gorsuch is well-qualified for the job, acquitted himself admirably by any measure, and if an unprecedented partisan filibuster is the only thing standing between him and the bench, the Reid Rule will be invoked for the second time” [Politico]. “The cloture rule now faces an existential paradox. Call it Schrödinger’s Filibuster. Assuming Schumer can hold the line within his caucus—and he has seven votes to give—the 60 vote threshold for Supreme Court nominations is dead. Do the right thing and it lives to see another day.” “President Trump brought his chaos-and-loyalty theory of management into the White House, relying on competing factions, balanced by trusted family members, with himself perched atop as the gut-instinct decider. He now realizes this approach has flopped, and feels baffled and paralyzed by how to fix it, numerous friends and advisers tell us” [Mike Allen, Axios]. “‘Trump is thinking through his frustrations,’ said one Washington wise man close to the West Wing. ‘The team didn’t put the windows in right.'” I didn’t know there were “wise men” in DC any more. As Nooners (and I) keep asking, “Where is Trump’s James Baker?” Because Jeff Bannon sure is heck isn’t James Baker. “Nobody knows where this nas­cent Don­ald Trump pres­id­ency is go­ing. New ad­min­is­tra­tions start off with an in­fin­ite num­ber of po­ten­tial tra­ject­or­ies, but this one is even more un­pre­dict­able than oth­ers. Trump could still turn out to be a suc­cess­ful pres­id­ent. As an Amer­ic­an, I cer­tainly hope he will. But today at least, it looks more like a ‘death by a thou­sand cuts'” [Charles Cook]. The NAFTA news makes me incline toward Cook’s view; something like Trump = Carter + Executive Orders + Bush/Obama’s national security powers. On the other hand, Trump rode “chaos and loyalty” all the way to the White House in his campaign, and all the same people yammering then are still yammering now. Realignment and Legitimacy “Bernie Sanders visits Boston for three sold-out events Friday” [Boston Globe]. “‘The guy, who is not even a Democrat, is being treated like a rock star in deep-blue Kennedy Massachusetts, and it’s because he is a rock star,’ said Erin O’Brien, chairwoman of the political science department at the University of Massachusetts Boston. ‘It speaks to the vacuum that Hillary Clinton left. She never had the same kind of passionate support that Bernie Sanders had.'” “This guy”? “Rock star”? Really? More from O’Brien: Hillary Clinton: Doing the fucking homework since 1947. pic.twitter.com/b7P2p828Qc &mdash; Erin O&#39;Brien (@Prof_EOB) September 27, 2016 “Can a Sanders-Style Democrat Win Montana’s House Seat?” [RealClearPolitics]. “[B]anjo-playing country/folk musician Rob Quist is the Democratic candidate in the race to fill Montana’s vacant At-Large congressional seat. Republican Ryan Zinke left the seat earlier this year to serve as secretary of the interior in the Trump administration. Quist, a self-proclaimed Sanders-style Democrat, is scheduled to face off against Republican businessman Greg Gianforte on May 25”. Lambert here: I don’t understand. This Quist guy isn’t a centrist carpetbagger and London-based documentary film-maker who’s never run for office but has raised millions and appeals to suburban Republicans, especially suburban Republican women. I mean, is Quist even a Democrat? (And do read the whole RCP article on Montana, because it contrasts how Democrat Jon Tester won to how Clinton lost at the county level.) “GA-06 Special Election Moves to Lean Republican” [Charles Cook]. “It’s hard to remember the last time a House race became as much of a national fixation as the race in GA-06 to replace HHS Secretary Tom Price. With less than three weeks left until the initial April 18 primary, minor celebrities and Democratic staff continue to pour into suburban Atlanta, and left-leaning donors – with few other ways to channel their anger towards the Trump administration – continue to pour millions into the coffers of Democrat Jon Ossoff.” (Ossoff is, of course, the Perez- and DCCC-fave contrasted above to Quist.) “It’s possible Ossoff could hit 50 percent on April 18, but the mostly likely scenario is still for this race to head to a runoff on June 20. You can bet the contest’s national prominence will only snowball in the next few weeks, and that may not be the worst thing for Republicans, who badly need their base to wake up. This race moves to the Lean Republican column, and that’s probably being generous to Republicans.” Because celebrities worked so well for Clinton in 2016. Georgia readers, what’s going on? Stats Watch Personal Income and Outlays, February 2017: “A second month of weak spending on services pulled down on consumer spending which could only manage a 0.1 percent rise in February, one that follows a nearly as weak 0.2 percent gain in January. February’s result is below consensus and at the low end of the Econoday forecast range” [Econoday]. “Income data are more favorable headlined by an as-expected 0.4 percent gain and a very solid 0.5 percent increase in the wages & salaries component. And consumers moved money into the bank as the savings rate climbed 2 tenths for a second straight month to 5.6 percent. Increases in savings are a factor behind the weakness in spending.” And: “Remember these are average numbers – not median. The rate of growth of consumption is slowing which does not bode well for 1Q2017 GDP. On the bright side, this is a corrrection as consumption has outpaced income growth recently which historically the two have remained in balance” [Econintersect]. And but: “Using the two-month method to estimate Q1 PCE [Personal Consumption Expenditure] growth, PCE was increasing at a 0.4% annual rate in Q1 2017. (using the mid-month method, PCE was increasing 1.0%). This suggests weak PCE growth in Q1” [Calculated Risk]. And but: “There was further evidence of a partisan divide in the data which has not shown any significant sign of easing since November’s Presidential election” [Economic Calendar]. “There has also been evidence that consumers have lowered their underlying expectations with relatively subdued growth rates in the economy viewed more positively than would have been the case in previous years.” Consumer Sentiment, March 2017: Below consensus but still a gain [Econoday]. “A puzzle in the report is a noticeable decline in inflation expectations, down 2 tenths for the 1-year outlook to 2.5 percent and down 1 tenth to 2.4 percent for the 5-year outlook. The declines aren’t due to gasoline prices which have been edging higher, not lower, and raise questions over the consumer’s outlook for wages and general economic strength.” Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, March 2017: “[B]eats the consensus” [Econoday]. “This report falls in line with the breadth of anecdotal data that are signaling a pivot higher for the economy, one however that has yet to appear.” And but: “The results of this survey continue to agree with district Federal Reserve manufacturing surveys – and aligns with the overall trend of the ISM manufacturing survey” [Econintersect]. Rail: “We review this data set to understand the economy. If coal and grain are removed from the analysis, rail over the last 6 months been declining around 5% – but this week improved +7.8 % (meaning that the predicitive economic elements improved year-over-year)” [Econintersect]. So, on the one hand we have the anecdotal/survey data saying “Everything’s gonna be peachy!” On the other hand, we have the real data saying “Not so fast, I don’t see a thing!” On the third hand, we have “stuff is moving,” as here. Is anyone actively pursuing a state of non-baffflement on this? Can this “stuff” all be a “lump in the python” brought about by shippers’ fears of Trump tariffs? And if that’s the theory, how does that account for the Chemical Activity Barometer? Commodities: “China’s internal shifts on energy production have already sent coal markets into sharp swings, and experts say the country’s outsize role in commodities from aluminum to zinc leaves other markets open to sharp swings. That’s created a market for what’s essentially detective work, as consultants use satellite imagery and measure truck movements to check official figures. The results may have a crucial impact on commodity shipping operations that are finally flexing some financial muscle. The Baltic Dry Index measure of dry bulk shipping rates reached a 28-month high this week, suggesting demand is on the upturn and could stay there unless commodity markets become oversupplied” [Wall Street Journal]. Shipping: “Container manufacturer Singamas suffered its biggest loss ever in 2016, but chairman Teo Siong Seng believes the worst is over.Hit by a $59.4m net loss, Mr Teo told a press conference on Thursday that since late last year demand had gone up and so had box prices” [Lloyd’s List]. Shipping: “Who’s fooling who as alliance reshuffle falls tomorrow?” [Splash 247]. “Did the world’s liner planners not clock the irony of tomorrow’s date when choosing a time to launch the new dawn for container shipping? April Fool’s Day does seem appropriate however for the start of THE Alliance, the Ocean Alliance and 2M redux. It’s just hard to see who are the fools – the lines for their slovenly planning for tomorrow’s big day, their clients for putting up with them or the regulators for letting the lines get away with this monopolistic move. Shippers seeking to move goods from Europe to Asia have been struggling this month thanks to a large drop of available slots for containers on almost every shipping line. The confusion and growing anger was always likely when one looks at how last-minute so much of the planning has been for tomorrow’s big day. Ports were kept in the dark about the alliances’ final network details until a couple of weeks ago giving scant time to prepare their landside operations. Then there’s the whole competition question to ponder as we count down to tomorrow. The [European Shippers Council] has also drawn the attention of the regulation authorities to the upcoming market structure where from Saturday three major alliances control close to 90% of the capacity on the major trades. The council’s concerns follow hot on the heels of the FBI raiding a meeting of the Box Club, the annual get together of the world’s top liners.” Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 48 Neutral (previous close: 43, Fear) [CNN]. One week ago: 30 (Fear). (0 is Extreme Fear; 100 is Extreme Greed). Last updated Mar 31 at 12:00pm. Dodging a bullet? Our Famously Free Press “Is it any coincidence that the race to the bottom in media—toward clickbait headlines, toward the vulgar and prurient and dumb, toward provocative but often exaggerated takes—has accelerated in lock-step with the development of new technologies for measuring engagement?” [The Atlantic]. ” Two journalists who say they have been targeted by the United States have filed a complaint against the American government, accusing it of putting them on a “kill list” and demanding to be taken off it” [Al Jazeera]. “The complaint was filed in the US District Court of the District of Columbia on Thursday on behalf of Ahmad Muaffaq Zaidan – a dual Pakistani-Syrian citizen who works for Al Jazeera and Bilal Abdul Kareem, an American who has freelanced for Al Jazeera.” Sure hope Trump doesn’t follow Obama’s precedent of whacking Americans with drones. That would be bad. Gaia “Major Fracked-Gas Pipeline Leak Shuts Down Rhode Island Interstate” [Ecowatch]. “Two lawsuits were filed in Montana on Thursday aiming to stop construction of the TransCanada Corp.’s (NYSE: TRP) Keystone XL pipeline. Both suits argue that the U.S. State Department erred when President Trump signed the executive order to permit construction because the environmental impact statement used as the basis for the permit was outdated and incomplete” [247 Wall Street]. “Among the groups filing one of the suits in federal district court were the Northern Plains Resource Council, Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club. The Indigenous Environmental Network and the North Coast Rivers Alliance filed the other.” Guillotine Watch “One of the main concepts behind ‘Hamilton’ is the idea that people with vastly different backgrounds and feelings can come together and create something that matters, such as the United States of America” [Iowa State Daily]. Gag me with a spoon. That’s not what Hamilton is about at all. Class Warfare “‘One of the mantras I heard the steelworkers repeat over and over again was ‘We invested so many years in this factory, and they don’t see us. We’re invisible,’ [playwright Lynn] Nottage said” [The New Yorker]. “‘I think it profoundly hurt their feelings.'” I think that’s the most New Yorker sentence ever. “Killer Debt: The Impact of Debt on Mortality” [Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta]. “Worsening creditworthiness and increases in severely delinquent debt are found to lead to increases in individual mortality risk. This result has implications for the benefit of policies such as the social safety net, which aims to protect individual finances, by adding reduced mortality to the benefit of any intervention.” They call it “class warfare” for a reason… “Wages for college graduates across many majors have fallen since the 2007-09 recession, according to an unpublished analysis by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in Washington using Census bureau figures.

Donate $25$50$75$100 00400 This entry was posted in Water Cooler on March 31, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Reply ↓ djrichard March 31, 2017 at 4:42 pm “We really do need a debt jubilee.” This is and will always be a non-starter. Just imagine what it was like in the 1800s when there was no central bank: bank runs and bankruptcies went with the territory. The sword of damocles hanging over your head kind of loses its power when you see that bankruptcy is just a way of doing business. Worse than that, it loses even more power when you realize the asset side of “doing business” was just games played with funny banker money. Reply ↓ djrichard March 31, 2017 at 5:47 pm “The United States have developed a new weapon that destroys people but it leaves buildings standing. It’s called the stock market.” – Jay Leno. Just saw that quoted on ZH, but relevant here too. And fundamentally it’s not the stock market per se, it’s the funny banker money behind it. Without the central bank there was no way to back-stop the bank runs. The facade would all come down. And from the ashes, we would couldn’t help ourselves but repeat the cycle again. Moderation when it comes to banker funny money just doesn’t seem possible. Except when the central bank back stops it all. In such moderation we trust. In which case, all your debts are belong to us. All else is secondary, including your health and mortality.

As a Bernie Bro this Russian connection is news to me, I couldn’t stand Hillary forever (before Putin even) and even less her hapless cadre of well wishers. If you pile up all the lying and obfuscating that went on with Obama and Bush, I was more than ready to look outside the Beltway for a life raft. I tell you when I absolutely decided I was not going to play the ‘lesser evil’ game and that was when it became patently obvious that Sec State Hillary Clinton was going to approve of the DAPL pipeline by having its environmental impact ‘independently’ scrutinized by a contractor that was also working for the pipeline’s owners.

Then she lost to Obama. She polled as a consistent drag on down ticket races. The stuff about Obama’s soaring rhetoric was absolutely nuts. “We aren’t red states or blue states.

Reply ↓ Jim Haygood March 31, 2017 at 3:24 pm As a companion to Craazyman Fund, today a new and simpler portfolio is introduced. Thumper is a monthly trading model which selects one sector on the last trading day of each month, from a menu of seven choices: Energy, Financials, Industrials, Technology, Consumer Staples, Health Care and Consumer Discretionary. Each sector fund holds between 35 and 85 individual stocks drawn from the S&P 500 index of the largest US stocks. While the sector funds are diversified among companies, the similarity of their constituents means that sector performance can vary greatly from the S&P 500 index, either positively or negatively. Simulated results indicate that Thumper beat the S&P 500 index in 20 of the past 27 years, often by substantial margins. Since simulated results can be unrealistic owing to hindsight, a live one-year trial of Thumper begins today. On average, Thumper changes its selection eight times per year. Therefore, it would be most appropriate for a tax-deferred account such as an IRA, Keogh or 401k. In a taxable account, sector futures would offer more favorable tax treatment than sector funds. This chart shows the simulated performance of Thumper over the past 12 months, as of 3 pm today. For April, the selection remains Financials (stock symbol XLF). This is not an investment recommendation. It’s a live public trial of a research project. http://ibb.co/cwZZyv Reply ↓ fresno dan March 31, 2017 at 5:48 pm Jim Haygood March 31, 2017 at 3:24 pm if one has an active…perverted…imagination, one can see thumper having (missionary) sex with the S&P….being a family blog, I can’t describe the position I anticipate in the next 6 months….

Why Nunes left his cab: Around the same time, Mr. Nunes’s own intelligence sources informed him that documents showed further collection of information about, and unmasking of, Trump transition officials. These documents aren’t easily obtainable, since they aren’t the “finished” intelligence products that Congress gets to see. Nonetheless, for weeks Mr. Nunes has been demanding intelligence agencies turn over said documents—with no luck, so far. Mr. Nunes earlier this week got his own source to show him a treasure trove of documents at a secure facility. Here are the relevant details: First, there were dozens of documents with information about Trump officials. Second, the information these documents contained was not related to Russia. Third, while many reports did “mask” identities (referring, for instance, to “U.S. Person 1 or 2”) they were written in ways that made clear which Trump officials were being discussed. Fourth, in at least one instance, a Trump official other than Mr. Flynn was outright unmasked. Finally, these documents were circulated at the highest levels of government. ============================================================= Other than right wing sites, this is the first instance of the argument I have seen of the repubs that has been put forward coherently and the issue stated cogently. That does not mean its true, but at least it is put forward. I was watching CNN last night and the blonde commentator woman (Kirsten ???) put forward the proposition that the intelligence agencies “collecting” information on Trump associates does not mean Trump associates were surveilled – now this was in the context that the discussion was about the fact that Trump individuals were supposedly illegally “unmasked” by the intelligence agencies because the information was …..collected because they were under surveillance. Parsing “collection: vs “surveilling” was disingenuous beyond reality. One can put forward the idea that Trump personnel had conversations because of “incidental collection” or that Trump personnel are lawbreakers or treasonous as a reason for the surveillance (if surveillance happened – it seems obvious that it did happen) and the surveillance was legitimate. Unmasking could be legitimate as well – we don’t know right now. But to continue to put forward the proposition that Trump associates were not surveilled (by the Obama ADMINISTRATION) is simply preposterous. Again, I just see purposeful obtuseness. And the trust in the honor and integrity of CIA and intelligence agency officials assumed by the MSM when there are so many instances of documented lying is hard to reconcile with an objective press. I pretty much suspect there were some standard Washington scams/influence peddling going on – more so because this is Trump – and someone in the Obama administration was over anxious to leak this information, developed from classified information to hurt Trump. The only problem is that intelligence gathered information is not to be used for common criminal law. So we have the common law breaking on the Trump side and we have constitutional law breaking from the Obama side. Unfortunately, this country seems to have lost all desire to restrain the government from access to ALL communications of US citizens.

But China, with its nearly $350 billion trade surplus with the United States in 2016, will be at the top of the list for review.” Mar-a-Lago should be decked with as many Made-in-China products as possible…maybe even laminated flooring. “This is why we have to address that $350 billion trade surplus, Mr. Xi.” Shirts, socks, coffee cups, apple juice, etc. Reply ↓ Byron the Light Bulb March 31, 2017 at 4:04 pm It’s as if GRU and Spetssvyaz had their own political action preferences based on self-interest. Destabilize and fragment Eastern Europe for bilateral relations with individual gov’ts to which warm relations are rewarded with lower natural gas prices at the risk chaos and armed conflict. Or preserve the stable central adversary for deployment of sober conventional forces that have unity of purpose with the stabilizing benefits of large conservative institutions that will just sit and rust.

Reply ↓ cojo March 31, 2017 at 4:05 pm RE: “Meditation’s Calming Effects Pinpointed in Brain” [Scientific American]. Krasnow’s team genetically engineered mice to remove a specific subset of neurons that contains two genes: cadherin 9 (Cdh9), a gene that is expressed in the pre-Bötzinger complex, and developing brain homeobox protein 1 (Dbx1), which prior studies had demonstrated are necessary for respiration—without it, mice do not breathe. Researchers both in mice and later in human studies were looking at effects of the respiratory drive of the human brain. This is located in the brain stem, also known as the “reptilian brain” for it’s evolutionary basis throughout most vertebrates since reptiles. This portion of the brain also includes other “subcortical” brain structures such as the amygdala which is responsible for fight or flight responses. These portions of the brain are important in many of our subconscious “automatic” body functions such as respiration, blood pressure and temperature control. What this study implies is that meditation and other repetitive efforts at mindfulness do have an effect on these deep brain regions along with their functions. This is an example of brain plasticity at work. On the same vein, many psycho social ills suffered by humans are also due to this brain plasticity although via opposite mechanisms where maladaptations tend to send these regions into overdrive causing revved up fight of flight responses leading to stress, high blood pressure, and eventually to human diseases all to prevalent in modern society such as heart disease, strokes, cancers, and eventually death. Reply ↓ Paper Mac March 31, 2017 at 4:11 pm ‘“Meditation’s Calming Effects Pinpointed in Brain” [Scientific American]. I’m very dubious about any study that “pinpoints” effects in the brain. Surely an infinitely plastic brain is adaptive?’ No one believes that the brain is “infinitely plastic” (neurogenesis and synapse remodelling are limited processes; in adult human brains they’re extremely limited- that’s why brain damage is a problem) or that plasticity implies free neofunctionalisation of brain regions within a single person’s lifespan. Functions can be reliably localised to particular regions of the brain, eg. visual processing functions don’t ever up and migrate from the visual cortex to the cerebellum. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef March 31, 2017 at 4:46 pm If you just look at activities (electromagnetic or whatnot) and heat/energy generated, you may get the idea that one brain region is processing this or that information or signals. But suppose an alien does the same to the country of America. 1. New York money demands a certain action and reaction policy in DC. New York originates it in a low key fundraiser and that is transmitted to DC, without much noise the alien can detest. 2. Russia responds with a strong signal 3. DC then responds with its own strong signal. Both 2 and 3 can be detected by the alien easily. Does the alien then conclude the DC is the only region really processing, or the only region processing the kind of signal Russia sends?

Reply ↓ Oregoncharles March 31, 2017 at 11:44 pm Do you really want an answer? I can’t answer for California, but I can for Oregon: Snail mail costs money. Registrations provide ONLY mailing addresses, with occasional emails or phone #s as a voluntary bonus. A mailing to every registered Green in California would be a LOT of money. Among other effects, this causes us to industriously collect email addresses, since email does NOT cost money. It means that our mailings are quite selective. And you’re right: this has unfortunate effects, cutting the party off from a lot of its members. You can correct the problem for yourself by going to the website and signing up for an appropriate email list (assuming their system is similar to ours – but a former Californian administers ours, so it’s a good bet.) If you really want to make things happen, send them some money earmarked for mailings, and give them your address (once you donate, you may wish they’d stop). For an anti-corporate party, almost everything comes down to lack of money, compounded by a shortage of people, since very few of them get paid (in Oregon, precisely one, the fundraiser/treasurer/webmistress). I know excuses don’t really cut it, but that was my weekly reality for about 10 years.

But the critics stand by their assertions that the agency’s heightened security sensitivity to applicants with multiple visits to China has also cost it high-quality talent. “If you have that on your background, your résumé is just tossed in the trash, because they are so paranoid about MSS penetration and co-opting students,” a former senior CIA intelligence analyst tells Newsweek on condition of anonymity.

Military Military: The Intel 'Badass' women veterans: Getting less respect? Kirstie Ennis Marine Corps veteran Kirstie Ennis appears in a new Got Your 6 public-service video about the contribution of female veterans. Marine Corps veteran Kirstie Ennis appears in a new Got Your 6 public-service video about the contribution of female veterans. Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter “Their service is often overlooked when they leave the military.” A new public-service campaign is drawing attention to women veterans, one of the fastest-growing veterans groups but one that feels undervalued. That’s according to the national nonprofit Got Your 6, which is launching an advertising push called “She’s Badass.” Temecula-area Marine Corps veteran Kirstie Ennis, who lost part of her leg in an Afghanistan helicopter crash, appears in the video. SNAP Video #SheABadass campaign #SheABadass campaign See more videos “Their service is often overlooked when they leave the military,” said Iraq War veteran and Got Your 6 Director of Content Kate Hoit. “We hope people will watch and share this video to help us defy stereotypes and put a face to a new generation of veterans.” Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day Ennis served with two Miramar Marine Corps Air Station helicopter squadrons in Afghanistan. Enlisting at 17, she was a helicopter door-gunner and mechanic for six years. On June 23, 2012, during her last deployment to Afghanistan, her aircraft crashed during a supply mission. Ennis lost her left leg from the knee down, among other significant injuries. She was medically retired from the Marine Corps as a sergeant in 2014. In the video, Ennis says, “I get all sorts of questions, (such as,) ‘I didn’t realize that women could even be doing the jobs that you were doing.’” The population of women veterans is on the rise. It is projected to go from 8 percent of all veterans in 2013 to over 16 percent by 2043. Meanwhile, while the overall population of vets will decrease during that period, from 22 million to less than 15 million people. The Got Your 6 campaign debuts as the military — and the Marine Corps in particular — is staggering from a revelation that hundreds of nude photos of current and former servicewomen were shared illicitly on a Facebook group called Marines United. The scandal has prompted critics to say that a culture of sexism is still rampant in the U.S. military, despite growing gender integration in the ranks and Pentagon-led anti-sexual harassment programs in recent years.

Andrew Cunningham - Mar 31, 2017 5:45 pm UTC Enlarge materod on flickr reader comments 76 Share this story You may have just upgraded your computer to use DDR4 recently or you may still be using DDR3, but in either case, nothing stays new forever. JEDEC, the organization in charge of defining new standards for computer memory, says that it will be demoing the next-generation DDR5 standard in June of this year and finalizing the standard sometime in 2018. DDR5 promises double the memory bandwidth and density of DDR4, and JEDEC says it will also be more power-efficient, though the organization didn't release any specific numbers or targets. Like DDR4 back when it was announced, it will still be several years before any of us have DDR5 RAM in our systems. That's partly because the memory controllers in processors and SoCs need to be updated to support DDR5, and these chips normally take two or three years to design from start to finish. DDR4 RAM was finalized in 2012, but it didn't begin to go mainstream until 2015 when consumer processors from Intel and others added support for it. DDR5 has no relation to GDDR5, a separate decade-old memory standard used for graphics cards and game consoles. Further ReadingIntel’s first Optane SSD for regular PCs is a small but super-fast cache RAM isn't going anywhere in the near future, but if you look ahead a few years, you can see a potentially RAM-free future looming. Intel's Optane drives are attempting to combine the capacity, density, and non-volatility of an SSD with speed that is beginning to approach RAM's—first-generation Optane drives have about 10 times higher latency according to Intel, but that's not so far off the mark for many workloads. As the technology improves, it may well remove the need for separate pools of RAM and storage, triggering a fundamental shift in the way that computing devices work. For now, though, bring on the faster RAM. Andrew Cunningham Andrew has a B.A. in Classics from Kenyon College and has over five years of experience in IT.

Burns Friday March 31st, 2017 Read about the latest sports tech news, innovations, ideas and products that impact players, fans and the sports industry at SportTechie.com. During a recent episode of the SportTechie Podcast with host Bram Weinstein, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was asked, ‘What’s the biggest overrated and underrated technology in sports right now?’ His response? “Overrated is analytics. Underrated is artificial intelligence and its derivative.” Why does Cuban think the way he does? Subscribe to the SportTechie Newsletter Subscribe Alexa Provides Live Information On NBA Playoff Teams Garmin Makes It Easier For Triathletes To Monitor Training With Forerunner 935 Smartwatch CLeBron James Stars In Intel’s Final Four Commercial Featuring 360-Degree Replay Technology “Because it’s become efficient now and because AI is going to kick (analytics’) ass all over the town. It’s going to be not gone because analytics becomes your AI. Your analytics department will have to learn AI, machine learning, deep learning, neural networking, etcetera, and be good at that. But historically, when analytics, and this is going back to the day I bought the Mavericks when we started using advanced plus minus, you have to make choices. And you have to be able to say, ‘OK, what are important to me? How am I going to weigh those variables and what are the conclusions I’ll draw from those variables?’ At the beginning with the Mavs at least, we had huge advantages. We would force teams to play their bad lineups that they didn’t know were bad. We forced teams to play bad combinations that they didn’t know were bad combinations, and it helped us win games and playoff series. “Over time, teams became a lot more aware, and the market became a lot more efficient. And then it didn’t become so much about the analytics as it became, ‘OK, could you find the players you needed to play the style that you wanted to play?’ And that to this day remains the biggest challenge. You can have the greatest analytics department in the world, it’s going to be very difficult now to get an advantage over the other team. Maybe there’s a couple teams that are behind in analytics, but you’re not going to get an advantage on smart teams.” The new NBA pic.twitter.com/RkV6PkwXaD— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) March 28, 2017 With not many NBA teams that are behind in analytics, Cuban called it an “efficient market” now. “Going forward, I think what data you incorporate into your models, how you clean your data, how you train your data, whether it’s structured, unstructured, how you label it, all those things will be critically important,” Cuban continued. “The hope, at least from my perspective, is we’ll learn things and see things that we never imagined, that we couldn’t perceive in a traditional analytics environment.” Along with analytics, Cuban also discussed the current state of virtual reality and why he hasn’t invested in an esports team as opposed to other NBA team owners like Ted Leonsis and Peter Guber, who acquired esports franchise Team Liquid last Fall.

In the cases below, the judge addresses internet prescriptions; examines the extent of a computer technician's knowledge of a prescription scheme; explains computer systems and some of their interactions with software; decides appropriate damages for disclosing, but perhaps not using, a former employer’s computer source code; and finds that in certain circumstances, a reasonable person should know that his or her internet activities involves interstate wire transmissions. Rest Easy (or Easier), Low-level Computer Technicians In United States v. Lovern, a computer technician was convicted for conspiracy to dispense drugs in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. Red Mesa, the pharmacy that the technician worked for, operated an elaborate online prescription scheme, contracting with two internet-based companies, SafeTrust and IntegraRx, which ran websites where “patients” who wanted prescriptions would answer a questionnaire. Contract physicians would then log onto these sites and approve prescription requests based solely on the questionnaires. There was no contact between the doctors and patients—no consultation, no follow up questions, no scheduled review. SafeTrust and IntegraRx then contracted with several pharmacies, Red Mesa being one of them, to fill the prescriptions, paying $7 per prescription on top of the wholesale cost of the drugs. Not only did Red Mesa’s methods diverge from the norm, but so did its prescription breakdown. Where a traditional pharmacy dispenses more non-controlled substances than controlled substances at a rate of nine to one, Red Mesa filled more controlled than non-controlled substances. In Lovern, Judge Gorsuch handles two issues—first, whether SafeTrust and IntegraRx’s physicians were acting outside the usual course of modern medical practice by prescribing medicine based solely on an online questionnaire, and second, whether the computer technician had the requisite mens rea for violating the Controlled Substances Act by knowingly helping to fill prescriptions written by doctors who had no interaction with their patients and were either acting outside of the scope of usual medical practice or without a legitimate medical purpose. As to the first question, Judge Gorsuch finds that a reasonable jury could have been persuaded by the government’s substantial evidence from a variety of sources that SafeTrust and IntegraRx’s physicians were acting outside of medical standards of care and contemporary medical practices. However, he leaves the door open to these practices changing in the future, noting that “[w]hatever may be the case in five or ten or twenty years, the government adduced sufficient proof at trial that the practices of SafeTrust and IntegraRx physicians were not within the usual course of professional practice as of 2005 and 2006 (emphasis added).” And as for the computer technician’s conviction under the Controlled Substances Act, Judge Gorsuch reverses the verdict, finding that no reasonable jury could have found the technician, named Barron, guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In order for the conviction to stand, the government would have needed to prove that Barron knew that the physicians were prescribing medicine based solely on online questionnaires and that this was not consistent with legitimate medical practices. Barron had little familiarity with pharmaceuticals and received little training from SafeTrust and IntegraRx. His job was quite menial—he logged onto the websites and navigated to a page with the prescriptions available to Red Mesa. The business manager sat next to Barron and directed him on which prescriptions to select to fill. Barron would then print out the labels. This question points to an interesting strategy by the government. The government chose not to argue that Red Mesa was unlawfully accepting prescriptions over the internet, stating both in its brief and at oral argument that “[u]sing the Internet to transmit a lawful prescription is not the issue.” Instead, it chose to apply the Controlled Substances Act in a more traditional way, arguing that those involved in the pharmacy knew that the doctors were “exceed[ing] the boundaries of legitimate practices and purposes in the medical profession.” However, Judge Gorsuch finds the facts did not line up with the government’s argument when it came to Barron. While there were some instant messages between Barron and the operator of the SafeTrust website showing that Barron knew something at Red Mesa was awry, that level of general knowledge is not sufficient to convict under the Controlled Substances Act: the government needed to prove that Barron knew both that the online questionnaires were the only “interaction” the doctors had with the patients and that this was not consistent with contemporary medical practices. Judge Gorsuch’s opinion provides a roadmap for computer technicians to isolate themselves from the criminal behavior of their employees. If a technician is performing tasks that do not provide, or amount to, knowledge of the criminal activity on the part of his or her employer, taking the ostrich approach and sticking one’s head in the sand may be beneficial—at least if the suspected criminal activity violates the Controlled Substances Act.   Harkening Back to Microsoft’s Monopoly Sending us back to the release of Microsoft 95, Judge Gorsuch’s opinion in Novell Inc., v. Microsoft is yet another example of his technological understanding. Novell, creators of WordPerfect software programs, brought suit against Microsoft for withdrawing independent software vendors’ (ISVs) access to part of Windows 95’s application programming interfaces and thus furthering Microsoft’s monopoly of Intel-related personal computer systems. While ultimately finding that Microsoft’s actions did not monopolize trade as defined by § 2 of the Sherman Act, Judge Gorsuch explains computer systems and software interfacing with ease and precision. While the whole opinion reads as an accessible, historical primer, here are some highlights: An operating system amounts to the computer’s core software—software that allows the everyday user to take advantage of a computer’s functions. Users often rely on an operating system to open and close other applications—word processors, spreadsheets, calendars, or the like. Those applications often depend on the operating system, too, drawing on the operating system’s code to read and write files on the hard drive, draw images and text on the screen, or transmit information. In 1981, Microsoft introduced MS–DOS, an operating system that required users to type commands on the keyboard. Beginning in 1990, the company developed successive versions of its Windows operating system, one that featured a “graphical user interface” allowing users to issue commands simply by pointing and clicking a mouse on visual icons. … Anticipating the release of Windows 95 to the public sometime in 1995, in June 1994 it shared a beta, or test, version of the operating system with ISVs [independent software vendors].  At the same time, Microsoft also gave ISVs access to Windows 95’s application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs allow programs to invoke the operating system’s built-in abilities to perform certain functions; each API consists of a set of named procedures that automate particular tasks an application might need to perform. By publishing the names of the procedures in an API and providing information about how to invoke each one, Microsoft essentially permitted ISVs a shortcut—they could rely on Microsoft’s APIs when writing their own code rather than having to design custom code to perform the same functions. … Among the APIs Microsoft chose to share information about were namespace extensions (NSEs). NSEs are a subset of APIs that permit a user to see (and then open) documents affiliated not just with the current application but located in wildly different places on the computer or elsewhere. Familiar namespaces include the “Recycle Bin”—where a user might dispose of an unwanted document—and the “Desktop”—the computer’s default screen that displays when the user starts up his computer. If a user wants to open a document on the Desktop, she might click the Desktop namespace icon on the left side of the file open dialog on the application she is currently running, and watch the contents of the Desktop appear on the right side of the window. With a double click, she might then open the document. NSEs thus provide something of a shortcut to places outside the current application. In Novell, Judge Gorsuch demonstrates not only his understanding of the detailed workings of computers and software but also that he can clearly, and fairly concisely, explain technology to the general public.   Sharing Your Former Employer’s Source Code: What Damages Are Allowed? In StorageCraft Technology v. Kirby, Judge Gorsuch examined the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, the definitional overlap between “use” and “disclosure”, and the distinction between trade secret law and patent law’s available awards for disclosure violations. Given the importance of trade secrets and the applicable law to the industry, StorageCraft may be an important case for tech companies to keep in mind in dealing with a future Justice Gorsuch James Kirby, one of the founders and directors of the computer software company StorageCraft had a falling out with the company and took StorageCraft’s source code, a trade secret, to a rival company, NetJapan. StorageCraft sued for trade secret misappropriation and a jury returned a verdict of 2.92 million dollars in favor of StorageCraft. However, he never personally profited from the move and StorageCraft did not prove at trial that NetJapan ever made commercial use of the source code. As a result, Kirby argued that the claim is immune from certain damages, namely “reasonable royalty” damages or “the price that would be set by a willing buyer and a willing seller.” Reasonable royalty damages “seek[] to recreate ‘an actual market transaction,’” as opposed to the two other options for damages—defendant’s unjust enrichment or the plaintiff’s “actual loss.” Noting that Utah’s statute, in line with the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, does not restrict reasonable royalty damages to cases where the defendant used the trade secret as opposed to disclosing it, Judge Gorsuch upholds the district court’s judgment. In doing so, he touches on the policy behind Utah’s use of reasonable royalty awards as a general option, ultimately declaring it the terrain of the state legislature.  [W]here (as here) a defendant discloses a trade secret to a rival company in a fit of retaliatory pique without any desire for personal riches, the other two measures of damages may not always be entirely fit for the task. An award based on unjust enrichment risks undercompensating the plaintiff when the defendant has no gains of his own to disgorge Though what the Utah statute calls the “actual loss” measure of damages doesn’t suffer from this particular problem, it may invite practical difficulties of its own. In cases like ours the best evidence about the extent of the plaintiff’s lost sales isn’t readily available from the defendant before the court but resides instead in the hands of far-flung third parties like NetJapan. Proving a causal connection between the plaintiff’s claimed lost profits and the defendant’s conduct might be difficult, too, in these circumstances. Complexities like theses may be surmountable, but the cost of doing so may be enough to explain why a state would wish to make reasonable royalty awards generally available to misappropriation plaintiffs. After all, it is hardly unknown for the law to resolve ambiguities about the appropriate quantity of damages against the wrongdoer rather than his victim. … We can imagine arguments that might lead reasonable lawmakers in [another] direction as well, including worries that hypothetical royalty negotiation exercises themselves might be difficult to administer in certain circumstances or might yield damages in excess of the plaintiff’s actual losses. … In the end, though, arguments like these are more appropriately directed to those charged with writing Utah’s trade secret statute than those charged with applying it. To decide this case it’s enough for this court to recognize and respect Utah’s policy choice to permit “reasonable royalty” awards as a “general option” in “disclosure” cases. We are in no position to override that legislative choice simply because we might prefer another. While Judge Gorsuch repeats that states did not have to follow Utah’s choice in adhering to the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, he points out that the distinction between use and disclosure is not quite clear. Can’t disclosing a trade secret for a particular end or purpose (be it retribution or profit or otherwise) be a way of putting it to use, at least in a broad sense of the word? What happens when the disclosure is made to a third party (like NetJapan) with the intent the third party itself put the trade secret to commerical use in ways harmful to the secret’s owner? Isn’t at least that disclosure a use of the secret, whether or not the third party takes up the invitation? Finally, Judge Gorsuch muddles through the cases cited by the defendant and clarifies the source of the distinction between trade secret and patent law’s requirements for reasonable royalty damages. To the extent that University Computing or similar cases cited by Mr. Kirby happen to emphasize commercial use apart from disclosure, it’s noteworthy that they tend to borrow generously from patent law’s approach to reasonable royalty damages. Under the terms of the federal patent statute (unlike those of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act), a reasonable royalty award does depend on “the use made of the invention by the infringer.” But the difference between the Patent Act and Uniform Trade Secrets Act on this score is hardly surprising given basic differences between patents and trade secrets. Sharing information about another’s patented invention is generally not the injury disclosing a trade secret is. After all, patentees aren’t allowed to keep their innovations entirely to themselves; telling us how to practice their invention is the price they must pay for their patent. Because the crucial information about patented inventions is already a matter of public record, patent cases on reasonable royalties have had no cause to address unauthorized disclosure. Their focus has been and must be on authorized uses. To be sure, patent cases still provide useful instruction for courts considering damages for trade secret misappropriation, as we have noted before. But in light of the differences between the patent and trade secret statutes—and between patents and trade secrets themselves—patent law’s treatment of reasonable royalties can’t be read to suggest that a reasonable royalty award in trade secret must always and as a matter of logical necessity require commercial use. What the Reasonable Person Should Know About the Internet Do you know where server connections were made for you to read this article? Do you at least presume that they crossed state lines? According to United States v. Mullins, Judge Gorsuch believes there are situations in which a reasonable person should know that her internet activity moved beyond the boundary of her own state. LaDonna Mullins and Linda Edwards used their real estate business to defraud the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by falsifying applications for Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, which are often easier to obtain than standard loans. Once Mullins and Edwards had a client who was unable to obtain a loan due to poor credit, they sent the client on to a pair of forgers Warren Williams and Rod Wesson, who would create a variety of false documents—”pay stubs, W-2 forms, Social Security numbers, rent verifications, and gift letters”—to bolster the client’s credit. The plan was well thought through; Mullins and Edwards even created fake companies acting as the client’s employer, using their own phone numbers so they could answer verification calls. Money flowed both ways between the real estate agents and the forgers: the document makers would pay the real estate agents a percentage of the fee they charged the client, and once a client closed on a house, a percentage of the real estate agents’ commission went to the forgers. After being convicted of wire fraud, Mullins appealed on the grounds that the government lacked sufficient evidence that she had caused interstate wire transmissions. Judge Gorsuch finds that in order to sustain her convictions, “the evidence need not go so far as to prove she ‘specifically intend[ed] to use this or that wire,’ but it must at least show that Ms. Mullins did ‘an act with knowledge that the use of the wires will follow in the ordinary course of business, or where such use can reasonably be foreseen, even though not actually intended.’” Since a FHA case number was required for each loan application, interstate wires were frequently used in the scheme. To obtain the case number, a lender logged in to HUD’s FHA Connection computer database system and entered information about the property and prospective borrower. That information was sent to HUD’s mainframe in Maryland, which produced and transmitted an [sic] FHA case number back to the lender. That case number then appeared on the various loan documents the real estate agents handled through closing of the property purchase. However, Mullins claimed that the entirety of her business dealings occurred in Colorado so the interstate nature of the wire transmissions for the FHA case numbers was not foreseeable. Judge Gorsuch does not find her argument persuasive. The wire fraud statute doesn’t require that a defendant be able to anticipate every technical detail of a wire transmission, before she may be held liable for causing it. It’s enough if she “sets forces into motion which foreseeably would involve” use of the wires. Judge Gorsuch finds that due to Mullin’s choice of FHA-insured loans, coupled with her seeing the closing documents that contained case numbers, a rational jury to find that she could reasonably foresee the use of the wires. Before narrowing his holding to the case at hand, Judge Gorsuch hints at a more sweeping ruling. Indeed, given the ubiquity of electronic communications in our day and age, one might posit that use of the wires is always foreseeable when conducting such large and complex transactions. As for the interstate nature of the wire transmissions, Judge Gorsuch drew an interesting conclusion—that since the seat of the FHA was outside Colorado, Mullins should have anticipated interstate wire transmissions. She maintains that the real estate transactions underlying her convictions had everything to do with Colorado and only Colorado: all of the people and properties involved were located in the Centennial State. But that is not so. The charged wire transmissions came from the FHA in Maryland. As its name suggests—and as Ms. Mullins testified she was aware—FHA is an agency of the federal government, whose seat resides outside of Colorado. From this, it’s no stretch for a jury to conclude Ms. Mullins should have anticipated that wire transmissions involving the agency might cross state lines, as they did. This holding gives rise to other questions—if there is a FHA branch office in Colorado, which there is, is it reasonable to assume that the FHA has in-house servers and databases for processing Colorado applications? Also, is it reasonable to assume that an agency or a company stores their servers and databases where their seat is located? Does cloud computing change this? Regardless of these lingering questions, Judge Gorsuch makes one thing crystal clear: he envisions the hypothetical “reasonable person” as endowed with a certain degree of technological understanding.  Topics:  Cybersecurity Tags:  Neil Gorsuch Sarah Tate Chambers is a second year law student at the University of South Carolina.

Myles Cullen/Wikimedia Commons Donate Subscribe Share Tweet Print Email Nancy is correct to emphasize that it’s quite possible, likely even, that many folks are drawing the wrong conclusions from the fact that Michael Flynn is seeking immunity before he’s willing to talk again to the FBI or testify before Congress. All it definitely means is that there’s a high probability that Flynn will invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Whether he has something worthy of a trade for immunity is a separate matter. In other words, some folks are willing to say that they’re eager to talk to Congress, and others are warning that they’ll clam up real tight if called or subpoenaed to testify. Flynn is in the latter camp, and for obvious reasons. If he was ever in any doubt about it, he now knows with a certainty that he’s been the subject of a multiagency counterintelligence investigation since at least July of last year. He’s seen the allegations made against him in the Steele dossier. If those things weren’t terrifying enough, he apparently was “less then forthcoming” with the FBI when they questioned him about the content of his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. It’s also increasingly clear that even if the Intelligence Community and, in particular, the CIA didn’t see him as potential turncoat and Putin-controlled mole, he attempted to make war on them and lost. His legal vulnerabilities are therefore huge and his enemies determined, which makes it less than helpful that he’s been caught dead to rights failing to report payments from the Russian government for his travel to Moscow to meet with and fête Vladimir Putin, nor to divulge that he was taking money from Turkey and was therefore serving as an agent of a foreign power. One might imagine that he’s committed perjury by paperwork on these issues as he got himself cleared to work as Trump’s National Security Adviser. And then there’s the possibility that he could actually be prosecuted for conspiracy to commit kidnapping, which he had the lack of foresight to engage in in the presence of a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Former Central Intelligence Agency Director James Woolsey told CNN Friday that former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn met with representatives of the Turkish government in 2016 and discussed potential ways to send a foe of Turkey’s president back to face charges in that country, As a representative of his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, Flynn met with senior representatives of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government in September 2016, Woolsey said. Woolsey was a Trump campaign adviser at the time and attended the meeting, but said he arrived after it was already well underway. Woolsey claims that those present discussed sending Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim leader who Erdogan has accused of being behind a failed military coup to overthrow him, back to Turkey to face charges — possibly outside the legal US extradition system. “What I saw and heard was sort of the end of the conversation — it’s not entirely clear what transpired because of that,” Woolsey said on “CNN Tonight” with Don Lemon. “But it looks as if there was at least some strong suggestion by one or more of the Americans present at the meeting that we would be able, the United States would be able, through them, to be able to get hold of Gulen, the rival for Turkey’s political situation.” If a president could be impeached for lack of judgment, Trump’s decision to name Flynn as his National Security Adviser would be sufficient to remove him from power. It’s hard to gauge how crippling it would be to the administration for Flynn to discuss all of his criminal and potentially criminal activities in front of Congress. And that’s before he might divulge anything about Trump or his campaign or any coordination with the Russians. Needless to say, if the FBI wants Flynn to talk, they have enough potential jail time to wave in front of him to make him sing like a canary. The question is, can Flynn help them enough in their counterintelligence investigation to make it worth trading away a bunch of convictions, some of which would be very easy to prove? Some people have suggested that only by implicating Trump could he give the FBI a bigger scalp, but the FBI’s interest in understanding the facts and the scope and the nature of Russia’s tactics could be enough of an enticement to get them to talk about immunity. If that would tend to exonerate or vindicate Trump, it might still be good enough. However, with so much criminal liability, Flynn won’t want to commit more perjury. So, either he’s going to keep quiet and take his medicine or he’s going to tell what he knows. And that can’t be a comfort to Team Trump. If he were insanely lucky, me might trick Congress into immunizing him against prosecution the same way that Congress inadvertently immunized Oliver North and John Poindexter against prosecution. I could definitely see Rep. Devin Nunes being a willing collaborator in that effort. But, that would still involve him testifying before Congress about everything, which could also destroy the Trump administration even if it saved Flynn’s hide. And, in any case, Nunes can’t give Flynn immunity unilaterally. The best case for Trump is that Flynn invokes the Fifth Amendment and goes to jail without doing them any further damage. And he might do that if he can’t cut a deal. Of course, a plea bargain may be the best he can negotiate, since there are so many looming charges against him. So, no, the fact that Flynn has sought immunity doesn’t mean that he’s about to drop a dime on President Trump. But it does mean that Trump’s presidency is in a world of trouble.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News Intilop’s 10G Full TCP Accelerators with Network Security Features IP Core for Altera/Intel FPGAs is qualified by major University and government clients Another industry first: As the adaption of their TCP Acceleration Technology becomes more widespread around the globe that includes Security infrastructure and other equipment classes, this Security module is an add on module to their TCP and UDP Accelerators providing unprecedented functionality of Network Traffic Security combined with Full TCP/UDP Acceleration at 10G. Intilop, Inc., a pioneer, most respected and recognized leader in providing Ultra-Low latency and Hyper Performance Complex Networking Protocol Accelerators like Full TCP, UDP, IGMP & other Mega IP Cores, Systems and Solutions since 2009, delivers yet another industry first: a full TCP and UDP Accelerator with Network Security capability which performs functions of firewall and other monitoring functions at full line rate. In addition to full TCP/UDP offloading, this security module performs port filtering, blocking, monitoring and related functions in FPGA hardware thereby relieving CPU from these tasks. They are performed in nanosecond speeds and with ultra-precision and zero jitter. During network security processing, the CPU gets bogged down under high traffic rates, sometimes missing some ‘Events’, can be used for other application functions. So this is a win-win situation for both. Ultra-fast and precise processing time of around 100 nanoseconds for this module including TCP and UDP with thousands of sessions initially at 10G, sets the bar much higher for speed and performance powered by a 7+ years mature and proven TCP Protocol Compliant architecture. The Security module for their latest 40G TOE is planned for Q3 2017 It was a highly significant achievement to develop this cutting edge technology rich architecture which implements Network Security module coupled with TCP and UDP Accelerators running at Full 10G Line rate. 40G soon to be released. The 10G TOE has been in volume production for more than 6 years now and is deployed around the globe. Working out of the box solutions with Choice of Cores implemented with this security module with 1K, 512 and  256 concurrent TCP/UDP Sessions will be available later this year. 32 through 128 sessions are available as of Q4 2016 A sample of their TCP and UDP Accelerators can be found also at Altera and Xilinx websites: Altera/Intel: https://www.altera.com/products/design-software/embedded-software-developers/opencl/developer-zone/opencl-reference-platforms.html Altera/Intel: https://www.altera.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/pdfs/literature/br/br-intellectual-property-brochure.pdf Xilinx: http://www.xilinx.com/esp/datacenter/data_center_ip.html Not only it offers 100 ns latency and wire speed TCP performance with security features, it also offers customization flexibility to network architects to design world-class system-level applications tailored to their specific needs.

Page 1 of 2. 21 Comments It's been fun benchmarking Vulkan vs. OpenGL with Mad Max, Feral's first Linux game port featuring a beta Vulkan renderer. With the Radeon benchmarks and many NVIDIA Pascal tests yesterday an Intel Core i7 Kabylake CPU was used while for this article is a Mad Max run with AMD's Ryzen 7 1800X. In the NVIDIA test results yesterday I showed how with the Core i7 7700K, the CPU usage dropped noticeably while the GPU utilization went up heavily, as is designed to do with properly using Vulkan. Thanks to the test automation around the Phoronix Test Suite, it's easy to look at the various system sensors during testing. With the testing under Ryzen, the CPU usage has gone while the GPU usage goes up. With the Core i7 7700K tests yesterday with GTX 1080 Ti, the CPU usage was a 36% average with a peak of 54% under OpenGL while under Vulkan dropped to a 22% average with Vulkan and 38% peak. With the Ryzen 7 1800X paired with a GTX 1080, the CPU usage dropped from just 18.9% to 15.1%. The GPU usage had increased from an average of 50.3% to 58.8% while the peak went from 89% to 99%. The GPU utilization difference wasn't nearly as big of a difference with the Intel testing where the Pascal card went from 51% to 80% utilization. But still, even with Ryzen, it's a noticeable improvement. For those wondering if the memory usage is any different with Mad Max under OpenGL vs. Vulkan, it comes down to almost the same. The GPU temperature is only slightly higher with the greater utilization under Vulkan. And barely any difference in the GPU fan speed. Next are the actual OpenGL vs. Vulkan benchmark results.

Jefferson Graham reports from the USC campus. LOS ANGELES — Rarely a day goes by without tales of another drone advancement, usually for deliveries to a remote area, something Amazon and other companies are pursuing. University of Southern California students Wolfgang Hoenig and James Preiss check drones before they take flight on March 8, 2017, in Los Angeles.  (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY) It’s not here yet, but another futuristic use of drones is having large groups of quadcopters in packs, working together like bees, to assist in search and rescue, fire safety, coastal surveillance and other useful actions. Researchers at the University of Southern California are hard at work at just that, looking to spend the next five years perfecting synchronized drones for prime time. The advantage of multiple drones working together is that “if one fails, other ones can fulfill the gap,” says USC computer science professor Nora Ayanian. “With teams, you can be everywhere at once, not confined to one location.” We watched as Ayanian and her team demonstrated for us, having the computer start the process, and then the swarm of drones lifted off the floor, through the windows and back again. This they have down now; it's what happens when they go outside into the real world that the researchers need to perfect. Nora Ayanian, Gabilan assistant professor of Computer Science, shows some of the tiny drones used in her project at the University of Southern California.  (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USAT) Many of us watched as 300 synchronized drones flew together at the recent Super Bowl, in a demo performed by chip maker Intel, which has been showing off the technology at Disney World, as well. Like Intel, Ayanian’s drones are also operated by computer and cameras, but they are tiny—like flying insects with built-in cameras. Her research is all indoors, in a controlled environment, where the “robots” as she calls them, are trained to fly in and out of simulated windows, and to spell the letters U-S-C. Synchronized drones at Disney and sporting events “are shows,” says Wolfgang Hoenig, a USC PHD candidate working on the project. “We are using this for real applications.” When in shows, computers and manual controls are used to fly the drones, but Hoenig notes “we’re fully automated. We tell the drones where to start, and what the environment looks like, and they go from there.” USC isn’t alone in its research. The military is developing using mass drones for defense, as a “collective organism, sharing one distributed brain for decision-making and adapting to each other like swarms in nature,” said William Roper, the director of the Department of Defense’s Strategic Capabilities Office, in a statement. University of Southern California PhD students Wolfgang Hoenig and James Preiss run checks before sending tiny drones on a flight at the University of Southern Calfornia. Reporter's note: -- University of Southern California to interview a professor about how she connects drones to work together to fly as groups, for a variety of different missions, and she's going to demonstrate a drone army and how she gets them to work together. -- ORG XMIT: RH 136069 Drone army Live 03/08/2017 [Via MerlinFTP Drop]  (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USAT) Romeo Durscher, the director of education for consumer drone company DJI, says the idea of drones working in unison for search and rescues “will be tremendously helpful.” He regularly works with crews on missions to find lost people, usually with one drone in the sky. Increasingly first responders are using drones in places people can't go. In the recent Oakland "Ghostship" warehouse fire in December, for instance, investigators launched a drone with thermal imaging capability to help officials see if there were any survivors. “What we have now is way better than what we had two years ago, but it’s still a lot of manual input,” says Durscher. “We know one single drone can reduce the time it takes to find someone—imagine if we had many drones working together and sharing information, how much faster it would be.” Follow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham and don't forget to subscribe to the daily #TalkingTech podcast on iTunes and Stitcher.  Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2nDFAhX Most Popular How to clean your pillows, because they are full of dead bugs 18k Shares Target will give you $300 if you buy a new iPhone this week 4.7k Shares WhatsApp: What you need to know about the popular messaging app 1.7k Shares Should you buy an OLED, LED or QLED TV? 2.1k Shares Uber execs' trip to karaoke hostess bar raised HR complaint 382 Shares 3 ways to check out your neighbors online 2.0k Shares

Photo by Susanna Frohman, San Jose Mercury News. Bay Area philanthropists Gordon and Betty Moore have given Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford $50 million toward patient care and advance research for children with heart disease, the hospital announced on Tuesday, March 28. The Moores' private donation is the largest gift from an individual to Packard Children's Hospital since its founding gift from David and Lucile Packard, the hospital said in a statement. The hospital will rename its Children's Heart Center the Betty Irene Moore Children's Heart Center in honor of the gift. The donation provides funding for clinical and research facilities, an endowment for the center's highest strategic priorities and endowed positions for faculty to lead specialized care and research, the hospital said. Gordon Moore is co-founder of Intel Corporation. He and his wife, Betty, are founders of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, which funds research in the sciences, environment, health and education. Long-time supporters of Packard Children's Hospital, the couple previously made gifts to the hospital's 521,000-square-foot expansion, which is now nearing completion this year. The Moores decided to make the $50 million gift after their grandchild was helped by care from the heart center. "Our grandchild had lifesaving surgery at the hospital, and we would like to help make sure the capability is there for others," Gordon Moore said. The heart center has gained recognition as a national and international destination for highly specialized surgical procedures, including many that are among the most challenging and complex cardiovascular cases. The center receives more than 25,000 patient visits annually and performs 80 to 90 percent of all cardiac surgical care for children in northern and central California, according to the hospital. Pediatric heart surgeon Dr. Frank Hanley is executive director of the Betty Irene Moore Children's Heart Center. The Moores' gift comes at a critical point in pediatric cardiovascular care in that it will help physicians advance beyond surgical repair that is not a cure for disease to discovering treatments that could ultimately lead to true cures, he said. Currently many patients require multiple surgeries and repairs throughout their lifetimes that can interfere with their quality of life, according to the hospital. "We imagine a day when a child born with a poorly working aortic valve, rather than undergoing multiple open-heart operations throughout his lifetime, instead receives a replacement valve engineered from his own stem cells," he said. The Moores' gift will allow the heart center to build a robust research program aimed at improving the treatment and prevention of congenital and acquired heart conditions, including adult congenital heart disease. The Center will also expand its clinical facilities, including a newly designed outpatient center in the coming years, the hospital said. --- Follow the Palo Alto Weekly/Palo Alto Online on Twitter @PaloAltoWeekly and Facebook for breaking news, local events, photos, videos and more.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Open questions about Nunes’ surveillance claims By Tim Starks 03/31/17 10:00 AM EDT With help from Cory Bennett, Eric Geller and Martin Matishak QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS — As long as there are unanswered questions about President Donald Trump’s evidence-free allegations that his predecessor ordered surveillance of his campaign, this story is going to live on. On Thursday, the questions roiling Congress were: Who were House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes’ sources for his statements partially backing up the White House claims about surveillance (even if incidental) of the Trump camp? When will anyone else on his committee, or elsewhere in Congress, learn about it? What will a White House cache of classified documents prove to Congress? Story Continued Below The New York Times sought to shed some light on the first question Thursday, pinpointing Nunes’ sources as Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a national security-focused lawyer at the White House Counsel’s Office and a former House Intelligence counsel under Nunes. The Washington Post named a third, top NSC lawyer John Eisenberg. But the question about when other key members of Congress will get the information remains. The White House invited the leaders of both Intelligence panels over to view documents about “information collected on U.S. persons [that] was mishandled and leaked," but ducked other questions in a press briefing. Rep. Adam Schiff, who has grown increasingly critical of a chairman with whom he once worked in relative harmony, said he looks forward to viewing the documents at the “earliest opportunity.” Senate Intelligence leaders balked, asking for the documents to be sent to Capitol Hill instead. Thursday night brought another unsolved mystery. The Wall Street Journal reported that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn made an offer to Hill Intelligence panels and the FBI to testify in their probes into alleged Russian election interference in exchange for immunity. A House Intel spokesman said Flynn made no such offer to the committee to testify in exchange for immunity. A lawyer for Flynn said he sought protection from “unfair prosecution.” The Washington Post reported that the immunity idea might be a non-starter. Stay tuned.

SOME NEW DETAILS … — While Thursday’s Senate Intelligence hearing was light on bombshell revelations, it did fill in some more details about who the Russians may have targeted during the election. Most notably, Sen. Marco Rubio revealed that former members of his failed presidential bid have twice come under attack from possible Russian hackers. And during his testimony, King’s College professor Thomas Rid informed lawmakers that Moscow-backed digital intruders had also gone after America’s future top military officer, the current and former U.S. ambassadors to Russia and the leader of Russia’s largest opposition party. Rid explained that 12 of the 13 Americans who had their emails leaked during the election were hacked via a spearphishing operation, in which the hackers tricked their victims into entering their credentials at fake login portals. While Rid’s information came from ongoing research being conducted into the Russian election-year hacking campaign, the Rubio nugget appeared to drop out of nowhere. Clint Watts, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, mentioned Rubio had been targeted as part of Moscow's influence efforts during the presidential primary season. The remark — made during the morning session of the two-part hearing — seemed to surprise Rubio. The Florida Republican then came back during the afternoon session to explain that his former campaign staffers had been hit by two attacks. The first was in July, shortly after Rubio announced he would seek reelection to the Senate. And the second was on Wednesday. Both attempts were unsuccessful, according to Rubio. RUSSIA WASN’T THE ONLY TOPIC — Sen. Ron Wyden used his time during the Intelligence panel’s afternoon session to raise concerns about flaws in the worldwide mobile network that he said could be used to “hack, tap or track” personal cellphones. Rid acknowledged the technology — dubbed Signaling System No. 7, or SS7 — is “certainly a weak point and can be easily exploited, ultimately, because it is a trust-based system” that can be undermined by a single entity. He added that “if you use an encrypted app for your communications, then you most likely will defeat some of that vulnerability there.” Wyden, who is working with Rep. Ted Lieu to insist the government address the issue, said encryption “may not be enough” and pressed the FCC “off the dime, too,” because the agency has been “slow-walking” approaches that could provide cellphone users additional security. — AND LEST WE FORGET SURVEILLANCE — Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn asked former NSA chief Keith Alexander about the importance of the overseas digital spying programs covered by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which expires at the end of the year unless Congress reauthorizes it. “I think that’s the most important program that’s out there, especially in counterterrorism,” Alexander replied, citing the case of Najibullah Zazi, who was going to make a cross-country trek from Denver to New York City to attack the city’s subway system, but was detected by the snooping apparatus. “I think that’s the most effective counterterrorism program we have,” he told the panel. Alexander did concede, though, that officials “have to be more transparent” about these efforts. WE HAZ PROBE NOW? — The House Homeland Security Committee’s top Democrat is trying to use an obscure congressional tactic to help spark a second House probe of Russia’s alleged attempts to meddle in the U.S. presidential race. Rep. Bennie Thompson on Thursday introduced a so-called resolution of inquiry that would direct the Homeland Security Department to give his committee all memos, research and analysis related to Moscow-backed cyberattacks targeting the election. Such information would serve as a prelude for a Homeland Security panel examination of the digital interference campaign, Thompson said. So far, the Intelligence committees in both chambers have taken the lead on investigating Russia’s election-year behavior. But a partisan spat and accusations of White House interference have eroded lawmakers’ faith in the House Intelligence inquiry. “With the investigation in the House Intelligence Committee torpedoed by its chairman’s bizarre and inappropriate behavior, our committee must step up to the plate and get to the root of this debacle,” Thompson said in a statement. But the resolution (H. Res. 235) has little chance of passing. Congressional rules dictate that a resolution can be brought straight to the floor only if the relevant committee doesn’t act on the measure within 14 legislative days. If the committee does act, the Republican-controlled panel must approve the language. And House GOP leaders have consistently deferred to the Intelligence panels to lead the Russia probe. NTIA QUIETLY PLUGGING AWAY AT CYBER RESEARCH — The Commerce Department is ramping up its cyber work after a slow start during the Trump administration, officials said Thursday. Commerce runs two key cybersecurity programs through its National Telecommunications and Information Administration. “It’s been a little slower than we anticipated,” said Evelyn Remaley, deputy associate administrator for NTIA’s Office of Policy Analysis and Development, at a government cyber advisory board meeting run by the technical standards agency NIST. Remaley and her colleagues still don’t have a boss, but she said staffers are “still moving forward” with their two major programs. These little-known initiatives are among the government’s most important cyber projects. One program brings together the security researchers who hunt for bugs in commercial products, and the companies that are often rattled by their efforts to expose those bugs. NTIA’s goal is to develop a model vulnerability disclosure program that companies can adopt to reduce tensions with the researchers and improve product security. With its other multi-stakeholder process, focused on the security of internet-connected devices, NTIA hopes to make digital protections a key part of product design. The internet of things security project, the newer of the two, will convene its second in-person meeting in April, Remaley said. Its 40 contributors are split into four working groups. And members of the working groups plan to attend cyber events over the summer to seek feedback on their efforts, Remaley said. A DEEPER LOOK AT GORSUCH’S CYBER RECORD — Judge Neil Gorsuch’s rulings in computer crime cases suggests that Trump’s Supreme Court nominee has a deep knowledge of cyber issues, argues a contributor at the Lawfare national security blog. “He seems to respond to detailed, creative, and thorough lawyering — opting to engage fully with cyber issues when they are teed up accordingly,” wrote University of South Carolina law student Sarah Tate Chambers, in a recent post analyzing his rulings on child porn detection software and database reliability. In a subsequent post, published Thursday, Chambers noted Gorsuch’s insightful treatment of how the Fourth Amendment applies to digital searches. He “eloquently expresses concern about intrusive searches into computers,” she wrote of one June 2013 ruling, “recognizing that the vast array of information they may contain harkens back to several items the Fourth Amendment sought to secure: papers and effects.” Gorsuch decided the case a year before the Supreme Court issued its own landmark digital privacy ruling in Riley v.

Donahoe is taking the company’s helm after a break of a year and a half following his stint as CEO of eBay. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 31, 2017 at 6:00 am | UPDATED: March 31, 2017 at 10:25 am SANTA CLARA — John Donahoe is no stranger to the C-suite. After all, he held the chief executive job at consulting giant Bain & Co., and served as CEO at e-commerce leader eBay from 2008 until 2015. That he should take on another CEO role should come as no surprise. What was surprising, though, is that even after he was hired as the new CEO at cloud-based service-management software company ServiceNow, he still couldn’t get into the company gym. “I got here at 6 a.m. to use the gym for the first time, but my (building) card wouldn’t work,” Donahoe said, while laughing about the matter during an interview at ServiceNow’s Santa Clara headquarters. “I found someone in the parking lot and asked if they could let me in!” That person turned out to be ServiceNow investor relations director Dominic Phillips, who showed Donahoe how to fill out the proper release form online that soon let him into the gym. Technically, he wasn’t yet ServiceNow’s CEO. When he spoke with The Mercury News on March 20, he was still two weeks away from officially replacing CEO Frank Slootman. (Slootman is staying on as ServiceNow’s chairman of the board.) Donahoe discussed how his experience with running eBay will help him at an enterprise software maker, why ServiceNow is the right fit and what musician Van Morrison means to him. His comments have been edited for length and clarity. Q: So, what have you been doing between leaving eBay a year-and-a-half ago and joining ServiceNow? A:  When I left eBay, I committed to take a full year off. And my goal was to take no business meetings. I’m on several boards, so I did my board responsibilities. (Donahoe is on the board of directors at PayPal, Nike and the Bridgespan Group.) My wife and I recently became empty-nesters, so we traveled quite a bit. I did a 10-day silent Buddhist retreat. I followed my musical hero, Van Morrison, attending four different concerts. My first granddaughter was born, my first grandchild. I had what I would call “wisdom conversations” with about 30 to 40 people I really respected. We talked about how they’d handled transitions in their lives. What I am passionate about is, I love being part of organizations that help build-to-last companies that generally are purpose-driven, that contribute to their customers, their employees and their owners and to the communities where they operate. And as I came back after that year, one thing led to another, and here I am. Q: Was there anything in your background that led you to go on this wisdom journey? A: Any decision I make is an important one because I want it to be a five-to-10-year decision. I also think the best leaders, as well as the top performers, whether in athletics or any field, take their own development quite seriously. I’m a big sports fan, and I’ve always enjoyed watching world-class athletes, and one of the things that distinguishes them is how seriously they take investing in their own development and capabilities. I was inspired when I was young in my career by that notion of developing all of your capacities. Q: Can you tell a bit about how ServiceNow felt like it was the right place for you to be? A: I would almost characterize it as a falling-in-love process. EBay had been a (ServiceNow) customer, (so) I was familiar with the company, but not in a deep way. The way Frank (Slootman, ServiceNow’s outgoing CEO) described the performance of the company and the way it has very strong growth and is addressing a key customer need really stuck with me. In Frank’s tenure, ServiceNow has gone from $75 million in revenue to close to $2 billion this year. And now, we look at how to go from $2 billion to $5 billion to $10 billion. I’m excited about the opportunity, which I think is enormous. Q: The average person might not have heard of ServiceNow. If you were to meet someone on the street, how would you describe what the company does? A: Let me tell you how I think about it. ServiceNow helps a company’s technology work for them. It takes what’s complex and streamlines, simplifies and automates it so a company can focus on serving its customers and where they want to innovate and add value. We help companies take advantage of technology to allow them to operate more effectively, more efficiently, and focus on where they want to dedicate their time and energy. Q: Where do you see the challenges in the new environment, with ServiceNow and its competitors seeking out their stake in the marketplace? A: What’s striking to me is that the cloud is transforming how both consumers and companies can operate. In the consumer world — and I’ve seen this firsthand — cloud-based applications like eBay are transforming how we lead our lives. I think one of the challenges and opportunities for ServiceNow is how do you build what I would call consumer-like experiences for the employees of our customers. In many ways, enterprise and consumer are converging, so we need to ensure how our customers’ experiences are easy, intuitive and mobile-based. Q: Did you ever think, “What am I getting myself into?” by going from a company that’s in front of consumers to one that’s, for lack of a better term, in the backroom of a business? A: Obviously, consumer brands are going to be more visible than enterprise brands, but enterprise technology is no less important — you could argue it’s as, or more, important because it’s impacting the effectiveness of companies. And companies are the ones that create jobs and help people create their livelihoods. Being an essential technology partner to help companies do that more effectively is something that is very exciting. Q: You’ve said you’re a big fan of Van Morrison. Where you are in life now, how did the experience of seeing him recently differ from when you first saw him and felt a connection to his music and performance? A: He’s a genius. A creative genius. And while I love his songs as they are recorded, you see in concert where he will at times go on a riff and just go with what is in his heart and his soul. You just see him go into almost a trance, and I think you’re watching genius. You’re watching art being created. JOHN DONAHOE Age: 56. Occupation: CEO and President, ServiceNow. Education: Graduate of Dartmouth College and Stanford Graduate School of Business Family: Married to wife Eileen. Three sons, one daughter, one granddaughter. City of residence: Portola Valley.

IT strongly supports the growth of the banking sector, thereby enhancing the economic growth. Hyperscale data centers improve the competitive efficiency of the banking sector. The increasing adoption of hyperscale data center in BFSI application is expected to generate maximum revenue by 2022. In addition, in the manufacturing industry, huge amount of data is generated on the operation and shop floor, which can be analyzed to enhance the production practices.

Hyperscale data centers offer enterprises with higher data storage capacity, advanced servers, and faster computing capability as a result of which the enterprise segment is expected to be the fastest growing market, with a CAGR of 27.7% during the forecast period. Hyperscale data center is designed to offer a single, largely scalable compute architecture, which is developed from small, individual servers called nodes that offer computing, networking, and storage solutions. These nodes are grouped together and managed as a single entity. The main idea behind developing hyperscale architecture is to start with small infrastructure to keep the initial investments minimal. With increasing demand, new nodes can be added to the cluster to expand the initial infrastructure. Do Inquiry To Buy Report Of Hyperscale data centers Market @ http://www.marketresearchstore.com/report/world-hyperscale-data-center-market-opportunities-and-76258#InquiryForBuying Hyperscale data centers are largely adopted by key companies, such as Amazon and Google, thereby emerging as one of the fastest growing technology in the IT infrastructure world. In May 2015, Intel announced the launch of new Intel Xeon Processor, which securely processes and analyzes enormous volumes of data in the system memory. Efficiency is one of the key factors to be considered in a hyperscale data center, in addition to the design and layout of the facility. Designing is a very important factor as it helps to minimize the inefficiency at the rack, node, and facility level. Hyperscale data centers usually have compute nodes ranging from thousands to tens of thousands. In such a hyperscale data center, a small error in design can significantly increase the cost of computation. The other elements of the data center, such as power, HVAC, networking, and layout of racks, also affect its computation cost.

Safe Harbor Statement This press release contains express or implied forward-looking statements within the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other U.S. Federal securities laws. For example, the company is using forward-looking statements when we discuss Pluristem entering advanced stages of clinical development for its PLX products, leveraging Pluristem's wealth of intellectual property and innovation to bring Pluristem closer to global marketing for its products and that broadening Pluristem's expertise and experience at the senior-most level will enable Pluristem to deliver even better results and opportunities for the company, investors and the potentially many patients who can benefit from the company's therapies. These forward-looking statements and their implications are based on the current expectations of the management of Pluristem only, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: changes in technology and market requirements; the company may encounter delays or obstacles in launching and/or successfully completing its clinical trials; the company's products may not be approved by regulatory agencies, the company's technology may not be validated as it progresses further and its methods may not be accepted by the scientific community; the company may be unable to retain or attract key employees whose knowledge is essential to the development of its products; unforeseen scientific difficulties may develop with the company's process; the company's products may wind up being more expensive than the company anticipates; results in the laboratory may not translate to equally good results in real clinical settings; results of preclinical studies may not correlate with the results of human clinical trials; the company's patents may not be sufficient; the company's products may harm recipients; changes in legislation; inability to timely develop and introduce new technologies, products and applications; loss of market share and pressure on pricing resulting from competition, which could cause the actual results or performance of Pluristem to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise required by law, Pluristem undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Laminar Research announced this week that X-Plane 11 is now officially available. The system requirements are fairly stiff with needing a minimum of 8GB of system RAM and a DX11-class graphics card while recommending a system with 16~24GB of RAM and a GeForce GTX 1070 or similar graphics card. In regards to the Linux driver situation, they mention, "For Linux, we require the proprietary driver from AMD or NVIDIA to run X-Plane. You may be able to get X-Plane to run on the Mesa/Gallium driver with an Intel GPU, but this is unsupported. We absolutely do not support the fully open source drivers for AMD and NVIDIA." There is a demo available but otherwise the flight simulator costs $59.99 USD and is available on Steam for Linux. As a former pilot, I can't wait to try out X-Plane 11; I'll likely be doing so this weekend out of Linux driver curiosity if it really doesn't work with the open-source AMD driver or not. Also waiting to hear from Laminar to find out if X-Plane 11 will be benchmark friendly similar to the good testing abilities of X-Plane 9. 14 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

PUBLISHED : Friday, 31 March, 2017, 3:13pm UPDATED : Friday, 31 March, 2017, 9:13pm Comments:   Howard Yu Share PrintEmail Related topics Management Tesla Motoring Related Articles Companies Generational matters challenge managers 31 Mar 2017 Companies Can your managers manage change? 24 Mar 2017 Companies Managers must offer right mix of rewards to win customer loyalty 24 Mar 2017 Elon Musk has been known as a builder who loves to construct things. He builds Tesla cars that lure buyers from BMW, Maserati and Audi. He founded SpaceX, which manufactures and launches rockets and spacecraft. He opened the Gigafactory, which produces lithium-ion batteries, and will be the world’s second-largest plant after Boeing. He runs SolarCity, the largest solar energy services provider in America. A sceptic of artificial intelligence, Musk has long scoffed the idea of letting the powerful technology only be controlled by a small group of elite scientists or government bodies. He founded OpenAI, a billion-dollar non-profit, to work on safer artificial intelligence, as he once solemnly warned that artificial intelligence could be “potentially more dangerous than nukes”, and likened it to “summoning the demon”. On Monday this week, Musk launched yet another company called Neuralink, aiming to implant tiny electrodes in our brain to directly flash data to and from our consciousness. “Your phone and your computer are extensions of you, but the interface is through finger movements or speech, which are very slow,” Musk told the Vanity Fair. This is a bold response in the age of technological acceleration. Lately, scientists have begun to realise that there is no way that human can keep up with the advancement of artificial intelligence. Millions of years of natural evolution have endowed us with an outsized brain. We possess an unparalleled skill for language and the brilliance to coordinate complex activities, well enough to outcompete every other species on earth. But that natural evolution took eons. Meanwhile, the improvement of computing power, on average, has been doubling every 18 to 24 months. Intel has been delivering on that promise since the mid-60s, and has immortalised it in the name of the company’s co-founder: the Moore’s Law. That is why in recent successions, we saw IBM Watson beat human contestants on the game-show Jeopardy!, and then AlphaGo won the ancient board-game Go against the world champion Lee Se-dol. There is little doubt about whether machines will become smarter than humans. They will. The only dilemma is how humankind will respond. For Elon Musk, our carbon-based wet brain needs an upgrade. For investors at large, however, the most pressing question remains whether Elon Musk is stretching himself too thin. Has his family of companies diversified into too many unrelated businesses? In the ’70s, the idea of conglomerate discount gained rapid popularity among financial analysts. It was a time when private equity was in full swing. Big, lacklustre, publicly listed companies were taken over one by one, often unwillingly, by activist investors. They streamlined, split, and diced the newly acquired companies into simpler, leaner and smaller descendants, with each focusing on fewer businesses. With sweeping changes of top management teams and through the use of highly incentivised compensation, many of the companies were reborn agile and regained market leadership in their own right, and in the process, unlocked shareholder value. That wave of leverage buyouts, hostile takeovers, and divestment proved to be so powerful that the idea that complicated businesses are always bad took root in all financial analyses. Other than exceptions like GE and Johnson & Johnson, companies that don’t have a narrow focus are punished with a discount on their stock price. If Wall Street analysts can’t pigeonhole a company, it is probably a bad company, so the thinking goes. Tesla is valued at more than US$45 billion, worth more than Nissan Motor, and only a few billion shy of the reigning queen of Detroit: Ford Motor To be sure, Tesla is not exactly a conglomerate, as SpaceX and Neuralink are operating as separate entities. But within Tesla, as a carmaker, the scope of its operation is bewilderingly wide compared to General Motors, Ford or Toyota. As of November 2016, Tesla’s market share in cars and light trucks was a tiny 0.3 per cent. During the year, some 76,000 vehicles rolled out of the factory. Ford’s F-Series alone sold 780,000 units in 2015. And yet, at Tesla’s Palo Alto headquarters, visitors can marvel at the myriads of manufacturing activities that the company carried out in-house, including operations that a traditional carmaker would outsource for reasons of staying focused. Although the batteries inside a Model S might resemble those found in a laptop, Tesla sought to master battery chemistry first-hand. Its Gigafactory in Nevada is set to produce batteries at a scale that far exceed the current capacity of today’s global supply chain, ready to drive down production costs to a level the world has not yet seen. SolarCity, a seemingly unrelated manufacturer of solar panels, was also merged into Tesla in November last year. And the financial markets love it. Tesla’s stock has risen more than 40 per cent over the last four months. The company is valued at more than US$45 billion, worth more than Nissan Motor, and only a few billion shy of the reigning queen of Detroit: Ford Motor. All this means that the conventional wisdom that a company should focus on existing core competencies or current business lines in order to achieve a stock premium looks downright ludicrous. Kodak did have a singular focus and look what happened to it. And one can theoretically argue that Tesla is enjoying a conglomerate premium rather than a discount, precisely because it is building critical capabilities to reinvent a century old industry. The mastery of energy storage in car batteries or at home, energy generation by solar cells, and an energy delivery system via superchargers are arguably keystones to upgrading our current mobility system. Only with a combination of these critical capabilities can we hold out hope of creating sustainable transport that can power the 21st century. Where Tesla would persist in operations is where the current supply chain underperforms, turning in-house control of component parts into a real advantage. In the today’s era of abundant cash and capital, managers must therefore ask themselves: ● To what extent are we committed to new capabilities critical to future success? ● As a thought experiment, imagine Elon Musk were to enter your industry, what would he do differently? And if Musk’s Neuralink does materialise, we may one day summon a Tesla by mere thought. Now that’s autopilot for real.

Michael Flynn’s Testimony May Have Trump Ready To Quit Politics 3.3k 0 0 March 31, 2017 Donald Trump To Resign? Michael Flynn’s Testimony May Have Trump Ready To Quit Nathan Francis Donald Trump is reportedly considering resigning the presidency after reports that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has offered to testify about allegations that the Trump campaign worked with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. Flynn offered to be interviewed by the FBI and Congress in exchange for immunity, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. In a statement released later, Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, confirmed that Flynn had reached out to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, which are operating parallel investigations into the alleged Russian interference. “General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it,” Kelner wrote in the statement. The offer appears to carry even more weight given Flynn’s previous statements regarding Hillary Clinton’s investigation. Intel Dem on Flynn: "Innocent people don't seek immunity" https://t.co/doWvlf3prH pic.twitter.com/tfY3212a0E — The Hill (@thehill) March 31, 2017 “When you are given immunity that means you’ve probably committed a crime,” Flynn said in September in an interview with NBC. There have been reports circulating for months that Trump was working closely with Russian intelligence officials, and the allegations were laid out in a dossier compiled by a former British MI6 agent. The report claimed that Russian officials had worked for many years to cultivate Donald Trump as a candidate, compiling embarrassing information to use as blackmail while also offering lucrative financial deals for Trump. The dossier alleged that Trump struck a deal to lessen sanctions on Russia in exchange for help taking down Hillary Clinton. That help allegedly came in the form of emails from Clinton’s campaign leader and the Democratic National Committee, stolen by Russian hackers and published through WikiLeaks. Flynn had already been taking down for his connections to Russia. The national security adviser served just three weeks before resigning for reportedly lying to Vice President Mike Pence about contact with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. Dem lawmaker on Flynn immunity request: "Where theres smoke, there's fire" https://t.co/dHVtfhigmo pic.twitter.com/vUvTbnVj1r — The Hill (@thehill) March 31, 2017 Flynn has other connections to Russia, NBC News noted. “Flynn was paid $45,000 plus expenses to speak at the 10th anniversary gala of the RT television network in Moscow in December 2015, while he was already an advisor to Trump. The U.S. considers RT, which is state-sponsored, to be a propaganda outlet.” Now a number of sources have claimed that Donald Trump is considering resignation amid the growing Russia scandal and potentially damaging testimony from Flynn. Within an hour of the news of Flynn’s testimony offer breaking, a former U.S. military officials and “hacktivist” known as The Jester cited sources claiming that Trump was considering all options, including resignation. #FLASH A previously reliable source says they have 2 further sources stating Trump is "considering his options, including resignation". — JΞSŦΞR ✪ ΔCŦUAL³³º¹ (@th3j35t3r) March 31, 2017 While he has not put his real name to his work, The Jester reportedly has close contacts throughout the intelligence community and has a strong track record with his predictions. And others have also claimed that Donald Trump is considering resigning. Claude Taylor, a former White House staffer under Bill Clinton, also reported that Trump may be planning to resign with a deal to receive a pardon from Mike Pence. An ind journalist I have worked with-who has been reliable-says they have 2 sources that say Trump is considering options-incl resignation. — Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) March 31, 2017 If Trump does chose to resign-he'll do it with pardon deal in place and before he's charged. Also likely to throw in dementia diagnosis imo. — Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) March 31, 2017 While the rumors of Donald Trump’s plans to resign are relegated to Twitter for now, the reports seem to offer a new perspective to a strange and somewhat telling statement made this week by Senator Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Speaking to a group of activists asking why she and Democrats were not doing more to press on the Russia investigation and force Trump out of office, Feinstein hinted that she may have inside information that Trump may be planning to resign. “We have a lot of people looking into this,” she said. “I think he’s going to get himself out.” While the rumors that Donald Trump may resign are circulating online, the White House has continued to deny any collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential election.

This is significant, because it shows Nunes may have had White House help in his ham-handed efforts to buttress (sort of) Trump’s false claim that former President Obama wiretapped his phones, and later, after admitting that didn’t happen, that Trump and associates were subject to U.S. surveillance. Nunes apparently cited the info he’d been given to suggest that Trump may have been wiretapped, though he later backed off of that assertion. If the White House provided that info, it adds to the case that Nunes is functioning as a defender of Trump rather than exercising oversight, by running his committee’s probe into Russian meddling and possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Meanwhile, another big story is unfolding: Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is running its own probe, are beginning to treat this matter with the seriousness it demands — particularly since it is now becoming apparent that the House probe is devolving into absurdity. Indeed, a Senate Intel Committee hearing Thursday on Russian interference revealed some genuinely new — and stunning — information. It should worry Republicans just as much as Democrats — particularly the Republicans who continue to back Trump and Nunes. Here’s what happened. In a remarkable moment, one key witness, Clinton Watts, a senior fellow at the George Washington Center for Cyber and Homeland Security, bluntly informed Sen. Marco Rubio, who serves on the Intelligence Committee, that as one of Trump’s presidential primary opponents, Rubio “suffered from” Russian disinformation efforts. (Although Watts wasn’t specific about those efforts, later in the day Rubio charged that Russian hackers have conducted unsuccessful cyber attacks on his former presidential campaign staffers.) According to Watts (who was backed up by other witnesses who testified), the Russians have been using “active measures,” which are built on propaganda tactics that date back to Soviet times, to spread disinformation, fear, confusion, and chaos in multiple democratic countries, including the United States. These efforts include the use of visible Kremlin propaganda outlets, such as RT and Sputnik, to publish false news stories and conspiracy theories. Russian actors then deploy social media bots to spread these false stories far and wide. In the U.S., Watts said, the goal has been to provoke the Trump into repeating them or retweeting them to his millions of followers. In a moment that stunned the hearing room, Watts flatly stated that the president himself has become a cog in such Russian measures. When asked by Oklahoma Republican James Lankford, who appeared visibly dismayed, why, if Russians have long used these methods, they finally worked in this election cycle, Watts’ answer was extraordinary. “I think this answer is very simple and is one no one is really saying in this room,” he said. Part of the reason, he went on, “is the commander in chief has used Russian active measures at times against his opponents.” To buttress the claim that Trump (unwittingly or not) aided Russian disinformation efforts, Watts cited several instances. Among them: Trump’s citation of an apparently false Sputnik story at an October 2016 campaign appearance; his ongoing denial before and after the campaign of U.S. intelligence of Russian interference in the election; his claims of voter fraud and election rigging, which Watts said was pushed by RT and Sputnik; and Trump’s questioning of the citizenship of former President Barack Obama and even his primary rival Ted Cruz. Watts added that one of the reasons such tactics are working is that Trump and/or his surrogates have repeated some of the claims, further spreading them through social media accounts that are owned both by real people and bots. Thus, the disinformation is kept alive and gradually becomes more real and plausible. “Part of the reason active measures work is because they parrot the same lines,” Watts said. Republicans on the committee Thursday seemed to be grappling with the enormity of what this could mean — and, crucially, that this threat should not be seen through a partisan prism. Rubio questioned Watts about a series of such false news stories and hoaxes, including claims that a thousand Muslims had burned down the oldest church in Germany while shouting “Allahu Akbar,” that migrants had raped a German girl, and that the European Union planned to ban snowmen as racist. (If you’ve ever spent time on alt-right social media, there’s a familiar ring to these stories: they are exactly the sort of thing that gets spread and recycled, and reverberate as supposed evidence of the nefariousness of say, Muslims, or the overreach of “political correctness.”) Rubio seemed to suggest that he sees these tactics as intended to divide Americans from one another. “Aren’t we in the midst of a blitzkrieg, for lack of a better term, of informational warfare conducted by Russian trolls, under the command of Vladimir Putin,” Rubio asked, that is designed to divide Americans “politically, socioeconomically, demographically, and the like?” Watts confirmed that one of the aims of Russian active measures is to “play on ethnic divisions.” It’s not clear yet how much significance these revelations have, if any, to the ongoing probe into possible Russian-Trump campaign collusion. But the gravity of Thursday’s hearing — combined with the New York Times revelations — may prod Senate Republicans into stepping up, particularly to fill the vacuum caused by Nunes’ plummeting credibility.

Why Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) Stock Can’t Climb Out of This Hole View All Posts Last week, chipmaker — and graphics processing specialist — Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) unveiled some encouraging but perhaps unusual news. That is, Chinese internet powerhouse Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTCMKTS:TCTZF) has selected Nvidia as the provider of its core hardware needed to make Tencent’s artificial intelligence ambitions a reality. Source: Shutterstock It was odd, simply because that’s not what Nvidia does. A more conventional computer processor and chipset name like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) or Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) would make more sense serving as the backbone for a new AI system. Thing is, this isn’t the first time owners of NVDA stock have heard of the company’s hardware being selected as the centerpiece of an artificial intelligence system. Just two weeks ago, Nvidia was tapped by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to power the next generation of its AI offering. What gives? As it turns out, traditional computer processors like Intel’s Core and Pentium CPUs or AMD’s Ryzen aren’t necessarily best-suited for the ultra-high-speed processing needs the rise of AI has created. Investors — and not just NVDA stock holders — would be wise to note the nuance, as AI is expected to become a $16 billion market by 2022, and grow to $36 billion by 2025. GPU Technology vs. CPU Technology Historically, while the hardware and firmware supporting a computer’s (or laptop’s) display screen was a key part of its performance, a device’s heart and soul was its processor, or CPU. It operates… well, everything at blazing fast speed, with more RAM (memory) helping out. The graphics processing unit, or GPU, wasn’t a dealmaker or a dealbreaker. As computers have become faster and more powerful, though, and performance expectations have swelled, GPUs have become very, very impressive, in many cases fully taking on the display-management role that was otherwise taken on by the CPU. Indeed, a GPU is some4thing of a mini-computer in itself… … and they’re very, very fast. That makes them perfect for high-speed artificial intelligence applications, where the quantity of computations is more important than the depth or complexity of those computations.

(MU) Stock Is Only Getting Started Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK) Stock Is Doing Everything Right Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock May Be Healthy for Long-Term Investors View All Posts The entire semiconductor sector is on a roll. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector (NASDAQ:SOX) started March at 985 and has already flown above the 1,000 level thanks to product launches from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and a solid quarterly earnings report from Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). Source: AMD Only Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands out as the underperformer in this market. The takeover of Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) for $15 billion will add risks for shareholders, as integrating such a big company will be fraught with uncertainties. Investors should stick with what they know best: Advanced Micro Devices’ CPU refresh, with the Ryzen 7 and the Ryzen 5 next, holds big promise for AMD stock. And as much as that promise seems priced in … it’s not. Ryzen 5 Targets the Mainstream Market The Ryzen 7 CPU, rebuilt from the bottom up, will compete with some of Intel’s high-end chips, including the i7 processor. AMD is targeting enthusiasts here, so the chip is still at the high end. Still, at least one outlet cut the price of Ryzen to 1700X to $370. As the price falls, AMD should be able to gobble up more share. Ryzen 5 targets a different market than the 7, however. Retailers are apparently releasing the chip weeks ahead of schedule, and at a price range that won’t cramp the ol’ wallet. On April 11, AMD will officially announce four Ryzen 5 chips: the 1400, 1500x, 1600 and 1600X. The chips will range from 4-cores to 6-cores and will cost just $169 to $249. At that price point, Intel’s budget i3 chip and Pentium chips will look laughably expensive. Ryzen 5 offers between 8 and 12 threads, which is up to three times more than that offered on the G-series Pentium processors. The high-end Ryzen 5 chips will compete with Intel’s i5 7600K, since the former costs just $10 more. AMD Stock: Growth, But With Risks Ryzen 7 must win PC enthusiasts now. The more gamers that use AMD chips, the faster that game developers will optimize the software to work efficiently on Ryzen. Meanwhile, Ryzen 5 must win the OEM and PC manufacturing orders. Big companies like Dell, HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) and Lenovo could give shelf space to AMD-based computers and laptops. If that happens, AMD will be chewing market share from Intel on a couple of fronts. Also, Polaris-based graphics cards can help AMD win back some market share from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Photo credit Susanna Frohman, San Jose Mercury News. Bay Area philanthropists Gordon and Betty Moore have given Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford $50 million toward patient care and advance research for children with heart disease, the hospital announced on Tuesday, March 28. The Moores' private donation is the largest gift from an individual to Packard Children's Hospital since its founding gift from David and Lucile Packard, the hospital said in a statement. The hospital will rename its Children's Heart Center the Betty Irene Moore Children's Heart Center in honor of the gift. The donation provides funding for clinical and research facilities, an endowment for the center's highest strategic priorities and endowed positions for faculty to lead specialized care and research, the hospital said. Gordon Moore is co-founder of Intel Corporation. He and his wife, Betty, are founders of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, which funds research in the sciences, environment, health and education. Long-time supporters of Packard Children's Hospital, the couple previously made gifts to the hospital's 521,000-square-foot expansion, which is now nearing completion this year. The Moores decided to make the $50 million gift after their grandchild was helped by care from the heart center. "Our grandchild had lifesaving surgery at the hospital, and we would like to help make sure the capability is there for others," Gordon Moore said. The heart center has gained recognition as a national and international destination for highly specialized surgical procedures, including many that are among the most challenging and complex cardiovascular cases. The center receives more than 25,000 patient visits annually and performs 80 to 90 percent of all cardiac surgical care for children in northern and central California, according to the hospital. Pediatric heart surgeon Dr. Frank Hanley is executive director of the Betty Irene Moore Children's Heart Center. The Moores' gift comes at a critical point in pediatric cardiovascular care in that it will help physicians advance beyond surgical repair that is not a cure for disease to discovering treatments that could ultimately lead to true cures, he said. Currently many patients require multiple surgeries and repairs throughout their lifetimes that can interfere with their quality of life, according to the hospital. "We imagine a day when a child born with a poorly working aortic valve, rather than undergoing multiple open-heart operations throughout his lifetime, instead receives a replacement valve engineered from his own stem cells," he said. The Moores' gift will allow the heart center to build a robust research program aimed at improving the treatment and prevention of congenital and acquired heart conditions, including adult congenital heart disease. The Center will also expand its clinical facilities, including a newly designed outpatient center in the coming years, the hospital said.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News Mercury Systems Launches First Model in Secure Rack Server Product Line Printer-friendly version Built-in System Security on Dual Intel Xeon Platform Enables Forward Deployment ANDOVER, Mass. – March 30, 2017 – Mercury Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRCY, www.mrcy.com), announced that it has launched the Ensemble® HDS9624 Secure Rack Server to address the need for rack servers with system security features that can be forward deployed or sold to allies under Foreign Military Sales (FMS) or Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) programs. In addition to the unique security features, Mercury’s new product line is the only rack server that includes both ruggedization and a fully trusted supply chain for both hardware and software. Rack servers deployed for missions in wide-body aircraft, ships, submarines, or ground stations need to be secure, trusted, and rugged. Security comes through system security features that deter reverse engineering. Mercury provides these security features as a turnkey solution or as a customer-private, customizable portfolio of techniques. Trust comes through DMEA accredited design, manufacturing, and testing by US personnel in US facilities that minimize the risk of backdoors, counterfeits, and trojans. The board support package, BIOS, and network stack are designed by US personnel and are available for inspection by government agencies. Ruggedness is delivered by applying ANSI/VITA 48.7 Air Flow-By™ mechanical and cooling techniques to a standard ATX-based server form factor. Together, the system security features and trusted supply chain of the Secure Rack Server are designed to help system integrators meet U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) instruction 5200.44 “Protection of Mission Critical Functions to Achieve Trusted Systems and Networks.” “Until now, system security engineering requirements have challenged the rack server form factor, requiring untenable tradeoffs in affordability and system architecture,” said Scott Orton, Vice President of Mercury’s Secure Processing Solutions group. “As a result, many programs were not able to optimize Critical Program Information protection while maintaining the affordability and performance advantages of the rack server form factor. Mercury’s Secure Rack Server product line provides an affordable solution across system security levels.” The HDS9624 Secure Rack Server is an ATX-class server with two 10-core Intel® Xeon® E5 v4 processors with a cache-coherent memory pool running a single SMP operating system across all cores in both processors. The design of the HDS9624 server is optimized for both memory bandwidth and I/O bandwidth, resulting in a high-performance server architecture that can be used for sensor processing as well as mission computing. Because the HDS9624 server is based on standard server designs, it benefits from the full software ecosystem for networking, storage, and data center applications. For portability and isolation in a secure setting, the HDS9624 server has options for secure virtualization and a secure hypervisor. Mercury’s Secure Rack Server product line is designed to address concerns about Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) in the use of commercial servers. Unlike traditional servers that typically are available for only 3 years, Mercury’s Secure Rack Servers offer 10+ years of supply longevity. A demonstration of Mercury’s Secure Rack Server can be seen at the Navy League’s Sea-Air-Space Exposition in booth #1724. For more information on the HDS9624 Secure Rack Server, visit www.mrcy.com/secureserver/ or contact Mercury at (866) 627-6951 or info@mrcy.com. Mercury Systems – Innovation That Matters™  Mercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY) is a leading commercial provider of secure sensor and mission processing subsystems. Optimized for customer and mission success, Mercury’s solutions power a wide variety of critical defense and intelligence programs. Headquartered in Andover, Mass., Mercury is pioneering a next-generation defense electronics business model specifically designed to meet the industry’s current and emerging technology needs.

Numerous emerging technologies promise to further "tech up" the consumer and industrial spaces. This dynamic has led to increasingly strong sales in the semiconductor industry.  Projected 2017 revenue is nearly $354 billion. Image source: Statista. As to NVIDIA's specific business, the company operates in two main segments: graphics processing units (GPUs) and Tegra processors. In fiscal 2017, these businesses accounted for 84.3% and 11.9% of total revenue, respectively. (There's also a small "other" category.) NVIDIA's flagship GPU segment's main processor product lines include the GeForce for gaming, Quadro for design professionals, and Tesla for cloud computing. The segment also includes the NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2, a scalable artificial intelligence (AI) computing platform for driverless vehicles. End markets for the Tegra business, which produces processors that integrate a computer onto a single chip, are things that are mobile -- from consumer gadgets to autos and drones. The company's four core market platforms are computer gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. 2. It's led by a founder-CEO  NVIDIA gets high marks on leadership. CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is a co-founder of the company, so he knows it intimately. He also has a lot of skin in the game: he owned 1,751,179 million NVIDIA shares as of March 15, valued at $191.6 million based on Thursday's closing price of $109.40 per share. Huang, who has a master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford, worked as a microprocessor designer at Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, before founding NVIDIA in 1993. Huang gets a thumbs up from 98% of the 588 Glassdoor ratings from current or former employees, with the company itself garnering 4.3 stars (out of a total of 5). Huang is 54 years old, so investors probably don't need to be concerned that he'll retire soon. In early March, the first batch of what NVIDIA touts as its most powerful GeForce card ever, the $700 GTX 1080 Ti, sold out in 30 minutes, even with a two-card-per-customer limit.

In the calendar fourth quarter of 2016, NVIDIA held a 70.5% share of the market for discreet GPUs, with competitor AMD holding a 29.5% share, according to industry monitoring and analysis firm Jon Peddie Research.  4. Its financial performance proves it can execute Data by YCharts. In fiscal 2017, which ended Jan. 29, NVIDIA's year-over-year revenue grew 38% to $6.91 billion, earnings per share based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) soared 138% to $2.57, adjusted EPS jumped 83% to $3.06, and free cash flow rose 37.6% to $1.50 billion. Both segments grew, with GPU revenue increasing 39% to $5.82 billion and Tegra revenue rising 47% to $824 million. (There was $264 million of "other" revenue.) NVIDIA's powerful growth in fiscal 2017 is especially impressive because it's a good-sized company with a market cap of $64 billion.  5. It's been whipping Wall Street's estimates In the last two quarters, NVIDIA smashed Wall Street's EPS estimates by 46% (Q3) and 19% (Q4). This supports the belief among some, myself included, that analysts' future estimates will also prove too conservative. If this premise proves true, the stock's valuation may not be as pricey as it seems at first glance. Image source: Getty Images. 6. Its great performance in its core computer gaming market Market Platform                           Fiscal 2017 Revenue                  Year-Over-Year Change                 Computer gaming    $4.06 billion (58.8% of total revenue)  44%  Data source: NVIDIA.  The company predicts continued solid growth in its core gaming market due to growth drivers like VR, eSports, and the adoption of broadband in emerging markets.  7. Its phenomenon growth in its data center and auto markets Market Platform                           Fiscal 2017 Revenue                  Year-Over-Year Change                 Data centers   $830 million (12% of total revenue)  145%  Automotive $487 billion (7% of total revenue)  52% Data source: NVIDIA.  8. Its explosive growth opportunities  Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA's products have applications in numerous hot tech spaces that are widely projected to explode in the years and decades ahead, including virtual reality, artificial intelligence, driverless cars, and cloud computing. (There's some overlap in these categories, as driverless cars and cloud computing are AI-driven apps.)  Laying out NVIDIA's current market sizes with the company's estimated total addressable market (TAM) sizes -- the annual revenue opportunity available for it to capture -- we can clearly see its phenomenal growth opportunities:  Market  NVIDIA's Market Size in Fiscal 2017*   Total Addressable Market (TAM)**   Gaming  $4.06 billion  $20 billion   Professional visualization (includes virtual reality and augmented reality)  $835 million  $6.5 billion   Data center $830 million  $5.0 bilion   Auto  $437 million  $8.0 billion  Data sources: *NVIDIA's fiscal 2017 earnings report; **NVIDIA's Sept. 2015 Corporate Presentation. NVIDIA's customer and partner list reads like a Who's Who of the corporate world. Here's just one example of its growth opportunities: Tesla Motors has long used NVIDIA's Tegra processors to power its vehicles' standout infotainment systems and instrument clusters. In October, Tesla began using NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 AI-computing platform to power its Autopilot on all new Model S and Model X vehicles. The more affordable Model 3, slated for release later this year, will be similarly equipped. This isn't to say NVIDIA's road to growth in its various markets will be speed bump free. Tesla, for instance, had been working with Israeli company Mobileye on its Autopilot efforts before the companies' ugly public parting. In mid-March, chip giant Intel announced a $15.3 deal to buy Mobileye, so NVIDIA is in for some stiffer competition in the emerging driverless car market. 9. Its commitment to shareholders NVIDIA's commitment to returning value to shareholders is evidenced by its dividend and stock buyback programs.   Data by YCharts. It's quite rare for fast-growing tech companies that have considerable growth opportunities to pay dividends. Granted, NVIDIA's dividend is modest, with a current yield of 0.52%. However, the dividend has grown 56% in approximately three years. The fact that NVIDIA pays a dividend at all suggests that management is extremely confident of the company's continued success and resultant strong FCF.  NVIDIA has been actively buying back its stock, which suggests that management doesn't view the stock as overvalued, or at least not significantly so. In fiscal 2017, NVIDIA spent $739 million on share repurchases and paid $261 million in dividends, so it returned a total of $1.0 billion to shareholders. Since the restart of its capital return program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, it's returned $4.02 billion to shareholders, representing 88% of its cumulative FCF for this four-year period.  10. Its valuation is palatable given its growth potential Data by YCharts. NVIDIA stock's absolute valuations are high. At Tuesday's closing price of $107.30, it is trading at 42.4 times trailing-12-month earnings, 46.2 times trailing free cash flow, and 32.8 times projected forward earnings. However, when we bring growth into the equation, the stock's valuation is more palatable. The forward PEG (P/E to forward projected earnings growth) of 1.18 is pricey, but far from outrageously so. Many factors come into play, but a rough rule of thumb is that a PEG of 1.0 implies that a stock is about fairly valued. Moreover, if you believe that analysts' forward earnings estimates are too conservative, then this PEG would be overstated.  Summing it up Huang's statement in NVIDIA's Q4 earnings release provides a great summary of what I believe to be the primary bull case for NVIDIA stock: Our GPU computing platform is enjoying rapid adoption in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles.‎ Deep learning on NVIDIA GPUs, a breakthrough approach to AI, is helping to tackle challenges such as self-driving cars, early cancer detection and weather prediction. We can now see that ‎GPU-based deep learning will revolutionize major industries, from consumer internet and transportation to healthcare and manufacturing.  Beth McKenna has no position in any stocks mentioned.

I welcome people to also come back in the future and restart the thread with new news and parts. The thread is about how to make the maximal PC processing systems to handle complete work flows realtime going into the future, particularly 8k and above. I'm gong to kick off with some unconventional hardware and configurations. Any companies that would like to sponsor this effort by doing workstations, plug ins drivers and updated applications to take advantage of these configurations in the background off site are welcome, remembering if you want to be involved in the thread at all you have to strictly seek Redusers administration's official permission first, as are their rules. As this is not their initiative, they are under no obligation to allow any company to post here. Any outside system builder enthusiast should also seek their permission too. These objectives are open to other top end uses as well, such as 3D and simulation/engineering/scientific uses, which hopefully will be complimentary, but establish a business case to service this sector. I expect Red will progressively move towards 16k for rendering purposes of 8k footage, but there has long been developed 16k holographic filming technology, that needs to move far beyond that to achieve 8k resolution. Plus, advertisers need to move far beyond that again for street level billboards and video billboards. Touch table products are in need of 16k or more for work spaces. Start While I am pursuing the highest performance system, I am hopeful of also being able to get a better system than today with cheaper half priced parts. I am looking at systems past single CPUs, even single main boards, and separately beyond the twin GPU configurations. Processing farm: So, I have heard of rack systems, where each blade may contain many individual computer modules in a blade, and you keep stacking blades. As well are rack systems full of many GPU's. Another option is just to string PC's together. I understand that large data sets ate ideal for these sorts of parallel and processing farm like solutions, but our software is not usually written to distribute the workload across many threads or PC's. I understand that the usual parts used here (we don't need to use them) are not optimised for workstation use, but can properly written software out do our present top of the line systems on these parallel processing configurations? Enabling software: What sort of plugins, drivers can be written to enable existing software to use these systems (and which software allows this). How would a company write (the technology to do) such plug ins and drivers, or even software to do this. These answer are not simple yes or no answers, but complex and justifiable. We currently are seeing single socket 36 core AND processor systems. How useful. The future Linux, Windows and undoubtedly the Mac, are moving towards ARM. ARM is moving towards higher performance for server space. Some ARM systems like the Apple A11 and Nvidia CUDA GPU enabled Tegras offer much higher processing densities and lower energy consumption, but at the moment a lot lower single thread performance. However they are a reasonable candidate for above 5Ghz implementations, but just gave not received performance implementations at such speeds. These can be integrated into massive processing systems on a 1KW budget, even 200w, as a single cheap old Mosis compares favourably at 10watts of more with an i3 in Linux, plus it has an CUDA array. Intel alphas Phi, and a desire to integrate that with normal processing functionality. The Phi currently is like a mini processing farm. Opencore RiscV processor us aimed at being more efficient than past Each, including ARM, and has attracted so lot of industry attention. We will soon probably face mass arrays boards of these. At the moment Linux programs are probably best poised to take advantage of these configurations, with even x86 binary to arm transliteration software modules available to run x86 Linux binary, and others to run windows. Apart from old ARM parallel processing requiring more careful programming (new r Ella cemented has already been announced, and new processing architecture to be announced latter in the year) how suitable might these be give the software? WPU cards: Finally, a plea to the manufacturers. GPU's have a lot of circuitry that is not needed for non 3D display/Game heavy processing purposes. While every PC might have a GPU configuration for display purposes, it would be desirable to have cards stripped of these excess parts with the freedom up space dedicated to higher processing densities for custom, cuda, other code, alongside the GPU, a Workstation Processing unit (WPU). As such, these cards with the exiting of an ARM, or other, section for control, could act as a parallel processing computer board that could be further turned around and used on a card in a blade back plane. A new high density processing platform: A previous proposal of mine was for a blade system with an optical bus back plane linking inserted rows processing cards (like PC's, GPU's or WPU's) card to cats, or through a control card, and optical links from rack to rack to rack. Using standard high speed optical technology this far exceeds the performance of PCI-e, and rather than a contact protocol is meant to be a donkey maximum speed low latency parallel protocol. This also fits in a lot with the idea of present rack with computer modules, useful for cooling cards in blade systems. There you go, some useful ideas. Knowledgeable people will already know a lot more than me about the blade modular systems. Since when has denying that the possible is possible been reason? Such is the life of some skepticism. Normalcy involves what is realistically possible, not just what you say. Inferiorly superior (humbleness) rather than superiorly inferior (arrogance). - Reputation is something the unwise apply. But integrity is what the wise apply.     Quick Navigation Post-Production HARDWARE Top Site Areas Settings Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home Forums Red Digital Cinema Recon NAB 2016 DRAGON WEAPON RAVEN RED DISCUSSION Crucial Ordnance EPIC-M OWNERS The DSMC System EPIC RED ONE SCARLET REDLINK DEVELOPERS .

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 April 2017 by Military News ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Our vision is to enable affordable microelectronics that improve the quality of life. To achieve this, our mission is to invent, develop, manufacture and service advanced technology for high-tech lithography, metrology and software solutions for the semiconductor industry.

About Future Resources Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Morro Data Accelerates Cloud with Cache and Sync Morro Data Accelerates Cloud with Cache and Sync Posted on March 31, 2017 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Leadership is an overused word, and is often misused. We like this definition. Using Morro Data, SMBs can easily sync, share, transfer and save unstructured files across sites, between business partners and into cloud storage. (PRWEB) March 31, 2017 MORRO DATA ACCELERATES CLOUD WITH CACHE AND SYNC Files Are Stored in the Cloud, Cached Locally, and Synced Globally Morro Systems an innovator in file transfer and storage solutions for SMBs has launched its Morro Data Cached Cloud Service. Using Morro Data, SMBs can easily sync, share, transfer and save unstructured files across sites, between business partners and into cloud storage. Media and Entertainment, Biotech, Design houses, and others generate large workflow files that must be stored safely and distributed both internally and externally to clients. Big Data is here and files are getting larger. With the Morro Data Cached Cloud-on-LAN file access experience, users enjoy a familiar drive letter interface. File sync and cloud storage becomes a simple drag-and-drop operation, eliminating time consuming uploads and bypassing PC storage limitations. "We're delighted to be partnering with Morro Data and have tested axle 2017 with the CacheDrive, with excellent results," said Sam Bogoch, CEO of axle Video, the leading vendor of affordable media management software. "We believe this solution offers powerful new capabilities for video teams who have to edit and review media at multiple locations. Before this, synchronizing files at 2 or more locations would have taken complex and sophisticated tools, or a lot of manual effort.  Morro makes it easy, with familiar network-volume shares for each site." “What is good for enterprise is also beneficial for small and medium businesses. However, the same technology needs to be redesigned to be more user friendly, more affordable, and more integrated,” said Paul Tien / Founder & CEO of Morro Systems. "We designed the Morro Cloud and associated CacheDrive device using our innovative xCache O/S and Morro Sync Engine technology, to vaporize drives into the cloud while keeping high performance through a local cache. Small and Medium Business can now also experience the benefits of cloud storage and convenient file transfer with a Fast, Simple and Affordable solution." Morro Data solution benefits include: Convenient File Transfer, Sync and Share: Large files uploads require FTP which is manually intensive and error prone. Cloud Storage apps require the PC to be active and use limited drive space. With Morro Data CacheDrive, file transfer, sync and share is as easy and quick as drag-and-drop. Affordability: With no per-user fees, Morro Data is more cost effective and encourages adoption across the company instead of islanding users to reduce charges. CacheDrive also saves on internet bandwidth charges while the Global File System eliminates the need for complex VPNs to share data securely. Internet Bandwidth Optimization: With Cached Cloud, files only need to be transmitted once per location with all users in that location accessing the locally cached copy. The Morro sync technology ensures files are fully deduped saving on repeat transmissions. Global File System, VPN Elimination: The Morro Data Global File System single namespace means all users see all permitted files irrespective of location, and there is only one authoritative version per file. Files saved in one location are available to all, while permission controls provide fine grain data security. IT managers can eliminate complex VPN setup, enhancing group productivity and user satisfaction. Intuitive and Centralized Management: The Morro Cloud Manager improves IT manager productivity, through centralized management of the worldwide deployment and enhanced performance and usage metrics. IT Productivity: With the CacheDrive, IT Managers are freed from time consuming NAS maintenance, risk of drive failure and laborious VPNs and FTP transfers between sites. Internet Outage Resilience: SMB and ROBO often have weaker internet access. With CacheDrive, active files are accessible even if the Internet link is down, and cloud sync auto restarts on link restoration. Continuous Backup and Recovery: Unlimited, seamless, cloud storage expansion and file versioning provides integral data protection and simplified file recovery. Secure Private Cloud: All files are encrypted at rest and in transit. Businesses using Dropbox and OneDrive can experience cache-accelerated uploads and file sync to their Cloud Storage. "Morro Data has transformed how we transport files between our offices. With each office coming online while the other is going offline, efficient transferring of large files is top priority to EIGHT25MEDIA. Morro’s Cache Cloud Acceleration allows our designers to upload large files in seconds compared to the 30 to 40 min they were spending each day with our previous cloud storage solution. We also love the cost savings from the bandwidth efficiency and elimination of per user fees." – Head of Digital Strategy, Jahzeel Omar of EIGHT25MEDIA said. Companies like Nasuni, Panzura and Ctera have brought the benefits of cloud storage to enterprises with the cloud storage gateways and hybrid NAS products. Morro Data now brings these same benefits to the SMB. "Excited to see Morro Data being available," said Ben Woo, Principal Analyst of Neuralytix based in San Francisco. "Many small and medium businesses are interested in moving to cloud storage to get the Opex and operational benefits but are put off by the complexity, per user costs and need to retrain IT staff. Now for the first time, they can get this through Morro Data." The Morro Data service will be introduced at the Intel Solutions Summit -EMEA, the premier event for Intel® Technology Providers, April 4-6, 2017 in Madrid.

Trump says Flynn is right to ask for immunity in exchange for talking about Russia. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) By Bloomberg News The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said President Donald Trump's former national security adviser would have to go through several steps before lawmakers would consider offering immunity in exchange for his testimony. Rep. Adam Schiff of Washington said that he would discuss Mike Flynn's offer with the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Justice Department, and that he would need to receive details about what Flynn would say. "As with any investigation -- and particularly one that grows in severity and magnitude by the day -- there is still much work and many more witnesses and documents to obtain before any immunity request from any witness can be considered," Schiff said Friday (March 31) in a statement. Trump encouraged Flynn to seek immunity from prosecution Friday morning, calling investigations into alleged contacts between the Trump administration and the Russian government a political "witch hunt." "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!" Trump wrote in a Twitter post, using shorthand for Democrats. While it's unclear if Trump was coordinating with his former adviser, Flynn has told investigators that he's willing to be interviewed in return for immunity from prosecution. "General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit," Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, said in a statement late Thursday. "We will not comment right now on the details of discussions between counsel for General Flynn and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, other than to confirm that those discussions have taken place." Jack Langer, a spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee, said that the panel "had a preliminary conversation with Michael Flynn's lawyer about arranging for Flynn to speak to the committee. The discussions did not include immunity or other possible conditions for his appearance." Flynn's lawyer suggested immunity is justified because his client is "the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated." Kelner, a partner at Covington and Burling LLP in Washington, said: "No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution." Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, was forced out of the Trump administration after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. after Trump's victory. FBI Director James Comey has told Congress that the bureau's probe into Russian hacking of last year's presidential election "includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts." While Trump continued to scoff at concerns over the investigations into Russian hacking, one of his cabinet members said it's a real concern for the U.S. and allies. Defense Secretary James Mattis said Friday at a London news conference with his U.K. counterpart that Russia "is choosing to be a strategic competitor." Its violations of international law are a matter of record, including its Crimea annexation and "mucking around" in other countries' elections, he said. The House and Senate Intelligence committees are also investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, including any contacts between Trump associates and Russia. Flynn, who ran the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama, was one of Trump's closest advisers during the campaign and was one of the more vocal critics of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, even leading chants of "lock her up" during his Republican National Convention speech regarding her use of a private email server. "I mean, five people around her have had, have been given immunity," Flynn said in an interview with NBC's "Meet the Press" in September. "When you are given immunity, that means that you have probably committed a crime." Flynn briefly held one of the most sensitive jobs in the Trump administration as national security adviser, which carries the highest-level security clearance. He has been at the top of the list for Democrats and others investigating the possible Russia connections. In the weeks after Flynn left the administration, new details emerged about his business ties with Turkey's government and Russian entities. Flynn retroactively registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for work that his firm, Flynn Intel Group, did for a Dutch consulting company, Inovo BV, which has ties to President Recep Erdogan of Turkey. Flynn's filing showed that his company received $530,000 from Inovo between Sept. 9 and Nov. 14. Kelner wrote in a letter accompanying the filing that Flynn had previously registered with Congress under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, but made the new filing because the work could have been interpreted as benefiting the government of Turkey. Lobbying on behalf of a foreign government requires registration with the Justice Department. The top Democrat and Republican on the House Oversight Committee are seeking documents related to Flynn's security clearance applications and contacts and payments from Russian, Turkish and any other foreign sources including the Kremlin-backed media outlet RT, dating from Flynn's 2014 retirement from the Defense Intelligence Agency to the present. Democrats on the House committee last week released documents showing Flynn received more than $45,000 from RT for taking part in a December 2015 gala where he sat at President Vladimir Putin's table. Other documents showed that Flynn, who received $11,250 for a 2015 speaking engagement in Washington for Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of a Russian cybersecurity firm; and an $11,250 payment from Volga-Dnepr Airlines. - Steven T.

Net loss of $187 million in 2017, narrowed from $203 million in 2016. Sales and marketing expenses also increased from $161 million in 2016 to $203 million in 2017. Cloudera, founded in 2008, was an early startup in the big-data field. It offers software and services that let businesses store massive amounts of data on inexpensive hardware via Hadoop, a type of software invented by Google and pioneered by Yahoo. Hadoop is great for storing stuff cheaply, but it was hard for the average company to use once it put all that stuff in there. Cloudera was one of a handful of companies that made it easier for an average business to use. As such, it attracted attention and a boatload of angel and venture-capital cash, including angel backing by Diane Greene, the cofounder of VMware who is now running Google's cloud business, and Caterina Fake, the cofounder of Flickr and chairwoman of Etsy. Greene and Fake are scheduled to cash out their shares in this IPO, according to PitchBook, a database that tracks such things. People have been talking about Cloudera's potential IPO since 2013, but it chose to stay private longer. The company was an early "unicorn," a startup with a valuation of over $1 billion, and it stood by while one of its main competitors, Hortonworks, a Hadoop spin-off from Yahoo, went public in 2014. Hortonworks had a successful IPO in December 2014, but its stock price has struggled big time since then, down from about $26 to under $10. In contrast, Cloudera had raised over $1 billion at a valuation of over $4 billion — a record-breaking amount for an enterprise startup at the time — and had investors like Accel, Greylock Fidelity, Intel, and T. Rowe Price. By early 2016, when the valuations of unicorn startups were under siege, Fidelity marked down the valuation of much of the startup stock it owned, including Cloudera's. While the shares aren't priced yet, Cloudera's IPO is expected to give the company a valuation of about $4 billion, the same as its last private round, with 33 investors cashing out at least some of their stakes, according to PitchBook. But so far, 2017 looks like it will be good for highly valued enterprise IPOs — those of tech startups that sell their tech to businesses — so investors may gobble up Cloudera as well. MuleSoft had a good IPO earlier this month. Okta is nearing the gates with its IPO, too. And now Cloudera is waiting in the wings.

Representative Adam Schiff of Washington said that he would discuss Mike Flynn's offer with the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Justice Department, and that he would need to receive details about what Flynn would say. "As with any investigation - and particularly one that grows in severity and magnitude by the day - there is still much work and many more witnesses and documents to obtain before any immunity request from any witness can be considered," Schiff said Friday (March 31) in a statement. Trump encouraged Flynn to seek immunity from prosecution Friday morning, calling investigations into alleged contacts between the Trump administration and the Russian government a political "witch hunt." "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!" Trump wrote in a Twitter post, using shorthand for Democrats. While it's unclear if Trump was coordinating with his former adviser, Flynn has told investigators that he's willing to be interviewed in return for immunity from prosecution. "General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit," Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, said in a statement late Thursday. "We will not comment right now on the details of discussions between counsel for General Flynn and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, other than to confirm that those discussions have taken place." Jack Langer, a spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee, said that the panel "had a preliminary conversation with Michael Flynn's lawyer about arranging for Flynn to speak to the committee. The discussions didn't include immunity or other possible conditions for his appearance." Flynn Wants Immunity Here's why it's complicated: White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Friday that Schiff is expected to visit the White House later in the day to view intelligence intercepts. The administration says they raise questions about whether government spy agencies improperly identified Trump's campaign officials and associates in the course of routine foreign surveillance. The White House invited Schiff and the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee to view the documents shortly after the New York Times reported that two White House officials had provided House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes with reports showing that Trump and his associates were named incidentally by U.S. spy agencies monitoring foreign officials. Schiff said Thursday that he would be willing to review the material, but questioned the administration's motives, saying officials may be trying to disseminate information that helps Trump's case. The administration has been deflecting questions about Russian meddling in the presidential election by focusing on leaks of classified materials and, more recently, Trump's allegations that his predecessor may have spied on him and his aides before and after the election. Flynn's immunity offer has refocused some attention on the original questions about Russian meddling in the election. 'Highly Politicized' Flynn's lawyer suggested immunity is justified because his client is "the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated." Kelner, a partner at Covington and Burling LLP in Washington, said, "No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution." Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, was forced out of the Trump administration after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the US after Trump's victory.  FBI Director James Comey has told Congress that the bureau's probe into Russian hacking of last year's presidential election "includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts."  'Mucking Around' While Trump continued to scoff at concerns over the investigations into Russian hacking, one of his cabinet members said it's a real concern for the US and allies. US Defence Secretary James Mattis said Friday at a London news conference with his UK counterpart that Russia "is choosing to be a strategic competitor." Its violations of international law are a matter of record, including its Crimea annexation and "mucking around" in other countries' elections, he said. The House and Senate Intelligence committees are also investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US election, including any contacts between Trump associates and Russia. Clinton critic Flynn, who ran the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama, was one of Trump's closest advisers during the campaign and was one of the more vocal critics of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, even leading chants of "lock her up" during his Republican National Convention speech regarding her use of a private email server. "I mean, five people around her have had, have been given immunity," Flynn said in an interview with NBC's "Meet the Press" in September. "When you are given immunity, that means that you have probably committed a crime." Flynn briefly held one of the most sensitive jobs in the Trump administration as national security adviser, which carries the highest-level security clearance. He has been at the top of the list for Democrats and others investigating the possible Russia connections. In the weeks after Flynn left the administration, new details emerged about his business ties with Turkey's government and Russian entities. Turkey and Russia Flynn retroactively registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for work that his firm, Flynn Intel Group, did for a Dutch consulting company, Inovo BV, which has ties to President Recep Erdogan of Turkey. Flynn's filing showed that his company received $530,000 from Inovo between Sept 9 and Nov 14. Kelner wrote in a letter accompanying the filing that Flynn had previously registered with Congress under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, but made the new filing because the work could have been interpreted as benefiting the government of Turkey. Lobbying on behalf of a foreign government requires registration with the Justice Department. The top Democrat and Republican on the House Oversight Committee are seeking documents related to Flynn's security clearance applications and contacts and payments from Russian, Turkish and any other foreign sources including the Kremlin-backed media outlet RT, dating from Flynn's 2014 retirement from the Defense Intelligence Agency to the present. Democrats on the House committee last week released documents showing Flynn received more than $45,000 from RT for taking part in a December 2015 gala where he sat at President Vladimir Putin's table. Other documents showed that Flynn, who received $11,250 for a 2015 speaking engagement in Washington for Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, Inc, a US subsidiary of a Russian cybersecurity firm; and an $11,250 payment from Volga-Dnepr Airlines. Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, said the retired lieutenant general "both informed and fully briefed" the Defence Intelligence Agency about his Russia trip beforehand and when he returned.

The stand out performer in the space was none other than Goldman Sachs, which soared 32% from election night until the end of the year.  However, the momentum in the financial sector began slowing as it appeared Trump might not be able to get things done as quickly as he wanted. The S&P 500 Financial Index fell about 5% during March.   That weighed on Goldman Sachs, which is set to end the first quarter of 2017 in negative territory, down about 4%. The bank is the fifth-worst performing stock in the Dow. Meanwhile, rival JPMorgan fared a bit better, but was still among the worst performers in the Dow. Its stock eked out a gain of about 2%, which is about half of the Dow's gains during the quarter. Other laggards include Intel Corp, which has seen a -0.4%, and energy stocks such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil which lost about 9% apiece.  23 of the 30 companies companies listed on the Dow are in positive territory for the year. Apple led the pack, climbing about 24%, on its way to its best quarter in five years. Other firms in the top 10 include Boeing, Cisco, and Nike. The gained between 9% and 14%.

(AMD) Stock Is a Rotten Apple Big-Box Retail Stocks: 2 to Buy, 2 to Avoid Why Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still the Alpha Dog View All Posts Without a doubt, if ever there was a candidate for a “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” stock, it would be Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Source: Shutterstock Not long ago, on a CNBC roundtable segment, an analyst proposed a “buy” recommendation on AMD stock. The other pundits laughed. And then they laughed some more. When the humor appeared to fade, they laughed again, just for good measure. It took a while, but the joke was ultimately on the naysayers. Last year was a stunning turnaround for Advanced Micro Devices. From start to finish, AMD stock returned long-suffering shareholders more than 300% in profits. To put that into perspective, 2016 was the biggest year in its publicly traded existence. More impressively, AMD eclipsed the performance of 2009, when several stocks were clawing back from 2008’s devastation. What’s particularly endearing for both present stakeholders and prospective buyers is that Advanced Micro Devices is not slowing down. For 2017, AMD stock is up just shy of 30%. That’s enough for a very solid year for most people’s portfolios. In fact, if it keeps up this work rate, AMD could challenge for yet another triple-digit return. That would make consecutive triple-digit returns, something that hasn’t happened for AMD stock since 1982 and 1983. Although the prospect for a history-making event is extremely enticing for investors, we also have to remember the risks. Advanced Micro Devices has long played second-fiddle to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) for a reason. It also gave a foothold for semiconductor rivals like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The question is, which AMD will show up this time around? Many Reasons to Love AMD Stock Certainly, I can respect the idea of Advanced Micro Devices pulling off another upset. It’s running high on momentum, and sometimes, that’s all you really need. But as InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli asserts, other substantive factors are working in favor of AMD stock. Having a strong business is all about people. And AMD has a powerhouse leadership, starting from the top. At the helm is CEO Lisa Su, a phenomenal executive who has a doctorate’s degree in electrical engineering from MIT. She has also served in high-level positions at renowned firms Freescale Semiconductor Ltd (NYSE:FSL) and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM). Along with great people are products. Historically, this is one area that has tripped up AMD stock. Although, it’s always been cheaper in price compared to rival Intel’s offerings, AMD semiconductors have wrestled with the quality stigma.

They mark the end of the era of maximizing the degree of standardization in IPCs and introduce a new concept of modular design, allowing a higher level of customizing IPCs to specific client needs. One of the new Industrial PCs is the RXi2-EP. Optimized for heavy usage in harsh industrial environments, it delivers mid-to-high performance computing capabilities to run e.g. data analytics applications right at the machine, enabling improved control of operations in real time. “Our new, customized IPCs deliver on the promise of lower total cost of ownership. When compared to standardized products, they require less maintenance and have longer life-cycles. They allow for operating periods of 7 to 10 years throughout which the computers can continuously be deployed, hardly requiring reconfiguration. Expenses for software modifications are lower, and there is less regression testing“, says Rudolf Krumenacker, Head of Engineering and Site Leader at GE in Augsburg, Germany. All aspects of the new IPCs have been designed to further advance the Industrial Internet, as they provide more computing power at the heart of GE’s Field Agents which are the critical link and gateway of machine controllers to data analytics in the cloud. Furthermore they are preconfigured for secure data transmission via secure networks. The new RXi2-EP IPC is the perfect platform for running industrial apps right at the machine, even in the harshest environments. The core of the RXi2-EP IPC architecture is GE’s COM Express modular CPU platform. It allows users to flexibly combine the IPC’s carrier with a range of COM Express modules for maximum customization to specific application needs. GE’s COM Express platform architecture separates the processor module and carrier card, allowing the life of the subsystem to be extended by offering a simple, cost-effective upgrade of the processor alone. One of the new COM Express modules presented at Embedded World is the bCOM6-L1800, based on the capabilities of Intel® core processors. It has been designed specifically for industrial control applications in rugged environments which require the highest reliability and protection against shock, vibration, moisture, dust, chemicals as well as heat. Thanks to a unique cooling technology, the processors deliver full performance with no throttling over the entire temperature range of -20°C to +80°C. All new products will be presented at GE‘s Automation & Controls Press Briefing on Tuesday, March 14, 2017, at 3.30pm at the GE booth 543 in Hall 3 . Our experts will be glad to discuss the latest trends and products with you in person.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BIG DATA Cloudera files to raise $200 million in IPO Jordan Novet@jordannovet March 31, 2017 11:11 AM Tags: Cloudera, Cloudera IPO, IPO, IPO news Image Credit: techmsg/Flickr Big data software company Cloudera today submitted its S-1 filing to go public on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CLDR. Joint underwriters on the deal include Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Allen & Co., BofA Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank Securities, Stifel, JMP Securities, and Raymond James. For the year ended January 31, the company lost $187 million on $261 million in revenue, according to the filing. The year before, Cloudera turned up a $203 million loss on $166 million in revenue. The majority of Cloudera’s revenue comes from subscriptions, which are generally sold for one- to three-year periods, but the company is also dependent on services. Services include professional services, training, and education. Cloudera sells a distribution of the Hadoop open source software for storing and processing lots of different kinds of data. Cloudera’s competitor Hortonworks went public in 2014. Another Hadoop-based competitor is MapR. Building large businesses around open source software has traditionally been challenging, and in that regard many startups have longed to be the next Red Hat after the Linux distribution seller went public in 1999. Traditional database and data warehousing companies like IBM, Oracle, SAP, and Teradata are mentioned as competitors in the filing, but so are public cloud infrastructure providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, which companies can use to run Cloudera’s software. One business risk cited in the filing is Cloudera’s dependence on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), which manages various pieces of software that Cloudera builds on for its commercial offering. The company recently introduced cloud services; in the coming years, the company will increasingly focus its marketing attention on smarter systems like IBM Watson, as well as AWS as a whole. Founded in 2008, the company had 1,470 employees as of January 31 and more than a thousand customers, according to the filing. Cloudera has been expected to go public for years. The company filed confidentially earlier; today’s filing is listed under the name Project Thunder. Investors include Accel Partners, Greylock Partners, and Intel. As of January 31 Intel owned 22 percent of Cloudera, following a major funding deal on the part of the chipmaker, rather than its corporate venture arm, in 2014. In May 2014 Cloudera sold 11.9 million shares of its Series F-1 preferred stock to Intel for $370.9 million, the filing says. But first, one month prior to that, Cloudera “agreed to waive certain transfer restrictions” for capital stock from certain shareholders, including Accel and Greylock, for a tender offer from Intel. Employees were also allowed to participate, and cofounder and chief strategy officer Mike Olson did, as did chief financial officer Jim Frankola. All told, Cloudera sunk $741.8 million into Intel, between the funding round and the transfers of ownership, according to the filing. Chief executive Tom Reilly received $4.6 million in compensation including stock awards for the year that ended on January 31; for the prior year he got $7.3 million, according to the filing. Okta and Yext are also looking to go public. Snap went public last month, and Alteryx and MuleSoft did this month. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News Global Home Energy Management Systems Market to Grow at a CAGR of 18.71% During the Period 2017-2021; Finds New Report Lewes, DE — (SBWIRE) — 03/31/2017 — Report forecast the global home energy management systems market to grow at a CAGR of 18.71% during the period 2017-2021. HEMS are devices that are installed in residential buildings to enable the provision of feedback on electricity consumption patterns and power consumption data for individual appliances. These systems perform pre-programmed functions, such as maintaining the temperature of houses. In addition, HEMS not only provide demand-response prompts from utility loads but also provide data about loads generated by microgrids. The data generated are provided to users, wherein they can view their energy consumption patterns and compare them with historical data. The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global home energy management systems market for 2017-2021. To calculate the market size, the report considers the new installations in the market. The market is divided into the following segments based on geography: – Americas – APAC – EMEA According to the report, one of the major drivers for this market is growing adoption of smart grid technologies. The growing adoption of smart grids is one of the key factors for the increased use of HEMS. Globally, utilities are adopting smart grid technologies as a measure to improve the reliability of the grid and for achieving energy efficiency. Technologies such as remote terminal units, intelligent electronic devices, and other supervisory control and data acquisition systems are being adopted in the transmission and distribution infrastructure, while smart meters are being installed in consumer homes. Further, the report states that one of the major factors hindering the growth of this market is high cost of implementation and interoperability issues. Installing HEMS is highly expensive as it involves the use of many components such as sensors, displays, and software, which are interconnected to save energy consumption. This makes many homeowners reluctant to invest in these systems, as they do not find HEMS beneficial and the return on investment is perceived to be negligible. The premium pricing of the system and products hinders the adoption of HEMS among end-users. In addition, other expenses such as installation and maintenance costs are also high, which hinder the adoption of HEMS among many end-users.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Nation/World Adam Schiff: Too early to discuss immunity for Michael Flynn FRIDAY, MARCH 31, 2017, 10:57 A.M. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, March 30, 2017. (J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press) By Steven T. Dennis, Chris Strohm and Billy House Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser would have to go through several steps before lawmakers would consider offering immunity in exchange for his testimony. Rep. Adam Schiff of Washington said that he would discuss Mike Flynn’s offer with the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Justice Department, and that he would need to receive details about what Flynn would say. “As with any investigation — and particularly one that grows in severity and magnitude by the day — there is still much work and many more witnesses and documents to obtain before any immunity request from any witness can be considered,” Schiff said Friday in a statement. Trump encouraged Flynn to seek immunity from prosecution Friday morning, calling investigations into alleged contacts between the Trump administration and the Russian government a political “witch hunt.” “Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!” Trump wrote in a Twitter post, using shorthand for Democrats. While it’s unclear if Trump was coordinating with his former adviser, Flynn has told investigators that he’s willing to be interviewed in return for immunity from prosecution. “General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,” Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, said in a statement late Thursday. “We will not comment right now on the details of discussions between counsel for General Flynn and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, other than to confirm that those discussions have taken place.” Jack Langer, a spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee, said that the panel “had a preliminary conversation with Michael Flynn’s lawyer about arranging for Flynn to speak to the committee. The discussions did not include immunity or other possible conditions for his appearance.” Flynn’s lawyer suggested immunity is justified because his client is “the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated.” Kelner, a partner at Covington and Burling LLP in Washington, said: “No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution.” Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, was forced out of the Trump administration after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. after Trump’s victory. FBI Director James Comey has told Congress that the bureau’s probe into Russian hacking of last year’s presidential election “includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts.” While Trump continued to scoff at concerns over the investigations into Russian hacking, one of his cabinet members said it’s a real concern for the U.S. and allies. Defense Secretary James Mattis said Friday at a London news conference with his U.K. counterpart that Russia “is choosing to be a strategic competitor.” Its violations of international law are a matter of record, including its Crimea annexation and “mucking around” in other countries’ elections, he said. The House and Senate Intelligence committees are also investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, including any contacts between Trump associates and Russia. Flynn, who ran the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama, was one of Trump’s closest advisers during the campaign and was one of the more vocal critics of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, even leading chants of “lock her up” during his Republican National Convention speech regarding her use of a private email server. “I mean, five people around her have had, have been given immunity,” Flynn said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” in September. “When you are given immunity, that means that you have probably committed a crime.” Flynn briefly held one of the most sensitive jobs in the Trump administration as national security adviser, which carries the highest-level security clearance. He has been at the top of the list for Democrats and others investigating the possible Russia connections. In the weeks after Flynn left the administration, new details emerged about his business ties with Turkey’s government and Russian entities. Flynn retroactively registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for work that his firm, Flynn Intel Group, did for a Dutch consulting company, Inovo BV, which has ties to President Recep Erdogan of Turkey. Flynn’s filing showed that his company received $530,000 from Inovo between Sept. 9 and Nov. 14. Kelner wrote in a letter accompanying the filing that Flynn had previously registered with Congress under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, but made the new filing because the work could have been interpreted as benefiting the government of Turkey. Lobbying on behalf of a foreign government requires registration with the Justice Department. The top Democrat and Republican on the House Oversight Committee are seeking documents related to Flynn’s security clearance applications and contacts and payments from Russian, Turkish and any other foreign sources including the Kremlin-backed media outlet RT, dating from Flynn’s 2014 retirement from the Defense Intelligence Agency to the present. Democrats on the House committee last week released documents showing Flynn received more than $45,000 from RT for taking part in a December 2015 gala where he sat at President Vladimir Putin’s table. Other documents showed that Flynn, who received $11,250 for a 2015 speaking engagement in Washington for Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of a Russian cybersecurity firm; and an $11,250 payment from Volga-Dnepr Airlines. Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, said the retired lieutenant general “both informed and fully briefed” the Defense Intelligence Agency about his Russia trip beforehand and when he returned.
