The Linux Foundation Years after Intel released the low-power, Linux-compatible Quark X1000 processor, which runs on the Intel Galileo and numerous IoT gateways, the chipmaker last year launched three microcontroller-like Quarks that do not run Linux. Like the original Quarks, the Quark D1000 is limited to Pentium ISA compatibility and supports only bare metal implementations. The Quark D2000 and similar Quark SE C1000, which drives the Intel Curie module, also supply full Intel x86 ISA. They lack an x86 FPU but can still run RTOSes like Zephyr. Considering the minimal MCU footprint, and lack of Linux-associated technologies like U-Boot, Intel had to develop a Quark D2000/SE bootloader from scratch. At the Embedded Linux Conference in February, Intel software engineer Daniele Alessandrelli detailed the inner workings of the Intel Quark Microcontroller Bootloader (QM-Bootloader). In his presentation, Alessandrelli also described security extensions added to version 1.4 of the BSD-licensed QM-Bootloader. Designed for the D2000 and SE C1000, the QM-Bootloader offers typical bootstrap features such as system initialization, trim code computation, and restore context from sleep. It also provides Firmware Management (FM) functionality based on the DFU (Device Firmware Update) protocol and its most popular host tool, dfu-util. Alessandrelli and his team needed to adapt dfu-util to work over UART as well as USB. This would provide a uniform firmware-upgrade experience whether developers were working with the USB 1.1-enabled SE or the standard D2000, which lacks USB support. The D2000 and SE Quarks both feature 32MHz, x86-based Lakemont cores, but only the SE offers a 32MHz ARC sensor subsystem core. Further complicating the QM-Bootloader development process was the fact that the SE provides more memory: 80kB SRAM and 384kB flash. Both models, however, conveniently share an 8kB allotment of OTP (one-time programmable) SRAM. “From the bootloader point of view the two Quarks are quite similar because we put our bootloader in OTP,” said Alessandrelli, who, together with Jesus Sanchez-Palencia, is the maintainer of the project. “The 8kB limitation was a restraint, but we were still able to implement a modular approach so we could add new transports and potentially OTA updates in future.” The foundation of the QM-Bootloader is the DFU protocol, which provides a way to transfer data to the device with DFU_DNLOAD for FM, as well as extract data with DFU_UPLOAD. Both are block-based mechanisms: All blocks except the last must have the same size. “We decided to use DFU because it is open source, well documented, and designed for resource constrained devices,” said Alessandrelli. “Also, DFU doesn’t define any specific image format, and we wanted to do our own image format with its own metadata and authentication mechanism. We don’t have enough RAM or flash to store a full image, so we needed to develop our own block-wise transfer/flashing protocol to allow us to write an image a block at a time.” To adapt DFU for UART, the Intel team created a Quark DFU Adaptation (QDA) protocol. “QDA makes DFU available over any message transport,” said Alessandrelli. “Because UART is stream oriented, we added the old XMODEM-CRC protocol layer to transport QDA packets. QDA provides all DFU request/response messages, such as DFU_UPLOAD, and also mimics some generic USB functionality, including active alternate settings. We needed a different host code for QDA/UART, so we modified dfu-util to replace the USB layer with QDA/UART.” The resulting qm-dfu-util code is available on GitHub, licensed under GPLv2. On top of the QDA layer, the Intel team defined a Quark Format Upgrade (QFU) image format that works with generic DFU tools and supports firmware authentication. This “very simple block-wise format” adds a header to the first block of the binary, “so it’s processed before the image,” said Alessandrelli. The header is subdivided into a base header, which contains information like the target device and the vendor and product ID, as well as an extended header used for authentication. “We do not add any specific memory address to the header, but instead assume the flash is divided into partitions, and that every image is targeting a partition,” said Alessandrelli. This setup enables the bootloader to support a single partition on the D2000, and two partitions on the ARC-enabled SE model. This also enables future schemes such as multiple partitions per core, which might come in handy for OTA. Finally, the Quark Firmware Management (QFM) protocol runs on top of the DFU layers, thereby enabling functionality beyond firmware upgrade, such as key provisioning, application erase, and system/firmware information retrieval. QFM is basically a request (DFU_DNLOAD ) or response (upload) protocol. QM-Bootloader 1.4 adds security features Alessandrelli went on to describe new Secure Firmware Upgrade extensions that have been added to QM-Bootloader 1.4’s QFM layer to enable authenticated firmware upgrades. Due to the Quark’s limitations, he could not use a public key scheme. Instead, he chose a simple symmetric key scheme called HMAC256. “With HMAC, the image is verified using the same key that is used to sign it, and the key must be located within the device,” said Alessandrelli. “We decided not to hard-code the key, but instead provided users with the key management functionality so at runtime they can provide the key.” The QFU header is extended with an HMAC extended header. “We don’t compute the HMAC for the entire image, but we authenticate the header, adding an array of hashes, one for each block that composes the image,” said Alessandrelli. “We authenticate the header using HMAC, then start receiving blocks of images.We compute the SHA of every block and compare it with the SHA in the header.” The security enhancements address the challenge of ensuring partition consistency -- how to handle failures that can leave partitions in an inconsistent state, for example, due to a reset during a firmware update. The new code associates a consistency flag to every partition and stores this metadata in a bootloader file called BL-Data. The updated bootloader also adds key management. “We basically define and authenticate a key update request, an extension of QFM,” said Alessandrelli. “We use double-signing, providing both the firmware key, which is used to authenticate an image, as well as a revocation key.” Although this scheme will need to be modified if they add OTA support in the future, “since right now we’re only supporting wired and point to point USB or UART transfer, a man in the middle attack is defeatable,” he noted. Alessandrelli also described security enhancements used to protect BL-DATA using CRC and further explained how partitions are related to targets. The enhancements are designed to support future upgrades to OTA and other additions, such as BLE modules with their own firmware. Alessandrelli concluded with some lessons learned, such as the importance of reusing existing open source code and using a modular approach. “By not pre-optimizing for footprint, we can adapt to changing requirements,” he said. “By using link-time optimization, we could offset most of the overhead from the modular approach, giving us 15 to 20 percent savings in flash footprint saving.” Watch the complete presentation below.

A security researcher has discovered around 40 zero- in Samsung's Tizen operating system. Samsung adopted Tizen – a Linux-based OS developed in partnership with Intel and based on Nokia and Intel's failed MeeGo – to reduce its dependency on Google's Android operating system and is deploying it in TVs, smartphones, watches and other devices. According to Israeli security researcher Amihai Neiderman, head of research at Equus Software in Israel, almost every system app is vulnerable to attack, but in a presentation at Kaspersky's Security Analyst Summit in St. Martin, he said that some of the bugs found in the OS “felt like 2005”. He claimed that Tizen was "maybe the worst code I've ever seen". He tested his findings on a Samsung smart TV as well as two Tizen smartphones, the Samsung Z1 and Z3, which he purchased on eBay. He claimed that all the security holes found were critical and would enable a hacker to control a Samsung device remotely.  He noted the TV implementation of the software was particularly bad. Its TizenStore app (Samsung's version of the App Store), could be hijacked and inject malicious code into a Tizen device, changing parts of the system to gain control of devices. Another issue was the reuse of code from Bada, Tizen's predecessor operating system. But new code also had problems. One function, called “strcpy()”, has a buffer overflow exploit, while another fails to use SSL encryption when transmitting certain data. "They made a lot of wrong assumptions about where they needed encryption," he said. "It's extra work to move between secure connections and unsecure connections."  Tizen is Samsung's attempt to move beyond using Android in its devices, particularly its smartphones, in a bid to have more control over both the hardware and software its sells. Neiderman said that the company should reconsider widespread deployment of the OS until there has been a major overhaul of the code. Samsung has told the press that it is “fully committed” to working with Neiderman to mitigate flaws.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → The Cheese Grater Mac Pro  April 5, 2017April 5, 2017 ⌘ Permalink As we learned this week, the 2013 trash can Mac Pro is going to … well … the trash can. Apple has promised a new “modular” Mac Pro for sometime after 2017. In the light of this news, I thought it would be interesting to look back a model, to the “cheese grater” Mac Pros Apple sold from 2006 until 2013. It was a flexible, expandable, powerful desktop computer.  Imagine that.  (Full resolution version can be downloaded here.) Early Days The Mac Pro was introduced at the tail-end of the Mac’s transition to Intel chips back in 2006. It was designed to replace the Power Mac G5, which had been serving pros for several years. The Mac Pro used the same external case,1 complete with the cheese grater look on the front and back, but the inside was all new, as Phil Schiller spoke about at WWDC 2006: The new desktop used Intel’s “Woodcrest” Xeon chips, in speeds up to 3.0 GHz, a number that eluded Apple and IBM in the PowerPC days. Schiller praised the Xeons for being far more efficient than the G5. The Mac Pro offered twice the performance of the Power Mac G5 while running much cooler, and without the need of the kilowatt power supply in the quad-core G5. This efficiency allowed Apple to drastically redesign the interior of the Mac Pro: The G5 required a system of nine computer-controlled fans, and later models came complete with liquid cooling modules. The Xeons ran cooler, so Apple had more room for goodies. The Mac Pro came with 4 hard drive carriers. A user just had to screw a hard drive to the carrier and slide it into place for the system to see it. For those who wanted it, a second optical drive could be installed as well. Like the G5, it came with 8 RAM slots and was upgraded to a total of four PCI Express slots as well. When the Mac Pro first went on sale, Apple offered a single SKU for $2,499: 2 x 2.66 GHz Dual-core Xeon 1 GB RAM 250 GB Hard Drive NVIDIA GeFrorce 7300GT GPU 16X SuperDrive The Mac Pro could be configured in countless ways on Apple’s online store, of course, with faster (or slower) Xeons, more RAM and storage, a better card, AirPort and Bluetooth cards and a second SuperDrive. The 8-Core Mac Pro All of the original Mac Pros were quad-core machines, but in April 2007, Apple launched a new high-end model at $3,997. This Mac Pro used Intel’s “Clovertown” Xeons and ran at 3.0 Ghz. The Good Years The Mac Pro saw updates in January 2008, then again in March 2009 and July 2010. With each revision, the tower became more powerful, moving from “Harpertown” chips in 2008 to “Bloomfield” and “Gainestown” in 2009. By the time 2010 rolled around, Apple was offering three SKUs in its Good/Better/Best arrangement. These machines used “Bloomfield,” “Gulftown” and “Westmere” Xeons, respectively. The Early 2008 Mac Pro was the first to officially support 32 GB RAM, even though users were having luck with that much memory with older machines. The Early 2009 Mac Pro brought with it Intel’s Nehalem architecture. While the clock speeds don’t show it, these towers were noticeably faster, especially for multi-threaded applications. They also supported higher RAM ceilings than earlier models, as the quad-core machines could address a whopping 128 GB of memory. The Mid 2010 model is the oldest Mac Pro supported by macOS Sierra. Apple introduced a $4,999 12-core model for the first time in this generation, as well as a build-to-order option for a SSD. Mac Pro Server The Mid 2010 Mac Pro had a sibling: the Mac Pro Server. Announced in November 2010 as a semi-replacement for the outgoing Xserve, this tower came with a license for Mac OS X Server, a 2.8GHz quad-core processor, 8GB of RAM and two 1 TB hard drives. Apple would also ship a version of the Mid 2012 Mac Pro with the Server designation. The Decline 2011 marked the first time that Apple “missed” its schedule for Mac Pro updates, and users noticed. Here’s Marco Arment in 2011, responding to a report that Apple was questioning the need for a Mac Pro: The Mac Pro was a tough sell to anyone but the most demanding users even in 2008. Today, even fewer buyers can justify it and it’s a worse deal relative to the rest of the Mac line. The Xeon E5 isn’t going to help either problem. I bet we’ll see a minor Mac Pro update to use the E5 CPUs whenever they’re available (probably within the next few months). But it wouldn’t surprise me if that’s the last Mac Pro. It had a great run, but the tower is over. Around this time, the iMac was making great strides, as I wrote in May of the same year: The Mac Pro used to be the obvious choice for anyone who needed power or expandability. It really was a no brainer. If you need brawn, Apple’s only tower was the only choice. Clearly, the first factor has become less of a differentiator as iMacs have become increasingly powerful. There are very few things that an iMac can’t do smoothly at this point. While some still need all 12 cores that the muscular Mac Pro offers, the Sandy Bridge chipset in Apple’s all-in-one is enough horsepower for just about everyone. People that just barely needed a Mac Pro for the power would be fine getting an iMac now. The new desktop can even support two displays out, something that only the Mac Pro could boast until this week. 2011 came to an end with no new Mac Pro, and by the spring of 2012, people were freaking out. This is the way the world ends This is the way the world ends This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but a whimper… In June 2012, Apple updated the cheese grater Mac Pro one last time. Updated may be too strong of a word, as James Galbraith wrote for Macworld: The new Mac Pros released at WWDC 2012 represent a speed bump, plain and simple. The new Mac Pros use the same, highly-upgradable case design, the same graphics cards, and even the same version of USB as the last iteration. And while the Macworld Lab’s test results show the new Mac Pros to be considerably faster than those systems the new Mac Pros replace, it is hard to swallow new “pro” systems that lack Apple’s fastest connection, Thunderbolt, released on MacBook Pros 16 months ago, and USB 3.0 support that arrived on the new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. The machine was met with such dismay that Tim Cook wrote this in a customer email the same day they were released: Although we didn’t have a chance to talk about a new Mac Pro at today’s event, don’t worry as we’re working on something really great for later next year. We also updated the current model today. That “really great” machine is the one the company just apologized for and then said it was replacing. Time really is a flat circle. I sometimes wonder what a Mac Pro would have looked like if the G5 didn’t need so much air flowing through it. I guess we’ll find out. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post RSS Sponsorship: With CardioBot, you can easily understand the data captured by the Apple Watch so you can improve your lifestyle and discover notable patterns.   512 Pixels is a blog written by Stephen Hackett about things that light up and make noise.

Gina Rodriguez in Luna Equal Pay campaign Credit: LUNA Bar via YouTube Equal Pay Day on April 4 turned into a lasting marketing opportunity, thanks to LeanIn.Org, founded by Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, and partners that include Procter & Gamble Co., Clif Bar & Co.'s Luna bars and Lyft. To raise awareness that women on average are paid 20% less than men, for example, P&G is offering a 20% rebate on up to $50 of its products purchased through April 30. Luna is offering 20% off bars purchase through lunabar.com through April 11. And Lyft is donating 20% of fares for rides on April 4 in 240 cities to women's organizations. Local businesses in 25 cities offered 20% discounts that day too. But underpayment of women isn't just a one-day or one-month marketing opportunity, it appears. The American Association of University Women is part of a "Lady Dollars" campaign taking a somewhat opposite approach to illustrate the problem, including a Google Chrome extension that will automatically add 20% to the prices of products at online retailers, starting with Walmart.com and Amazon.com. You don't actually have to pay those prices, but it's an illustration, and one that will be updated for Mother's Equal Pay Day (May 23), Black Women's Equal Pay Day (July 31), Native American Women's Equal Pay Day (Sept. 25) and Latinas' Equal Pay Day (Nov. 2). Luna's equal pay campaign is showcasing Gina Rodriguez, including a 90-second video in which the "Jane the Virgin" actress practices boxing and discusses equal pay. Luna Brand Director Ritu Mathur said Ms. Rodriguez "felt very authentic," in part because she was already speaking out as an advocate for women. The Clif Bar brand has long advocated for equal pay and representation through programs including its women's cycling team getting the same pay a men's team would and running the Lunafest women's film festival. Luna plans to donate up to $100,000 to fund wage negotiation workshops throughout the year. It also hired many women leads on the project including, among others, director Alexis Spraic and Executive Producer Tieneke Pavesic at production house Farm League, and at digital agency AnalogFolk Creative Director Carren O'Keefe. Meanwhile, Dress for Success, which specialized in programs aimed at empowering women, on April 4 kicked off a campaign called #OpenDoorProject by FCB. The organization is asking women to post a photo of their shoe holding a door open, and then thank the woman -- or women -- who opened the door to their success. Burger King's Froot Loops shake  Credit: Burger King Burger King's latest limited-time product isn't a burger, fries, or even a new flavor of chicken fries. Instead, it's introducing a Froot Loops shake made with vanilla-flavored soft serve, pieces of Froot Loops cereal and a "sweet sauce," as the idea of ice cream mixed with a cereal that lists sugar as its first ingredient apparently isn't quite sweet enough. The BK tie-in is believed to be the first-ever collaboration between the home of the Whopper and a Kellogg's cereal. BK already features Kellogg Co.'s MorningStar Farms brand in its veggie burger. The shake will be available starting April 17 at a suggested price of $2.99. Intel is deploying what might be the best use case of its 360-degree technology through a partnership with the NFL. Stadiums in Houston, San Francisco and Baltimore will showcase Intel's FreeD technology, which freezes video so users can rotate the picture and see big plays from any angle. Fans will be able to use the tech by visiting the NFL's official website. Broadcasters, meanwhile, will showcase the 360-degree feature during games, Intel said. The complex FreeD technology is made possible through dozens of 5K HD cameras that are connected to Intel servers via fiber-optic cables that stretch for miles, Intel said. A 15- to 30-second clip generates about 1 terabyte of data. There is a small caveat, however: Producers will select and package replays, not fans or broadcasters, Intel said. The technology made its first debut during last year's Super Bowl, the company said. Dean Foods' DairyPure was the big new-product winner of 2016, according to IRI, which tallied $1.2 billion in sales for its milk brand in all measured outlets for the year. The brand was new, but the products weren't, as DairyPure was a nationwide consolidation of several regional dairy brands in a marketing campaign led by Curiosity Advertising Cincinnati that began in May 2015. GSK's over-the-counter switch of prescription allergy drug Flonase was No. 2 overall and the big non-food winner with $316.5 million in IRI-measured 2016 sales. Procter & Gamble Co. landed five products in the top non-food launches of 2016, with entries from Gillette, Tide, Crest, Tampax and Old Spice. But Walmart also flexed its muscle in an unusual way on the list, with one of its exclusive brands, The Pioneer Woman Collection, coming in No. 6 in non-food at $79.1 million in sales. Henkel's Persil ProClean determent also cracked that list just below at $45.2 million in 2016 sales, despite having only been distributed at Walmart during the early part of the year. While big players did well at the top, IRI notes that 80% of top-ranking brands and 64% of new-product dollars came from small and midsize manufacturers. Credit: J.Crew It's the end of an era at J Crew Group Inc. -- an era that favored orange-red lipstick and thick black-frame spectacles. Earlier this week, the retailer announced the December departure of Jenna Lyons, who has spent more than a quarter-century at the New York-based company, most recently serving as president and executive creative director since 2012. The chain, which has struggled with souring sales in recent years amid rising competition from fast-fashion players and ecommerce disruptors, does not plan to replace Ms. Lyons. Years ago, the creative was responsible for infusing the 34-year-old apparel brand with a much-needed nerdy chic -- Ms. Lyons' preference for combining patterns like stripes and florals and ability to combine formalwear with casualwear helped propel J. Crew into the spotlight, but such trends -- once fairly innovative -- have faded in recent years. Calling all would-be fashion models. Denim brand NYDJ, a Los Angeles-based outfit founded in 2003, is taking its campaign casting call to the road. This month, the brand will host opportunities at various malls for aspiring models to be featured in the brand's Fit is Everything fall campaign. The company plans to visit three malls throughout April in its search for loyal consumers ready to strike a pose. The move is the latest in apparel brands' strategy to use authenticity and realness in their marketing as a way to better connect with actual customers. Lastly, here's the latest on some marketing personnel changes at Heineken USA. The beer marketer has promoted Felix Palau, formerly VP-marketing for Tecate, to senior VP-marketing for its flagship Heineken brand. Ralph Rijks, the former Heineken VP, "is returning to Holland with his family," according to Heineken. Esther Garcia has been promoted to replace Mr. Palau on Tecate.

The TPU is a Tensor Processing Unit – to be compared to Intel’s CPU or NVIDIA’s GPU, made for processing data. Google’s news here is their first-ever study published on how well their TPU works – compared, appropriately enough, to Intel’s CPU and NVIDIA’s GPU whilst neural networking. A neural network is a computer system with functionality based on that of the human brain and nervous system. Neural networking is meant to allow computers to think and reason, and ultimately solve problems in ways that’ve only before been possible with the human brain. Google uses neural networks for a wide variety of applications. Saying “OK Google” followed by a question or request utilizes Google’s neural network computing technology. Google uses neural networking for machine learning as well – each time the computer solves a problem, it gets smarter. Each time the user confirms that the computer has solved a problem correctly, the computer gets more capable of finding answers that are correct. This is called Deep Learning. To solve the problem of increasing demand for neural networking capacity, Google worked on their own Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). Google’s TPU is processing hardware – an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Google’s goal (starting in the year 2013), was to improve cost-performance for neural networking (in this case Deep Neural Networking) by 10x over GPUs. This is according to Google’s paper “In-Datacenter Performance Analysis of a Tensor Processing Unit”. Google’s TPU plugs into existing servers like a GPU does using the PCIe I/O bus. Google’s TPU is a coprocessor, one that is not tightly integrated with a CPU. Google’s development team says that because the host server sends instructions to the TPU rather than the TPU fetching them itself, the TPU is “closer in spirit to an FPU (floating-point unit) coprocessor than it is to a GPU.” Speaking with NextPlatform, Google hardware engineer Norman Jouppi suggested that Google looked at field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) before they decided on ASIC units. While FPGAs are easy to modify, they do not perform as well as ASICs. Google’s TPU seems to be the best of both worlds. “The TPU is programmable like a CPU or GPU,” said Jouppi. “It isn’t designed for just one neural network model; it executes CISC instructions on many networks (convolutional, LSTM models, and large, fully connected models). So it is still programmable, but uses a matrix as a primitive instead of a vector or scalar.” Google’s choices in hardware were done not to create the most efficient or powerful TPU possible. Instead, Google’s choices in hardware were to allow deployment at a massive scale. “It needs to be distributed—if you do a voice search on your phone in Singapore, it needs to happen in that datacenter—we need something cheap and low power,” said Jouppi. “Going to something like HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for an inference chip might be a little extreme, but is a different story for training.” From the paper linked above, Google’s benchmarks show that Google’s TPU solution far outperformed comparable Intel Haswell CPU architecture with less power. Their tests showed their TPU process 92 TOPS (71x more throughput than Intel’s CPU on inferences) in a 384 watt thermal envelope for the server while busy. The Intel Haswell CPU processed 2.6 TOPS with a thermal envelope of 455 watts while busy. This is where Google’s entry into this neural networking processing hardware universe begins. Google’s TPU will be seeing a lot more play – and publicity – over the next several years if their efficiency continues to take on the top guns as it has in this first benchmarking study.

Billy Steele, @wmsteele 10h ago in AV Comments 224 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Intel/Fox Sports The National Football League just announced that it's moving its Thursday Night Football streaming coverage from Twitter to Amazon, but there's more news to share this week. Through its on-going partnership with Intel, the NFL plans to install the company's 360 replay tech in more stadiums before the 2017 season kicks off. Right now, the setup is only available in Baltimore, Houston and San Francisco, but it will be in place for more teams this fall. Intel acquired Replay Technologies and its so-called freeD 360 tech just over a year ago. The system was used for NBA and MLB games as well as college football. Most recently, 360 replays and "Be the Player" views were part of Fox Sports' Super Bowl LI coverage. The whole thing is powered by camera setups that capture 5K visuals and Intel servers that can process up to one terabyte of data per 15-30-second clip. Each stadium where this is installed will have both the cameras and the servers on-site to get replay footage to producers quickly. Today's announcement doesn't reveal exactly which other NFL stadiums will get the 360 tech before the 2017 season starts, but you can bet the league will announce more details before players take the field. When the time comes, freeD 360 replays, "Be the Player" views and other content will be available on NFL.com, the NFL Mobile app and the league's YouTube channel. Intel and the NFL also say they will work with teams and broadcasters on using the technology -- something else we'll likely hear more about in the near future.

By: Anthony Garreffa | Editorials in Video Cards | Posted: 11 hours, 5 mins ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Page 1 [Introduction] Page 1 [Introduction] Page 2 [CPU & Motherboard] Page 3 [RAM & Storage] Page 4 [Wrapping Up] Introduction   After a few years of using the HEDT platform from Intel and ASUS, with the Core i7-5960X and Rampage V Extreme motherboard - I've finally switched over to a more mainstream CPU. As of now, every graphics card review will be run through Intel's new Core i7-7700K processor and the AORUS Z270X-Gaming 9 motherboard.     Now that I've hired some additional staff here in my office (my expansions of my day-to-day duties for TweakTown are continuously expanding), I can benchmark and run more tests and graphics cards than ever before. We're currently running all of our graphics cards through this new Core i7-7700K/AORUS Z270X-Gaming 9 system, while running the same cards through our AMD Ryzen 7 1800X platform.     This way, we can introduce Ryzen CPU performance into a series of 'versus' articles, seeing how Ryzen and Kaby Lake perform against one another. There are also new resolutions that are now in our default testing, with 3440x1440 making a permanent return. I was one of the first to dive into the 21:9 aspect ratio, and have four 3440x1440 displays in the lab right now. They are an amazing alternative to 4K gaming, especially with its 21:9 aspect ratio and 34-inch size.     In the very near future, we will be securing 5K and 8K displays as we get closer to the launch of AMD's next-gen Radeon RX Vega, which will push 8K gaming - something we will be on top of from day one.   For now, take a look around our new GPU benchmarking testbed.

It also added weight to the idea that Apple will at some point want to ditch Intel chips in Macs in favour of its own design of ARM-based CPUs. The arguments in favor of Apple designing its own Mac processors are exactly the same ones that led the company to design its own A-series chips for iOS devices. Apple gets total control – something the company values highly. Control of costs is part of it, of course. Tim Cook in particular got to the position he’s in today in large part by demonstrating a mastery of the supply-chain, and a significant goal there is to keep costs as low as possible in order to maximise margins. Apple eliminates royalty fees by designing its own chips, and that will further boost margins. But while cost is of course one motivation, there are two even more important benefits to Apple-designed CPUs … NordVPN The first is efficiency. Because Apple designs both hardware and software for iOS devices, it is able to ensure both total compatibility – and thus greater stability and reliability – and maximum efficiency. This is the reason that iPhones and iPads deliver far greater performance and battery-life than their relatively modest RAM size and battery capacity would suggest. Apple can tweak its software to suit the hardware – something any manufacturer can do – but it can also tweak the hardware to suit software demands. The second – and by far the most important – is that it frees Apple from third-party hardware cycles. Flagship Android manufacturers are at the mercy of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon production cycles, for example. Want to design a faster phone? Well, you can’t until Qualcomm creates the processor needed to do it. Apple, in contrast, can determine its own A-series chip cycles. It has so far settled on an annual tick-tock cycle, but is free to change that as and when it desires. Being able to have the same control for Mac processors as it does for iPhone and iPad ones would be huge. Right now, Apple is totally dependent on Intel’s development cycles. It can’t make a significant update to any of its Mac models until Intel has made the next generation of CPUs needed to power it. Not only that, but Apple is also stuck with any constraints imposed by Intel’s chipset. For example, it had to limit the maximum RAM of the 2016 MacBook Pro to 16GB – rather than the step up to 32GB many of us expected – in part because of a limitation imposed by the CPU. The new MacBook Pros use a low-power DDR3 RAM type called LPDDR3E that maxes out at 16GB. Going to 32GB would have required a switch to DDR4 RAM, but the low power variant of that type isn’t supported by the Intel processors found inside the new MacBook Pros. Apple-designed chips would give the company total control of both product cycles and capabilities. So the benefits are clear, but there are three key challenges to be overcome before Apple could make the switch. The first is power. Right now, ARM processors are already starting to rival low-end Intel ones, both in theory and in real-life use, but they can’t yet compete with top-end Intel CPUs. That part is likely just a matter of time. The second is software compatibility. If Apple completely switches architecture, that would require software to be rewritten to remain compatible with new Macs. That’s huge. Huge, but not unprecedented, of course. It’s something Apple has done not just once before, but twice. In 1994, the company switched from the Motorola 68000 architecture of the original Macintosh range to the PowerPC. And in 2006, it switched from PPC to Intel. Apple made both transitions easier by offering compatibility features that enabled older software to run on the newer Macs. For the 68000 to PPC switch, by offering an emulator, and from PPC to Intel through Rosetta. Described by Apple as ‘the most amazing software you’ll never see,’ it allowed many – though not all – PPC apps to continue to run on Intel Macs. It’s likely that Apple would take a similar approach with a switch from Intel to ARM machines, encouraging developers to create new versions while offering a compatibility mode for those who don’t. The third is unique to a switch away from Intel: maintaining Windows compatibility. Especially in the corporate market, a significant number of Mac users run one or more Windows apps, either through Bootcamp or virtualization software like Parallels. But Windows can run on ARM, so this needn’t be an insurmountable problem either. Reports of Apple working on ARM-based Macs have been circulating for several years. As both Chance and I have argued, the question is when rather than if – and the decision to switch to Apple-designed GPUs in iOS devices only strengthens our case.

Undeniably impressive in the multi-core stakes, the released quartet of Ryzen 7 chips make a solid case for being considered for your next performance PC build. Yet it's arguable that a CPU is only as good as the platform it is sat on top of, and such thinking is what has previously shied many away from the FX chips whose supporting motherboards are long in the tooth and short of modern features. That's largely changed with Ryzen, as the X370 and B350 chipsets, primed for Ryzen 7 usage, offer a feature-set that, on paper, is a solid match for Intel's Z270. However, early indications are that X370-based boards aren't quite there in terms of stability and robustness, underscored by multiple BIOS releases in quick order. Gigabyte is hoping to change all that with its newly-minted Aorus-branded boards, and initial indications are good. We had no problem in running our full suite of benchmarks and, unlike the Asus Crosshair VI Hero benchmarked with an earlier BIOS to show where Ryzen support was, this board ran with higher speed DDR4 memory without issue. The board we are referring to is the Gigabyte Aorus X370-Gaming 5, which sits half way up the premium stack. At £200 and therefore £60 cheaper than the Asus, Aorus pricing is comparable to the Intel equivalent - Z270X-Gaming 5 - as is the look and feature-set. There's the inevitable array of RGB-infused lighting, dubbed Fusion, with Aorus providing Windows-based software support for tinkering with the LEDs' colour. Unlike others, this extends to the DIMM slots as well as 10 other lights dotted around the board and a light strip down the right-hand side. If it's lights you're after, the X370-Gaming 5 suits you well. One complaint of X370 boards has been the hit-and-miss memory support, with many forums users mentioning they are unable to run at XMP timings using even DDR4-2,666 RAM. We encountered no such issues with the F5d BIOS that would happily run a set of G.Skill memory at 2,933MHz, though we knocked it down to the officially supported 2,666MHz for testing. X370-Gaming 5 goes overboard in terms of fan headers. There are eight on board, including a trio that service all-in-one watercoolers and a duo for CPU, and each one is what Aorus calls hybrid. What this means is that each fan header can adjust the power and speed of the fans, which comes into play well when fine-tuning a build. We're not as pleased when it comes to storage, as Gigabyte has prioritised SATA over the much-preferred PCIe-based M.2. Eight SATA ports are offered, sharing bandwidth with the almost-defunct U.2 and SATA Express. This leaves just a single, 110mm-long M.2 inconveniently located between the strengthened top and bottom PCIe x16 slots. The Z270 version has two M.2 slots, which is what we would like to see here. We do, however, like the debug LED along with dual BIOSes and, to the extreme right, a bevy of enthusiast-oriented buttons that control power, reset, clear CMOS and one-touch OC. For the real tinkerers, there are even a couple of temperature-measuring points and compatible wires in the box. The board is well-stocked with audio, as Gigabyte Aorus offers the updated ALC1220 Codec twice. The reason for doing so rests with having high-quality audio output from both the IO section at the back and from an onboard header routed to the front of the case. The Codec pairs up with Creative's X-Fi MB5 software for some DSP presets. For graphics, Nvidia and AMD are both supported in quad-GPU mode split over two cards. Understanding just which output comes from where is a task in itself. The combination of X370 chipset and Ryzen CPU offers two USB 3.1 Gen 2 (red), six USB 3.1 Gen 1 (two on back, four from onboard headers), and a further four USB 2.0 again through onboard headers. If that's not enough, ASMedia's own USB controller is added to the mix to offer Type-C USB 3.1 Gen 2 as well as a same-specification Type-A. Adding it all up leads to 10 USB 3.1 ports on the back. Phew! Notice the HDMI connector? It's pointless for the Ryzen chips as they don't feature on-chip graphics but will be useful for the next generation of APUs. Finally, as this is a board that goes above and beyond in almost every category, an Intel Gigabit NIC is augmented by a Killer E2500. Perhaps the only missing part is WiFi, though that's a stretch at a £200 price point. The firmware is a direct copy of that found on the Intel-based Gaming 7, which means above average fan control (Smart Fan 5). There's compatibility with the Windows-centric Easy Tune and System Information Viewer software, too.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH People and Careers Former Intel Exec Ready to Help Bring Broadband to Rural Colorado Tony Neal-Graves talks about his plans for the state's broadband office and how he spent the first three weeks on the job. by Zack Quaintance / April 5, 2017 David Kidd/Government Technology Tony Neal-Graves, a former Intel Corp. vice president who was recently named executive director of Colorado’s broadband office, spent the first three weeks at his new job meeting people in state government, learning all he could about operations, challenges and possibilities. RELATEDColorado Appoints First Digital Transformation OfficerColorado Taps Intel Exec to Lead State Broadband Office During a recent conversation with Government Technology, Neal-Graves said the next step is to familiarize himself with the disparate challenges faced by communities throughout Colorado, from major cities like Denver in the mountainous Front Range region, down to rural towns in the Eastern Plain, where life looks more like Kansas than the Rockies. “My perspective on broadband — and solving some of the challenges about access and coverage across the state — is that it really depends on where you are,” said Neal-Graves. “Each of the various local counties and municipalities have different challenges.” Neal-Graves' focus in doing so is related to the state’s ongoing push to bring high-speed Internet access to all residents. Seventy percent of Colorado’s rural population currently has access to broadband, a number the state government aims to raise to 85 percent by the end of 2018, and 100 percent by the end of 2020. Neal-Graves described these goals as ambitious, but obtainable and imperative, pointing to collaboration as one of the keys. The broadband office is housed in the Governor’s Office of Information Technology, where it works closely with the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade. Neal-Graves reports directly to Gov. John Hickenlooper’s chief of staff, Doug Friednash, as well as to Lt. Gov. Donna Lynne. A veteran of the private sector who before Intel spent years with AT&T and Lucent Technologies, Neal-Graves said his background in business and private companies will help him foster partnerships. He spent the last three years at Intel working on initiatives related to Internet of Things and other developing technologies. He said a key takeaway of that work, was that in order to deliver capabilities to all citizens, multiple companies must collaborate. With the Internet of Things there was a variety of companies partnering to deliver functionality. “I think the same is true here,” said Neal-Graves. “It’s going to take a state government working with municipalities and also with private companies, ISPs and various service providers to really solve the problems in the different counties. I think my business background — in terms of developing those types of partnerships — will lend itself to this as well.” Neal-Graves said in the early days of his work he’s had a “laser focus” on extending high-speed Internet access to all residents of Colorado. His current plans are to spend the first 90 days of his tenure understanding how the various regions that make up the state view the problem, before beginning work on collaborations that may solve it. “The No. 1 reason I took this job is that I really believe in providing good-quality broadband access to all citizens,” said Neal-Graves. “It’s something that we really, critically have to do.” In addition to collaboration, Neal-Graves said a willingness to explore new technologies and other innovations could be useful. This work could also potentially span multiple administrations. It is, however, worth sticking with, as the rewards for extending high-speed infrastructure are immense. Neal-Graves, who describes himself as a history buff, said that throughout the history of the United States, economic development has been driven by improvements to infrastructure, whether that be canals, railroads, rural electricity capabilities or telephones. High-speed Internet now functions as a powerful information tool that can level the playing field, giving all those who have access to it the ability to compete. “We’ve always tried to build out that infrastructure and get people connected somehow,” said Neal-Graves, “whether it was physically connected or through technology, first with phones and now with the Internet.” Zack Quaintance Staff Writer Zack Quaintance is a staff writer for Government Technology. Prior to that, he spent five years working in daily newspapers, and another five years working in the tech sector. He lives in Northern California.

Bill Addison Eleven Madison Park has unseated Osteria Francescana to take the top spot on the annual World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. Since the rankings debuted in 2002, just seven restaurants (EMP now included) have held the no. 1 spot. Like many of these, Eleven Madison Park experienced a steady rise to the top. The New York restaurant appeared in the 50th slot in 2010, jumped to no. 24 in 2011, followed by no. 10 in 2012, no. 5 in 2013, and no. 4 in 2014. In 2015, it fell to the fifth slot, before continuing on its trajectory to the top, making it to third place last year. Related Here's the 2017 World's 50 Best Restaurants List Looking at the list of the restaurants that have held the top spot on the World’s 50 Best, the criticisms lobbed at the rankings (criticisms that Eater’s Ryan Sutton has enumerated before) are evident. Nearly all of the restaurants that have been ranked first are located in Europe, and those that aren’t in Europe serve European food, and all of the restaurants are helmed by men. Aside from last year’s Osteria Francescana and the Fat Duck in 2005, all of the restaurants on this list have held the top spot for at least two years. Time will tell whether Eleven Madison Park can hold on for a second year, but the tasting menu restaurant from Daniel Humm and Will Guidara makes good on the other common qualifiers for being named the best of the World’s 50 Best. Here’s a comprehensive look at all of the restaurants that the World’s 50 Best have deemed best in the world: Nick Solares/Eater Eleven Madison Park, New York Years at No. 1: 2017 Vital Intel: Daniel Humm and Will Guidara have vied for the top spot on the World’s 50 Best list since their restaurant made it into the top 50 in 2010, a year before the chef and general manager purchased EMP from Danny Meyer. The restaurant, which serves a seasonal tasting menu and also has three Michelin stars and four from the New York Times, is just the second American restaurant to be named best in the world by this particular list. Osteria Francescana Osteria Francescana, Modena, Italy Years at No. 1: 2016 Vital Intel: Osteria Francescana had been hovering near the top spot before making it to no. 1 last year. Massimo Bottura’s Italian restaurant was ranked second in 2015, and third the year before that. The first Italian restaurant to reach the top of the list, Osteria Francescana has a reputation for being near-impossible to get into, thanks in part to chef Bottura’s whimsical menu items, like “Five ages of Parmigiano Reggiano” and “An eel swimming up the Po River.” Encantadisimo/Flickr El Celler De Can Roca, Girona, Spain Years at No. 1: 2015, 2013 Vital Intel: In 2013, the modernist Spanish restaurant became the second restaurant from the Girona region of Spain to make it to the top of the list. At El Celler De Can Roca, Roca brothers Joan, Josep, and Jordi serve an avant-garde tasting menu for around $300 per person. Since being named the world’s best, the brothers have been as committed to international outreach as they are to innovation, becoming Goodwill Ambassadors for the United Nations Development Program and embarking on a 2014 worldwide tour. Noma/Facebook Noma, Copenhagen Years at No. 1: 2014, 2012, 2011, 2010 Vital Intel: René Redzepi, famed for his foraging expeditions and fermenting techniques, redefined what it means to be a locavore with Noma. The restaurant’s new Nordic, hyper-local cuisine made Copenhagen a global dining destination and served as a training ground for a number of notable chefs. In 2016, Redzepi closed Noma, with plans to reopen with an urban farm and three new partners in 2017. In the meantime, Redzepi has been making good use of the local produce at his Noma popup in Tulum, Mexico. elBulli, Girona, Spain Years at No. 1: 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2002 Vital Intel: The first restaurant to nab the top spot, elBulli also holds the record for the longest time spent at no. 1. The Spanish restaurant pioneered modernist, molecular gastronomy techniques, and elBulli chef Ferran Adrià trained several renowned chefs early in their careers, including José Andrés and fellow World’s 50 Best chef René Redzepi. Wikimedia The Fat Duck, Bray, England Years at No. 1: 2005 Vital Intel: Before today, the Fat Duck was the only restaurant on the list to have held the top spot for a single year. At the time, chef Heston Blumenthal’s 10-year-old restaurant was lauded for its highly innovative multi-course tasting menu, which included the now-retired snail porridge and egg and bacon ice cream. This year, Blumenthal was recognized by the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list for lifetime achievement. The Braineack/Flickr The French Laundry, Yountville, CA Years at No. 1: 2004, 2003 Vital Intel: Thomas Keller’s the French Laundry was the first American fine dining establishment to make it to the no. 1 spot on the list. The restaurant, which featured Keller’s French cooking in a picturesque Napa Valley setting, was also the first on the World’s 50 Best list to take the spot two years running. In recent years, the French Laundry has remained stubbornly on list of back 50 restaurants. • The World's 50 Best Restaurants List (and Its Flaws), Explained [E] Can't get enough of Eater?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak  ⋮  Rumor Intel Kaby Lake-G Processors To Pack Fast Discrete GPU and HBM2 Memory – Will Utilize Multi-Die Package Design By Hassan Mujtaba Apr 3, 2017 33Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel is reportedly preparing a new class of processors based on the 14nm process, known as Kaby Lake-G. The new processors, although part of the current 7th gen family, will be packing a revolutionary design scheme. Intel Kaby Lake-G Series CPUs To Pack Separate Discrete GPU and HBM2 Memory According to Benchlife, a new Intel roadmap has seemingly confirmed that Intel is preparing the latest Kaby Lake-G processors. These processors will feature advanced technologies that do away with the older, conventional design scheme seen on Intel consumer chips. The new processors will feature core tech utilizing 14nm process and will have a dedicated PCI Express link to a separate discrete GPU along with faster HBM2 memory. Related AMD Radeon RX 580, Radeon RX 570 and Radeon RX 550 Polaris Graphics Cards Performance Benchmarks Leaked – 3DMark Fire Strike Extreme and Ultra Results Spotted Intel recently confirmed at their Technology and Manufacturing Day that they’ll be moving towards a more robust and heterogeneous architecture. The new architectural layout will allow Intel to mix and match various CPU components and dies based on different process nodes and interlinking them on a single chip. This would allow Intel to do away with the cost and efficiency of a single monolithic design and utilize smarter and more efficient designs for their future processors. The new processors will utilize an embedded, multi-die interconnect bridge allowing for high density and high bandwidth, die-to-die interconnects. The main difference between a multi-chip package and a multi-die integration technique is that the former has poor density of die connections and interconnects while the later is not only denser but brings significant advantages at a lower cost. Intel could have gone with a silicon interposer layout but that costs more due to the massive number of TSV’s that need to be embedded underneath the main dies. Related AMD Ryzen 5 1600 Review Leaks Out – Faster Than The Core i7 7700K in Multi-Threaded Tests But Gaming Perfomance Slightly Lackluster Advertisement Intel Kaby Lake-G Would Feature Two SKUs With BGA Design – Aimed at Embedded and Laptop Solutions The two chips that will be part of the Kaby Lake-G series will feature the BGA (Ball Grid Array) design and a package size of 58.5 x 31mm. For comparison, a desktop Kaby Lake-S has a size of 37.5 x 37.5mm while the Kaby Lake-H series chips for laptops have a size of 42 x 28mm. So it’ll be a big package but there’s a reason why it’s so large. Intel Kaby Lake-G series SKUs listed by Benchlife. The two models feature 4 cores so we are looking at a quad core design. The CPU die comes with a GT2 graphics chip and the two SKUs have TDPs of 100W and 65W. The chip doesn’t contain any on-package cache so it would be extremely weird for a normal quad core chip with GT2 graphics to pack such a high TDP. The reason it is so high is because the chips are said to pack HBM2 memory and a discrete GPU on a separate die. The separate GPU will be connected to the main CPU die through a PCIe x8 (Gen 3.0) interface and the HBM2 memory will serve as the main on-board VRAM for the discrete level GPU. There’s no telling if the on-board GPU is an in-house Intel design or part of the alleged licensing deal between Intel and AMD that will allow Intel to use AMD’s graphics IP for their processors. Also, it’s worth noting that the chips don’t come with an integrated PCH, but will instead be located separately on the board as Kaby Lake-G series are aimed at 2-chip platforms (main chip + PCH). Little is still known about the Kaby Lake-G series but it’ll be interesting to see if a deal really formulates between AMD and Intel allowing faster processors with capable graphics cores.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 5, 2017 at 8:30AM At Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Technology and Manufacturing (TMG) Day event, the company spent a good deal of time talking about how it's aiming to build a "foundry franchise." That is, Intel -- a company that has traditionally designed and built its own chips -- wants to leverage its chip manufacturing expertise and its expensive chip manufacturing plants to generate additional revenue by building chips for third-party chip manufacturers. Image source: Intel. Intel pegs the total addressable market for what it calls "leading edge" chip technology (28-nanometer technology and below) at about $23 billion. That said, just because a market is large and a company has ambitions to play in it doesn't mean much if a company can't capture a significant portion of said market. During a question-and-answer session at Intel's TMG day, one analyst asked Intel executives about its long-term ambitions in this market and whether it would build chips for competitors (as some of the foundry total addressable market overlaps with Intel's own product lines). Let's look at what Intel executive Murthy Renduchintala had to say. No publicly stated ambitions Unfortunately, Renduchintala declined to provide long-term market share goals/ambitions for Intel's foundry business. He did say the following, though: "I think specific ambitions, we haven't declared any beyond the fact that I think that there are strategic partnerships and co-learning that could be available to [Intel] that could be mutually beneficial both to the internal product businesses of Intel and to, as well as, essentially providing a degree of extension of our foundry capability for other relationships." Considering that Intel isn't generating any meaningful revenue from its contract chip business today, any targets that Intel puts out today probably wouldn't be all that credible, anyway. Will Intel build chips for competitors? Renduchintala didn't directly answer the question about potentially building chips for competing chipmakers. However, he did provide something of an indirect answer. "I don't think we're setting ourselves up to be a general-purpose foundry," Renduchintala said. "We're really looking at strategic partnerships that essentially deliver win-win arrangements both for Intel and their customers and a degree of technical cooperation that's part of that win-win story." Image source: Intel. It's not hard to read this as a "no." After all, if Intel really has technology that could fundamentally improve the competitiveness of a product that directly competes with significant Intel-designed products, then would it really be a "win-win" to enable that competitor? Of course not! It would be much smarter for Intel to leverage whatever manufacturing technology advantage that it must make its own products better to defend market-share against challengers to its leadership position while at the same time trying to grow its market share in areas where it's a relatively small player today. An example of a "win-win" would be if Intel worked with a third-party chipmaker that builds chips for a market that Intel doesn't serve today. For example, Intel doesn't really participate in the tablet/smartphone applications processor market today. So, a "win-win" for Intel would be to collaborate up with a company that builds smartphone chips and build a large portion of that company's chips. That's what the company is doing with mobile chip vendor Spreadtrum today.  If Intel's technology really provides a performance and/or cost benefit compared to other technologies, then the potential customer wins and, of course, Intel would win (since it wouldn't otherwise derive any revenue from those smartphone chip sales). The challenge that Intel faces is that the competition in this market is quite strong and Intel's chip manufacturing competitors in this market have spent years building tight relationships with the major mobile chipmakers. Breaking those bonds won't be easy. Foolish takeaway At the end of the day, investors shouldn't bet on any serious near-to-medium term revenue from Intel's contract chip division -- it'll be a while before the money starts flowing, if it ever does. Keep an eye on the progress that Intel makes here, though. If the public starts to get clear signs that Intel is gaining traction with major mobile chipmakers, then that'll be the time to start thinking about the potential revenue and profit contributions to Intel from such business. Until then, though, I wouldn't factor in any meaningful upside from these efforts into any potential financial models. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News Intermedia Moves Nearly Half a Million McAfee users onto its New Email Protection Platform MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., April 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Intermedia, a leading cloud business applications provider, today announced that it has moved nearly half a million McAfee users onto its enhanced email security platform – Intermedia Email Protection. Now these customers gain not only better email protection, but complete mailbox integration and outstanding reliability and support. Intermedia originally partnered with McAfee because of McAfee’s reputation and the perception that Intel was continuing investments into the email security solution. However, when Intel Security abruptly shut down the McAfee SaaS security business to focus on enterprise, Intermedia was left with a difficult decision: enhance its existing email security platform, or find an alternative. „Leveraging 13 years of experience in the email security business, we invested heavily in our R&D team and third-party technologies. Now I am thrilled to say that we have enhanced our broader suite with an excellent, enterprise-grade cloud-based email security solution for SMBs that combines multiple industry-leading email security engines and antivirus solutions into one easy-to-manage and flexible platform. In addition, this high level of integration gives partners greater levels of control and protection over their core services offering, while letting them sell Intermedia Email Protection under their own brand,” said Michael Gold, CEO at Intermedia.   Company adds new capabilities to Intermedia Email Protection While many security and mailbox solutions are decoupled, Intermedia Email Protection bridges these capabilities.

Now these customers gain not only better email protection, but complete mailbox integration and outstanding reliability and support. Intermedia originally partnered with McAfee because of McAfee's reputation and the perception that Intel was continuing investments into the email security solution. However, when Intel Security abruptly shut down the McAfee SaaS security business to focus on enterprise, Intermedia was left with a difficult decision: enhance its existing email security platform, or find an alternative. "Leveraging 13 years of experience in the email security business, we invested heavily in our R&D team and third-party technologies. Now I am thrilled to say that we have enhanced our broader suite with an excellent, enterprise-grade cloud-based email security solution for SMBs that combines multiple industry-leading email security engines and antivirus solutions into one easy-to-manage and flexible platform. In addition, this high level of integration gives partners greater levels of control and protection over their core services offering, while letting them sell Intermedia Email Protection under their own brand," said Michael Gold, CEO at Intermedia.   Company adds new capabilities to Intermedia Email Protection While many security and mailbox solutions are decoupled, Intermedia Email Protection bridges these capabilities.

Digital Trends Home > Virtual Reality > Has Intel turned into a virtual reality film… Has Intel turned into a virtual reality film studio? We found out By Keith Nelson Jr. — April 3, 2017 3:00 AM Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Few companies have been as integral to bringing the future to computing for as long as Intel. Now Intel is putting its chips where the films are, acting as a sort of “tech whisperer” to help filmmakers create in virtual reality. Does that mean Intel, and other companies that power VR films, are becoming de facto movie studios? Helping moviemakers achieve their look is nothing new to Intel. The company provided processing technology to Dreamworks Animation in 2008, for instance. If you thought 2009’s Monsters vs. Aliens looked cool, you can thank Intel. More: YouTube wants to make it ‘Chocolate Rain’ in VR At this year’s South by South West (SXSW) festival, Intel helped with the world premiere of Eliza McNitt’s virtual reality film Fistful of Stars, a VR exploration into the life and death of a star from the view of the Intel-powered Hubble telescope. Digital Trends spoke with McNitt and Frank Soqui, head of Intel’s Virtual Reality Center of Excellence, about how the chipmaker meticulously helped put the film together. Intel, the VR film consultant If you ask Soqui how Intel views its role in the VR filmmaking process, he’ll tell you the company considers itself a “technology advisor.” But, as soon as he starts explaining how Intel helps, it becomes clear the chipmaker’s role is far more extensive than simply giving advice. Before any filming begins Intel provides “guidance on the technology, what the CPU can do, and what we can do in software to create a better experience,” Soqui said. Then the cameras start rolling, and Intel is there to help, literally, bring it all together. “You film for VR, but then you have to stitch that together,” Soqui told us. “There are pre-production aspects in terms of captures, and post-production aspects in terms of how does that film gets made so that it is interactive.” All of that requires high performance computing provided by back-end servers and engineers who know how to use them — both of which Intel has in abundance. And that’s not the extent of a technology advisor’s role; the Intel rabbit hole goes deeper. “Then you are producing the film, and it becomes a consumption thing. That consumption thing can land on multiple platforms,” Soqui said. “The idea is that it scales to the performance of the consumption device.” It’s more to enable [filmmakers] than to pay for movie content. Intel makes sure filmmakers have the equipment to film in VR, sometimes helps piece films together, and optimizes distribution strategies. That sounds a lot like what a movie studio does, short of paying for the film itself. “It’s more to enable [filmmakers] than to pay for movie content,” according to Soqui. Fistful of Stars director Eliza McNitt told Digital Trends that Intel played a pivotal role in the film’s creation by acting like a movie studio, providing servers to produce the film, computers for McNitt to view the film on the Oculus Rift, and helping her preview it at this year’s CES. “This is not something that could have existed many years ago,” McNitt said. “As an independent creator, Intel has empowered artists like myself who don’t work for a major Hollywood studio to be able to create this kind of an experience, completely on our own.” McNitt’s Fistful of Stars will be released in June through Viceland’s Beyond the Frame series for the Samsung Gear VR, before it is released on all VR platforms later. Mixed Reality Films For McNitt’s Fistful of Stars experience at SXSW, Intel provided Positron Voyager VR seats, the world’s first seats made for cinematic virtual reality. They vibrate, tilt, and give haptic feedback based on what you are viewing in virtual reality. And believe it or not, that is only the beginning of Intel’s ambitions to mix real life with the virtual. “Let’s say something was rushing at you and you wanted to block it with your hands; all you want to do is hold your hand up,” Soqui said. “Because the [RealSense] camera can detect depth in my hand, the movie would respond to the fact I put my hand up and block something.” That is thanks to Intel’s RealSense technology, which consists of 3D imaging, depth perception, interior mapping, and feature tracking. The company put two cameras with RealSense into its prototype headset, Project Alloy, to demonstrate mixed reality possibilities at this year’s CES. There, it showed how users might interact with VR objects in real time, and how the headset can turn a real space into a virtual play area. McNitt and Intel are working on an upcoming episodic virtual reality experience that explores the future of the human race among the stars. “There is a multiplayer social component in one of the episodes, and I want the RealSense camera as a way to incorporate viewers into the experience,” McNitt said. Us earthlings may be able to play with stars in a virtual reality movie as early as 2018, when the episodic VR experience is slated to be released. More: Intel revs up its autonomous driving efforts with the acquisition of Mobileye Soqui says this type of technology will be prevalent in movies “when filmmakers start to add more interactivity other than viewing to their films.” Filmmakers have been working towards that with programs such as Microsoft’s Actiongram, which lets filmmakers insert augmented holographic characters and effects into real life footage using Microsoft’s Hololens headset. Such films are visually impressive, with holographic astronauts exploring a real-life bathroom and actors talking with unicorns. But none of those mixed reality films let the viewer manipulate what goes on. Even Intel has underwhelmed in that regard. No Headset? No Problem As virtual reality, and specifically VR films, become more complex and interactive, we are going to need better HMD’s to enjoy them. Intel’s Project Alloy prototype headset was showcased recently to demonstrate features the future of VR headsets could possess. Alloy is a headset that has all the tracking sensors, cameras, computing power, and content you would need, without wires connected to an external device. It’s intriguing, but it still has a long way to go. One of the primary features Project Alloy was meant to display was the headset being able to track someone’s movements in virtual reality without having to set up external sensors. When we tested it at CES in January, however, the tracking didn’t work as well as it should, and we repeatedly bumped into real world objects not represented in the VR realm. The Oculus wireless headset prototype we tested last October was noticeably better at tracking. Intel welcomes the competition, because to the chipmaker, Alloy is more of a proof-of-concept than a marketable product. “Why would we enter the [virtual reality headset] market when our customers are doing these things, and we’re enabling them,” Soqui questioned. “I’m not there to compete with my customer.” Soqui then mentioned Intel’s “long history of showing people what it takes to innovate in these various, evolving form factors” including ultrabook designs. Alloy existing is not indicative of Intel’s intention of making a headset. It is just indicative of what Intel wants other companies to make. Intel is in the business of pushing VR technology forward beyond just films. It is using its WiGig chips to help HTC make its Vive wireless. It is planning to have its Alloy headset on sale — manufactured by as-of-yet unnamed Intel partners — by the end of the year. Intel may not be funding the next wave of virtual reality films, or even making the headsets you will watch them on. But the company powering some of the greatest 3D animated films ever made will likely be in the center of the VR film revolution. It will power the machines that innovate the industry, and make sure the filmmakers using it know what they are doing. In the land of VR films, companies like Intel are the new movie studios.

When it wished her happy anniversary she was downright disturbed. "It felt like they were tipping their hand a little too much," she said. "I had to take a step back and say 'ooh that's not good'. You've now told me much more about your tracking of me than I needed to know, in the guise of a personal experience. What you've done has gotten really creepy." Speaking at the AIIA Navigating Digital Government Summit in Canberra today, the former Intel anthropologist warned that government and industry needed to keep in mind the effect data and technology had on people. "It got too close. It was just too personal," the Australian National University professor said of her unnerving ATM experience. While data can give rise to "magic" user interactions, Bell explained, it could also cause people to be anxious about what was known about them. "We talk about big data and recommendation engines and algorithms. Consumers encounter it through preferences, they encounter it through things being served up to them which inevitably creates a sense of anxiety and questioning. Why is it that Netflix thinks I should watch that show? What is it they know about me that they imagine I should?" she said. Humans can sometimes fear their choices are being "prescribed by their past" by these algorithms, which by their nature work on retrospective data. "They want to imagine they're more interesting than that," she added.

Bell, who joined the ANU in February, recounted an Intel study into household water usage. In one case when a couple could see that one took a shower in the early evening after a business meeting, the other became suspicious of why. "Making data visible has the capacity to make a series of tacit rituals public and visible. And it turns out that's a little bit confronting," she said. Another study concerning agricultural IoT gave dairy cows RFID tags to they could trigger a automated milking process by themselves. While the farmers usually milked twice daily, given the ability, the cows were doing so far more often.

Scale that up and imagine what data can tell us about what things want that we hadn't thought about." Human in the middle Bell, who is recognised as a world leader in the ethnographic approach to developing technology, explained that though it was easy to be wooed by "provocative and remarkable and delightful" innovations, human users can't be forgotten. "If all we do is think about the technology we set ourselves up to not be as successful as we could and should be," she said. "Having humans in the middle, both as the objects and subjects and regulators of that technology is the most important and in some ways the hardest thing to do. "It's not just talking about digital transformation but digital transformation in a world where we are still human beings." @georgepnott Why Performance Matters When Building Your SD-WAN More from Silver Peak Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Intel Security has sold its majority stake in McAfee, which will now resume operations under its original name. The re-launch of McAfee marks the closing of the previously announced investment by TPG and Intel Corporation (INTC) to establish a pure-play cyber-security company. Additionally, McAfee announced that leading private equity investment firm Thoma Bravo has joined as a minority investor in the company through an agreement with TPG. As previously announced, Intel is retaining a 49 percent equity stake in the new entity. Raj Samani, the newly appointed chief scientist of McAfee spoke with us about the company's renewed vision and purpose coming from the newly appointed CEO, Chris Young. Promoting a unified approach to security, Young wishes to encourage the idea that “together is power”, according to Samani. McAfee is still wanting to “disrupt”, and is said to be looking to the future, wanting to secure connected cars and ensure the Internet of Things doesn't bring everything crashing down. “Cyber-security is the greatest challenge of the connected age, weighing heavily on the minds of parents, executives and world leaders alike,” said Christopher Young, CEO of McAfee. “As a standalone company with a clear purpose, McAfee gains the agility to unite people, technology and organisations against our common adversaries and ensure our technology-driven future is safe.” Like many security vendors, McAfee says it wishes to become the “number one security partner”. Samani confirmed despite his title, though he doesn't work wearing a white lab coat, and is now in charge of technical planning and strategy for the company. “Just don't call me Heisenberg,” joked Samani. Samani, an active participant of the information security community, confirmed he will continue his work on No More Ransom, a non-profit initiative he started with the Dutch Police, Europol and Kaspersky, working to help decrypt and recover the files of victims which suffer a ransomware infection. The initiative has helped save US$ 3 million from being paid to criminals, and the project is still going strong. “There's a healthy pipeline of announcements coming in the second quarter of 2017 on that side of things,” Samani said. We questioned Samani on the decision to keep the McAfee brand, which is often associated with John McAfee, the original founder of the company who sold it over 20 years ago, who has since made some dubious comments about security. Samani said despite this, the brand still carries recognition within the security industry saying, “people still know us as that brand”. Amusingly, the McAfee name will also live on through the silver screen, as Johnny Depp is expected to play John McAfee in ‘King of the Jungle', which portrays the rise and fall of the McAfee empire.

By: IANS | Bengaluru | Published: April 5, 2017 5:33 AM By 2020, the industry expects more servers to process data analytics than other workloads and analytics predictors will be built into every application. (Reuters) Global chip maker Intel on Tuesday announced a string of initiatives to boost the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in diverse sectors by collaborating with partners and customers across the country. “Our developer education programme will educate 15,000 scientists, developers, analysts and engineers on AI technologies, including Deep Learning and Machine Learning in India,” said Intel South Asia Managing Director Praksh Mallya here. AI is a software programme that makes computers and machines think intelligently and faster with more predictability than a human mind. AI is also the main workload in data centres which operate in line with the Moore’s Law of computing power doubling every year. By 2020, the industry expects more servers to process data analytics than other workloads and analytics predictors will be built into every application. Intel powers 97 per cent of data centre servers running AI workloads and offers flexible performance-optimised portfolio of solutions. Through 60 programmes in a year, the initiatives will empower the community with the know-how for AI adoption with ready-to-deploy platforms and tools for solution development. “As India undergoes digital transformation, the data centre and the intelligence behind the data collected will enable the government and industry to make quick decisions based on algorithms,” said Mallya on the margins of Intel’s ‘AI Day 2017’. Also Watch: The company’s Indian subsidiary is collaborating with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Wipro, Julia Computing and Calligo Technologies for using AI in the country. “Our collaboration with the industry and the academia will help democratise AI, by reducing entry barriers for developers, data scientists and students,” noted Mallya. The subsidiary is targeting the BFSI (Banks, Financial Services and Insurance), telecom, and e-commerce sectors, across High Performance Computing (HPC), big data and Internet of Things, which are complementary to AI,” added Mallya. The onset of AI-based technology in India is evident in e-commerce and research, where entities using data analytics are looking to explore AI. “Our research groups are working on implementation of evolutionary algorithms in parallel environments and using Intel platforms and software tools to deploy, parallelise and optimise systems,” said IIT-Patna Director Pushpak Bhattacharya. With its unified approach, Intel leads the AI computing era through hardware and software designed for building AI applications across industries. Intel’s collaboration with companies like Google and is acquisitions, including Saffron, Movidius, Nervana Systems and Mobileye, further its AI capabilities, giving it an edge at a time when embedded computer vision is becoming increasingly important the world over.

There are even new ARM processors that are somewhat comparable to the previous generation desktop processors. This jump in performance led many to speculate that Apple could be making a jump as well to ARM for its line of laptops like the MacBook Pro. While it could be quite possible, Apple made it clear that it does not have any intentions of changing systems for the MacBook Pro or any other Mac device. According to Axios, Apple has no intentions of using an ARM chip to a Mac or a MacBook Pro as a main system. However, the company is not closing its doors on the possibility for more ARM chips used for peripheral devices. At the moment, the latest MacBook Pro is already equipped with an ARM chip. This chip controls the Touch Bar and Touch ID features of the 1026 MacBook Pro. While the prospect of using an ARM chip to MacBook Pro is quite enticing, it will remain to be with the mobile devices that Apple sells in the market. MacBook Pro 2016 (via apple.com) Even if Apple chooses to switch to the ARM platform, it is not entirely new to the company. In fact, back in 2006, Apple made a huge decision to ditch the PowerPC line of processors in favor of the Intel line of chips. Another aspect of it not being a surprise at all is the fact that Intel has been lagging behind in terms of performance for a few years now. Its old strategy of small incremental upgrades for each product released has led to the boost in market for other products like the AMD Ryzen processor. Perhaps the most obvious change that could possibly come is the switch to AMD processors instead of ARM chips. Right now, Intel is caught between a rock and a hard place as AMD unleashed its newest line of cheap and high-performance processors. Maybe in the near future, consumers could be seeing a Mac product that uses an AMD processor. In hindsight, Apple has already made the switch to AMD graphics on the new MacBook Pros and Mac Pros. It is only a matter of time before it makes the same switch to AMD processors. For more updates on the MacBook Pro, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

    Home About Antiwar.com Donate Blog US Casualties Contact Latest News Trump Removes Steve Bannon From National Security Council Restores Positions on Council to Intel Chief, Joint Chiefs Chairman by Jason Ditz, April 05, 2017 Print This | Share This Back in late January, President Trump surprised many with a reshuffle of the National Security Council, adding his chief strategist Steve Bannon to the council while removing the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman and the Director of National Intelligence. Today, he reversed course, booting Bannon off the council, restoring both of the previously removed posts to the principals committee, and also adding the Secretary of Energy, the CIA Director, and the US Ambassador to the United Nations to the committee. There were reports of Bannon clashing with National Security Adviser HR McMaster, and the move is seen as a boost for McMaster, as the revision also downgrades the authority of Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert, putting him under McMaster’s control. Interestingly, White House officials say that the only reason they put Bannon on the council in the first place was to “keep an eye” on former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned  in February, and that Bannon’s appointment was always intended to be temporary. Officials added that Bannon never attended a single meeting of the council in his role.

Still leaves one wonderin why to let the navigator go this early in the voyage… Must more to this than Thanks Alot! Good job baby sitting… See you soon… Or not… Stay tuned… Who knows what rocks they yill find in the sea of tears ahead without Bannon to steer away from peril.. What think you..?? Tonyandoc Even Trump cannot avoid getting stuck in the tar-pit that is Washington. Populism and nationalism are not permitted within the establishment. Trump probably got the same message recently as Elizabeth Warren got from from Larry Summers back in 2009. The Democrats took care of the Sanders threat in-house. The elites’ firewall is still working as designed. Ten Count Toronto Probably a McMaster demand. At this point I think Trump is already just a hostage in his own presidency as most of his inner circle from the campaign is separated from him and those still around are under enormous pressure & threat of investigations and trial in the media, right up to his son-in-law.

But trucks, particularly semi-trucks, often get left out of the discussion. Until now. Peloton Technology, a startup based in Mountain View, Calif., that’s backed by Intel Corp., has created technology it says would reduces the danger of trucks traveling in close proximity to each other, according to Automotive News. The technology reportedly tracks vehicle locations, and then matches up trucks headed in similar directions at similar times. Once the trucks meet up, Peloton’s system would assume control of breaking and acceleration, leaving drivers in control of steering, per Automotive News. As a result, the trucks would travel nose-to-tail, reducing the chances for collisions. Peloton reportedly is working to perfect its system through various testing, and is enlisting the help of truck operators, vehicle manufacturers and technology providers, among others. “We are finishing validation of a real product,” Peloton CEO Josh Switkes told Automotive News on Wednesday. “It’s hard to make a safety-critical system like this a commercial product.” With the help of Peloton’s technology, the $700-billion trucking industry reportedly would be able to save money on wind resistance and fuel costs. Although the system would enable trucks to platoon, it first would check various safety factors, including weather, to determine if platooning is viable, Automotive News reports. Peloton reportedly aims for the technology to be deployed commercially by the end of this year. The company is about to close a $60 million round of funding, according to Automotive News, including an investment from Intel. The California startup reportedly believes its technology is just one step away from full automation, something it says it will work on in the future.

The Mountain View, Calif.-based company has created technology that makes it less dangerous for trucks to travel in close proximity to each other, enabling them to cut wind resistance and fuel costs. It's about to close a $60 million round of funding that includes an investment from Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Omnitracs, a truck fleet management spinoff from Qualcomm Inc., said it's leading the new investment round. Peloton is aiming for commercial deployment by the end of this year, CEO Josh Switkes said in a phone interview. He declined to comment on the funding round. The company has been working with regulators, truck operators, vehicle manufacturers and other technology providers to perfect its system via on-road and track-based testing, Switkes said. "We are finishing validation of a real product," he said. "It's hard to make a safetycritical system like this a commercial product." Peloton's technology tracks the location of vehicles and then matches up trucks headed in the same direction at the same time. When they meet, the system takes control of breaking and acceleration to allow them to travel nose-to-tail and avoid collisions. Their drivers remain in control of steering. According to Peloton, its technology allows a saving of 7% in costs when trucks are traveling at 65 mph. About 40% of the expense of operating longhaul fleets goes to fuel. The system also helps keep everyone safer as it eliminates the delay humans create between recognizing the need to slow down and hitting the brakes, Switkes said. The truck in front tells the one following to brake electronically. Peloton's system also arranges trucks in a platoon in order according to their braking ability, checks the local weather conditions to see whether it's safe to team up at all and lets vehicles convoy only on roads that have been cleared as safe for such a system. The company will charge truck companies fees for installation and per mile of platooning. The savings in fuel are created through aerodynamics. Putting the trucks close to each other and using radar sensors and wireless communications reduces turbulence and drag. The company believes its technology is a step on the way to full automation, which it will work on in the future. Omnitracs is planning joint deployment of Peloton's technology.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News Intilop’s 10G Full TCP Accelerators IP Core with Network Security Features for Altera/Intel FPGAs Intilop’s 10G Full TCP Accelerators with Network Security Features IP Core for Altera/Intel FPGAs is qualified by major University and government clients Milpitas, CA. – Apr 5th, 2017 – Another industry first: As the adaption of their TCP Acceleration Technology becomes more widespread around the globe that includes Government Security, Universities, Cloud Servers, Financial and many other equipment classes, this Security module is an add on module to their TCP and UDP Accelerators providing unprecedented functionality of Network Traffic Security combined with Full TCP & UDP Acceleration at 10G. Intilop’s 40G TCP/UDP without Security module was demoed at Supercomputing 2015 in Austin, TX Security module for 40G TOE & UOE will be released in the near future. Intilop, Inc., a pioneer, most respected and recognized leader in providing Ultra-Low latency and Hyper Performance Complex Networking Protocol Accelerators like Full TCP, UDP, IGMP & other Mega IP Cores, Systems and Solutions since 2009, delivers yet another industry first: a full TCP and UDP Accelerator with Network Security capability which performs functions of firewall and other monitoring functions at full line rate. In addition to full TCP/UDP offloading, this security module performs port filtering, blocking, monitoring and related functions in FPGA hardware thereby relieving CPU from these tasks. They are performed in nanosecond speeds and with ultra-precision and zero jitter. During network security processing, the CPU gets bogged down under high traffic rates, sometimes missing some ‘Events’, can be used for other application functions. So this is a win-win situation for both. Ultra-fast and precise processing time of around 100 nanoseconds for this module including TCP and UDP with thousands of sessions initially at 10G, sets the bar much higher for speed and performance powered by a 7+ year mature and proven TCP Protocol Compliant architecture.

Featuresby Robert Triggs13 hours ago 7 272 11 Last week, Samsung began making noise about its future generation 7nm manufacturing technology that is expected to arrive in the coming years. Currently, Samsung and its main rival TSMC are manufacturing 14nm and 16nm processors for smartphones, with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 and Samsung’s Exynos 8895 being the first to make use of Samsung’s latest 10nm FinFET node. New advancements in sub-10nm manufacturing will eventually lead to even more power efficient processors, and therefore better battery life and performance for our smartphones. However, Samsung’s semiconductor rivals are also looking to be the first to reach this next major milestone, so let’s see who’s likely to be first.. Samsung To recap the company’s announcements, Samsung has invested significant capital into boosting the production capacities of its 7nm manufacturing line, in order to accommodate anticipated semiconductor production in the future. This investment expected to bear fruit in early 2019, meaning at least a couple of year’s to wait until Samsung’s 7nm capabilities are up and running. Samsung’s 7nm chip production capacity is expected to increase throughout 2018, but we probably won’t see any mobile processors until 2019. Samsung is already trialling its 7nm process, but has so far only demonstrated its technology to repair rather than construct SRAM modules. This suggests that product rollouts are further away than the company’s recent announcements suggest. Interestingly, the company appears to be working on several next-generation process nodes, having recently stated that “8nm and the 6nm will inherit all innovations from the latest 10nm and the 7nm technologies”. Samsung says that technical details for these 8nm and the 6nm nodes will be showcased to customers at a dedicated U.S Samsung Foundry Forum that is starting on May 24, so we’ll know more about the company’s plans in a couple of month’s time. Samsung’s 7nm chip production capacity is expected to increase throughout 2018, but we probably won’t see any mobile processors until 2019. In the meantime, the company is planning to ramp up production of its advanced 10nm LPP and LPU models over 2017 and 2018. EUV technology is seen as the superior for smaller manufacturing processes and will probably be key to reaching 5nm in the future. TSMC TSMC appears to be much more aggressive in its pursuit of 7nm than Samsung. The foundry’s roadmap currently points to a mid 2018 commercial availability for 7nm processors, after the company is expected to start limited risk production in the coming months. Interestingly, TSMC is not pursuing EUV technology for its 7nm line and is sticking with 193nm immersion lithography tools. The company plans to use EUV for its 5nm chips instead, which could even be ready before the end of 2019. Unlike Samsung, TSMC is not pursuing EUV technology for its 7nm line and is sticking with 193nm immersion lithography tools instead. Importantly, ARM has been collaborating with TSMC to help scale its processor designs to 7nm FinFET. This partnership will help mobile SoC developers expedite the development of their products to take quick advantage of TSMC’s upcoming production lines. Cadence Design Systems, a company that offers development tools for SoC designers, has also announced certification for compatibility with TSMC’s 7nm FinFET process after some close collaboration. This also means that more tools are available for developers to start designing processors that can be built using TSMC’s platform. See also: ARM and TSMC team up to create a 7nm chip March 15, 2016 TSMC has already showcased a 7nm SRAM chip, a key milestone on the road to more complicated SoC circuits, and states that it is seeing “healthy” yields from its process. The company has also recently been reportedly testing a 7nm, 12 CPU core processor developed in conjunction with MediaTek. Small volume risk production of a more advanced 7nm+ process is expected to appear by June 2018. This suggests that TSMC is quite far ahead of Samsung, which could lead to the company securing a number of contracts from its mobile chip rival. Apple already moved over to TSMC last year, and Qualcomm may being eying up space on the foundry’s 7nm line if Samsung’s technology remains a year behind. See also: TSMC wants to build a new factory for 5nm and 3nm chips December 9, 2016 GlobalFoundries GlobalFounderies hasn’t featured in the mobile SoC market in the past few generations but may make a comeback with the arrival of 7nm. The company close to forgo 10nm production, but is still keeping up with the competition when it comes to the next major silicon manufacturing milestone. At the last update, the foundry is looking towards the second half of 2018 as its launch window for its first commercial 7nm products. GlobalFounderies is expected to finalize its production facilities in the second half of 2017. The foundry has already begun producing test wafers at its Fab 8 in Malta, New York. Like TSMC, the company is currently using the existing 193nm wavelength technology, but is looking to incorporate EUV tools into its production flow further down the line. This likely means that GlobalFoundies’ EUV technology won’t be available until sometime in 2019 at the earliest, which is when we’re likely to see Samsung enter the 7nm market with the same technology. 7nm production will be sticking with the current FinFET transistor design, but may look to new materials and other improvements to boost performance. Intel Intel has historically been one of the leaders in the processor fabrication business and last year made moves to start producing 10nm chips for the mobile market. Intel Custom Foundry partnered with ARM to announce two Cortex-A based POP IP chips back in August. LG is also a relatively new Intel customer listing and one that is rumored to be launching its own mobile SoC manufactured by the company, so Intel is certainly worth watching. So far, Intel hasn’t unveiled the technology it will be using for its next-generation 7nm process, but the suspicion is that it will be following Samsung and GlobalFoundries down the EUV route. See also: ARM partners with Intel Custom Foundry, ARM chips for LG on the way? August 16, 2016 Currently, Intel is said to be upgrading its Fab 42 manufacturing plant in Arizona to start building these chips, which could cost the company around $7 billion. However, the refitting could take three, possibly four years, meaning that mass volume production is still likely some way away. Therefore, the earliest that Intel will begin pushing its first 7nm products off the line is likely to be sometime in H2 2019. The company has been later than its competitors with 10nm and Intel is looking increasingly behind the curve in the pursuit of 7nm too. It’s production line is not expected to start rolling off volume production until later in 2020. H2 2018 is the date Although companies are already talking up their next generation processing nodes, 10nm has only just arrived and we should be plenty content and even exciting about products heading our way that make the most of this new technology. 7nm development is underway, but we are still just over a year away from the earliest commercial launch estimate from TSMC and GlobalFoundries, and that’s if everything goes according to plan between now and then. For smartphone SoCs, this likely means that we won’t see many major, if any, 7nm platforms launch until early 2019, as this is when most companies choose to launch their latest high-end smartphone and typically follows new flagship chip announcements from Qualcomm. We are likely to see 10nm FinFET and subsequent revisions be the process of choice for mobile SoCs throughout 2017 and 2018.

There’s new security options for logging in, and new cameras that deliver acceptable photos. Changes inside have made the Surface Pro 4 faster at transferring pictures and video. It is booth cooler and quieter than past Windows 2-in-1s from Microsoft. There’s one problem with the Surface Pro 4 though. Despite big upgrades in other areas, the Surface Pro 4 gets the same battery life as the Surface Pro 3. Crank up the display brightness and it’s possible to get even less battery life. Many blame the lack of better battery life on its sharper display. Whatever the reason, only being able to match the battery life of the Surface Pro 3 is a big potential problem for Surface Pro 4 buyers. Read: Surface Pro 4 Review – The Best There Is There are some ways that you can extend the amount of time your Surface Pro 4 lasts between charges. Many of these tricks apply to Windows 10 devices that aren’t made by Microsoft. Get Better Surface Pro 4 Battery Life: Use the Darker & Darkest Setting For Display Ever since the iPhone, ambient light sensors have let smartphones measure the amount of light around them. Devices use the information from the sensor to dim their screen accordingly. Automatic screen brightness lets your device eek out battery life by only making the screen bright enough so that it’s comfortably readable, but not overly bright. On the Surface Pro 4, swipe from the right edge of your screen to open the Action Center. Tap the Expand option. Now tap or click on the Suggested box. Tapping it repeatedly changes it between Darker, Darkest, Suggested, Brighter and Brightest. Go with Darker or Darkest for more battery life. The Surface Pro 4’s display is its biggest battery draw. Get Better Surface Pro 4 Battery Life: Disconnect Any Extras Almost everything that’s connected to the single USB port on your Surface Pro 4 is pulling from its battery. Disconnecting extras can marginally improve battery life. When you’re near a power plug, consider charging through the power supply that comes with the Intel Core i5 and Intel Core i7 versions of the Surface Pro 4 instead of your device. This will get your device charged faster and save you from having to draw on your Surface Pro 4 when away from a power plug. When between charges, unplug any accessory that’s not essential to what you’re doing at that moment. Get Better Surface Pro 4 Battery Life: Pause OneDrive Syncing Microsoft built OneDrive cloud storage into Windows 10, giving users the option to keep their stuff in sync with their folders online. The moment you add anything to your OneDrive folder, Windows attempts to put a copy on its online service. If you’re noticing a significant amount of battery drain, try pausing OneDrive syncing until the next time you’ve connected your PC to a power plug. Read: Is Microsoft OneDrive Worth Using? Get Better Surface Pro 4 Battery Life: Turn Off Extra Connectivity Another big draw on battery power for the Surface Pro 4 is Wi-Fi. Having Wi-Fi off when not in use can improve your experience. It’s not a great idea to go turning the feature off all the time, but its great for situations where you already expect to not be connected – like planes, trains and long car rides. Tap the Wi-Fi icon in the right corner of the Taskbar. Flipping on Airplane Mode with a tap will shut off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, boosting your Surface Pro 4’s battery life while it’s off. Get Better Surface Pro 4 Battery Life: Change When Your Device Sleeps Another way that the Surface Pro 4 creates the illusion that it’s just a tablet is a feature Microsoft used to call Connected Standby. When users hit a power button on their phone or tablet, they aren’t really turning it off. It’s going into sleep mode, where it still can pull down email updates, stay connected to the internet, and continue to stream music. The Surface Pro 4 is no different, which can have an impact on battery life. Open the Settings app from the Start Screen or Start Menu, depending on whether you have Tablet Mode turned on or off. Tap or click on System. Tap or click on Power & Sleep. From this screen you can have your Surface Pro 4 automatically turn off when it is on its own battery power for just a minute. There’s also options for disabling Wi-Fi connectivity when in Sleep. Finally, there’s a switch for letting Cortana manage power options depending on your location. Get Better Surface Pro 4 Battery Life: Close Power Hungry Programs This needs repeating, there are programs that can have a huge impact on battery life. These programs are usually feature rich and downloaded through a web browser. Great examples are iTunes and the Adobe suite of media creation tools. Also, Google’s Chrome browser is known to be a huge offender. Close non essential programs and your Surface Pro 4 has to do less work. Less work means there is less power required for the processor. Your device will last longer. Get Better Surface Pro 4 Battery Life: Sync Your Email Less To go hand in hand with that examination of apps that consume too much battery power, take a look at how often you have Outlook or Outlook Mail check for new messages. Every time these app search for new messages, they’re hitting your battery life just a bit. For the Outlook Mail app included with Windows 10, go to the Settings app and look in Accounts. Now select Email & App Accounts. Tap or click on each account and select manage to lower the amount of times your PC checks that account for new emails. Get Better Surface Pro 4 Battery Life: Turn On Power Saver Mode Like Windows Phone before it, the Surface Pro 4 has a special mode meant for situations where longer battery life is required. It’s called Power Saver Mode and it can be toggled at any time or configured to turn on automatically. Tap or click on the battery icon in your Taskbar on the right side. Now click or tap on Battery Saver. Surface Pro 4 Battery Life Quick Tips Check to see how much battery life your device has left by tapping or clicking on the battery icon in the Taskbar. This estimate is updated in real-time> It’s based on your screen brightness and processor load. The Surface Pro line had a Power Cover at one point that almost doubled battery life. Unfortunately, Microsoft never refreshed the Power Cover when it introduced the Surface 3 and Surface Pro 3. Some report good results with the Power Cover and Surface Pro 4, but it’s not an officially supported accessory any longer. Good luck with your Surface Pro 4. Here’s to hoping these tips lead to better battery Surface Pro 4 battery life for you. 2 Responses 12/19/2015 Mamiemknotts Reply 2=7 my classmate’s step-sister makes $81 /hr on the internet .

By Ryan Borker • 04/05/17 9:58am Many founders seem to have a Messiah complex. ‘Follow me,’ they say. Pixabay This article originally appeared on Quora: Why are many successful tech CEOs belligerent? I’ve noticed in many (but not all) Silicon Valley CEO’s a phenomenon that I’d call Management by Unreasonable Standards. For tech companies, it happens to be an unreasonably effective strategy. It’s a simple management equation: Unreasonable Standards + Past Successes = License to be unreasonable in all situations. #1 Unreasonable Standards Unreasonable standards in tech companies play on beliefs that people in Silicon Valley accept without question as true: They (the employee) are smarter, better and more creative than anyone else They (the employee and the company) through technology can solve the world’s problems Their work is ‘disrupting’ the world – doing things that have never been done before that will totally change the way everything is done If you believe these things, that you’re basically God’s gift to AdTech or photosharing or whatever, then of course it follows that you can do things that seem impossible. If it weren’t the case that you could do the impossible, then you wouldn’t be smarter than everyone else or your company could just be one of the millions of other companies out there. And that would shake your world view, wouldn’t it? #2 Credible Past Successes As the leader of DisruptCo, you basically tell everyone that your rocket, or your phone, or your chips, will change the world. In the best cases, this is perceptibly true. Intel, Apple, and Tesla are in fact fundamentally changing the way the world works with technology. Your employees see the change. They own it. They feel motivated by the mission. These past successes and examples in the outside world show that something is in fact possible that people didn’t think was possible. Nokia? Killed by Apple and the genius of the iPhone. Blockbuster? Destroyed by Netflix. If your vision is something that people don’t think is possible, you sometimes need to ask them why not? Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos anecdotally do this frequently. In some instances, if engineers say something is impossible, Musk himself will come up with the solution and present it. If that happens twice, the engineer who said it was impossible is fired. Unreasonable in ALL Situations So we see that some of the best leaders are in fact brilliant visionaries. They can solve problems themselves that others can’t. They can ‘skate to where the puck is going’ and have been proven to be right in so many ways. The fact that the world has changed as they predicted is proof. So they learn to think they’re right all of the time. The worst buy into their own genius. They can’t be wrong, or at least no one else is likely to be more right than them. Culture soon follows. Everyone aspiring to be Steve Jobs or Elon Musk cascades the questions they receive (why isn’t this possible) down the line? They take personal responsibility for not solving the problem. This isn’t inherently a bad thing. Intel continually produces the best chips in the world. Tesla has made some amazing bets and may shake up the car industry through better technology. Trickle Down What happens, however, is that this becomes endemic in Silicon Valley. Many startup founders who very clearly aren’t Steve Jobs take the ethos that managing by unreasonable standards is what makes Jeff Bezos great. It is propagated further by the following logic: Great leaders do this, therefore if I do this I will be a great leader The best talent will want to join the great companies, and I show that I’m a great company by managing by unreasonable standards As a result, this kind of belief propagates throughout silicon valley and tech in general. If you DON’T manage by unreasonable standards, you must not be visionary enough or pushing your team hard enough. This is patently silly, but it creates the culture of the ‘belligerent’ CEO. You have to have an outspoken ‘visionary’ opinion or people overlook you. You can’t accept human limitations or you’re weak. The above portrayal is a bit exaggerated, but not far from the truth. It’s why many founders seem to have a Messiah complex. ‘Follow me,’ they say, ‘and I’ll take you to the promised land of IPO and incredible riches and fame.’ If there’s just a clear business plan, a great insight and better technology, it isn’t enough. Many SV people don’t want to be part of a good plan based on solid ideas. They want to see around the corners and be the next Apple. Coda: A Short Story Imagine you’re managing your local movie theater. A couple walks up to the ticket booth and buys two tickets for the 9:30pm movie. Afterwards, you yell at the employee: “Why didn’t you sell them 3 tickets to the show??!! We could have increased profits by 50%!” The employee, reasonably, might quit on the spot, or suggest you go to the loony bin. The movie ticket buying experience is for the most part solved and defined. Demanding employees sell extra movie tickets won’t necessarily help. Now imagine you’re Jeff Bezos in 2010, you see the success of Prime 2 day delivery. That was an amazing logistical hurdle, and your employees are proud of the achievement. But instead of resting, you say to the employees: “Why can’t we deliver within 2 hours?” These employees are possibly flabbergasted. They’ve moved heaven and earth to get 2 day delivery. But Jeff is insistent: “What’s preventing us from delivering within 2 hours?” Well, we don’t have the distribution centers set up to pick orders in < 30 minutes. Well why don’t we build that technology? It would take forever to train people to do that? How would we balance normal orders? Can’t we experiment and see what works? How would we handle traffic jams? Don’t we have enough data to make sure we hit 95% of our packages on time? We can’t prevent everything, but we can come close. One by one the excuses and limitations come down, and the Amazon engineers and analysts get to work… Related links: Will malls still exist in the US in 2025?

It’s about the size of New Jersey, with just 8.5 million people. It may be easy for investors to overlook it, but that would be a big mistake. That’s because this mighty mite is a global technology powerhouse. It holds the following world rankings: #2 in innovation (World Economic Forum in 2016) #3 in quality of scientific institutions #3 in company spending on R&D #3 in university-industry collaboration on R&D #4 in capacity for innovation #5 in patent applications per million citizens #2 in R&D spending as a % of GDP And when it comes to technological advancements, it actually scores higher than the U.S.! This country has more scientists, engineers, tech companies and venture capital investment per capita than any other country in the world … More than 270 major international technology and industrial companies have significant operational and R&D centers there. That long (and growing) list includes 3M, Apple, Cisco Systems, General Electric, General Motors, Google, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, Qualcomm, Renault-Nissan, Samsung, SAP, Siemens and Tata Group. Plenty of universities and governments also partner with this country’s campuses and institutions, or on bilateral R&D projects: But the thing is, few people know about it — or don’t make the connection. That means this country is an uncharted territory for the overwhelming majority of the investment community. So amateur and professional investors, and even many large institutional investors, are missing out on its potential. However, some pretty smart folks DO know about it. And they have commented on this country’s investment prospects. But you won’t find their comments in the mainstream media … Warren Buffett stated: If you’re going to the Middle East to look for oil, you can skip [this country]. If you’re looking for brains, look no further. [This country] has shown that it has a disproportionate amount of brains and energy. [This country] is the leading, largest and most-promising investment hub outside the United States. Bill Gates declared: The innovation going on in [this country] is critical to the future of the technology business. Rupert Murdoch commented: Armed with the energy and drive of a young nation, [this country] has overcome its small size and population to achieve some truly remarkable developments in science, technology and medicine. With such a wealth of creativity and drive, I fully expect [this country] to remain at the forefront of technological development into the future. Even Albert Einstein saw its promise when he once said: [This country] can win the difficult battle for survival only by developing, painstakingly, the intelligence and expert knowledge of her young people in the field of technology. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates aren’t the only prominent investors with vested interest in this country’s burgeoning tech sector. Carlos Slim, Mark Cuban, Jeff Bezos and Donald Trump are investing there. And celebrities Leonardo DiCaprio, Ashton Kutcher, Toby Maguire, Bono, Serena Williams, Lance Armstrong, Billie Jean King and Jay-Z have investment dollars there, too. So, what do all these companies, colleges, governments, institutions, masterminds and famous affluent people know about this country that most investors don’t? Well, they recognize Israel is a sleepy technology dynamo with an abundance of innovation and intelligence. They understand why Israel has been named the “Start-Up Nation.” And why it’s home to more start-ups and innovative companies than any other country in the world. They know the “technology” coming out of Israel goes beyond just computers and chips. A wide range of innovative technology is derived from Israel: biotech, agriculture-tech, defense-tech, clean-tech, info-tech, etc. And they’re aware of one key ingredient that’s present in most Israeli companies … The real genius of Israel — specifically, its tech sector — comes from the military. There’s obligatory military service in Israel. Men must serve from age 18 to 21. And women must serve from age 18 to 20. In terms of imagination and creativity, the mind at 18 is very different than the mind at 30. So, this nation has a lot of really diverse, well-educated, well-trained, highly motivated young people who are constantly coming up with new ideas. Young Israeli men and women are forced to assume leadership responsibilities and to be self-sufficient … After all, you have to be innovative when you’re outnumbered 100-to-1, if not 1,000-to-1, by your enemies. Israelis can’t fight by manpower, so they fight with brainpower. They’re constantly reinventing technologies. The help of the government really brings that intelligence to market. When Israeli computer engineers and intelligence department workers finish their military service, they go out into the Israeli business world. They’re free to use everything they learned in the military and build new technologies that will be important to the rest of the world. Virtually every Israeli tech company that’s involved in communications has its roots in the Israeli military. Most of the publicly traded and private-sector companies have founders who came from intelligence units or the engineering department of the military.Private and public Israeli companies — and U.S. companies with R&D operations in Israel — covet these workers. Remember, more than 270 major international technology and industrial companies have chosen to set up offices there to tap into the country’s tech talent. Many of the military-to-business-world transformers are responsible for creating innovative technologies … For example, high-tech Israel companies have developed: Machine Vision Technology. Using advanced camera technology and sophisticated algorithms to assist in driver navigation and collision avoidance. Smart Drip Irrigation. Releasing water in controlled amounts has allowed for precise crop irrigation and water conservation. PillCam. A “pill” capable of recording images of the digestive tract. It has revolutionized the visualization and detection of digestive-tract diseases and medical disorders. USB Flash Drive. A compact device that allows for easy storage and transportation of files. And there are many others, as well. How can a country with such a massive footprint in the global tech ecosystem fall through the cracks? An Under-covered, Under-researched, Not-yet-realized Opportunity Most people … and most investors … have no idea that many of the world’s leading companies have important R&D facilities — or are domiciled — in Israel. Nor do most technology users — from online shoppers to Fortune 500 companies — know that they’re using Israeli tech applications and solutions daily, and that there is a lot of “Israel Inside” their devices and technology. Israeli tech is in the news all the time. But the media, readers and watchers usually don’t make the connection. Israeli tech companies frequently provide the critical “back end” to companies like Amazon(AMZN), IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT) and Samsung (SSNLF). Many Israeli-born, technology-related companies like Check Point Software Technologies(CHKP), Mobileye (MBLY) — with Intel’s major $15.3 billion buyout announced mid-March, Amdocs (DOX), Stratasys (SSYS), CyberArk Software (CYBR), Mazor Robotics (MZOR), SodaStream International (SODA) and Wix.com (WIX) are leaders in their fields. On top of a general lack of recognition, most of these companies don’t make it into the portfolios of actively managed funds, popular indexes or ETFs. Part of the reason is Israel moved from an emerging market to a developed market in 2010. While that’s an upgrade for the country, its weight dropped from 3%-3.5% in emerging-market indexes to 0.4%-0.5% in developed-market indexes. Because of this large weight reduction, most active international equity managers can either completely ignore Israel equities … or simply grab a name or two to fill a miniscule weight in their portfolio. So, even with Israel’s importance in the global tech supply chain, investors still don’t get exposure through major tech indexes and ETFs. Steven Schoenfeld, the Founder and CIO of BlueStar Indexes, told me: The Nasdaq-100 Index (tracked by the QQQ ETF) has only one Israeli company … the Nasdaq-100 Technology Index (tracked by the QTEC ETF) has one Israeli company … the S&P Global 1200 Information Technology Index (tracked by the IXN ETF) has zero Israeli companies … and the S&P Small Cap 600 Information Technology Index (tracked by the PSCT ETF) has just three Israeli companies. Clearly, the representation of Israeli tech stocks in the world’s most-prominent tech indexes/ETFs does not comport with Israel’s significance in the global tech sector. There’s a solid workaround (actually, two efficient ways) for this. And you don’t need to be a billionaire or private equity or venture capital investor to capture Israeli tech in your portfolio. The BlueStar TA-BIGITech Israel Tech ETF (ITEQ) and VanEck Vectors Israel ETF (ISRA) can make investing in the new Silicon Valley accessible to investors of all types and sizes. The Nasdaq-listed ITEQ tracks the TASE-BlueStar Israel Global Technology Index. This index currently has 56 constituents that are Israeli companies, regardless of their listing venue. This ETF and the index provide exposure exclusively to Israeli “high-tech” companies such as information technology, cyber-security, biotechnology and defense technology. The NYSE-listed ISRA tracks the BlueStar Israel Global Index. The index currently has 118 constituents made up of Israeli companies, including those listed on the NYSE, Nasdaq, London Stock Exchange and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. This ETF and the index provide exposure to all sectors of the Israeli economy, including pharmaceuticals, technology, real estate, energy and consumer-related sectors. Both Israel ETFs are off to a nice start in 2017. For Q1, ITEQ finished up +14.3%, while QQQ finished up +12%. And ISRA was up +8.7%, while SPY was up +5.9%. Combined, these two ETFs have less than $50 million in assets. Considering there’s about $15 trillion in U.S. mutual funds and another $3 trillion in U.S. ETFs, that’s barely a blip on the radar. Whether Israeli tech companies are shunned due to their domicile, a negative country stance or other index methodology restrictions, they will likely receive more recognition — and investor interest — at some point soon. The compelling Israel Tech story and the two ETFs’ outperformance in Q1 2017 should help raise the profile of both ITEQ and ISRA. BlueStar Indexes Director of Research Joshua Kaplan suggests an Israeli equity discovery could be under way … When we speak to financial advisers about investing in Israel they are often confounded as to how their clients have such little exposure to Israel. The country is one of the most stable and strongest economies in the world with an explosive tech sector. Israeli equities have the potential to be strong alpha generators outside the well-covered large cap space and more informationally-efficient areas of the market. There’s also strong fundamental investment case for Israeli stocks to boot. To learn more about the BlueStar TA-BIGITech Israel Tech ETF (ITEQ), click here.

The VanEck Vectors Israel ETF (NYSE:ISRA) was unchanged in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, ISRA has gained 8.39%, versus a 5.56% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. ISRA currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #9 of 38 ETFs in the Energy Equities ETFs category. This article is brought to you courtesy of Uncommon Wisdom Daily.

AOL, Yahoo mocked over new name in Verizon merger Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press Follow on Twitter on April 05, 2017 at 6:58 AM, updated April 05, 2017 at 10:26 AM comments Oath is a Verizon company as part of AOL's merger with Yahoo.Twitter  Verizon will meld AOL with Yahoo and rebrand the operation as Oath, AOL chief Tim Armstrong announced yesterday. This comes around April 1, so it could be the back end of a dumb April Fool's Day joke. If it's not, I would immediately claim that it is a joke, because it's a good way to backtrack on a terrible idea. Like Tronc, Oath is not a pleasant word. It sounds like a creepy, cultish organization. In Oath, there's definitely a secret handshake and a weird hat. In fact, Armstrong's tweet encourages people to #TaketheOath. Billion+ Consumers, 20+ Brands, Unstoppable Team. #TakeTheOath. Summer 2017. pic.twitter.com/tM3Ac1Wi36 -- Tim Armstrong (@timarmstrongaol) April 3, 2017 Perhaps the name is an anagram. What could it be? Well, since it involves AOL and Yahoo, it could easily be "Our Access To Hell." That works for me. According to Tech Crunch, Oath will be used to pitch Verizon brands to other businesses, while maintaining the individual value of its different content brands. For the time being, Yahoo's brand name will still be used for the public.  Most modern high-tech naming conventions are designed around the idea of mental association. This thinking began in earnest with the appearance of the Pentium chip. It was not a real word and was designed to elicit a subconscious response. The next chip from Intel in 1993 should have been the 80586, but the company decided to spend a fortune for some consultants to come up with a new brand. Pentium was the winner. Pentium had at least two elements of mental association. First the "pent" was short for penta, which means five--for the 586. It also implied pentagon and pentagram--creepy occult stuff. The "-ium" combined with the hard P of Pentium suggested platinum--a good thing. AMD followed with Athlon, incorporating athletic and longevity perhaps. Then came Intel's retort of Celeron, which just made me think of celery and lawn clippings. These ideas at Intel faded, and now it sticks with simple associations like Atom and Core. Oath likely started in a board meeting with the idea to call the new combined company "Both." I imagine the meeting going something like this: Board Member A: We've called a special meeting to discuss the renaming of the new Yahoo plus AOL corporate entity. Board Member B: Why are we changing the names? They are established brands. Everyone knows them. They are familiar. Board Member C: You are new here. This is what we do because we do not care about such old-fashioned thinking. You'll learn. Board Member B: It just seems dumb. Board Member A: You can shut up. Do we have any good ideas for a name? Board Member D: Yes, "Both!" B-O-T-H - the word itself. It implies two combined companies. It's dynamite. Fabulous idea. Board Member A: I kind of like it. Board member E [who is hard of hearing]: What did you say? Oath? Board member A: That's it! Even better! Oath it is!! Meeting is adjourned. This scenario makes as much sense and any rationale for calling any company Oath. Sheesh.

It took two years to get another upgrade but the Mi Pad 3 is now officially here. It popped up on the company's Chinese website today, without any official announcement. Frankly, we can't really blame Xiaomi, since the new offer is more of a refresh than a huge upgrade. On the exterior, the Mi Pad 3 is practically identical to the 2015 model. It has the same metal unibody design, measuring 200.4 x 132.6 x 7 mm and weighing in just a few grams more at 328 g. The 7.9-inch, 1536 x 2048 pixel LCD also seems to be unchanged, But, don't get us wrong, it is still a pretty decent setup. It's the new Mediatek MT8176 chipset that leaves raises a few eyebrows. Rocking two 2.1 GHz Cortex-A72 cores and four 1.7 GHz Cortex-A53 ones, it should be more than capable, especially combined with 4GB of RAM - a twofold upgrade. However, we can't help but miss the x86 compatibility of the Intel chip or the exceptional GPU performance and gaming pedigree of the ULP GeForce Kepler GPU in the Tegra K1 before it. It seems Xiaomi just can't decide on a particular chipset line. So, there's not going to be a Windows version of the Mi Pad 3, but at least its Android is skinned by the newer MIUI8. Other notable improvements in the tablet include a bigger 6,600 mAh battery, which promises up to 867 hours of standby and 12 hours of multimedia consumption. The main camera has also been upgraded to 13MP, f/2.2. But, we won't fixate on that any further, since we condemn tablet photography in all its forms. The Mi Pad 3 is only offered in a 64GB version and there is sadly no microSD card - still odd, since the original Mi Pad did have one. The local price is set at CNY 1499, or around $220, but there is still no word on availability. Thank you, Faisal Munir, for sending this in!

Apple could release a new iMac with a native 5K resolution, while Intel's latest Kaby Lake family of CPUs will surely be on offer - with up to the Core i7-7700K available.     USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 will most likely be the default connectivity, and since Apple has already debuted the TouchBar - something they unveiled on their enthusiast MacBook Pro. The new iMac could feature a TouchBar of some sorts, but I'm sure we'll be filled in with all of the nitty gritty details in the coming months.

When it wished her happy anniversary she was downright disturbed. "It felt like they were tipping their hand a little too much," she said. "I had to take a step back and say 'ooh that's not good'. You've now told me much more about your tracking of me than I needed to know, in the guise of a personal experience. What you've done has gotten really creepy." Speaking at the AIIA Navigating Digital Government Summit in Canberra today, the former Intel anthropologist warned that government and industry needed to keep in mind the effect data and technology had on people. "It got too close. It was just too personal," the Australian National University professor said of her unnerving ATM experience. While data can give rise to "magic" user interactions, Bell explained, it could also cause people to be anxious about what was known about them. "We talk about big data and recommendation engines and algorithms. Consumers encounter it through preferences, they encounter it through things being served up to them which inevitably creates a sense of anxiety and questioning. Why is it that Netflix thinks I should watch that show? What is it they know about me that they imagine I should?" she said. Humans can sometimes fear their choices are being "prescribed by their past" by these algorithms, which by their nature work on retrospective data. "They want to imagine they're more interesting than that," she added. What cows want Read more Researchers use analytics and machine learning to detect dodgiest travellers Making data visible and opening up analysis could also have unintended consequences, Bell warned, and data should not be considered a "benign thing". Bell, who joined the ANU in February, recounted an Intel study into household water usage. In one case when a couple could see that one took a shower in the early evening after a business meeting, the other became suspicious of why. "Making data visible has the capacity to make a series of tacit rituals public and visible. And it turns out that's a little bit confronting," she said. Another study concerning agricultural IoT gave dairy cows RFID tags to they could trigger a automated milking process by themselves. While the farmers usually milked twice daily, given the ability, the cows were doing so far more often.

Scale that up and imagine what data can tell us about what things want that we hadn't thought about." Human in the middle Bell, who is recognised as a world leader in the ethnographic approach to developing technology, explained that though it was easy to be wooed by "provocative and remarkable and delightful" innovations, human users can't be forgotten. "If all we do is think about the technology we set ourselves up to not be as successful as we could and should be," she said. "Having humans in the middle, both as the objects and subjects and regulators of that technology is the most important and in some ways the hardest thing to do. "It's not just talking about digital transformation but digital transformation in a world where we are still human beings." @georgepnott Why Performance Matters When Building Your SD-WAN More from Silver Peak Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The security software company, founded by American computer programmer John McAfee, has been around for three decades but was acquired by Intel between 2010 and 2011. This week, it became a new, jointly-owned independent cybersecurity company, with alternative asset management firm TPG owning a 51 percent stake and Intel retaining 49 percent. The deal was announced last September, and valued the business at approximately $4.2 billion. "We spin out today to become a standalone — one of the largest standalone security companies globally, so we're very excited," Gavin Struthers, global SVP and Asia Pacific president at McAfee, told CNBC's "The Rundown" on Wednesday. Asia Pacific — which is split between mature markets like Singapore and Australia and emerging Asia, where security levels are not as comprehensive — is a "hyper-growth" market for McAfee, according to Struthers. He also reckoned no one is safe from hackers — from families at home trying to raise their children in a hyper-connected world to small and medium businesses, large corporations and even governments. "The bad actors are more sophisticated and they're coming after not just for profit, but sometimes for principle," he said. That is where Struthers said McAfee can help with its numerous security technologies. "McAfee has always been a broad portfolio company and that ability to connect multiple technologies together — we call it a platform — is something the rest of the market is not doing," he said. Struthers added access to a comprehensive global threat intelligence network and automation of technologies to detect and tackle breaches was what set McAfee apart from the competition.

"It's an asymmetrical balance — (hackers) have to get it right only once, we have to get it right every time," he said. McAfee provides a range of antivirus software to individual users to help protect their home, offices and connected devices. McAfee also offers advanced threat analysis, data protection, encryption and network intrusion prevention for enterprises. Cybersecurity threats have grown in frequency and complexity in recent years. Hackers have targeted government institutions and companies, and have made away with databases containing personal information. Awareness, according to Struthers, is also important in defending against digital threats, as is industry-wide collaboration in intelligence gathering.

Texas Rep. Jaoquin Castro made the explosive claim in an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, though he declined to give specifics about why he believes jail time is in the offing for Trump advisers. “There’s…quite a lot of smoke, the investigation is to determine if there’s a fire or not,” Castro said of the investigations into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government operatives. “I would say this, that my impression is I wouldn’t be surprised after all of this is said and done, that some people end up in jail,” said Castro. Asked by Blitzer if he was implying that multiple Trump advisers will wind up in the slammer, he said: “That’s my impression, yes.” The FBI is said to be investigating the activities of former Trump campaign advisers Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Carter Page and Michael Flynn. All have denied coordinating with the Russian government to influence the election. So far, no Democrats have produced evidence of collusion between the Trump team and Kremlin. Obama administration intelligence officials, including James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, said last month that he saw no evidence of collusion up through the end of his term on Jan. 20.

Also, Jeff Howe is tweeting about Richard Sherman to the Patriots. The guys take a look at Sherman's contract situation to see if it could work. Also, LeGarrette Blount and Patriots are supposedly still talking. Callers react to Marchand's spear. You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. On him when he. Beats Fort Wayne and moaning and forty. And that's the way. Against Boston. Barges being escorted out that would signal that it's a major penalty water. Wonders if it is they've backed penalty had it been days with an automatic review by the national hockey league's player safety administration with the wind blew in. Christian I'm the last person I've about a big game for the student. And so our. I'm not want to get caught up regular season business you know them. And so I've been situated finals than. I'm the last person as a regular season game goof. Right now on Sports Radio WEEI. I'm not very many experienced suspensions of come out of the league so it'll be interesting how they played this one. I'm Marcia and most deserving and I think what the Bruins making the playoffs they might as well form a couple of games for us and send another message to on. Its. Keith Jones on last night's NBC sports broadcast its was wiped out here. Involvement play. That's what they were talking about national lane you know why he makes some sense. Bruins are in the postseason right now you wanna send a message to a guy that's got a rap sheet right he's been suspended before. He's been a bad boy won't that affect most recently January the 24 2007 team that trip on a Nicklaus crumble. So you may saying while they're in the playoffs. Two games left or should slap the tone but. If he just dropped their cash and it's no big deal. You don't mean like that Washington is clincher for college. The party classic colors then number one seed just suspended for the last two what does it matter if it's means or means a lot. To this Bruins team yet they clinch a playoff spot as of right now. Odds are they're facing Washington. If they don't lose Brad marsh area a better shot to win these last couple of games as a chance they could be the number three seeds they were they all. Do you think it might always huge demand means something Jeremy Jacobs in the organization that they're going to be able to sell popcorn and beer and pizza and a lot of the stuff for a few more games because let's face it. If you're any Atlantic Division. And you're facing Ottawa you facing Toronto. Not only is it more likely it's a long first round. But she got a chance to women at brown and get to the second round possibly I Montreal if not possibly face Montreal and cool and you do you do you have. Drama vet with clout but if you face Washington. If you think Washington how can anybody saved it you can when that I'm just amazed that this type of act. Is not frowned upon more I'm just amazed that this is just. And that's no big deal against those those note there's no real suspension history there's no light. Bylaw let's say if you take your steak and jammed it under somebody's undercarriage and and knock out his baby DNA under maggert and what that well he I think that this. It's this says had star written all over the fact that yet to gain that never suspect really I don't they don't any. I know I did it. That's just I guess that's just hockey and my friends who like whoever worked out with Trent wood down Foxboro all hockey players and all laughing about it like it's no big deal. Could you imagine somebody like. Brady fell down and just laying on his back in the JJ watt just came and took his foot just. Right did brilliantly jewels to knock them I'm not like no big deal on the consumer does that virtually every Sunday and that are here but we're talking yes he's one of the guy at a dirty ass player nations suspended every single time but he wasn't he wasn't. Purposely going for is not. March and was going or not. He did it was actually that this would strictly RS admits that but it was strictly be on reputation Crosby did it. You know a short period going in it but there's more attention to you see the replay of Crosby doing it's just there's no question what he was doing now there's a question will Marcia was doing either. Well it may look it's me those. But he might get suspend the ship if he does he probably deserves it because to be an idiot. After he sticks him in the groin when he turns around the talks are refereed like what. What Snyder is near where did me wrong he's got a stick any ice and it's like he hits the do at a at a bridge of his nose with this pick actually it's a guide to face. So to be taking a look at it and I wonder if they won't even bring that up when they announced garlic the penalty because the dude he's got nailed. In casinos get a stick in his nose on wryly yeah I'd be tested this nice gonna get reload Japanese and curtailing nothing's going on. I don't think he should be suspended. But he he should be a massive fine but if he does then. I agree with that but you know it it to himself is yeah but played a huge game. It's sound angry if you it was he was sold it was almost like he was fists. That he was addicted there's even an issue like people think I was faking it like god I barely giving I raised you. Amy I can bail you got to cop why did you know you're not really hurt like he was about you like he was flopping. We all guys like forever. Had hurt his stomach. Couldn't breathe if you really ever gotten it really does right on point Lou maybe baseball I've ever now men you know kind of got it catches you William when you least expect it doesn't happen in the NFL but it was a company NFL. Never happens that nobody ever since LS someone purposely does it. It's just they're all got me. You see how well Jimmie hey beat it because Brad my ship got 39 year concede a goal for forty. This sort of stuff you're hoping was in his past practice or something mr. Brad motion from 23 years ago. And you just take it beyond it now you can still be a little nastier out their player union VP discussion. And do something like this and arguably one of the biggest games at the garden in the last three years. A chance to make the postseason if not you start. Things start tighten it up if you lose that game. It may knows he's lucky they won that game yes yes they bail them out he owes an apology should go around that room today and he should apologize to every player and say thanks for bailing my ass out. And and killing that five minute nature 'cause he did it early now a minute left in the in the first period produce the best he does talk when the game is over. And he's kind of a bloodiest of the whole thing. He's suspended. Annoyed Hansen replace. You know that kicked over the game and frustrated also. So enjoy the one with the bush. Is that I is that OK with us either public or does anybody does anybody believe. Does anybody believe that he did not see the replay unless the way you phrased it low he knows exactly what he did he doesn't want to see the replay of. I'm only guessing that the Bruins. You know. I'm just going up my own experience you know it in the Red Sox for example you gate tossed to me you walk in their runway. Whether the video guys right there an accident dug out or is up there and in the locker room whatever it might be. When you get tossed he had two periods. You don't think you ran that play back he actually saw at least five times while he's up there hanging out prohibited beer line. Our shot of the game for boys come back in the locker room he addresses these nasty cracks open a beer or two who knows I don't know sits there watching the video showers maybe has another one who knows there are lapping water. Again here's the difference if he admits that he actually saw. Then there's a follow up question asking him specifically why he did it and what he did. By answering the question is I haven't seen the replay after that you can asked a question or he doesn't have an answer the follow up if you ask him exactly what he did I don't know I haven't seen. But come on it happened with a minute left in the first period. US all of that time you had nothing else to do there was no other obligation US you wore us out of the game that is sole. Some days you're differ look poised forty seconds before in the period I think was so called team comes out and the first period you're pissed million. David apple let my bad my bad my bad they go opposite compared what you don't. Hang out you don't BS write your guy don't you guys make them pay just got him hey you know you're you're regular Nabisco in you've seen. The Senate's idea acknowledged he was Smart there right appointed to bail us out. And they did dale assassinated they really did. And you know at the beginning of period you've got fresh ice out there you've got fresh legs. And they held up four and a half minutes to open up that second period and killing that Sakharov. And that was the difference and again you can see it. Tuukka Rask has a great second period they want them to win the thing they can bury that team and heels a mall an apology and heels a mall like that they'll MI. I mean you're Sammy he's not getting your game and you may be right. He should get too but he should there should be they should change his role. Overall that if you do anything like that regardless of culture what used to be and how was and how it should be good but if you take your stick. And blindly. Knock somebody in his knots on purpose. I mean not by accident another kid the putt hit somebody and it based are you your fight in the state actually hit somebody who's just skating by U. But here's the problem without logic if they have been have been hearings for guys that have done this already this year last year or the year before the year before that. And have not. And given a suspension for you that you can't suddenly today suddenly saying I want. Of the one there's exploration and Jerry I don't problem. You can't sit there and say las Sidney Crosby did it in now Brad marsh is getting out of control so let's suspend the got the last strategist David. You know and I understand that wouldn't be the reason the reason Libyan look at the history and and I get that but maybe this is something in the offseason the news when we go back to. You know of this type of thing you know there's an opportunity maybe to suspend these guys now as opposed to treating the way did with a haven't passed which just fine. Despite the guy but he inherited your game misconduct you missed the last two period dale. Directed bailed them out the amazing thing to me is this team what you've seen now eighteen and seven under Bruce Cassidy. It makes you feel better because that tip of gay game last time they played and we all sat there and everybody sat there the guys are nests and they're talking about it after the game Dallara all of of it is and we just thought this was it. This was it and it was just the timing of it it was so bad they lost three straight and it would all play the worst in the later Bruce Cassidy. And we just thought this was then now the reality six games later is. It was just a bad game. It was a bad game from Duca and now what got him going but in 1970 to save percentage is last four games. Dressed in four games three and ultimately it's only get away from ranked whatever it was motivating I don't really that's Reston. I think that's the problem jeans and he just he keeps on its own wants if it's why he's an arm of the can stand up to it now. Gust of night quiz was. Suspended for six games but he spirit of player in the face. So bleak you know is protective of offense protective thing that we've seen that any hits against the boards. With him with head related to neck related that is something that they they slap the suspension. But if you look at the history you have a guy with a stake in the not. It's OK what do I know little oil and let me go to this I get it right I guess my point is overall that ruled these changed my grip it just that I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm just amazed. That's at protections varies yes I mean there's two the two most important things are ahead. You had come back with him. All along some of them and make them by Annan who want it. Well as its current U protected wanna viewers the other woman mature I'm you don't admin. For some of the stuff you say in his per game and I have added yeah they got the years. You take your service others that JFK nets are critical that the we'll leave it there. So force assets Carlson you know he's sorry he signs that the three year entry level deals so he's gonna burn a year of eligibility but. It's going to be a game ranked yes. Whoever it is it is visa. That's a problem who's got the student DC now he's a work visa solicitor issues there with his visa thing. What did you get into. Troubled him out of the country the trust a veteran trial if you're in a battle embrace it could be a worry about it good to delegate is we need to. All. Is that your game right you think. Probably not tomorrow night against Ottawa by the way this game at least that's gonna drive me Sunday dads can drive secret you cannot call this guy JFK by now because we had a presidents here from the cells from Brooklyn. It is but I wanted to it was his first and Jacob or is it a Yucca as the verdict announced balls. The see you in the morning guys beat this Swedish yes. We're veteran or is it is Jacob here we are probably young couple out there ya ya got heated aggregated from your throat to the soft. Soft is that what is doctor and I heard it off why is I'm I'm listening to people thought about it for as Barca Carlson. I hate it when they do the hyphen stuff on Alex you two last names of the guys nice ringtone well it's it's now it's still it's lazy that's what is this what is slightly once we noticed. He said that. I don't know what a cable to pretend okay as we need a mechanic this up all the cell phone apple. Got on got you yeah routed the let me. Import arguing that fire wrecked cars and that that is on gold at port the budget at cadence player slashed and Netscape right at the line. It would not help because there's no way issue even think about and. I'll it and they didn't call one on I caused brief promo on the hit that he didn't call one did. We think all the penalty and only did they strike. Now they're gonna suspend and the causes you know is right protection. Right could you got a history. But that's another story fall and I think it's an interesting one. It's this guy wants to be a great player and I know he's probably sitting in making excuses that I coney city's best player in the league and he didn't. If he wants to be great player scout clean reputation. He's going to be a hard. Player but he's got to get away from being that that mosquito that that that just drives people crazy you know. That's what you want me he's got to play his game he's got a income went to get back in the Intel that mammoth starting this week. He can't change. He has yet. All he has this is. Already above all he had beat he is done now you know and ask him some he can't do we are shown he can do it. That's just not present a part of game. At least this year. The most who put up. And those. Are. But they say he got back to bestseller. Well there's a lot of chip on the shoulder while it's another thing about being a dirty as. You you don't think there's a difference. Unlike his champions. I mean this painting was the craziest thing I've ever seen he took what four punches at the guy and nobody said anything resembling what it isn't in on a Stanley Cup champions final. Unbelievable it was used to twitch yeah Oaxaca which of us I. Think that's the most amazing thing I don't like to accuse him. In a week it's there it's cutting out fighting he said they're stood up toe to toe. Just punched away with dreams of a punching bag. Pretty sketchy. And they took it and that's why they took it in the end game seven to right. Yeah but he's got to clean it up a little boy you don't think he's got to claim this act up. I think he's got a be a leader. And you can't take stupid penalties or dictate that a game that he got or at. And that was not and you agree that without being a leader last night that without was doing something because you were pissed off frustrated there like you ought. A great Gallagher right let's go to us Steve's and a truck. Hey guys I don't there. Christian I got a little bored to create Iraq and went a little girl on this on this subject. Is a listen and you shot. Let him call me this girl went upstairs. I'll tell ya on the Toyota knew why doesn't happen in the NFL because they brought steroids and it strikes on a minute about the. Her balance as stupid. As her other areas to order a wide open. OK let me ask you this this league again you has. It has nothing to do with mr. Rosenblum penis has nonetheless. The fact is it just seems like just I recall broke cold I don't know whatever you wanna call it. It's is like any time so don't think it's funny. To randomly. Knock somebody kick somebody and in the nuts it's just I don't see why that's not frowned upon like that. Okay. I actually light so late and if it is OK okay okay apply to me that's All Saints so it's been everybody I talk to says that's on the way to bet they don't mammals but I was I was sure you. Now I know I know I. I didn't my point is. The reason guys don't get personal global players are not gonna start randomly knock some guy. In the maps locate every now then under the pile there is one knuckle that that likes granddad Yankee Graham and even know I didn't do any really awareness cubs this. I think it has a down my leg right now on the come on stop me on whether whether this sometime this. Sort of intimate portrait what is. Wow. And struck out needs to write and remember. All I credited Byron friend guy. We. Larson's. Yeah it's what I thought he says in his right hey if you you noticed that if it doesn't have Chester says something. You know everybody jumped to a little commercial you know and yes Hutton yes but what went one added that does talk surveillance. So so he doesn't like an hour ago an hour and a half ago on on ESP and says. Is this something to this Richard Sherman about being traded. And then suddenly. You go online and and then suddenly everybody's popping up all he would he would grow go to the patriots are you would agree. It's suddenly becoming a Star Search all shift yourself. Was there is something to. The possibility that Richard Sherman could get traded in other words Seattle may be looking at that she got to figure out they holes. In their team so if you are going to try to fill some of those holes the best way of doing it if you've got cap issues. Is to take a way. Something where you really strong and right now they're strong in a back into their defense and and and through traffic seemed to Vilsack. And so you take it got its make an eleven million dollars a year fourteen I think as the average eleven million bucks and you take him out of the equation. As of now we've jumped the shark and we suddenly looking at the possibility. That he could becoming too knowing. Is is there any solid profitability do you sing anything that directly ties to knowingly or we just taking. We just jump off a rat poison in a while ago and what it yeah. Before they sent Gilmore that there was entry that there was interest that they talked to Sierra global trade for a for Richard chairman that was before soul. Now back editing here again there'll be so you see John Snyder apparently was on with our old friend Mike Salk you know. Wednesday morning GM first Seattle it's he says quote what you've seen lately in the news is real. Unquote that's on both sides. So there's this it's always ended messages. Now given how close did you ask him he also said that meg 90% of this type of stuff that they're discussing that doesn't happen it just doesn't it ever close about his discussions that they're both over to read Tom what is a go to sell insurance and to be at that I don't know if we got down the point that question. But you know that just affected them or Paul resulted they are urged him before Lisa Gillmor. Don't exist they got Gilmore you sit out at second after us now maybe people are opening up their doors are all gone now. Because Malcolm bulletin we still don't know what's so there should you not from what we're gonna you get something in return obviously foreign. With no warmth that you go out there and what are you gonna have to give. I'm probably everything you've already acquired in the box or do you gonna have to give up for Richard Sherman. They didn't have to pay Richard Sherman eleven million dollars he's only on under contract for 20172018. And granted. And some of that money because of the bogus stuff that structure will be paid by Seattle. But this is this just makes cents. Unless you love Richard Sherman is a boy you that is going to be the difference well he's a guy that seems to would we talk about. What was the knock on nudging it counts he likes to a freelance and do all zone. That kind of the Middle East on Richard Sherman is that. Clinton I don't know when they play only on once I'd left right guys AME had a player like inciting players always intently do you found he's got that. But the sideline as a as a friend so and I'm much see you can't really freelance that Martin Lister cheese in the back across the middle of the field and just being stupid. And and they're not gonna do that. I didn't look at finances with you said the EU can heaven for Tim Williams Zemaitis they do have an exec in you can keep him. Ominous thing in Seattle their interest in getting rid of whom they get room after one year but if you require I think he still control for two. Possibly look at his his let your two years you wanna give up all that for two years Richard Sherman does just what you're afraid to pay Malcolm Butler big time money. This guy's gonna get top the end money. Exactly and he's going to be thirty years of age 31 when he goes out the free agency so we some books for eleven point four this year. Eleven million next year a cat and remember the cap hit would go to Seattle's you know have to worry about that they would take it point. Did cap money nine point four. And then it becomes a free agent in 2000 in 1931 years of age. So it was two years is a two years these two years old of butler's Becker two years old down. There. Well that's a big capital he said to Medicare and and half million to look at I did like reports us Maria I'm 44 to get rid Richard chairman. Yeah I eight I don't know why you'd wipe these pressure when I got to take nine and a half men in a campaign to get rid of Richard Sherman it's horrible gorge and by the way the other one it's kind of interest because I think you would imagine this you're the low. Why would they worked out a deal with regard to what he wants to be here or finding out now that the money seems to be an issue and. It's always about money you know that when horses and some are eligible public. So when you wanna save it once you want to hold on just Carolina and yes I know your goal does not like it yes I'm familiar. But it didn't close calls that you are a you know Sissy boy was an area writes for the lemur Loney and 48. Christian college Sports Radio. It got released from the wasn't that wonderful to store here's Jim McCullough I joke. Pelé guys don't you know you don't expect expects a technical. Question what the audit of the white called orbit I grapefruit football. The or. If you are or call eight go to that. A whole lot Olympic and I never said it wasn't pop and actually the pass and said if we're gonna start raking as far as the toughest sport to place or is weird here on your body. One and baseball we know about her parents started as well it's the heartless or is a left. OK let's see a shift physical without it and that and that. You know you know ship that people are so I might. We don't have to contest right now I'm OK great you win a hockey is so much article on ethic I don't care. In August rarely eats that you feel worse the next morning after Hakim are football depending if your player for now. But how close Gaza third fourth I think guys know about it that's funny right that's what apple worked out after a game they don't get enough minutes that you're one of them that you only play sixty games because the body can't take more sixteen in the course of the season. Was too complacent it's more quickly when all you do is what's that there's more cheap shot mentality that's mine. If it did I don't get it it just doesn't make any sense played. That's OK everything else is everything else that is frowned upon like a vicious hits all can be careful tablet. You take a stake and it's nobody's looking at you when you give them the business. The monitor that's like at at two game suspension. Okay no I don't like I saw that I want to get what they pretty carefully collect I think it may be observed a double minor let's. I didn't see that in any more than that pretty much an up or I don't feel that anything that. Well hook Spinner Carl yeah yeah rumors using wish he had what he would use him right in the ball exactly. So I mean you go on a lark you know I'll call atmosphere the fact is he was trying to do damage to the guys products and you can't do that acts on that sorry he can't do that he is to go to player now. To lower himself to doing stuff like that or you better be. The way he used to be really sneaky about it that was not sneaking I was out in the open and that was would be essential literally over your shoulder. So he was not paying attention and you can't do it when your team is playing in the biggest game maybe in three freaking years. Stephen Marbury feisty. And guys in Auckland you just edit the biggest game in three years. And they were severely. Penalized in neck games to give someone a five minute major I'm pretty sure. That was the first penalty of the game I think dead matching penalties from the queen the other guys they're clueless first and got up five minute major and game like that's deciding to eighteen states. You know why don't we blame you don't live there. So I it was about play good call on I think you should have been on minor. I don't think it should be a five minute major. I don't know what and I don't you know why you know why well because Jane dodge of was down there. You know screaming at in soprano. That's what happened so he would all like. Yes so that's what happens and I agree with you should be based on the intent. And not what happens to the to the to the individual that that played into the five minute major. And a game misconduct. And the discount is an automatic. Right that was anonymous there and. They are it was almost as reject him for his own safety that Democrats have. We'll find out ammunition they're treated it and he gets suspended here because this game tomorrow and it now means an awful lot. Now in if you lose him for the last two games that would hurt this team you know and he was yelling I think it if at the wrath. Oslo would be yellen. I wouldn't be surprised if you jump ball the stick in the face afterwards as well. In early ages need mean it just you know we're stuck in and knocks. But did you see him stick in the face for a stick but he just casually just had to stick pretty nice it was like with what they end up music. Little. Later this statement Bridget is noses they call but you lick all. Any it's tough but I am a little bit surprised. Because. When it originally happened I I thought it was a real dirty yet. You can see people want to quarter were pretty much in the same thing now you caught in the heat of the game and where you war and you want the Bruins to win. The game is over not only do they kill off the five minute major but they win the game they win it in and a an easy fashion when it by fort Nelson school okay. An occasional four. At that human cry people screaming about martian but I would not. All you need to know to me is on the telecast with a brick weather's jackal the post in a medical was nobody was defending Brad nobody nobody sector no one really is there was a -- by bitter internal rarely dipped. Nobody not one of them defended them which was nice. And they all called to the carpet they also listening might face discipline for this thing you might actually missed a few games the wasn't anybody call looked like these guys. Innocent say I don't think he did it on purpose as a kid that Arctic and if they work in front of the net now. All the former players you heard from none of them let him off the OK so what should people be critical when not an awful lot to okay. Imagine what would have happened if Tampa Bay scored 23 goals splits into goals. In a five minute major period and suddenly they'd lose that game last that we get a total different but. What happens now. If he goes and he gets suspended it. They'd lose that game against Ottawa then they'd lose the game against Washington and you Washington in the first round of the blast. Maybe who knows maybe Washington wants to beat you Saturday. So the pic of you in the first round of the plant maybe they feel you're better matchup for that. But it dominated you he's been great against you maybe you look at it that way is that we got to win this game. We want Boston in the first round world kicked arrest. And you know suddenly. Are facing Washington as opposed to maybe getting back in the Atlantic Division getting Ottawa. Getting the Toronto getting a Montreal the second round and actually being able to make some noise in the post season now will people be pissed that the at marsh. On their deepest dive at it they lost last naked in Paris and we'll see you so wait. The backlash would be. Especially you know they were if they weren't able to. If that if they wanted to kill. You know that that was a five minute. Five when it would end up being honest like I hear of it for par four and a half minutes right. That ended any differently what a nightmare that would have been today. Major nightmare I mean blaming him personally for just being dumb but he embassy in all of the work of this there weren't last year. I Jackson McCartney Jack. Barry I I don't think they. Well. I'd get it was a really pulled it no doubt about it being very self which would just be sport spirit that. By a cross checked the back edge rock shall. Read it was dot. Sure thing I think in May let him skate on this or maybe aren't nada not a suspension by and check it won't mean. These are critical piece of that of that is enough. They cannot afford to be voted for a game or a couple games. But CR how many times the teams do that to him and nightly basis this year given the way he's playing this what you do when you play the Bruins rightly moshing is who he's doing out there. That's what you do you do things you know yeah and try to get a whiff of what you try what you try to do is get what the reaction that you got from him gave him off the ice took great. I yet but I significant across certain side of the face it's it's mostly just my heart and just a quick reaction. And I got it needs to be moronic. Just openly pledged it was a with a fine because she's playing great right now you know legitimate or hospital orderly to our souls and maybe just like it bought. Now that it that the key may be getting it back in the Atlantic Division again with a number two and a retreat you know in the Atlantic and suddenly you play teams that. I know they've had problems with with Ottawa Lebanon because of the way that they play. Now little trap but now those two teams that you'd rather get a much better shot against either one of those teams that you do against Washington. I six point 7779793. Several close about one more segment to go here each week. And then afterwards with the go who appreciate your guards are rare bloody glad you're afraid it is the way Maloney and Maury Montel you. It's video what Garrett wants during the second birthday we pair. We have via media critic. On the line I want to go home and out because he'd like to. It like to breakdown the commentary Lou's commentary and opening date is loop by the way will be doing tomorrow afternoon schedule at Fenway Park. If we have faced so this might be a little bit of a constructive British architect notes I had just. Yeah I. I really like Lou I think I'd like to move the ball players in. By my couldn't. He didn't shut out on. Commentary that color. Let analysis. You know he he was speaking right he was our speed dial in. And would let him talk and I don't know the feeling on too much too much life to let's say if the broadcast did you want to late clear more cricket. Between every pitch he he was like yeah. Pete talk in that particular did he overshadow the other two guys on the radio 2.2. Wouldn't shut I'll tell you what is that thing. Tomorrow do you gains and I will say and debris. But you want to say something you just don't want the cost as much right. Exactly it. Is an island like Hewitt it would like like it was nervous. Are you know it. You nervously now now a look at our donors was when Joseph does the play by play it's Joseph and me. And Tim does you know once and then when when Tim does a play by play it's Tim and mean Joseph. Did this is how the baseball the whole works these two late three and so when I'm in a Booth and allows them to sort of take a break. So they're talking for four and a half that you're talking for Obama. Yes let's talk. Zachary and Jeff want to shut up a well we'll sort lust of shorty wanna hear you get off the heat is also open up his car and to hear the sound of the back at at almost a half from now. So if he doesn't really wanna hear your toys to be just quieter as Jeb bowl Janice Jeff which one which one does which orders don't sell best with and which one disease sound worse with just told you. He does have to game would Joseph and have to game with him. Where would you see he say he sounds the best were the worst against with which guy. Oh easy but it's all this talk at all time you want it now he's put the ball that iTunes is talking and stuff. Some sauce or other words a jolt and I know I wrote Jim that tomorrow they're great in Fallujah Sox right Jeff I would think that's is that it just just I don't know I figured we heard this idea aux sable's goodness and CA united auto I don't know and I I will I will make a note. Diluted down so the and and. Slippery at that perfect gonna let nobody expects that it. But it was cute too much into reading. Wolf you know your stuff we did don't you think it's a Smart move to to pass that along to the list they also note quiet or should we hold all that stuff. Seventh. You don't get it to you want more we'll show him the ticket buyer from Irish bar had a shiner Baltimore there's advantages to get him on Knight. I'm and it's and I probably do one day be to a monkey should shoot for and that's about it so it's only what's I'll let you know what do the two yards on. Like the original mourns we should have moved critical decline. And local news on the field right now being chased down by superiors knew it was. Right. It is an example we'll enthused and it's just for fun to review with some dignity and go yeah individual homes and. I don't opening tomorrow. Reacted Kidman it's Brito left so tomorrow you'll be doing that John Ferrell song with deal holly this afternoon and obviously we'll talk a little bit about that the commit a while before we close out we bring in check out and those guys. The leader board that. Do you think the fact that Rex Berkett signed for three point one million dollars may have something to do with The Who would care what is he wanted to be here. Seems like it would be easier since it was going just fine. And then suddenly they go out and bring another running back yet who you would think would be lower on the depth chart. Then he would can be special teams guy to. And they given three point one million maybe I'd get hurt nobody else is where we are now he has no leverage Schwartzel who make money and more fall back down in a fourth down back you don't mirror ball or go back or out of whatever I don't I don't mean stripped of his yeah. Put doubts it. Select because he's on special teams like Brandon Bolden an upgrade on Brandon Bolden should be making more than leader or they must really like. Perk that they must really think this month cite your liberties for more than that maybe me maybe that's part of what they're looking at right now saying. Some of the stuff that Garrett pointed out we got a goal and that was gained seventeen last year with all the other running backs got hurt. And he had a big huge game because he played much this is one of those we've seen a little of and enough to think that he can be pretty good and maybe do some of the things that blocked. Yet if it the gear blondes wants to have a little I want to hold his breath and wait for them to. To give in its not gonna happen so what's thought Brooke gets three million what do they what is the what is blow one. 3.5. Or I'd rather not I'm gonna have I wanted to please his points well and there's nothing right there port unless that speaking of running backs out of even sort of set those salons have apparently interviews and yes a retirement system it was a major pieces came through me and talked all the coaches had some lunch and left. He actually worked out and we wish that he probably would work not I don't I said he did you know I know it never happened that way of an old veteran players never come in. And work out drew the creation and don't just happen you don't run forty you don't put it may be in September you do. But during your free agency during. You'll pick he she just shake hands. I'm just understand it went but I usually don't happen that deal's gonna try to get something out of this whether it's again Intel if you pop somewhere else he he might be doing the agent in favor. Who knows maybe he really thinks this guy. Comedic got a lead on the season maybe doesn't think anything's gonna take a chance on. If we get a guy at work they got a target at an age regularly and has an eight year in it to Ager Peterson is a 100% he's healthy they put him out there on the grass on the turf well and they start having go right go left and they watch him cut. Won't forget about it yeah start forget about all the issues you just want that guy to have ball. Oh sure the crusher average front you buy find mass money dot com no deal today he's worn out with a hockey game last night. Holly worked like eighteen hours yesterday so of course who was it as it is every day its chief. Gaelic you know I wanted to but I think you know like I got these guys sounds good but we know if you had the option not to do this you don't you're live in the Logan and the importance I was through eldest especially today outward out here but it's like to see your faces them now talk to you Linda. About four and better Adrian Peterson air want right now. Adrian Peterson yeah I I. Or just about everything. They didn't at all on a regular to the crowd could you talk Phil Graham make up our. So don't let 2000 and all with one partner so I had added I would like no not in my. And by the way we are altered your own company topic is glendening for the final five minutes of the job on wheels we've got a couple more we talk about that's OK you guys don't hold on a city and a good game now. Outlet about well I don't know what I gave acorn. The manager to sort of entity to make that case I think if you don't agree with Lou yeah you'll throw some tough questions that John Ferrell said. Falling today I was an article posted today a political talk about that performance. Out now. I feel pretty good. They asked if that I asked him joke at least on the wrong and he did and other Washington. They're all coming up next. We'll be back tomorrow I'm going to work Fenway Park tomorrow and am I. Yeah there was mad at him than originally. We're one of them don't. When Dave Dombrowski and Julia. Ultimately against an on going and going with them and doing browser and our. No review ongoing uniform maybe there. And a golden knights and AM. News & Analysis Recommended Columns Blogs Teams + John Tomase04/05/17 10:45 pm EST Showdown?

By Tas Bindi | April 6, 2017 -- 01:33 GMT (18:33 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Ros Harvey, founder and CEO, The Yield (Image: Microsoft/The Yield) Australian agtech startup The Yield has announced that it has raised AU$6.5 million from lead investor Bosch, as well as from KPMG and AgFunder. The closure of the Series A funding round brings the total amount raised by the two-year-old Tasmanian startup to AU$11.5 million. The Yield's microclimate sensing system, Sensing+, uses sensors, predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence -- combining its own technology with those from Microsoft, Bosch, and Intel -- to help growers make critical decisions faster. The system has been used in aquaculture to predict, for example, when oysters need to be pulled out of the water based on information such as salinity levels and temperature. If there was a storm and the oyster farmer knew contaminated water was going to flow towards the oyster farm in the coming days, then they could proactively harvest the oysters, for instance. The Yield will be using the funds to support the commercial deployment of Sensing+ in the second half of 2017. The funds will also be used for investment in sales and marketing capabilities, new product development, and entry into international markets -- particularly the US west coast. Founder and CEO of The Yield, Ros Harvey, said Australia is the "perfect breeding ground for agtech innovation" because the conditions there are "so tough". "Farmers and growers are incredible risk takers when you think about what they do. Growing something is an incredibly complex thing to do. It's not like a factory. You've got all these different variables to take into account. You're constantly making decisions about when to plant, when to irrigate, when to protect, when to feed, when to harvest," Harvey told ZDNet this year in an interview about using IoT to transform the agriculture industry in Australia. Harvey said creating reliable and accurate technology that growers can use every day is essential. "We also need to deliver these solutions at scale, which means bringing in the right strategic investors," she added. "We now have some of the world's best engineers from Bosch working on our microclimate system, we have KPMG's deep industry insights and commercial expertise, and AgFunder's global community helping us bring solutions to growers in Australia and beyond." Bosch and KMPG both admitted that the investment is strategic in that it will allow the companies to bring their solutions together and deploy them as a package. Meanwhile, The Yield is AgFunder's first global investment from its new agtech investment vehicle, which is currently being finalised. Michael Dean, AgFunder's Australian co-founder and CIO, said The Yield's strength lies in its ability to provide farmers with actionable, granular, real-time insights into the microclimates developing on their farms." "Developed and proven in harsh aquatic environments, the accuracy and reliability of The Yield's technology and simple delivery of useful data is the perfect platform for producers of all types of high-value crops such as nuts and berries," Dean said. "We are delighted to be an early stage investor in The Yield, and look forward to utilising our global network to assist with its development and expansion internationally." In March, Food Agility -- a consortium of commercial companies, universities, and farming industry bodies looking to facilitate the digital transformation of agriculture industry in Australia -- received AU$50 million as part of the Australian government's Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) program. The government funding adds to the AU$160 million in contributions -- both monetary and non-monetary -- previously raised by the organisation from partners such as KPMG, National Australia Bank, IAG, and Bosch. Moving forward, Food Agility's innovation programs will seek to deploy real-time big data market intelligence and predictive analytics to help farmers produce the right products at the right time, connect food producers with consumers in new ways, and develop a common knowledge base.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues The good news and bad news of Apple’s Mac Pro announcement Jason Snell 6 April, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News This week’s announcement by Apple that the current Mac Pro will be replaced by a new model–but not this year–was one of the most curious ones it’s made in recent memory. It was a defense of the Mac, a promise of things to come, an attempt to reassure professional Mac users, and an admission of failure, all at once. Here’s what it was: A restatement of Apple’s support for the Mac. Three years ago, Phil Schiller sat across a table from me at Apple’s Infinite Loop campus and responded to my question about the future of the Mac by saying, “The Mac keeps going forever.” And in stories posted today based on a prior interview, Schiller said much the same thing. “The Mac has an important, long future at Apple… we have every intention to keep going and investing in the Mac,” he said. For those who doubt the esteem the Mac holds at Apple, it’s worth nothing that Apple has been unwavering in its insistence that the Mac is an ongoing concern, not a product with a rapidly approaching expiration date. A remarkable admission of failure. The lack of updates on the Mac Pro made it obvious that this product was a flop, but it’s still to Apple’s credit that it came out and took its lumps. Going above and beyond the call of duty, the execs went into some detail about how the company made a bet on a unique design approach in the hopes that pro users would come to relay on the two GPUs that the system provided. It was a mistake, perhaps predicated on a troubling lack of understanding about what Apple’s professional customers really desired in a Mac Pro. Apple executives wouldn’t specify exactly when they realized that the existing Mac Pro needed to be killed, but it must have been somewhat recently, or this entire process could have happened sooner. (And perhaps a new Mac Pro would arrive sooner than 2018.) Acceptance that the current Mac Pro isn’t going to sell. Apple very rarely announces any product (or even the existence of a product) months in advance. When it does so, it’s generally in a new category. This is because the moment a company announces that it’s replacing a product with a newer model, sales tend to fall off a cliff. (It’s called the Osborne effect.) But in the case of the Mac Pro, it’s already been so long since the machine was updated, it can’t be selling. A signal sent to professional Mac users. The Mac Pro has been sitting, unadjusted, on Apple’s price lists for years now. The company’s silence on the issue has been deafening. In the past year, speculation about the future of the model has risen to a fever pitch, with cranky pro users beginning to brag about building custom Intel-based PCs as “hackintoshes” running Sierra just to show how far behind the curve Apple is. It seems like Apple has twice tried to cool the ire of the market via Tim Cook statements–one embedded in an internal memo, another expressed in public–about the company’s commitment to pro users. But the statements never took. Cook’s statements were so vague that they could be read as negative by those who wanted to believe the worst. Tuesday’s statement, on the other hand, couldn’t be more clear. A promise of a new Apple-branded monitor. Despite reports that an unnamed Apple executive had declared that Apple was “out of the display business” last year, on Tuesday Schiller confirmed that in addition to the new Mac Pro, Apple would release a display to go along with it. It’s possible that cosmetic and technical issues around the LG display Apple promoted with the new MacBook Pros may have prompted this move. Perhaps there was enough negative feedback around the LG display for someone at Apple to convince the powers that be that it was in Apple’s best interest to control this product category rather than leaving it to a partner? And here’s what it wasn’t: An update to the current Mac Pro. Reports from the writers who attended Apple’s private roundtable session used words like “bump” to support the changes Apple made on the current Mac Pro model today. But as Marco Arment pointed out on Twitter, this isn’t an update at all. Here’s what Schiller said: “In the meantime, we’re going to update the configs to make it faster and better for their dollar. This is not a new model, not a new design, we’re just going to update the configs. We’re doing that this week.” The two available Mac Pro configurations aren’t new, they’re just newly priced. So if you must buy a Mac Pro right now, at least it’s a better deal than it was. Not a good deal, mind you, but a better one. A solution for people who need a better professional Mac this year. As excited as we can be that the soap-opera story of the fate of the Mac Pro has been resolved, the fact is, its replacement won’t arrive until 2018 at the earliest, and we know nothing about it. If you’re a professional Mac user with a long-in-the-tooth Mac Pro or iMac and you need more power today, or next month, or this fall, Apple won’t have a new Mac Pro to sell you. Perhaps a new iMac will appeal to you–Apple suggested on Tuesday that iMac upgrades that may appeal to professional users are on the horizon–but if not, it’s going to be a long wait. A commitment to update the new Mac Pro in a timely fashion. Schiller suggested that the new Mac Pro will be more capable of receiving hardware updates, but on what schedule? It seems that Apple’s most high-end users want the company to track hardware updates as closely as possible with new chip releases from Intel. When this new Mac Pro debuts in 2018, will the company take that approach? Or will it do as it has done on most of its other computers lately, and lag behind Intel’s processor releases by months? In the end, Tuesday’s announcement allows Apple to stop the bleeding of a self-inflicted wound. It should probably have come to this conclusion a lot sooner, but whether it was an inability for those who green-lit the Mac Pro to see that they had made a mistake or a simple lack of focus on this particular market segment, the product languished far too long and became an embarrassment. At least now the deed is done. The “trash can” Mac is bound for the garbage dump itself. In the long run, it’s good news for Apple’s professional users. But in the short run, it doesn’t change Apple’s lack of competitiveness compared to other Intel PCs. At least now high-end pros can know that if they’re waiting for a solution from Apple in the next few months, they’re probably out of luck.

In fact earlier this year a report from Apple insider Mark Gurman at Bloomberg hinted that ARM-based MacBook Pros could be launched this year, although it seems that this chipset won’t be replacing Intel’s chipset, but rather exist alongside it. Whether or not that is true remains to be seen, but according to reports, Apple has no plans for pure ARM-based MacBooks. However the report goes to add that Apple did not rule out the possibility that ARM processors could be used as companion processors, which is more or less in line with what the report from Bloomberg had suggested, although Apple stopped short of confirming whether or not that is true. Apple also reiterated that there are no plans for touchscreen Mac computers. Following the launch of hybrid devices like the Surface Pro, many had wondered if Apple could follow suit. However the company has previously explained why this would never happen, with some Apple execs even calling the idea “absurd”, so definitely do not get your hopes up for a touchscreen Mac anytime soon. In the meantime Apple has also announced their plans to “rethink” the Mac Pro, but that we probably shouldn’t expect to see anything anytime soon. Filed in Apple >Computers.

The coddled feeling lasted only until they discovered that the real reason for the apparent courtesy was the old stereotype that U.S. tourists are Ugly Americans on foreign turf. While the students were in the lobby taking group photos (selfies weren’t even a gleam in the late Steve Jobs’ eye), hotel workers were upstairs, rifling through their baggage to make sure the guests hadn’t invoked five-fingered discounts for souvenirs. As I recall, a couple of classmates were trying to smuggle out a few towels, which were confiscated, but the youths weren’t turned over to the KGB. That’s lucky, because Vladimir Putin was a KGB hotshot at the time, and who knows when his punishment methods escalated from slapped hands to killing? So, the young ne’er-do-wells were able to go on their merry way with just stinging hands and without even a waterboarding session. I’m grateful that Annie wasn’t one of them. (Dang, I just had a thought, she told me the story, and she said others were the perpetrators, but she never out-and-out cleared her own name. And I didn’t think to ask.) Of course, that was back when Putin had a fuller head of hair, long before he became president of Russia and years before he began his bromance with Donald Trump, who arguably had more hair at the time, too. Russian hotel rules appear to have slackened over the years, if half of the rumors about what Trump did, before he became president, during stays in Russia — the country where he insists he has no ties or loans. Indeed, Trump insists that he doesn’t even know Putin, although some of his nearly 75 tweets about Putin and interview clips over the years contradict that assertion. But enough about politics. I’ll drop the shiny things that Kate says distract me and return to the topic of hotel thievery. Actually, the trigger for my reminiscence about Annie’s experience was an email from Conde Nast Traveler touting “Hotel Intel.” Headlined “8 Hotel Items Worth Stealing (We Won’t Tell),” the article revealed that 97 percent of travel editors confessed to glomming onto hotel amenities to take home. Beyond the shampoo and other toiletries, pens and stationery that are traditional targets of theft — some almost seem as if they had “take me” signs — fashionable robes topped the list. I confess that I have lusted after those posh robes. However, I lost the lust when I discovered that hotels charge at least 100 bucks — and usually lots more, for such robes in their gift shops — so they aren’t about to let you hang one on a hook in your own bathroom without paying through the nose. Also high on the pecking order are embroidered towels, which many hotels don’t even put in rooms any more because pilfering patrons are less likely to steal plain old towels. Another true confession: I swiped a couple of generic white towels from a San Diego hotel when I was in college and had been overserved in the lobby bar. Problem was, I discovered when I got back to my dorm room in St. Paul, Minn., that the towels apparently had been on the shelf so long that they were discolored at the folds. All was not lost, however, as I gave them to a classmate as her wedding gift. She wasn’t thrilled, but she praised the gesture. (I’m nothing, if not thoughtful.) In short, Conde Nast’s tally was basically a list of things that everybody swipes, anyway. In fact, some homeless shelter operators encourage folks to lift the toiletries and donate them for clients. Be forewarned, though: If you abscond with anything of value, the bill will be in the mail or, more likely, deducted from your credit card without so much as a please and thank you. A La Crosse hotelier who asked not to be identified for professional reasons mentioned one possible loophole, saying with a laugh, “You could probably steal a TV in Vegas but not be charged.” Toiletries aren’t that big of a deal because hotels expect unused ones to land in a bag, and the used ones are headed to recycling anyway, he said. “Wash cloths and hand towels are others,” he said, adding, “I’ve done it myself.” However, pricier items, such as radios, could be tagged onto your bill before you get out of the parking lot. “People will say it wasn’t there when they checked in, but we have a checklist. It gets to a he-said, she-said that’s slippery,” he said. Would-be thieves should know that a hotel that loses too much to theft eventually will have to recoup the money — and every guest will see jacked-up prices. “I’ve never had to do that,” but some do, the La Crosse hotel manager said. OMG, what if the old KGB is still active and combing the world for Annie? She could be, as The Beatles sang, “Back in the U.S.S.R.,” if it still existed.

Additionally, six high-value seven-figure value top-level e-Book related dot-coms, e-BookSite.com, e-BookSale.com, e-BookShelf.com, e-BookStand.com, e-BookClub.com and e-BookMart.com, which have been off-the-market for several decades, have recently been released to auction on www.Afternic.com by one of the world's leading interactive i3D digital content production agencies at five figure and low six figure pricing. Afternic.com currently has partnerships with dozens of other popular domain name auction sites, and can thereby consistently generate up to 75 million daily views of auctioned domain names in real-time through its expansive domain name reseller networks, so that these top-level dot-com domain names will sell to investors, speculators, and e-Book content developers within a relatively short period of time. These dozen or fewer digit top-level e-Book .coms cover websites (e-BookSite.com), sales (e-BookSale.com, e-BookStand, e-BookShelf, e-BookMart), clubs (e-BookClub.com), and promotion (e-BookCover.com, e-BookMark, e-BookEnd). E-Book Domain names that begin with e- ("electronic") are especially valuable these days because e-Books are a multi-billion dollar market, and e-Book, e-Business, e-Mail and e-Commerce are always hyphenated in correct editorial usage. E- domains are also popular due to the advent of affordable consumer electronics, affordable virtual reality 3D, i3D, VR, and AR, and affordable HD (2K) and UHD (4K, or IMAX) iTV Sets, most of which now feature eight-core processors with hundreds of i3D DSPs, or "CUDA" graphics processing cores (also known as "GPUs") from nVidia, Intel and AMD. Many of the top domain name vendors, like AVerisign and GoDaddy, often recommend putting this "e-" in front of the dot-com domain their customers seek to get, especially the short ones, if you cannot acquire a three or four letter dot com name (such as book.com), which are all taken and therefore valued in the millions, at this point in time. Despite many of these domains having a high six-figure, or eventually a seven-figure net worth, they are currently being offered in the low-five-figure to low-six-figure pricing range. This ultimately makes them incredibly affordable for digital e-Book content production agencies, or to top-level dot-com domain investors, for purchase as investments, or for resale to leading industry brand clients. These domains represent less than 5% of the top-level dot-com domains currently in production at the interactive 3D content development agency, and were secured back in the 20th Century, for projects which have been put on the backburner to focus on client work, as well as other higher-profile i3D projects targeted at the currently exploding iTV Set, SmartWatches, Casual Games, i3D websites and interactive eBook market segments. The agency has done i3D content production work for some of the world's largest consumer electronic manufacturing brands, including Sony, Samsung, Epson, Tyco, Mitsubishi, Nokia, Teac, ViewSonic, Compaq (now HP), Digital (DEC), Western Digital, CTX, KDS, ADI, KFC, SGI, Sun Microsystems (now Oracle), Electrohome (now Christie Digital), Eizo Nanao, and Micron Electronics. Domain names which denote virtualized (3D or i3D, and VR or AR) user experiences, such as e-BookStand.com, e-BookShelf.com, and e-BookMart.com, and iTV user experiences, such as iTVset.com, iTVclock.com, iTVmag.com and iTVart.com, are often typed directly into the browser by the end-users, in an attempt to find leading-edge e- (virtual) and iTV content experiences by the end-user. It is important to note that there are billions of iTV Sets and consumer electronics devices with built-in i3D processors (GPUs) and people continue to switch their electronic highway, virtual reality, and game playing activities from their 5 inch smartphones onto their 55 inch (and often 65 to 75 inch) iTV sets. Whereas most people typically have one phone and one tablet, many have iTV Sets in every bedroom, in the family room, living room, home office, and even in the kitchen.

Rather than buy a bunch of new real estate and servers just for that purpose, the company embarked on a journey to create dedicated hardware for running machine-learning applications like voice recognition. The result was the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a chip that is designed to accelerate the inference stage of deep neural networks. Google published a paper on Wednesday laying out the performance gains the company saw over comparable CPUs and GPUs, both in terms of raw power and the performance per watt of power consumed. A TPU was on average 15 to 30 times faster at the machine learning inference tasks tested than a comparable server-class Intel Haswell CPU or Nvidia K80 GPU, Google said. Importantly, the performance per watt of the TPU was 25 to 80 times better than what Google found with the CPU and GPU. [ Further reading: Google launches service to make machine learning easier ] Driving this sort of performance increase is important for Google, considering the company’s emphasis on building machine learning applications. The gains validate the company’s focus on building machine learning hardware at a time when it’s harder to get massive performance boosts from traditional silicon. This is more than just an academic exercise. Google has used TPUs in its data centers since 2015 and they’ve been put to use improving the performance of applications including translation and image recognition. The TPUs are particularly useful when it comes to energy efficiency, which is an important metric related to the cost of using hardware at massive scale. One of the other key metrics for Google’s purposes is latency, which is where the TPUs excel compared to other silicon options. Norm Jouppi, a distinguished hardware engineer at Google, said that machine learning systems need to respond quickly in order to provide a good user experience. “The point is, the internet takes time, so if you’re using an internet-based server, it takes time to get from your device to the cloud, it takes time to get back,” Jouppi said. “Networking and various things in the cloud -- in the data center -- they takes some time. So that doesn’t leave a lot of [time] if you want near-instantaneous responses.” Google tested the chips on six different neural network inference applications, representing 95 percent of all such applications in Google’s data centers. The applications tested include DeepMind AlphaGo, the system that defeated Lee Sedol at Go in a five-game match last year. The company tested the TPUs against hardware that was released around roughly the same time to try and get an apples-to-apples performance comparison. It's possible that newer hardware would at least narrow the performance gap. There’s still room for TPUs to improve, too. Using the GDDR5 memory that’s present in an Nvidia K80 GPU with the TPU should provide a performance improvement over the existing configuration that Google tested. According to the company’s research, the performance of several applications was constrained by memory bandwidth. Furthermore, the authors of Google’s paper claim that there’s room for additional software optimization to increase performance. The authors called out one of the tested convolutional neural network applications (referred to in the paper as CNN1) as a candidate. However, because of existing performance gains from the use of TPUs, it’s not clear if those optimizations will take place. While neural networks mimic the way neurons transmit information in humans, CNNs are modeled specifically on how the brain processes visual information. “As CNN1 currently runs more than 70 times faster on the TPU than the CPU, the CNN1 developers are already very happy, so it’s not clear whether or when such optimizations would be performed,” the authors wrote. TPUs are what’s known in chip lingo as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). They’re custom silicon built for one task, with an instruction set hard-coded into the chip itself. Jouppi said that he wasn’t overly concerned by that, and pointed out that the TPUs are flexible enough to handle changes in machine learning models. “It’s not like it was designed for one model, and if someone comes up with a new model, we’d have to junk our chips or anything like that,” he said. Google isn’t the only company focused on using dedicated hardware for machine learning. Jouppi said that he knows of several startups working in the space, and Microsoft has deployed a fleet of field-programmable gate arrays in its data centers to accelerate networking and machine learning applications.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News 3.5 GHz Wireless Broadband Service Gains Momentum Shutterstock photo Major U.S. telecom operators are currently exploring ways to commercialize usage of 3.5 GHz unlicensed wireless spectrum. Notably, the 3.5 GHz radio frequency is being considered in many parts of the world for the upcoming 5G wireless standard, thus increasing its chances of providing spectrum globally. Verizon Communications Inc. VZ is planning to deploy small cells – both low power and high power – using the 3.5 GHz band. T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for an experimental radio license to test 3.5GHz equipment in Washington State. Meanwhile, in Mar 2017, the FCC awarded AT&T Inc. T a license to test a 3.5GHz network. Sprint Corp. S is also likely to join the bandwagon. AT&T, T-Mobile US and Sprint currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . In Aug 2016, several leading tech giants formed an alliance — Citizens Broadband Radio Services (CBRS) — to explore low-cost ways to provide wireless service using unlicensed 3.5GHz band. Notable among them are Google of Alphabet Inc., Qualcomm, Intel, Ericsson and Nokia. In practice, CBRS alliance works toward defining standards that would allow wireless carriers, enterprises, venue owners and others to deploy 4G LTE networks in the 3.5 GHz band. The increase in adoption of small cells is because of the inconvenience of installing large towers in inaccessible areas. Verizon stated that the small cells will be used to augment its existing 4G LTE and upcoming 5G network and will primarily concentrate on high traffic locations like a business district or shopping mall. Small cells will increase voice capacity and data speeds as well as complement wireless service provider’s LTE infrastructure. Using small cells in unlicensed 3.5 GHz band will thus significantly reduce cost of operations for the wireless operators.  Now See Our Private Investment Ideas While the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

Norm Jouppi, a distinguished hardware engineer at Google, said that machine learning systems need to respond quickly in order to provide a good user experience. “The point is, the internet takes time, so if you’re using an internet-based server, it takes time to get from your device to the cloud, it takes time to get back,” Jouppi said. “Networking and various things in the cloud — in the data center — they takes some time. So that doesn’t leave a lot of [time] if you want near-instantaneous responses.” Google tested the chips on six different neural network inference applications, representing 95 percent of all such applications in Google’s data centers. The applications tested include DeepMind AlphaGo, the system that defeated Lee Sedol at Go in a five-game match last year. The company tested the TPUs against hardware that was released around roughly the same time to try and get an apples-to-apples performance comparison. It's possible that newer hardware would at least narrow the performance gap. There’s still room for TPUs to improve, too. Using the GDDR5 memory that’s present in an Nvidia K80 GPU with the TPU should provide a performance improvement over the existing configuration that Google tested. According to the company’s research, the performance of several applications was constrained by memory bandwidth. Furthermore, the authors of Google’s paper claim that there’s room for additional software optimization to increase performance. The authors called out one of the tested convolutional neural network applications (referred to in the paper as CNN1) as a candidate. However, because of existing performance gains from the use of TPUs, it’s not clear if those optimizations will take place. While neural networks mimic the way neurons transmit information in humans, CNNs are modeled specifically on how the brain processes visual information. “As CNN1 currently runs more than 70 times faster on the TPU than the CPU, the CNN1 developers are already very happy, so it’s not clear whether or when such optimizations would be performed,” the authors wrote. TPUs are what’s known in chip lingo as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). They’re custom silicon built for one task, with an instruction set hard-coded into the chip itself. Jouppi said that he wasn’t overly concerned by that, and pointed out that the TPUs are flexible enough to handle changes in machine learning models. “It’s not like it was designed for one model, and if someone comes up with a new model, we’d have to junk our chips or anything like that,” he said. Google isn’t the only company focused on using dedicated hardware for machine learning. Jouppi said that he knows of several startups working in the space, and Microsoft has deployed a fleet of field-programmable gate arrays in its data centers to accelerate networking and machine learning applications.

ACTUALIDAD MUNDO ECONOMÍA DEPORTES LO MEJOR OPINIÓN MULTIMEDIA TECNOLOGÍA AT & T prueba ‘switches’ de código abierto para mejorar los servicios futuros abril 5, 2017 12:25 pm Una prueba de la costa a costa de la red de AT & T el mes pasado, utilizando ‘switches’ de código abierto de “marca blanca”, señala un futuro de servicios más fiables que pueden llegar antes de los que muchos piensan.         AT&T ha realizado una prueba en su red principal utilizando switches basados ​​en chips de Intel, Broadcom y Startup Barefoot Networks.         Al igual que otros operadores y proveedores de cloud, AT & T está cambiando su red hacia SDN (redes definidas por software). A medida que estos cambios se llevan a cabo a través de más infraestructura, deben dar -tanto a los proveedores de servicios como a los usuarios- más flexibilidad y mayor rendimiento.         AT & T calificó su ensayo como el primero de su tipo en la industria de las telecomunicaciones. Estableció interruptores de “caja blanca” de dos fabricantes diferentes, utilizando procesadores de tres proveedores.         Las tres compañías de chips venden procesadores de red que están disponibles para cualquier fabricante, ayudando a los proveedores a competir mejor con grandes nombres como Cisco Systems que diseñan algunos de sus propios chips.         El chip de Barefoot destaca por sus capacidades y novedad. Anunciado en junio pasado, el Tofino está diseñado para ser más altamente programable que el silicio de conmutación convencional. También promete alto rendimiento, con velocidad de 6.5Tbps (bits por segundo).         AT & T empezó a trabajar con Barefoot y el fabricante de cajas blancas Edgecore Networks. En menos de tres meses, tenían un conmutador basado en el diseño Wedge 100 de Facebook, que no sólo estaba enrutado estándar sino que también estaba programado para nuevas funciones de procesamiento de paquetes. Esas capacidades proporcionan información en tiempo real sobre el estado de cada paquete en la red.         Esto abrirá nuevas capacidades de la misma manera agregando GPS a los teléfonos, dijo Fuetsch. Lo que ayudará a AT & T entregar características inalámbricas de 5G, incluyendo alta velocidad y baja latencia.         Eso llevará a que las redes sean capaces de detectar y responder a las necesidades de cada aplicación. La tarea de hacer coincidir los requisitos de la aplicación con la capacidad de la red, ya sea en un centro de datos o en la nube de un proveedor de servicios, habrá terminado.         Pero esto no ocurrirá en un día, la meta de AT & T, para este año es que el 55% de sus funciones de red se ejecuten en SDN.       cwv Por Confirmado: MariGonz 0 comments   Get Livefyre FAQ Sign in + Follow Post comment   Link Newest | Oldest Call of Duty dará el salto al cine Un juzgado decidirá si Pokémon Go puede invadir la privacidad Destiny 2: Tertulia especial sobre el FPS de Bungie Apple podría enseñar a Siri a reconocer tu voz: reporte Prueban primer autobús sin conductor en Londres Syberia 3 – Gameplay de la aventura gráfica protagonizada por Kate Walker Domina, un título de estrategia y gladiadores, llega hoy a PC Envíe sus comentarios, informaciones, preguntas, dudas: recomendaciones.info@confirmado.com.ve superconfirmado@gmail.com Confirmado | RIF: J-29778546-9 | Todos los derechos reservados © 2017 Si desea obtener información acerca de cómo publicar con nosotros.

As the year kicked off, we knew there were two big releases coming up, and both debuted back at CES. Leading up to that, attention was on the Samsung Chromebook Pro, but ASUS was in the background working on its own option and, spoiler alert, I think it might be the better choice… The best gifts for Android users Hardware & Design The ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA, with its poor branding, is the second laptop part of what I call the “third phase” of Chromebook designs. That means it has stronger specifications, most of the features you would expect, and a design which uses premium materials and has Android apps in mind. Like the Samsung Chromebook Plus, the C302CA hits all of these notes. It offers up a metallic design which looks good, despite having a “sticky” plastic feeling. The squared off edges make the Chromebook feel somewhat thick, but it looks good and is still quite thin overall. Along either side, you’ll find a USB-C port for charging, data transfer, and video output. While the lack of standard ports is a little annoying, personally I don’t mind on this type of device, and I do like that it enables charging the machine from either side. The sides also house a microSD card slot for extra storage, the headphone jack, and the sleep and volume buttons. It’s a simple design and I like it. Display ASUS uses a 12.5-inch display on the C302CA, and it’s pretty solid. The 1080p panel has good colors and viewing angles, and brightness is great as well. It’s not as incredible as the QHD panel on the Samsung Chromebook Plus, but it’s good nonetheless. This panel also uses a standard 16:9 aspect ratio which is nothing to complain about. While 3:2 is great in a lot of ways, 16:9 is what most of us are used to, and it makes using this machine as a computer feel a bit more natural, as well as makes content consumption more pleasing. Software & Performance Specifications are a bit of a weird area for this Chromebook, as ASUS has different builds depending on region. In the United States the model you’ll most likely find for sale is powered by Intel’s Core m3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. On top of these specs, Chrome OS flies. Multi-tasking is excellent as the extra power from the processor and RAM enables me to have several tabs open at once without an issue. Android apps are also good for the most part, despite some minor issues here or there since, at the time of reviewing, the functionality is still restricted to beta channels. Chrome OS & Android apps Just like on the Chromebook Plus, Android apps round out the experience on Chrome OS. They expand on the functionality that Chrome OS already brings to the table and makes it better in many cases. For many users, having native apps for things like music playback and email are huge benefits, not to mention access to all the apps and games Android tablets already have access to. I’ll never say it better than my colleague Abner Li did last year: Android apps on Chrome OS make it a viable competitor to the desktop OS duopoly. I use Windows 10 on a daily basis and, while I have always felt at home on Chrome OS, having access to Android apps just makes transitioning between the two operating systems easier. Keyboard & Trackpad The keyboard on the ASUS C302CA is one of the best I’ve used on any laptop in this form factor. I’d appreciate a bit more key travel, but overall this keyboard is good, offering a fair bit of tactility and good spacing between the keys. The addition of backlighting is also very much appreciated. However, the same praise can’t be given to the trackpad — at all. I’m not sure what happened in the past year or so, but I’ve been noticing that Chromebook trackpads are just getting worse and worse, and the C302CA is no exception. The trackpad feels “sticky” and is just annoying to use. I’ve honestly used the touchscreen quite a bit on this machine simply to avoid using the trackpad. Battery Life One of the obvious benefits of using a laptop with a lightweight OS like Chrome OS is battery life, and the C302CA is no exception. Battery life is solid on this machine, offering up about 8-10 hours with moderate use. Needless to say, I’m pretty happy with those results. Reasons I love Chrome OS… pic.twitter.com/ruoSo2HFXj — Ben Schoon (@NexusBen) March 12, 2017 Final Thoughts Overall, the ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA is a solid machine. The only major improvement I would honestly make is the trackpad. Otherwise, it’s a great little machine that I can highly recommend to anyone. Is it better than the Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro? In my opinion yes, but you might value what Samsung offers a bit more. At $499, the C302CA falls in between Samsung’s two models, and again, I can’t recommend it enough.

A 17-page paper gives a deep dive into the TPU and benchmarks showing that it is at least 15 times faster and delivers 30 times more performance/watt than the merchant chips. In May, Google announced the ASIC designed to accelerate inference jobs for a wide range of applications on its data center servers. Now it is providing a first in-depth look at the chip and its performance in a paper to be presented at a computer architecture conference in June. The paper gives a deep look into both the accelerator and Google’s diverse neural network workloads, suggesting that engineers have much more to learn about the rapidly expanding field. “We want to hire good engineers, so we want engineers to know that we are doing high-quality work, and we want to let cloud customers know our capabilities,” said Norman P. Jouppi, a distinguished hardware engineer who led a team of more than 70 engineers that contributed to the TPU. One of the contributors on the project was retired U.C. Berkeley professor and veteran processor architect, David Patterson, who will present the paper today (April 5) at a gathering of engineers in Silicon Valley. Google also posted a blog on the chip written by Jouppi. The chip is still being used in Google’s data centers today. Jouppi declined to give any details about how broadly it is deployed or any planned enhancements. The 40-W TPU is a 28-nm chip running at 700 MHz, designed to accelerate Google’s TensorFlow algorithm. Its main logic unit packs 65,536 8-bit multiply-accumulate units and a 24-Mbyte cache, delivering 92 tera-operations/second. In benchmarks in 2015 using Google’s machine-learning jobs, the TPU ran 15 to 30 times faster and delivered 30 to 80 times better performance per watt than Intel’s Haswell server CPU and Nvidia’s K80 GPU. “The relative incremental-performance/watt — which was our company’s justification for a custom ASIC — is 41 to 83 for the TPU, which lifts the TPU to 25 to 29 times the performance/watt of the GPU,” the paper reports. The 2015 tests used a 22-nm, 18-core Intel Haswell E5-2699 v3 CPU with a 145-W TDP running at 2.3 GHz. The Nvidia GPU was a 150-W K80 running at up to 875 MHz. Next step: A look inside the TPU The TPU (stars) outpaced Intel's Haswell (circles) and K80 (triangles) in a range of neural network inference jobs.

Image Credit: Screenshot Google today is providing more information about its tensor processing unit (TPU), the server chip that it uses in house to perform artificial intelligence (AI) computing workloads more efficiently. Google has been using TPUs internally since 2015. The company disclosed the existence of the TPU last year but hadn’t said anything more about the technology until now. In addition to publishing a paper on the TPU, Google’s David Patterson is also giving a talk about it today at a National Academy of Engineering event in Mountain View, California. Patterson is one of the paper’s whopping 75 co-authors. Google relies on TPUs for the second of two phases when operating artificial neural networks. First, Google trains the neural networks on lots of data, typically on servers that are accelerated with graphics processing units (GPUs). After that, Google has begun using TPUs to more efficiently make inferences about new data. Google says that compares very well with inference performance directly on GPUs or basic x86 chips. “Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X-30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU,” the authors write in the paper. Those contemporary systems are specifically Nvidia’s Tesla K80 GPU and Intel’s Haswell-generation Xeon E5-2699 v3 chips, the latter of which can be the underlying platform for a TPU. For the past five years, GPUs from companies like AMD and Nvidia have become the default infrastructure for economical deep learning, and Google has contributed to that. But Google, Microsoft, and other companies have also explored other types of chips, including field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), for various AI workloads. Google’s project is notable for its origins, as well as its uses in production; the system is already powering Google Image Search, Google Photos, and the Google Cloud Vision application programming interface (API), among other things, Google distinguished hardware engineer Norm Jouppi wrote in a blog post. One TPU has 3.5 times more memory on chip than a K80, while also being smaller, the authors write. And performance per watt is 30-80 times better. Currently Google can pack two TPUs into a single server, but that’s not to say that it won’t build other hardware systems that lead to better performance or economics. Google has embraced artificial neural networks more strongly than many other technology companies, and in 2013 the company concluded that they were so popular that their use could double the computational demands of its data centers. Doing it all on standard chips would have been unbearably expensive. And so Google began working on its own technology with an eye toward getting cost-performance that was 10 times better than GPUs. “Rather than be tightly integrated with a CPU, to reduce the chances of delaying deployment, the TPU was designed to be a coprocessor on the PCIe I/O bus, allowing it to plug into existing servers just as a GPU does,” the authors write. “Moreover, to simplify hardware design and debugging, the host server sends TPU instructions for it to execute rather than fetching them itself. Hence, the TPU is closer in spirit to an FPU (floating-point unit) coprocessor than it is to a GPU. The goal was to run whole inference models in the TPU to reduce interactions with the host CPU and to be flexible enough to match the NN needs of 2015 and beyond, instead of just what was required for 2013 NNs.” Typically, running code on the TPU is as simple as using the Google-led TensorFlow open source deep learning framework, the authors write.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Apple to Design In-House GPUs for iPhones and iPads Azeem Ullah 2 days ago Apple is famous for having a “walled garden” like ecosystem. From in-house designs for the iPhones and iPads to the iTunes App Store being the only source of downloading apps for iOS. The company is trying its hand at another venture, adding one more important component to its walled garden, GPUs. For a long while Apple relied on Imagination Technologies for designing its GPUs. This will be the first time that the company will be designing its own graphics solution for portable devices. Switched to Intel in 2006 The move could take place as soon as next year. The Cupertino-based company already makes the A-series CPUs it uses in its portables. Macs are an exception to that case, obviously, having switched over to Intel’s processors back in 2006. The phones have, since the beginning used Imagination’s PowerVR series for fulfilling graphics requirements, starting from the iPhone 2G. With all said and done, the shift will be completed in under two years. Apple had previously considered acquiring Imagination Tech, and does own 8% of it. Ultimately it decided to take a different route altogether and get production done in-house. Bad News for Imagination Technologies This is bad news for Imagination Tech. Half of their revenue comes from their licensing deals from Apple. The company’s shares have plummeted by more than two-thirds since Apple’s announcement. Whatever the case, we might hear more of this story as time progresses. That’s because Imagination reckons it’ll be hard for Apple to design a new graphics chip from scratch without infringing upon its intellectual property, not surprising since its designs have been used for more than 10 years now. It could just as easily conclude amicably, with “potential alternative commercial agreements” still being discussed. Only time will tell how Apple’s new venture goes.

Ryzen 7 chips range from $330 to $500, and Intel's Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K marks the threshold of the blue team's high-end offerings at about $350. Broadwell-E CPUs start at $425 and go all the way up to $1650. We're betting that these high-end CPUs aren't where the majority of folks spend their central-processing dollars, though. The strong interest in Intel's Kaby Lake Pentiums and AMD's Ryzen 5 CPUs of late suggests that many builders are looking more at bang for their buck rather than the biggest bang possible.

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Invest in the ‘New Silicon Valley’ Posted on April 5, 2017 by Grant Wasylik There’s a small country in the Middle East. It’s about the size of New Jersey, with just 8.5 million people. It may be easy for investors to overlook it, but that would be a big mistake. That’s because this mighty mite is a global technology powerhouse. It holds the following world rankings: #2 in innovation (World Economic Forum in 2016) #3 in quality of scientific institutions #3 in company spending on R&D #3 in university-industry collaboration on R&D #4 in capacity for innovation #5 in patent applications per million citizens #2 in R&D spending as a % of GDP And when it comes to technological advancements, it actually scores higher than the U.S.! This country has more scientists, engineers, tech companies and venture capital investment per capita than any other country in the world … More than 270 major international technology and industrial companies have significant operational and R&D centers there. That long (and growing) list includes 3M, Apple, Cisco Systems, General Electric, General Motors, Google, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, Qualcomm, Renault-Nissan, Samsung, SAP, Siemens and Tata Group. Plenty of universities and governments also partner with this country’s campuses and institutions, or on bilateral R&D projects: But the thing is, few people know about it — or don’t make the connection. That means this country is an uncharted territory for the overwhelming majority of the investment community. So amateur and professional investors, and even many large institutional investors, are missing out on its potential. However, some pretty smart folks DO know about it. And they have commented on this country’s investment prospects. But you won’t find their comments in the mainstream media … Warren Buffett stated: If you’re going to the Middle East to look for oil, you can skip [this country]. If you’re looking for brains, look no further. [This country] has shown that it has a disproportionate amount of brains and energy. [This country] is the leading, largest and most-promising investment hub outside the United States. Bill Gates declared: The innovation going on in [this country] is critical to the future of the technology business. Rupert Murdoch commented: Armed with the energy and drive of a young nation, [this country] has overcome its small size and population to achieve some truly remarkable developments in science, technology and medicine. With such a wealth of creativity and drive, I fully expect [this country] to remain at the forefront of technological development into the future. Even Albert Einstein saw its promise when he once said: [This country] can win the difficult battle for survival only by developing, painstakingly, the intelligence and expert knowledge of her young people in the field of technology. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates aren’t the only prominent investors with vested interest in this country’s burgeoning tech sector. Carlos Slim, Mark Cuban, Jeff Bezos and Donald Trump are investing there. And celebrities Leonardo DiCaprio, Ashton Kutcher, Toby Maguire, Bono, Serena Williams, Lance Armstrong, Billie Jean King and Jay-Z have investment dollars there, too. So, what do all these companies, colleges, governments, institutions, masterminds and famous affluent people know about this country that most investors don’t? Well, they recognize Israel is a sleepy technology dynamo with an abundance of innovation and intelligence. They understand why Israel has been named the "Start-Up Nation." And why it’s home to more start-ups and innovative companies than any other country in the world. They know the "technology" coming out of Israel goes beyond just computers and chips. A wide range of innovative technology is derived from Israel: biotech, agriculture-tech, defense-tech, clean-tech, info-tech, etc. And they’re aware of one key ingredient that’s present in most Israeli companies … The real genius of Israel — specifically, its tech sector — comes from the military. There’s obligatory military service in Israel. Men must serve from age 18 to 21. And women must serve from age 18 to 20. In terms of imagination and creativity, the mind at 18 is very different than the mind at 30. So, this nation has a lot of really diverse, well-educated, well-trained, highly motivated young people who are constantly coming up with new ideas. Young Israeli men and women are forced to assume leadership responsibilities and to be self-sufficient … After all, you have to be innovative when you’re outnumbered 100-to-1, if not 1,000-to-1, by your enemies. Israelis can’t fight by manpower, so they fight with brainpower. They’re constantly reinventing technologies. The help of the government really brings that intelligence to market. When Israeli computer engineers and intelligence department workers finish their military service, they go out into the Israeli business world. They’re free to use everything they learned in the military and build new technologies that will be important to the rest of the world. Private and public Israeli companies — and U.S. companies with R&D operations in Israel — covet these workers. Remember, more than 270 major international technology and industrial companies have chosen to set up offices there to tap into the country’s tech talent. Virtually every Israeli tech company that’s involved in communications has its roots in the Israeli military. Most of the publicly traded and private-sector companies have founders who came from intelligence units or the engineering department of the military. Many of the military-to-business-world transformers are responsible for creating innovative technologies … For example, high-tech Israel companies have developed:   Machine Vision Technology. Using advanced camera technology and sophisticated algorithms to assist in driver navigation and collision avoidance.   Smart Drip Irrigation. Releasing water in controlled amounts has allowed for precise crop irrigation and water conservation.   PillCam. A "pill" capable of recording images of the digestive tract. It has revolutionized the visualization and detection of digestive-tract diseases and medical disorders.   USB Flash Drive. A compact device that allows for easy storage and transportation of files. And there are many others, as well. How can a country with such a massive footprint in the global tech ecosystem fall through the cracks? An Under-covered, Under-researched, Not-yet-realized Opportunity Most people … and most investors … have no idea that many of the world’s leading companies have important R&D facilities — or are domiciled — in Israel. Nor do most technology users — from online shoppers to Fortune 500 companies — know that they’re using Israeli tech applications and solutions daily, and that there is a lot of "Israel Inside" their devices and technology. Israeli tech is in the news all the time. But the media, readers and watchers usually don’t make the connection. Israeli tech companies frequently provide the critical "back end" to companies like Amazon (AMZN), IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT) and Samsung (SSNLF). Many Israeli-born, technology-related companies like Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Mobileye (MBLY) — with Intel’s major $15.3 billion buyout announced mid-March, Amdocs (DOX), Stratasys (SSYS), CyberArk Software (CYBR), Mazor Robotics (MZOR), SodaStream International (SODA) and Wix.com (WIX) are leaders in their fields. On top of a general lack of recognition, most of these companies don’t make it into the portfolios of actively managed funds, popular indexes or ETFs. Part of the reason is Israel moved from an emerging market to a developed market in 2010. While that’s an upgrade for the country, its weight dropped from 3%-3.5% in emerging-market indexes to 0.4%-0.5% in developed-market indexes. Because of this large weight reduction, most active international equity managers can either completely ignore Israel equities … or simply grab a name or two to fill a miniscule weight in their portfolio. So, even with Israel’s importance in the global tech supply chain, investors still don’t get exposure through major tech indexes and ETFs. Steven Schoenfeld, the Founder and CIO of BlueStar Indexes, told me: The Nasdaq-100 Index (tracked by the QQQ ETF) has only one Israeli company … the Nasdaq-100 Technology Index (tracked by the QTEC ETF) has one Israeli company … the S&P Global 1200 Information Technology Index (tracked by the IXN ETF) has zero Israeli companies … and the S&P Small Cap 600 Information Technology Index (tracked by the PSCT ETF) has just three Israeli companies. Clearly, the representation of Israeli tech stocks in the world’s most-prominent tech indexes/ETFs does not comport with Israel’s significance in the global tech sector. There’s a solid workaround (actually, two efficient ways) for this. And you don’t need to be a billionaire or private equity or venture capital investor to capture Israeli tech in your portfolio. The BlueStar TA-BIGITech Israel Tech ETF (ITEQ) and VanEck Vectors Israel ETF (ISRA) can make investing in the new Silicon Valley accessible to investors of all types and sizes. The Nasdaq-listed ITEQ tracks the TASE-BlueStar Israel Global Technology Index. This index currently has 56 constituents that are Israeli companies, regardless of their listing venue. This ETF and the index provide exposure exclusively to Israeli "high-tech" companies such as information technology, cyber-security, biotechnology and defense technology. The NYSE-listed ISRA tracks the BlueStar Israel Global Index. The index currently has 118 constituents made up of Israeli companies, including those listed on the NYSE, Nasdaq, London Stock Exchange and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. This ETF and the index provide exposure to all sectors of the Israeli economy, including pharmaceuticals, technology, real estate, energy and consumer-related sectors. Both Israel ETFs are off to a nice start in 2017. For Q1, ITEQ finished up +14.3%, while QQQ finished up +12%. And ISRA was up +8.7%, while SPY was up +5.9%. Combined, these two ETFs have less than $50 million in assets. Considering there’s about $15 trillion in U.S. mutual funds and another $3 trillion in U.S. ETFs, that’s barely a blip on the radar. Whether Israeli tech companies are shunned due to their domicile, a negative country stance or other index methodology restrictions, they will likely receive more recognition — and investor interest — at some point soon. The compelling Israel Tech story and the two ETFs’ outperformance in Q1 2017 should help raise the profile of both ITEQ and ISRA. BlueStar Indexes Director of Research Joshua Kaplan suggests an Israeli equity discovery could be under way … When we speak to financial advisers about investing in Israel they are often confounded as to how their clients have such little exposure to Israel. The country is one of the most stable and strongest economies in the world with an explosive tech sector. Israeli equities have the potential to be strong alpha generators outside the well-covered large cap space and more informationally-efficient areas of the market. There’s also strong fundamental investment case for Israeli stocks to boot. To learn more about the BlueStar TA-BIGITech Israel Tech ETF (ITEQ), click here.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Shows Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air TRANSCRIPT Did Susan Rice spy on the Trump transition team? Published April 05, 2017 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 Email Print   This is a RUSH transcript from "The O'Reilly Factor," April 4, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch "The O'Reilly Factor" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET! O'REILLY: Continuing now with our lead story. Did National Security Advisor Susan Rice spy on the Trump campaign and transition team? Joining us from Washington, Congressman Peter King, member of the House Intelligence Committee. And Senator James Lankford, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Now, letters have been circulating demanding that Ambassador Rice come in and testify in front of both of your committees. Senator, we begin with you. How do you assess the situation so far? Say 10 is the most serious story. One is the least serious. Where is this? SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK), SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE MEMBER: I would say it's pretty high close to a 10. Because the accusation as it sits out there is that the Obama administration and people within the Obama administration were using their office in excess to official documents to get access to then political accusations. This is the same accusations flying around with the IRS, for instance, that the IRS was using their tools for political purposes to be able to silent conservatives. If we get close to the campaign time period and they are using official documents, classified documents at that to either release names that's obviously a legal issue, to target individuals that are American citizens that were masked, that's called reverse targeting. But when you say you are targeting people internationally but actually using that to be able to target American citizens, that's not legal, or to be able to use any official document for political purposes. Those are all serious. O'REILLY: Okay. Now, you heard Malia Zimmerman say that the track that she was on with Adam Housley was that it was a political play just as you are concerned about. But if Susan Rice comes before your committee, I can almost guarantee she is going to take the fifth, Senator. Not going to answer your questions. LANKFORD: We still need to ask the questions. I mean, we have a voluntary reach-out to be able to go to her. We don't want to raise it to a level of subpoena unless you absolutely have to. But we have got a lot of witnesses that we're in the process. So far all of the witnesses we have requested have voluntarily agreed to meet with us. We would hope she would, as well. O'REILLY: Okay. But you need to be under oath, Congressman King, for it mean anything. REP. PETER KING (R-NY), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE MEMBER: Absolutely. O'REILLY: Do you expect that the House is going to aggressively pursue that? KING: I am certain they will. We will have to ask Chairman Nunes to be certain. But I'm actually confident that he will. This is -- as Jim Lankford said that if all, even most of these charges that are out there, accusations that are out there against Susan Rice are true. This does rise to a level of very high scandal because it's such an abuse of privacy. I believe it violates the law. And it really is undermining the presidency of the United States. Whether it's Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. This is something that cannot be allowed. So, again, we don't know yet, but based on this very reliable sources, these are very, very serious charges that she has to answer. And by the way they follow logically what Devin Nunes has been saying for the last two weeks. O'REILLY: Now, do you expect your colleagues in the Democratic Party on the House Intel Committee to agree with you, Congressman? That this has to be done in a way that's methodical to the American people know the truth or do you expect obstruction? KING: I think there will be some obstruction. They will accuse us of trying to deflect the issue after way from Russia. We are going to go ahead with it. We have to go ahead with it. And to me, listen, I'm one of those who believe we have to examine, you know, the Russian issue as far as we possibly can but also this. And right now to me there is more credible accusations, if you will, on the side against Susan Rice than there is against President Trump when it comes to Russia. O'REILLY: All right. Now do you see it in the Senate as being obstructionist thing on the Senate Intel Committee or do you think they are going to cooperate? LANKFORD: I think they will cooperate. We have really locked arms throughout this investigation from the very beginning which was for us months ago in the starting that we agreed we are going to go where the facts go. And we don't know where those facts are going to go. But we need research. We have got to be able to pull original documents and sources. Talk to people that are originally involved in the investigation. Pull as many people out as we can to be able to their personal testimony. But let the facts lead us through it not let bipartisan pull us through it. O'REILLY: Yes. But it's got to be hard. Because, you know, a lot of people disagree with me that Ambassador Rice will take the fifth but I think she will. Now, Senator, when you heard her on March 22nd said she didn't know anything about any Trump surveillance and then changed a little bit, it's a nuances that, yes, I was interested for this reason telling NBC that, did that raise anything or do you think that's just a natural answer? LANKFORD: I think that's a natural answer. I think the bigger issue is to be able to press some of these issues when she said she didn't leak anything. You got to ask why were these names so important to the National Security advisor. Obviously the FBI, some of those folks I can understand in a criminal investigation or background. But to the National Security advisor, why is it important? How many staff around her were receiving that and was she aware any of the staff around her were leaking it the question to her was very specific. I didn't do it. And what you need to know is how many places did that information go after it was unmasked. O'REILLY: Okay. One more question to you, Congressman. As I mentioned, the White House gets a briefing every morning from the Intel Agencies. Have you ever heard of a National Security advisor taking this kind of an interest for more than a year in a campaign or a transition or anything like that? You have been around for a while. Have you ever heard of anything like that? KING: Bill, I think it's very unusual for a National Security advisor to take this type of interest at all. It may happen occasionally, but, to me, that's not her job. She is an investigator. She is not a cop. She is not an FBI agent. Her job is to set policy. So, if this is what people are saying it is. This is totally unusual and totally wrong and inappropriate. And if we are talking about veracity here, remember, our first impression of Susan Rice and lasting impression was when she went on all the shows to say that the video was the source of the Benghazi -- O'REILLY: But I don't think that's fair here. Because this is a different situation. And I know that she is embarrassed by that she had to be. KING: Well, she is embarrassed because she got caught. O'REILLY: Again, you are assigning a motive to her. I can't. But she does have a history there. But I don't know if that's -- if she should prejudge this. KING: I'm not prejudging. I'm just saying when you are factor in everything you also consider prior statements and prior conduct. O'REILLY: Okay. And that's true. Gentlemen, thanks you very much. KING: Thank you, Bill. O'REILLY: Please keep us posted. If you get anything, please let us know. Our audience is very, very interested in this story. LANKFORD: Thank you, Bill. KING: Thank you, Senator.

Alvarez Politics 15:23 05.04.2017(updated 19:47 05.04.2017) Get short URL 346251 Last week, United States Department of State official Candace Claiborne was arrested for "making a false statement to the FBI" about meeting with Chinese foreign intelligence operatives. © AFP 2017/ BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI US State Department Employee Charged With Lying to FBI About Chinese Intel AgentsThe Department of Justice said that in addition to abandoning her duty to report the meetings, the accused received gifts from Chinese foreign agents, perhaps as part of a "pay to play" type scheme. The employee also exploited her position and "access to sensitive diplomatic data for personal profit," the DOJ noted. Russian military expert Vasily Kashin told Sputnik China that despite the fact that the arrest took place shortly before a planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, the matter is unlikely to cause massive political outcry. At the same time, according to the expert, the situation is indicative of the high professionalism of Chinese intelligence agencies and serious security problems in US embassies around the world. Claiborne served as an administrative employee at the State Department and was not a diplomat. She was in charge of administration services at US embassies, including at the US Embassy in Beijing in the last years. Claiborne also has a top security clearance and access to sensitive diplomatic information. © Fotolia/ Serkat Photography Keeping an Eye on Trump: CIA Whistleblower Points Finger at Clapper, Brennan, ComeyAccording to unsealed documents, an unnamed relative of Claiborne was also involved in the scheme and was protected from investigation when he allegedly committed a crime in China. "Claiborne worked for Chinese intelligence for five years which is a long period. I assume that her failure was due to her own indiscretion, including mentioning the matter in private communications and in her journal. Maybe, she was not very cautious with her money. This is why US intelligence services could have set sights on her," Kashin said. US intelligence could not find out what sort of information Claiborne had handed over to Chinese agents. She has been charged with lying to the FBI, instead of espionage. She is facing up to 25 years in prison. © REUTERS/ Carlos Barria/File Photo Truth Doesn't Matter: What FBI's Trump-Russia Investigation is Really Aimed At"In practice, many similar cases have collapsed in court and the defendants have not been convicted. Sometimes, the FBI does not want to disclose sensitive information during court hearings in order to prevent confidential sources from being compromised," the expert pointed. Kashin also suggested that Claiborne is likely not the only source of Chinese intelligence in US governmental structures. "Hysteria over Russia’s alleged meddling into the US presidential election and attempts to find evidence to these allegations give Chinese intelligence agents an opportunity to increase their activities," he said. According to the expert, those activities may further increase due to the "demoralization" in the US State Department after Donald Trump was elected president. "There is little support for Trump among State Department officials and experts. New State secretary Rex Tillerson feels alienated from the majority of the staff and avoids direct contact with many employees. At the same time, de facto the US intelligence community is in conflict with Trump. This imbalance gives Chinese intelligence a unique opportunity to increase its activities," Kashin concluded.   Never miss a story again — sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed! ...

HTC U Ocean with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset, Edge Sense to launch in April Home > Technology > Reliance Jio laptop with 4G VoLTE SIM, 13.3-inch screen may launch soon Priya Pathak   |   @Priyapathakview Last Updated: APR 05, 2017 New Delhi Email Author With the initial work on the Jio 4G rollout almost over, Reliance is now reportedly working on a Jio-powered laptop for the Indian market. The laptop, which is likely to have a 13.3-inch screen size, will be aimed at travellers and users who need computer on the go. It will -- obviously -- come with a Jio SIM card already inside it, which will provide the web connectivity through a 4G network to the laptop user. This means that the users won't have to use any dongle to get the internet connection on Jio laptop. The laptop will also reportedly allow VoLTE calls. The report comes courtesy PhoneRadar, which says the laptop will be sourced from Foxconn that has built a similar computer for InFocus.  The SIM slot in the Jio laptop will be placed at its left side. Jio's 4G laptop may run on Windows or Chrome OS, most probably the latter one as it supports all the Android-based Jio apps. Reportedly, the laptop will sport a 13.3-inch FullHD (1920 x 1080 pixels) display with an aspect ratio of 16:9. The report also states that the there will be an HD camera placed above the display for making video calls and that the laptop will powered by a current-generation Intel Pentium quad-core processor. Jio laptop specificationsIn terms of storage, the rumoured Jio laptop will have 4GB RAM, 64GB eMMC or 128GB SDD storage on board. On the design front, the laptop will have magnesium alloy body with 12.2mm thickness and 1.2kg weight. The reports states that there will have slim keyboard without any number pad on it. Although this Jio laptop sounds rather exciting, hold on to your hopes for now. There is nothing official about it. India Today tech has reached out to Jio for a comment and this story will be updated when we get a statement. Also Read: Not just data plans, now Jio aims to disrupt how you watch cable TV At the same time, the specifications of the laptop look too good to be true. Jio, which also sells Lyf phones, is mostly focussed on the lower and mainstream ends of the market right now. This is the reason why most of the Lyf phones are priced less than Rs 20,000. Some of them sell for a price of as low as Rs 5,000. But the specifications hint that the rumoured Jio laptop will be a high-end machine, possibly costing around Rs 35,000 to Rs 40,000 at minimum. It looks very much similar to the Xiaomi Notebook or MacBook Air. 4G laptop a good ideaAlthough the idea itself is not bad. A laptop with a wireless connection provided through a dedicated SIM slot is an enticing idea and often many laptop users have demanded a laptop with SIM connectivity from companies like Apple, which makes MacBook. In a country like India where wired connectivity is bad and availability of good Wi-Fi poor, a laptop with dedicated 4G SIM card inside it can be useful to many users. If there is a company that can really launch such a laptop and pull it off it is Jio. The company, since it rolled out Jio service in September last year, has been in the news for its unconventional business ways. Since its launch, Jio continues to be a free service. It earlier launched a line of 4G smartphones under brand name Lyf that saw a crazy sale because of the Jio SIM that come bundled with it. There are also rumours that company is working on DTH services and may launch it soon. It is also working on Jio Fibre, a wired internet service, as well as already sells 4G dongles.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print GORSUCH BORROWS IN LEGAL WRITINGS – Obamacare repeal hits a wall, again – FREEDOM CAUCUS FIRES OFF WARNING ON TAX REFORM – Nuclear showdown coming Thursday 04/05/17 08:01 AM EDT By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope) With an assist from Elana Schor and Seung Min Kim Story Continued Below GORSUCH WRITINGS BORROW FROM OTHERS — Publications by Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, including a chapter in his book and an academic article, “copied the structure and language used by several authors and failed to cite source material,” Bres and Burgess report. The news comes as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has teed up a Thursday showdown over the nuclear option to push through Gorsuch’s confirmation over the protests of Democrats. The details: “The documents show that several passages from the tenth chapter of his 2006 book, ‘The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,’ read nearly verbatim to a 1984 article in the Indiana Law Journal,” they report. “In several other instances in that book and an academic article published in 2000, Gorsuch borrowed from the ideas, quotes and structures of scholarly and legal works without citing them.” The White House pushed back, calling the claims “a false attack” and a “baseless, last-second smear” by people who don’t want to see Gorsuch confirmed. And the author of the law article, Abigail Lawlis Kuzma, released a statement through Gorsuch’s team saying she does “not see an issue here, even though the language is similar.” But six experts on academic integrity differed in their assessment, “ranging from calling it a clear impropriety to mere sloppiness.” “I've never seen a college plagiarism code that this would not be in violation of,” said Syracuse professor Rebecca Moore Howard, who has written extensively on the issue. Much more, including a side-by-side comparison: http://politi.co/2o8TZoo. And more SCOTUS news below. REPEAL RUNS AGROUND, AGAIN — The White House’s latest effort to revive its Obamacare repeal fell flat Tuesday night after “conservative and moderate Republicans met and realized they had two very different understandings of the changes sought by top Trump officials,” Rachael and Josh Dawsey report. The late-night huddle with Vice President Mike Pence and GOP caucus leaders in the Capitol basement failed to clarify the issue, "leaving Hill insiders speculating whether the White House offered two different potential deals — or lawmakers selectively heard what they wanted,” they report. What’s next: Republicans plan to meet again today. But with GOP lawmakers still far apart on even the parameters that would get both sides closer to yes, it’s unclear where they go next. “There were no agreements tonight in principle, and certainly no agreements in terms of a foundation,” Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said Tuesday after the meeting. What is all but certain: The House will not be voting on a repeal and replace bill before they leave tomorrow afternoon for the two-week Easter recess. More: http://politi.co/2o9pmiK Video du jour-- Rep. Pat Tiberi proving that yes, he really is talking to his mom on the phone and not just trying to avoid reporters’ questions when leaving last night’s meeting, via Matt Fuller: http://bit.ly/2o9lTR6 ** A message from The Coalition to Protect America’s Health Care: The Coalition to Protect America's Health Care fights back against congressional and executive actions that threaten America's hospitals. When our caregivers, our patients, or our communities are at risk, our supporters speak out and advocate. Stand up for your hospital by joining our community today. http://politi.co/2ozIljy ** COUNTDOWN TO RECESS BEGINS. Welcome to Wednesday, April 5 and thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. TUESDAY’S MOST CLICKED: Matea Gold’s tweet pic of Rep. Devin Nunes’ awesome 1990’s mullet got all the clicks. NOW TALK IT OUT — Sen. Jeff Merkley vowed to filibuster Trump's Supreme Court nominee before Gorsuch was even tapped, and he sought to make good on that pledge Tuesday by holding court on the Senate floor over night. While the gesture is not technically a filibuster since cloture has already been filed and it will have no effect on McConnell's plans to confirm Gorsuch, Merkley's move drew quick cheers from liberal activist groups that have propelled Democrats' Supreme Court filibuster. Merkley's campaign also got in on the action with an email to supporters that vowed he would "stand there and talk – for hours, if necessary – to pressure the Republican leadership to pull Gorsuch's nomination." The Oregon Democrat, who started talking at 6:47 p.m. according to C-SPAN, was still going this morning. McCONNELL: FILIBUSTER STAYS FOR LEGISLATION — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may be more than willing to blow up the 60-vote threshold for SCOTUS nominees but there’s one thing he’s promising to never change: the filibuster for legislation. “Who would be the biggest beneficiary of that right now? It would be the majority, right?” McConnell told reporters. “There’s not a single senator in the majority who thinks we ought to change the legislative filibuster. Not one.” Seung Min reports: http://politi.co/2o90s2C FREEDOM CAUCUS WANTS TO PLAY ON TAX REFORM — Leaders of the House Freedom Caucus are firing an early warning on tax reform negotiations: They want to be included from the start or else a tax overhaul might meet the same embarrassing fate as the GOP’s Obamacare repeal. “When a member sees the text for the first time in a leaked draft from Politico, therein is a problem,” Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said, referencing what happened with the repeal bill. Aaron Lorenzo with the deets: http://politi.co/2o9dFsi Today: House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady will meet with Democrats on his committee to talk tax reform. Brady met with members of the centrist New Democrat Coalition Tuesday. DHS CHIEF BACK ON THE HILL — One day after meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly will be back on Capitol Hill to huddle with the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus at the request of CAPAC Chair Judy Chu. DHS officials and CHC members left yesterday’s meeting saying it went much better than the huddle-turned-showdown House Democrats had with Kelly in mid-March. But Rep. Joaquin Castro said there’s still “an incredible reluctance” by Kelly to admit any wrongdoing on the part of his immigration enforcement agents. “There’s a bit of a see no evil, hear no evil mentality on his part,” Castro said. The CHC has asked to meet with Kelly on a regular basis, every six weeks or so. RUNOFF IN RACE TO REPLACE BECERRA — California Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez and former L.A. planning commissioner Robert Lee Ahn appear to be headed to a June 6 runoff to replace former Rep. Xavier Becerra. Gomez had locked up several endorsements heading into the primary, including from Becerra, now the state’s attorney general. Ahn, if elected, would be the only Korean American in Congress, according to the L.A. Times. More: http://lat.ms/2o8VzGY THAT’S QUITE THE RETURN — Former lawmaker turned HHS Secretary Tom Price received three times the return on biotech shares he sold in February after being confirmed to his Cabinet post, James Grimaldi reports for the Wall Street Journal. Price faced intense criticism during his confirmation process for purchasing most of the shares at a discount after being told about a privileged stock sale by fellow Rep. Chris Collins, a board member for the biotech company. More: http://on.wsj.com/2o9cwB8 INTEL COMMITTEES TO VIEW NUNES REPORTS — Soon all members of the House and Senate Intel Committees will be able to view controversial reports about communication from Trump associates swept up in U.S. surveillance. House Intel ranking member Adam Schiff called the move “long overdue and follows an inexplicable series of events in which the White House played a role in selectively and surreptitiously providing the documents to” Intel Chairman Devin Nunes. Austin: http://politi.co/2o9gXvv Meanwhile, conservatives have seized on reports that former national security adviser Susan Rice ordered the names of Trump associates to be unmasked in the reports, actions Rice has defended as routine given the nature of her job. "When it comes to Susan Rice, you need to verify, not trust," Sen. Lindsey Graham said on Fox News. “There's a way to find out. I intend to find out.” Madeline Conway: http://politi.co/2o9h5es NOT THE ONLY MOTORCYCLE CAUCUS IN TOWN — In Tuesday’s edition of Huddle, we highlighted the Motorcycle Caucus being launched by Sens. Joni Ernst and Gary Peters. Turns out while that is the first such caucus on the Senate side, Reps. Michael Burgess and Tim Walberg have been chairing a similar House caucus for several years. TODAY IN CONGRESS — The House meets at 10 a.m. with first votes around 1:30 p.m. and last votes around 4 p.m. Today’s agenda: http://bit.ly/2o8QEWz. The Senate is still in session (due to Merkley’s talk-a-thon) but will start a new day at 9:30 a.m. AROUND THE HILL — Sens. Steve Daines and Thom Tillis hold a press conference with House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Reps. Doug Collins, Darrell Issa and Jim Sensenbrenner in support of Neil Gorsuch at 10 a.m. in front of the Supreme Court. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Reps.

Eric Swalwell and Eliot Engel hold a 3:30 p.m. press conference on their U.S.-Russia relations bill. Reps. Annie Kuster, Patrick Meehan, Jackie Speier and David Joyce announce a bipartisan task force against sexual assault at 4 p.m. in the House triangle. TUESDAY’S TRIVIA WINNER — Mikhael Smits correctly guessed that Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin attended a joint session of Congress in 1978. And King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin addressed a joint session in 1994. TODAY’S TRIVIA — I’ll take today’s question: Who holds the longest straight voting streak in the House and what’s the number of votes cast?

But that hasn’t stopped Congress from cutting vital federal funding for patient care. These cuts make it harder for hospital staff to do their jobs, prevent hospitals from getting beyond their four walls to better serve those who rely on them, and increase wait times and reduced access to medical technologies. We can’t afford any more cuts to patient care. Stand up for your hospital and protects access to the best quality health care for all people.

Apple’s desktop Mac lineup: A showcase of old technology Video MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac Tuesday’s announcement by Apple that the current Mac Pro will be replaced by a new model–but not this year–was one of the most curious ones it’s made in recent memory. It was a defense of the Mac, a promise of things to come, an attempt to reassure professional Mac users, and an admission of failure, all at once. Here’s what it was: A restatement of Apple’s support for the Mac. Three years ago, Phil Schiller sat across a table from me at Apple’s Infinite Loop campus and responded to my question about the future of the Mac by saying, “The Mac keeps going forever.” And in stories posted today based on a prior interview, Schiller said much the same thing. “The Mac has an important, long future at Apple… we have every intention to keep going and investing in the Mac,” he said. For those who doubt the esteem the Mac holds at Apple, it’s worth nothing that Apple has been unwavering in its insistence that the Mac is an ongoing concern, not a product with a rapidly approaching expiration date. A remarkable admission of failure. The lack of updates on the Mac Pro made it obvious that this product was a flop, but it’s still to Apple’s credit that it came out and took its lumps. Going above and beyond the call of duty, the execs went into some detail about how the company made a bet on a unique design approach in the hopes that pro users would come to relay on the two GPUs that the system provided. It was a mistake, perhaps predicated on a troubling lack of understanding about what Apple’s professional customers really desired in a Mac Pro. Apple executives wouldn’t specify exactly when they realized that the existing Mac Pro needed to be killed, but it must have been somewhat recently, or this entire process could have happened sooner. (And perhaps a new Mac Pro would arrive sooner than 2018.) Acceptance that the current Mac Pro isn’t going to sell. Apple very rarely announces any product (or even the existence of a product) months in advance. When it does so, it’s generally in a new category. This is because the moment a company announces that it’s replacing a product with a newer model, sales tend to fall off a cliff. (It’s called the Osborne effect.) But in the case of the Mac Pro, it’s already been so long since the machine was updated, it can’t be selling. A signal sent to professional Mac users. The Mac Pro has been sitting, unadjusted, on Apple’s price lists for years now. The company’s silence on the issue has been deafening. In the past year, speculation about the future of the model has risen to a fever pitch, with cranky pro users beginning to brag about building custom Intel-based PCs as “hackintoshes” running Sierra just to show how far behind the curve Apple is. It seems like Apple has twice tried to cool the ire of the market via Tim Cook statements–one embedded in an internal memo, another expressed in public–about the company’s commitment to pro users. But the statements never took. Cook’s statements were so vague that they could be read as negative by those who wanted to believe the worst. Tuesday’s statement, on the other hand, couldn’t be more clear. A promise of a new Apple-branded monitor. Despite reports that an unnamed Apple executive had declared that Apple was “out of the display business” last year, on Tuesday Schiller confirmed that in addition to the new Mac Pro, Apple would release a display to go along with it. It’s possible that cosmetic and technical issues around the LG display Apple promoted with the new MacBook Pros may have prompted this move. Perhaps there was enough negative feedback around the LG display for someone at Apple to convince the powers that be that it was in Apple’s best interest to control this product category rather than leaving it to a partner? And here’s what it wasn’t: An update to the current Mac Pro. Reports from the writers who attended Apple’s private roundtable session used words like “bump” to support the changes Apple made on the current Mac Pro model today. But as Marco Arment pointed out on Twitter, this isn’t an update at all. Here’s what Schiller said: "In the meantime, we’re going to update the configs to make it faster and better for their dollar. This is not a new model, not a new design, we’re just going to update the configs. We’re doing that this week.” The two available Mac Pro configurations aren’t new, they’re just newly priced. So if you must buy a Mac Pro right now, at least it’s a better deal than it was. Not a good deal, mind you, but a better one. A solution for people who need a better professional Mac this year. As excited as we can be that the soap-opera story of the fate of the Mac Pro has been resolved, the fact is, its replacement won’t arrive until 2018 at the earliest, and we know nothing about it. If you’re a professional Mac user with a long-in-the-tooth Mac Pro or iMac and you need more power today, or next month, or this fall, Apple won’t have a new Mac Pro to sell you. Perhaps a new iMac will appeal to you–Apple suggested on Tuesday that iMac upgrades that may appeal to professional users are on the horizon–but if not, it’s going to be a long wait. A commitment to update the new Mac Pro in a timely fashion. Schiller suggested that the new Mac Pro will be more capable of receiving hardware updates, but on what schedule? It seems that Apple’s most high-end users want the company to track hardware updates as closely as possible with new chip releases from Intel. When this new Mac Pro debuts in 2018, will the company take that approach? Or will it do as it has done on most of its other computers lately, and lag behind Intel’s processor releases by months? In the end, Tuesday’s announcement allows Apple to stop the bleeding of a self-inflicted wound. It should probably have come to this conclusion a lot sooner, but whether it was an inability for those who green-lit the Mac Pro to see that they had made a mistake or a simple lack of focus on this particular market segment, the product languished far too long and became an embarrassment. At least now the deed is done. The “trash can” Mac is bound for the garbage dump itself. In the long run, it’s good news for Apple’s professional users. But in the short run, it doesn’t change Apple’s lack of competitiveness compared to other Intel PCs. At least now high-end pros can know that if they’re waiting for a solution from Apple in the next few months, they’re probably out of luck.

Shop Breaking News ACM Awards Entertainment Fashion Beauty HollyBaby Kardashians ‘DWTS’ Selena Gomez Home Quantico ‘Quantico’ Recap: [Spoiler] Is Kidnapped… ‘Quantico’ Recap: [Spoiler] Is Kidnapped & Harry Runs Into A Familiar Face Mon, April 3, 2017 11:00pm EDT by Avery Thompson 1 Comment The stakes are higher than ever on ‘Quantico.’ The task force team gets their most dangerous assignment yet on the April 3 episode. Plus, Clay’s fiancee is introduced and multiple lives are left in jeopardy. Two masked people, who are likely working for the collaborators, place blueprints and other shady pieces of evidence in someone’s apartment. But whose?! I need answers! See More Photos Of ‘Quantico’ Guess who we’re finally getting to meet? Clay’s fiancee, Max! She’s a feisty one. Their sexy makeout session in bed is interrupted by Clay’s job, the one that he won’t tell Max about. She confronts him about the task force, but he doesn’t tell her anything. The Cash has been accessed again by Rebecca Sherman, an NYC socialite and power broker. She accessed classified intel on passport control. The team needs to get all of her information ASAP. Everyone points to Clay. They want to use him as bait! He doesn’t want to do it and get Max involved. Come on, Clay! Play ball. When Harry Met Clay Harry has officially joined the task force, and there’s one person he doesn’t get along with right off the bat: Clay. Harry calls Clay out for not helping out the team when he has the chance. Clay finally caves. Alex will act as a member of Clay’s private security team. He has to access Rebecca’s personal computer while meeting with her and Max to discuss the wedding. Ryan wants to get Sasha involved, because she somehow knows Rebecca. Before the team heads out, Clay tells Harry to stay back. That does not suit well with Harry. He says that if everyone leaves without him, he won’t be here when they get back. Now someone’s being a bit overdramatic about this… Max and Clay meet up with Rebecca. Alex distracts Rebecca while Clay hacks her computer. Sasha, Alex, and Clay somehow all work together seamlessly. Because Clay won’t tell her anything, Max gets pissed and storms out. Rebecca catches Clay by her computer, but she’s not mad. She wants his help! Apparently, Rebecca helped facilitate connections between collaborators. She’s willing to help the team if they can promise her and her family protection. One of the collaborators agrees to a meeting in Central Park. Once the guy talks, the team will get Rebecca and her family out of the country. Rebecca is relieved that this is all going to be over. She just wants safety and to be with her family. She’s willing to give up her career. She knows what’s truly important. Before she heads out to the meeting, she gives Alex some advice. Rebecca tells Alex that she doesn’t need a man to guide her in this life. The decisions ahead are going to be hard, especially when it comes to loved ones, but Alex has to choose at the end of the day. “Do you need them more than the world needs you?” Rebecca asks Alex. Harry shows up right as the team is about to spread out at Central Park. He begs Clay to take him back in the most Harry way. God, I love him. You Can’t Always Get What You Want Things get dicey quickly. Rebecca’s signal is lost when she’s meeting with the collaborator. He’s shot dead on the spot. Rebecca attempts to run away, but she’s caught in the crosshairs. Owen’s ready to try and help, but Clay tells him to stand back. Alex wants to run to Rebecca’s side and help her. But Clay keeps Alex in the van. He tells her they can’t risk exposure. For once, she can’t be the hero. Alex refuses to let Rebecca die alone, though. She talks to Rebecca until she passes. Harry gets left behind by the team. Ugh. However, he spots Sebastian amidst the madness. WTF?! Back at The Farm, Clay is pissed. They all messed up, including him. Shelby runs into his office and tells him to call Max before anyone else and explain to her what’s going on. Clay is one stubborn Haas and storms out. Alex mourns Rebecca’s death at The Green Leaf and asks herself a pretty important question. “Who gets a call when I die?” she asks Owen. He tells her that people like them don’t have many connections or people to grieve over them. That’s what happens when you choose duty over everything else. “You’re not the person to hide from anything and you never will be,” Owen says to Alex. Their conversation segues to Lydia. They’re still connected, but Owen’s at a loss as to what to do next. Alex advises that he be honest with Lydia and not shut her out just because she’s not who he wants her to be. Please Form A Support Group For [Spoiler] Meanwhile, Nimah calls Ryan out for compromising himself for Sasha. She knows he should leave the team, but she doesn’t want him to go. “You’re my friend yet you make the worst decisions when it comes to women,” Nimah says to Ryan, SLAYING HIM WITH A TRUTH DAGGER. Nimah urges Ryan to compromise Sasha so he’ll know longer be compromised. I love these two. Raina goes back to her apartment and finds all the evidence in HER place. Nimah calls her but Raina doesn’t answer. Raina’s then attacked by the same people who were in the apartment earlier! Knowing what happened to Leon, I’m very scared for Raina. Shelby goes to see Max on her own after her talk with Clay. She encourages Max not to lose faith in Clay. Out of all the Haas family members, he’s truly a good one. He’s obligated to keep secrets because of his job, not because he wants to. She begs Max to not let Clay’s job change her. Clay won’t be able to come back from that. After telling her to not trust Samar, Alex has a change of heart. Shelby calls Samar later, opening herself up to a connection once again. Owen sees Lydia, but there’s clearly tension between them. Harry calls Alex to tell her that he’s done with the task force, but this is not his decision. Sebastian’s holding him at gunpoint! How are you going to leave us hanging like that, Quantico?! HollywoodLifers, what did you think of tonight’s Quantico? Let us know!

FILE PHOTO - A company logo on BOSCH building is pictured at the company's new research and advance development centre Campus Renningen during a guided media tour in Renningen, Germany, September 30, 2015.  The pact between the world's largest maker of premium cars and the world's largest automotive supplier forms a powerful counterweight to new auto industry players like ride-hailing firms Uber and Didi which are also working on self-driving cars. Technology companies and carmakers are striving to adjust to a shifting landscape in the auto industry as consumers increasingly use smartphones to locate, hail and rent vehicles, rather than going out and buying cars. The alliance not only marks an end to Daimler's efforts to develop an autonomous car largely on its own, but moves the auto industry's ambitions beyond simply developing prototype vehicles towards industrial-scale production of self-driving cars. Financial terms were not disclosed of the deal between the two German companies, which was announced on Tuesday. Bosch - which was founded in 1886, the same year that Mercedes founder Carl Benz patented the motorcar - will develop software and algorithms needed for autonomous driving together with the carmaker. Bosch said Mercedes would be able to use the jointly developed system for two years before it could be offered to competitors. The deal will help the automotive supplier make up ground in a competitive autonomous driving system sector where rivals Continental, Delphi, ZF [ZFF.UL] and others have also made heavy investments. For Daimler and its Mercedes division, teaming up with Bosch helps them throw more engineering resources at autonomous cars, allowing them to speed up the process of creating a production-ready system for autonomous cars by several years. The autonomous system will now be ready by the beginning of next decade, Daimler said, without disclosing when it had first envisaged the commercial launch of automated taxis, or robo-taxis. "The prime objective of the project is to achieve the production-ready development of a driving system which will allow cars to drive fully autonomously in the city," Daimler said in a statement on Tuesday. The company will continue to build and sell vehicles that can be manually operated by individual drivers. CAR COMES TO DRIVER The market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles is expected to grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035, Goldman Sachs said last year. Daimler is focusing its efforts on the app-based car-sharing and ride-hailing sector dominated by China's Didi, and U.S.-based Uber [UBER.UL] and Lyft. Like autonomous cars, this market is a big global growth area and is expected to expand by 28 percent a year to 2030, according to consultancy McKinsey. "Within a specified area of town, customers will be able to order an automated shared car via their smartphone. The vehicle will then make its way autonomously to the user," Daimler said. "The idea behind it is that the vehicle should come to the driver rather than the other way round." The cutthroat competition to launch self-driven cars has forced carmakers to shift strategy from an evolutionary towards a revolutionary approach. Instead of evolving driver assistance systems to achieve full autonomy, carmakers are now experimenting with radical car designs combined with software-driven development - which has led to alliances with technology companies. Mercedes-Benz's arch rival BMW teamed up with Israeli autonomous vehicle tech company Mobileye and chip maker Intel last year to develop new technology that could put autonomous cars on the road by 2021. Intel has since agreed to buy Mobileye for $15.3 billion, a deal which followed Qualcomm's $47 billion move to acquire Dutch automotive chip supplier NXP. Before deciding to partner with Bosch, Mercedes-Benz had two engineering teams, totaling about 500 people, working on autonomous vehicles. One took an evolutionary approach, upgrading the capabilities of conventional vehicles, while the other team took a more radical approach to the car's design. Bosch and Mercedes did not disclose how many additional engineers they would assign to the teams in Stuttgart and Silicon Valley. "Cars which do not rely on any driver input have a different architecture and sensor setup, with more radar and cameras," Christoph von Hugo, a senior Mercedes-Benz safety manager, told Reuters at a recent event to present safety systems. NO STEERING WHEEL NEEDED The current Mercedes E-Class can cruise without driver input on highways, keeping the distance to the car in front and staying in lane using a system which has "level 2" autonomy. Full autonomy - known as an "eyes off, brains off" or "level 5" system - does away with even the need for a steering wheel. "We don't want to wait until level 3 has arrived before we start with level 4/5. That will be too late," von Hugo said, adding the prospect of new revenue streams from maintaining fleets of robo-taxis was a big motivating factor for doubling up the carmaker's R&D efforts. Autonomous vehicles came closer to road-going reality after Google unveiled a prototype car which it developed with the help of Bosch back in 2012. Mercedes-Benz responded by developing an S-class limousine that drove 103 km (64 miles) between the German towns of Mannheim and Pforzheim a year later. Real commercial applications for autonomous cars will start to take off between 2020 and 2025, Ola Kaellenius, Daimler board member and head of Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars development told Reuters last month. "If you take the robo-taxi, you start perhaps in a city or several cities or areas of cities, and then you grow from there," he said. "The key is to get to something that you can commercialise, scale up." Bosch is already one of the world's largest suppliers of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and recently announced an alliance with U.S. tech firm Nvidia to develop a self-driving computer for production cars. Mercedes-Benz and auto supplier ZF also have separate alliances with Nvidia. The Bosch-Daimler alliance will rely on high-definition mapping systems provided by HERE, the digital mapping firm owned by BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Intel.

Since the computer is relatively cheap, consumers can use the device to gently ease their way into using macOS especially for long-time Windows users. However, for the last couple of years, the tiny computer has been sort of forgotten as Apple concentrated more on its mobile devices. The last time the Mac Mini received an upgrade was back in 2014. At the time, one might argue that what Apple did on the computer can hardly be called an upgrade. In fact, many have considered it as more of a downgrade. For one, it lost support for hyper-threading by using only Intel processors without hyper-threading support. Furthermore, Apple limited the upgradability of the system by soldering all the components onto the circuit board, including the RAM. Mac Mini (via apple.com) Because of these, some Mac Mini fans were a bit disappointed with the 2014 version which led to its lacklustre sales performance. For a while, Apple has remained quiet about the fate of the tiny computer until recently. In an article from Daring Fireball, Apple SVP Phil Schiller stated that the Mac Mini remains to be a fundamental part of the company’s product line. However, he also said that, at the moment, nothing much can be said about the device. Nevertheless, Schiller then said that Apple envisions the next Mac Mini as a mix between pro and consumer-level use. While the pronouncements are somewhat vague, it could mean that consumers can still expect to see the Mac mini sometime in the near future. While the possible release is still uncertain, it can be expected that the famous small form-factor computer will get a considerable performance boost on its release. As to how much a performance boost it will be, is anybody’s guess. It is quite nice to hear that the cheap and cheerful Mac Mini is still alive and kicking. It would be a shame if Apple completely ditches the computer without a proper send off. For more updates on the Mac Mini, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Cube unveils iWork 3X Apollo Lake tablet with a Surface Pro 4-style display 04/02/2017 at 1:00 PM by Brad Linder 7 Comments Say you want a 2-in-1 tablet with the same display as the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 tablet, but you don’t want to pay full price for Microsoft’s high-end hardware? If you’re willing to settle for a much less powerful processor, Chinese device maker Cube may have a solution. The company has just unveiled a new 12.3 inch tablet with a 2736 x 1824 pixel IPS display and an Intel Apollo Lake processor. It’s called the Cube iWork 3X and it should be available soon, with a Chinese price of 1999 yuan ($290), although it might sell for closer to $360 internationally. The tablet has an Intel Celeron N3450 quad-core processor, 6GB of DDR3 memory, and a 128GB solid state drive. It features HDMI, a USB Type-C port, a microSD card slot, and an 8,500 mAh battery. The Cube iWork 3X has a built-in adjustable kickstand that lets you prop it up on a table. It’s also designed to work with a keyboard cover, but it seems the keyboard will be sold separately. The tablet measures 11.8″ x 7.1″ x 0.4″ and weighs weighs about 1.6 pounds. via TechTablets and Weibo Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 7 Comments on "Cube unveils iWork 3X Apollo Lake tablet with a Surface Pro 4-style display" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member Jerry Rioux Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 5 April 2017 | MYT 9:12 AM Mercedes joins forces with Bosch to develop self-driving taxis This new partnership forms a powerful counterweight to new auto industry players like ride-hailing firms Uber and Didi which are also working on self-driving cars. — Reuters FRANKFURT: Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler and supplier Robert Bosch are teaming up to develop self-driving cars in an alliance aimed at accelerating the production of "robo-taxis". The pact between the world's largest maker of premium cars and the world's largest automotive supplier forms a powerful counterweight to new auto industry players like ride-hailing firms Uber and Didi which are also working on self-driving cars. Technology companies and carmakers are striving to adjust to a shifting landscape in the auto industry as consumers increasingly use smartphones to locate, hail and rent vehicles, rather than going out and buying cars. The alliance not only marks an end to Daimler's efforts to develop an autonomous car largely on its own, but moves the auto industry's ambitions beyond simply developing prototype vehicles towards industrial-scale production of self-driving cars. Financial terms were not disclosed of the deal between the two German companies, which was announced on Tuesday. Bosch – which was founded in 1886, the same year that Mercedes founder Carl Benz patented the motorcar – will develop software and algorithms needed for autonomous driving together with the carmaker. The deal will help the automotive supplier make ground in a competitive autonomous driving system sector where rivals Continental and Delphi and others have also made heavy investments. For Daimler and its Mercedes division, teaming up with Bosch helps them throw more engineering resources at autonomous cars, allowing them to speed up the process of creating a production-ready system for autonomous cars by several years. The autonomous system will now be ready by the beginning of next decade, Daimler said, without disclosing when it had first envisaged the commercial launch of automated taxis, or robo-taxis. "The prime objective of the project is to achieve the production-ready development of a driving system which will allow cars to drive fully autonomously in the city," Daimler said in a statement on Tuesday. Car comes to driver The market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles is expected to grow from about US$3bil (RM13.2bil)  in 2015 to US$96bil (RM425.2bil)  in 2025 and US$290bil (RM1.2tril) in 2035, Goldman Sachs said last year. Daimler is focussing its efforts on the app-based car-sharing and ride-hailing sector dominated by China's Didi, and US-based Uber and Lyft. Like autonomous cars, this market is a big global growth area and is expected to expand by 28% a year to 2030, according to consultancy McKinsey. "Within a specified area of town, customers will be able to order an automated shared car via their smartphone. The vehicle will then make its way autonomously to the user," Daimler said. "The idea behind it is that the vehicle should come to the driver rather than the other way round." The cutthroat competition to launch self-driven cars has forced carmakers to shift strategy from an evolutionary toward a revolutionary approach. Instead of evolving driver assistance systems to achieve full autonomy, carmakers are now experimenting with radical car designs combined with software-driven development – which has led to alliances with technology companies  Mercedes-Benz's arch rival BMW teamed up with Israeli autonomous vehicle tech company Mobileye and chip maker Intel last year to develop new technology that could put autonomous cars on the road by 2021. Intel has since agreed to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for US$15.3bil (RM67.7bil), a deal which followed Qualcomm's US$47bil (RM208bil) move to acquire Dutch automotive chip supplier NXP. Before deciding to partner with Bosch, Mercedes-Benz had two engineering teams working on autonomous vehicles. One took an evolutionary approach, upgrading the capabilities of conventional vehicles, while the other team took a more radical approach to the car's design. "Cars which do not rely on any driver input have a different architecture and sensor setup, with more radar and cameras," Christoph von Hugo, a senior Mercedes-Benz safety manager, told Reuters at a recent event to present safety systems. No steering wheel needed The current Mercedes E-Class can cruise without driver input on highways, keeping the distance to the car in front and staying in lane using a system which has "level 2" autonomy. Full autonomy – known as an "eyes off, brains off" or "level 5" system – does away with even the need for a steering wheel. "We don't want to wait until level three has arrived before we start with level 4/5. That will be too late," von Hugo said, adding that the prospect of new revenue streams from maintaining fleets of robo-taxis was a big motivating factor for doubling up the carmaker's R&D efforts. Autonomous vehicles came closer to road-going reality after Google unveiled a prototype car which it developed with the help of Bosch back in 2012. Mercedes-Benz responded by developing an S-class limousine that drove 103 km (64 miles) between the German towns of Mannheim and Pforzheim a year later. Real commercial applications for autonomous cars will start to take off between 2020 and 2025, Ola Kaellenius, Daimler board member and head of Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars development told Reuters last month. "If you take the robo-taxi, you start perhaps in a city or several cities or areas of cities, and then you grow from there," he said. "The key is to get to something that you can commercialise, scale up." The systems and hardware expertise provided by Bosch will help Mercedes-Benz make autonomous car technology which can be produced in large numbers. Bosch is already one of the world's largest suppliers of advanced driver assistance systems and recently announced an alliance with US tech firm Nvidia  to develop a self-driving computer for production cars. Mercedes-Benz and auto supplier ZF also have separate alliances with Nvidia.

That's where the new mid-range Ryzen 5 family comes into play, with the first early review on AMD's upcoming Ryzen 5 1600 processor comes into play.     The new AMD Ryzen 5 1600 is quite the beast, with 6C/12T of performance - and priced at just $219... considering the Core i7-7700K (4C/8T, but it is a faster gaming CPU) costs $345. If we compare 6C/12T between AMD and Intel, then we look at the Core i7-5930K which still costs a huge $599 on Amazon. AMD is offering the Ryzen 5 1600 for nearly 1/3 the price, but offering 6C/12T performance for multi-threaded CPU performance, and now we have some leaked benchmarks to look over.     First up, some multi-threaded CPU-Z testing, where it beats the 4C/8T processor from Intel in the Core i7-7700K.     Next up, some Cinebench 15 goodness - where the 6C/12T lets loose, beating the Core i7-7700K and the 6C/12T chip from Intel in the Core i7-5930K.     1080p gaming performance is comparable to the Core i7-6700K, which is still one of the best gaming CPUs on the market.     What about 4K gaming? Yeah, some DAMN GOOD results from the Ryzen 5 1600!

Military Military: The Intel Marine's bracelet finally makes it home from WWII Marine's bracelet finally makes it home from WWII Master Sgt. Harry Francis Campbell's bracelet was found by Steven and Simone Turner at Point Erin Park in Auckland, New Zealand, and was returned to his children during a ceremony at Camp Pendleton. Master Sgt. Harry Francis Campbell's bracelet was found by Steven and Simone Turner at Point Erin Park in Auckland, New Zealand, and was returned to his children during a ceremony at Camp Pendleton. Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter The bracelet of a WWII Marine finally makes it home from the Pacific. Marine Harry Campbell fought in the South Pacific at the Battle of Guadalcanal in World War II. The young man made it home from that bloody conflict, but his identification bracelet didn’t. Nearly 75 years later, a family in New Zealand found Campbell’s bracelet buried underneath six inches of sand on an Auckland beach. The bracelet was returned to Campbell’s children at a Camp Pendleton ceremony last week, and the experience has reopened a chapter of their father’s life that was rarely glorified. Master Sgt. Harry Fr Lance Cpl. Austin Mealy / 1st Marine Division Master Sgt. Harry Francis Campbell's bracelet was found by Steven and Simone Turner at Point Erin Park in Auckland, New Zealand. Master Sgt. Harry Francis Campbell's bracelet was found by Steven and Simone Turner at Point Erin Park in Auckland, New Zealand. (Lance Cpl. Austin Mealy / 1st Marine Division) “He was never boastful about it,” his son, Jim Campbell, said in a telephone interview Tuesday. “We learned more last Friday than I’ve know before. It filled in some of the gaps.” The Turner family of New Zealand found the bracelet while combing a beach there with a metal detector. They decided to find its rightful owner and return it. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day The bracelet was typical of what some troops wore as a secondary ID. It bore Campbell’s name and his military serial number. On the back, someone inscribed the word Guadalcanal and the dates of the battle. The Battle of Guadalcanal is considered a pivotal campaign of the Pacific war. The Japanese held that portion of the Solomon Islands until the U.S. Marines launched a surprise attack in August 1942. In the ensuing battles, both sides took big losses to their ship fleets. But the Japanese suffered greater casualties on the ground, forcing them to withdrawal from Guadalcanal in early 1943. Campbell served with Camp Pendleton’s 1st Marine Division during that battle. Afterwards, before returning to the United States, the division was sent to Australia for rest and rehabilitation. That’s likely when Campbell lost his bracelet. From New Zealand, the Turners first reached out to the U.S. Marine sources in Hawaii. Someone there researched Guadalcanal and found Campbell’s name. Then they researched his whereabouts and discovered the plot at Riverside National Cemetery where the elder Campbell was interred in 2014. Next, the Campbells got a call from the Marines. Jim Campbell said were surprised when that phone call led to a honors ceremony Friday at Camp Pendleton, where leaders of the 1st Marine Division made Jim Campbell and his sister, Patti, honorary members. The Marine Corps band played “Waltzing Mathilda,” the division’s official song. The song is a nod to the post-Guadalcanal era when the division was taking time off in Australia. Jim Campbell said his father always held his wartime service close to his heart. After discharge, Harry Campbell went on to serve on the police force in his native Kansas City, Missouri, and then moved to California to work in the oil industry. The elder Campbell joined the Air Force Reserve, retiring as a master sergeant. But he always remembered his Marine Corps service. “He was very, very proud of it. Whenever he would meet another Marine, and they’d say, ‘Where were you at?’ and he’d say, ‘1st Marine Division’ and then he’d say ‘Guadalcanal.’ And just the admiration of the other people,” Jim Campbell remembers. Campbell said he only wishes the bracelet had been found sooner, so that his father could have seen accepted it in person. “It would have been wonderful to see the look on his face, and he could have filled in all the gaps that we are trying to do now,” Campbell said. But, he added, “He’s probably looking down with a great, big smile on his face.” Caption Investigation uncovers problems with America's fleet of nuclear couriers Office of Secure Transportation big rigs haul nuclear weapons and highly enriched uranium on the nation's highways each day.

Some of these claims have a specific meaning, while others are left to be interpreted by the users. These claims can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. Examples of these claims are issuer (iss), subject (sub), audience (aud), expiration time (exp), not before (nbf), and issued at (iat). JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or Elliptic-Curve. Structure of a JSON Web Token A signed, compact-serialized JWT consists of three main parts separated by a .namely: Header Payload Signature A JWT comes in this structure, aaaaaa.bbbbbb.ccccc. aaaaaaa represents the header, bbbbb represents the payload while cccccc represents the signature. Header The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the hashing algorithm such as HS256 or RS256. Example: {
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
} Then, this JSON is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT. Payload This part of the token carries the claims. An example of a payload can be found below: {
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "manager": true
} The payload is then Base64Url encoded to form the second part of the JWT. Signature The last part of the token is the signature. The signature is composed from the signing of the encoded header, encoded payload, and a secret. An example of a signature using the HMAC SHA256 (HS256) algorithm can be created like so: HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret) A signed JWT JWT Signing Algorithms The most common algorithms for signing JWTs are: HMAC + SHA256 (HS256) RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 + SHA256 (RS256) ECDSA + P-256 + SHA256 ( ES256) HS256 Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) is an algorithm that combines a certain payload with a secret using a cryptographic hash function like SHA-256. The result is a code that can be used to verify a message only if both the generating and verifying parties know the secret. In other words, HMACs allow messages to be verified through shared secrets. This is an example showcasing an HMAC-based signing algorithm: const encodedHeader = base64(utf8(JSON.stringify(header)));
const encodedPayload = base64(utf8(JSON.stringify(payload)));
const signature = base64(hmac(`${encodedHeader}.${encodedPayload}`, 
                              secret, sha256));
const jwt = `${encodedHeader}.${encodedPayload}.${signature}`; An example of signing a JWT with the HS256 algorithm using the jsonwebtoken JavaScript library can be found below: var jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const payload = {
  sub: "1234567890",
  name: "John Doe",
  manager: true
};

const secretKey = 'secret';

const token = jwt.sign(payload, secretKey, { 
    algorithm: 'HS256',
    expiresIn: '10m' // if ommited, the token will not expire
}); RS256 RSA is a public-key algorithm. Public-key algorithms generate split keys: one public key and one private key. For public-key signing algorithms: const encodedHeader = base64(utf8(JSON.stringify(header)));
const encodedPayload = base64(utf8(JSON.stringify(payload)));
const signature = base64(rsassa(`${encodedHeader}.${encodedPayload}`, 
                                privateKey, sha256));
const jwt = `${encodedHeader}.${encodedPayload}.${signature}`; When signing and verifying JWTs signed with RS256, you deal with a public/private key pair rather than a shared secret. There are many ways to create RSA keys. OpenSSL is one of the most popular libraries for key creation and management: # Generate a private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

# Derive the public key from the private key
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem Both PEM files are simple text files. Their contents can be copied and pasted into your JavaScript source files and passed to the jsonwebtoken library. // You can get this from private_key.pem above.
const privateRsaKey = `<YOUR-PRIVATE-RSA-KEY>`; 

const signed = jwt.sign(payload, privateRsaKey, {
    algorithm: 'RS256',
    expiresIn: '5s'
}); // You can get this from public_key.pem above.
const publicRsaKey = `<YOUR-PUBLIC-RSA-KEY>`;

const decoded = jwt.verify(signed, publicRsaKey, {
    // Never forget to make this explicit to prevent
    // signature stripping attacks.
    algorithms: ['RS256'], 
}); ES256 ECDSA algorithms also make use of public keys. We can use OpenSSL to generate the key as well: # Generate a private key (prime256v1 is the name of the parameters used
# to generate the key, this is the same as P-256 in the JWA spec). 
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out ecdsa_private_key.pem

# Derive the public key from the private key
openssl ec -in ecdsa_private_key.pem -pubout -out ecdsa_public_key.pem If you open these files you will note that there is much less data in them. This is one of the benefits of ECDSA over RSA. The generated files are in PEM format as well, so simply pasting them in your source will suffice. // You can get this from private_key.pem above.
const privateEcdsaKey = `<YOUR-PRIVATE-ECDSA-KEY>`; 

const signed = jwt.sign(payload, privateEcdsaKey, {
    algorithm: 'ES256',
    expiresIn: '5s'
}); // You can get this from public_key.pem above.
const publicEcdsaKey = `<YOUR-PUBLIC-ECDSA-KEY>`;

const decoded = jwt.verify(signed, publicEcdsaKey, {
    // Never forget to make this explicit to prevent
    // signature stripping attacks.
    algorithms: ['ES256'], 
}); Note: These algorithm notes above are excerpts from the very comprehensive Auth0 JWT book written by Sebastian Peyrott. Download it for more information on signing and validating JWTs using these algorithms mentioned above. Brute Forcing an HS256 JSON Web Token As secure as HS256 is, especially when implemented the right way, brute-forcing a JSON web token signed with small and medium sized shared-secrets using HS256 is still very possible. Recently, I came across a tool written in C on GitHub. It is a multi-threaded JWT brute force cracker. With a huge computing power, this tool can find the secret key of a HS256JSON Web token. Please note the RFC7518 standard states that, "A key of the same size as the hash output (for instance, 256 bits for "HS256") or larger MUST be used with this algorithm." Auth0 secret keys exceed this requirement making cracking via this or similar tools all but impossible. Implementing a Brute Force Attack I used a Mac computer to try out the brute force attack. First, make sure you have openssl installed. If it is not, install it with homebrew like so: brew install openssl Then run this command in the terminal like so: make OPENSSL=/usr/local/opt/openssl/include OPENSSL_LIB=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib On Ubuntu, you can install openssl like so: apt-get install libssl-dev The specs of my MacBook are mentioned below: Processor 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5. Memory 8GB 1867 MHz DDR3. Graphics Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB. Go ahead and clone the jwt-cracker from GitHub. An example JWT signed with HS256 and a secret, Sn1f is: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.cAOIAifu3fykvhkHpbuhbvtH807-Z2rI1FS3vX1XMjE Now, run the jwt-cracker from your terminal to crack the token like so: time ./jwtcrack eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.cAOIAifu3fykvhkHpbuhbvtH807-Z2rI1FS3vX1XMjE Note: Make sure the jwtcrack script is executable by running chmod a+x./jwtcrack It took about 6.16s on my laptop to crack the secret key. With the help of jwt.io, let's sign another token quickly, but with a secret, secret. Run the cracker again with the new JWT like so: time ./jwtcrack eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ Crack another token From the results shown above, it cracked the token and got our secret, which is actually secret, in about 3273.51s. Security Concerns and Recommendation Let's take another look at the keys we used to generate the tokens that were cracked easily. What are the key sizes? The first key, Sn1f, is 32-bit. 1 character = 8 bits The second key, secret, is 48-bit. This is simply too short to be a valid key. In fact, the JSON Web Algorithms RFC 7518 states that a key of the same size as the hash output (for instance, 256 bits for "HS256") or larger MUST be used with the HS256 algorithm. I, therefore, recommend that anyone trying to generate a JSON Web token and signing them with HS256 to use a properly sized secret key. Auth0 secret keys are 512 bits in length and not susceptible to this type of brute force attack. Additionally, Auth0 allows you to easily sign your JWTs with RS256. Conclusion JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are lightweight and can easily be used across platforms and languages. They are a clever way to pass signed or encrypted information between applications. There are several JWT libraries available for signing and verifying the tokens. We have also been able to show that brute forcing of HS256 JWTs is certainly possible when used with short and weak secret keys. Unfortunately, this is a limitation of most shared-key approaches. All cryptographic constructions, including HS256, are insecure if used with short keys, so ensure that implementations satisfy the standardized requirements. As a rule of thumb, make sure to pick a shared-key as long as the length of the hash. For HS256 that would be a 256-bit key (or 32 bytes) minimum.  Find out how Waratek’s award-winning virtualization platform can improve your web application security, development and operations without false positives, code changes or slowing your application.

But Google isn't the only one pursing AI chips. Qualcomm is building AI technology into its mobile chips, which could give machine-learning tasks a boost on your phone when you don't want to wait for a Google server on the other side of the network.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 6 April 2017 | MYT 11:00 AM Tech underestimates future demand for privacy: opinion by leonid bershidsky Just great: People the world over should be aware that using any of the services provided by major US-based Internet companies means giving up privacy altogether and opening up the most personal data to anyone, including malicious hackers whose work is now a lot easier because a lot of eggs are being put in large baskets. — AFP Relaxnews US Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey designed his social media presence to be safe from prying eyes. He set up a private Instagram account only followed by family members, and subscribed to Twitter under a false name.  After just one mention in a public speech, it took only a few hours of a reporter's time to discover the accounts with certainty approaching 100%. (Apparently in response to the story, the Twitter account – which quickly started gaining followers – is now available only to subscribers approved by its owner.)  If anyone really wants Comey's family pictures and media-reading history, the Instagram and Twitter accounts will be hacked in no time. In any case, the companies involved have the data, and the Senate recently voted to allow Internet service providers to sell personal browsing and app usage histories to advertisers – or, presumably, to anybody who wants them.  Meanwhile, the Internet privacy of non-US citizens is not protected at all thanks to an executive order that tells agencies foreigners are exempt from the US Privacy Act, even though European officials cling to the illusion of an unenforceable “Privacy Shield” arrangement with the US. (Under it, affected Europeans are invited to sue in US courts; I'd have to be officially accused of being the leader of ISIS before I'd contemplate that.)  People the world over should be aware that using any of the services provided by major US-based Internet companies means giving up privacy altogether and opening up the most personal data to governments, advertisers, the press and private investigators. It also makes malicious hackers' work a lot easier because a lot of eggs are being put in large baskets.  Up until now, the services have flourished anyway thanks to the well-known privacy paradox: people say they care about their privacy, but in practice they willingly give it up for convenience. My favorite explanation of the phenomenon is so-called “benefit immediacy": When the benefits of disclosure are instantaneous while the risks are delayed, the benefits are perceived to be higher than the risks. Last year's Pew Research study of the paradox showed a plurality of Americans is fine with giving up shopping histories in exchange for a discount card, but not with putting tracking devices in cars in exchange for cheaper car insurance.  The trade-off, though, is highly fluid; customers may become hostile to privacy intrusions by the tech industry if there are more major security breaches and more people are personally affected. So while investment currently flows mostly to companies whose products further compromise privacy – such as Uber, which knows everything about its customers' movements and has been known to misuse the information, or Internet of Things startups that essentially install surveillance technology in people's homes – privacy protection may be Silicon Valley's next hot play.  While there are many privacy protection products available, from browsers that block trackers to messenger applications offering end-to-end encryption, using one or several such products doesn't guarantee true safety: users need a holistic approach that entails lifestyle changes to stay safe but still connected to the tech-enabled universe.  A company called Purism, for example, sells laptops with maximum privacy and security in mind. It means not using certain processors – like recent Intel ones – that enable remote access to the computers even when they're powered off. It also employs an operating system (Linux-based) that prevents information collection, and has privacy-ensuring software, from a custom browser to encrypted messaging to a Google-bypassing map app.  If one has the discipline to give up the social networks (especially Facebook, whose data collection practices are so complex that it's probably fair to say no outsider understands them) a Purism machine can take care of all the basic privacy and security needs. But Purism is a tiny firm, which has had to crowdfund its component inventory. It gets some attention in the tech press, but not enough for a breakthrough: Its target audience is considered paranoid.  Because much of the tech economy is advertising-financed, and advances in important fields such as big data and artificial intelligence depend on people's propensity to share lots of information, much of it inadvertently, privacy concerns have taken a back seat. That doesn't mean, however, that the status quo is sustainable.  I wrote recently about a similar lack of investment in devices that work to reduce, not increase, people's device dependency; at some point, when medical science judges the digital media addiction as dangerous as the tobacco one and there's public pressure to combat it, the money will come. The same goes for privacy.  The more intrusive the tech industry becomes, the less users want to be the commodity sold by tech companies to advertisers or other exploiters of behavioural data and the more demand there will be for means of resistance. Investors betting on a Big Brother future may be in for some nasty surprises; those who bet against its endurance may be rewarded for their prescience. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Traffic offenders, watch out – you could lose your licence under Kejara system Co-ordinate donations to prevent surplus and abuse Forest City project: Penalty for China buyers who seek to cancel purchase Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie 8 types of runners you meet at a marathon Craft yourself a new career by embracing digital learning Others Also Read Copter ‘quietly’ attracts interest Kicking out the jams Snooker - Women's great Evans edges Hull, two wins from Crucible advertisement Latest News UK increases pressure on Google to remove terrorist content UK and Swedish watchdogs warn of international cyberattack Emirates joins Etihad, Qatar in US cabin laptop ban workaround Australian regulator sues Apple alleging iPhone ‘bricking’ Europe regulator says airlines’ tech ban may compromise safety Most Viewed in Tech Pepsi pulls Kendall Jenner ad after social media backlash Emirates joins Etihad, Qatar in US cabin laptop ban workaround Australian regulator sues Apple alleging iPhone ‘bricking’ Forget Apple; Xiaomi CEO now wants to be more like Costco Europe regulator says airlines’ tech ban may compromise safety Google’s AI hasn’t passed its biggest test yet: hunting hate Office workers most likely using lunch hour to plan their vacation: Kayak Samsung's foldable smartphone could land this year UK and Swedish watchdogs warn of international cyberattack New travel trends report shows how fliers search and book flights Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannMore By Edward Taylor FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler and supplier Robert Bosch are teaming up to develop self-driving cars in an alliance aimed at accelerating the production of "robo-taxis". The pact between the world's largest maker of premium cars and the world's largest automotive supplier forms a powerful counterweight to new auto industry players like ride-hailing firms Uber and Didi which are also working on self-driving cars. Technology companies and carmakers are striving to adjust to a shifting landscape in the auto industry as consumers increasingly use smartphones to locate, hail and rent vehicles, rather than going out and buying cars. The alliance not only marks an end to Daimler's efforts to develop an autonomous car largely on its own, but moves the auto industry's ambitions beyond simply developing prototype vehicles towards industrial-scale production of self-driving cars. Financial terms were not disclosed of the deal between the two German companies, which was announced on Tuesday. Bosch - which was founded in 1886, the same year that Mercedes founder Carl Benz patented the motorcar - will develop software and algorithms needed for autonomous driving together with the carmaker. The deal will help the automotive supplier make ground in a competitive autonomous driving system sector where rivals Continental and Delphi ZF and others have also made heavy investments. For Daimler and its Mercedes division, teaming up with Bosch helps them throw more engineering resources at autonomous cars, allowing them to speed up the process of creating a production-ready system for autonomous cars by several years. The autonomous system will now be ready by the beginning of next decade, Daimler said, without disclosing when it had first envisaged the commercial launch of automated taxis, or robo-taxis. "The prime objective of the project is to achieve the production-ready development of a driving system which will allow cars to drive fully autonomously in the city," Daimler said in a statement on Tuesday. CAR COMES TO DRIVER The market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles is expected to grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035, Goldman Sachs said last year. Daimler is focusing its efforts on the app-based car-sharing and ride-hailing sector dominated by China's Didi, and U.S.-based Uber and Lyft. Like autonomous cars, this market is a big global growth area and is expected to expand by 28 percent a year to 2030, according to consultancy McKinsey. "Within a specified area of town, customers will be able to order an automated shared car via their smartphone. The vehicle will then make its way autonomously to the user," Daimler said. "The idea behind it is that the vehicle should come to the driver rather than the other way round." The cutthroat competition to launch self-driven cars has forced carmakers to shift strategy from an evolutionary toward a revolutionary approach. Instead of evolving driver assistance systems to achieve full autonomy, carmakers are now experimenting with radical car designs combined with software-driven development - which has led to alliances with technology companies. Mercedes-Benz's arch rival BMW teamed up with Israeli autonomous vehicle tech company Mobileye and chip maker Intel last year to develop new technology that could put autonomous cars on the road by 2021. Intel has since agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion, a deal which followed Qualcomm's $47 billion move to acquire Dutch automotive chip supplier NXP. Before deciding to partner with Bosch, Mercedes-Benz had two engineering teams working on autonomous vehicles. One took an evolutionary approach, upgrading the capabilities of conventional vehicles, while the other team took a more radical approach to the car's design. "Cars which do not rely on any driver input have a different architecture and sensor setup, with more radar and cameras," Christoph von Hugo, a senior Mercedes-Benz safety manager, told Reuters at a recent event to present safety systems. NO STEERING WHEEL NEEDED The current Mercedes E-Class can cruise without driver input on highways, keeping the distance to the car in front and staying in lane using a system which has "level 2" autonomy. Full autonomy - known as an "eyes off, brains off" or "level 5" system - does away with even the need for a steering wheel. "We don't want to wait until level 3 has arrived before we start with level 4/5. That will be too late," von Hugo said, adding that the prospect of new revenue streams from maintaining fleets of robo-taxis was a big motivating factor for doubling up the carmaker's R&D efforts. Autonomous vehicles came closer to road-going reality after Google unveiled a prototype car which it developed with the help of Bosch back in 2012. Mercedes-Benz responded by developing an S-class limousine that drove 103 km (64 miles) between the German towns of Mannheim and Pforzheim a year later. Real commercial applications for autonomous cars will start to take off between 2020 and 2025, Ola Kaellenius, Daimler board member and head of Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars development told Reuters last month. "If you take the robo-taxi, you start perhaps in a city or several cities or areas of cities, and then you grow from there," he said. "The key is to get to something that you can commercialise, scale up." The systems and hardware expertise provided by Bosch will help Mercedes-Benz make autonomous car technology which can be produced in large numbers. Bosch is already one of the world's largest suppliers of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and recently announced an alliance with U.S. tech firm Nvidia to develop a self-driving computer for production cars. Mercedes-Benz and auto supplier ZF also have separate alliances with Nvidia. The Bosch-Daimler alliance will rely on high-definition mapping systems provided by HERE, the digital mapping firm owned by BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Intel.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 April 2017 by Military News ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Our vision is to enable affordable microelectronics that improve the quality of life. To achieve this, our mission is to invent, develop, manufacture and service advanced technology for high-tech lithography, metrology and software solutions for the semiconductor industry.

(Josie Lepe/Bay Area News Group) By Paul Freeman | PUBLISHED: April 5, 2017 at 4:20 pm | UPDATED: April 5, 2017 at 4:21 pm When Lee Actor, award-winning composer-in-residence at Palo Alto Philharmonic, is creating new music, he does not wait for the muse. “Waiting means you never get anything done,” Actor says. “The trick about writing music is that you have to write when you’re not inspired, which, frankly, is most of the time. “If I have a commission, I always insist that I have a date for completion. It means every day I sit down and I write something, whether it’s good, bad or indifferent. Some progress is slow. Sometimes I’ll spend two weeks on something and decide it’s not very good and start over. But the key is, you have to do it every single day.” Once the writing is underway, he’s completely immersed in the process. “I’m in my own little world when I’m composing. It’s in my mind 24 hours a day. For me, the hardest part is starting out. There are so many possibilities. You’re narrowing it down and getting a focus. My goal is to get to the point where, when I’m going sleep, when I’m waking up, when I’m eating lunch, I have stuff going around in my head all the time. Once I get on that roll, things get much easier.” On Saturday, Palo Alto Philharmonic will present the world premiere of Actor’s latest work, “Concerto for Trumpet and Orchestra.” It’s his 10th commissioned piece for the Philarmonic. The program will also include Carl Nielsen’s “Maskarade Overture” and Jean Sibelius’ “Symphony No. 2.” It’s Actor’s first piece featuring a trumpet solo. An accomplished violinist, Actor does not play the trumpet. The Monte Sereno resident says, “When you’re writing a concerto for an instrument you don’t play, you figure out how to evoke the natural character of the instrument, take advantage of its idiosyncrasies.” Actor usually composes in a linear fashion, but this time, the middle movement came to his mind first. “I kept being drawn to a certain feel, which was a muted trumpet, kind of a smoky, 1950s, film noir, jazz vibe, which is really not my usual mode. “The first movement has lyrical legato playing, kind of rhapsodic. It has disparate elements. The last movement has a little bit of a Latin feel with asymmetrical rhythms and unusual percussion instruments. So all three movements have a unique character of their own.” Actor will conduct the piece’s premiere, so he knows the Philharmonic’s trumpeter, Guy Clark, a Los Gatos resident, will bring out all the nuances of the composition. Actor’s wife Geri is the Philharmonic’s principal violist and a member of the board. In 2001, when the orchestra needed an assistant conductor, she suggested her husband. The music director, the late Gideon Grau, noting that Actor’s resume included composing, asked if he’d also like to write a piece for the Philharmonic. Actor eagerly accepted. Soon he was installed as the orchestra’s composer-in-residence. “It’s quite unusual at this level, for a community orchestra to have a composer-in-residence,” Actor says. “Almost every season, we do something of mine. It’s been a great opportunity to try things out and get exposure. Through that, other local conductors and organizations have heard my work, gotten interested and offered commissions. So it’s a great situation for a composer.” Actor collaborates closely with the Philharmonic’s current music director, Thomas Shoebotham. “He’s extremely supportive,” Actor says. Growing up in Denver, Actor began playing violin at age 7. In his teens, he played in the Colorado All State Orchestra. At one point, he served as violinist with the Albany Symphony Orchestra. But at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in upstate New York, he earned an engineering degree. “I never really considered music as a profession. But I was very heavily involved in music, even in engineering school. I was concert master of the school orchestra.” It was in that orchestra that he met his future wife, Geri. After graduating, they married. They moved to Boston in 1975, so Geri could earn a graduate degree in material science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Actor worked in digital communication systems, while studying musical composition and conducting. The couple relocated to Silicon Valley in 1978, when Geri took a job with Intel. Actor acquired his degree in musical composition at San Jose State. But music still seemed like a risky proposition, particularly for a new parent, so Actor shifted his focus to writing software for video game companies like Atari, Sega and Electronic Arts. He found a correlation between writing code and composing. “There are certain similarities in ways of thinking. People have long noted the overlap between mathematics and music.” The software career lasted 18 years. When he retired, with both children grown, he planned to relax and pursue neglected hobbies. But the opportunity with Palo Alto Philharmonic arose and Actor has been a full-time composer ever since. He hadn’t previously written for an orchestra, though that had always been a dream of his. Upon returning to composing after a nearly two-decade hiatus, Actor found that his style had evolved. “I gave myself permission to write in order to please myself. Through the ’70s, in the academic world, writing in a tonal style or writing triads was not considered the highest level of attainment in composition. And at one time, I was writing stringent, atonal music. Now I’m writing much more lyrical (music) and most people hear it as tonal music. I feel freer to go where the music seems to want to go.” His successes with the Philharmonic led to his work being performed not only in other parts of the country, but overseas, as well. Actor, 64, has won numerous awards. He has released several CDs. “Like most composers, I write to please myself. But I’m very aware of the audience. Some music is written to look good — is impressive-looking on the paper. Some music is written to sound good, to have an effect on the listener. That’s what I go for.” New projects are in the works. “The greatest challenge is spending month after month writing the piece, when things don’t seem to be going that well. And the greatest reward is finishing that process. Most of the time, it’s just a lot of hard work. But after it’s done, you say, ‘Oh, gee, that was fun. I should do that again,’ because you forget about all the hard stuff you had to go through.” Email Paul Freeman at paul@popcultureclassics.com.

But playing with 8K on PCs is a discovery process for Dell, which shipped the first-ever 8K display -- the Dell 32 UltraSharp 8K Monitor -- last week. The small initial stock of the US$5,000 display sold out in a few days. The display won't work on all PCs and needs specific hardware and display ports. But Dell is finding out that more hardware than it originally thought can handle 8K graphics, including AMD's Radeon Pro WX 7100 workstation GPU. The 32-inch display shows images at a resolution of 7680 x 4320 pixels. The monitor shows stunning colors and features 33.2 million pixels and more than a billion colors. But being first to market has its own shortcomings. The display has a 60Hz refresh rate, not enough for gaming or fast-moving video because new frames draw up slowly. The monitor is mainly aimed at applications like image manipulation, engineering, and space exploration, where static and deeper images matter more. Dell willingly admits that this monitor isn't for everyone or for all PCs. But the company is learning more as it works with GPUs, connectors, PC configurations, and drivers. There is only a handful of GPUs that support 8K. In early demonstrations of the monitor, Dell used a workstation with Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. AMD's Polaris-based Radeon Pro WX 7100 workstation GPU can now be added to the small list of GPUs supporting the 8K monitor, said Michael Turner, manager for monitor products at Dell. The 8K monitor has two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, and both need to hooked up to a PC to support the full 8K resolution. A single DisplayPort connection won't achieve the 8K resolution. The PC and GPU running the monitor also need to support DSC (Display Stream Compression), so compressed 8K content can be delivered to the monitor via the two DisplayPort connections. Outside of the new high-end GPUs, many don't support DSC, ruling out 8K support, Turner said. Standards-setting organizations are developing other connectors for 8K monitors and PCs. The new HDMI version 2.1 specification will support 8K at 60Hz, but Dell doesn't have enough information about it yet to consider the technology. Intel's superfast Thunderbolt 3 connector does not support 8K yet, Turner said. New details about the HDMI 2.1 specification for 8K could emerge at the upcoming NAB Show in Las Vegas in two weeks. Turner is curious about what the 8K-compatible HDMI cable compatible will look like. But Microsoft's Windows 10 is ready for 8K, and the OS is capable of scaling to the resolution. Users must ensure they have the right GPU and the latest drivers that scale beyond the 4K resolution. Users are still warming up to 4K displays, and it may be many years until 8K goes mainstream.  An important milestone for 8K will be in 2020, with the Tokyo Olympics is expected to be broadcast at that resolution. At CES, Chinese TV maker Changhong showed off an 8K TV, and chipmaker Ambarella touted its H3 chip for drones and video cameras that can capture 8K video at 30 frames per second. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 5, 2017 1:37 PM PT Credit: Dell More like this Dell will ship the first 32-inch 8K display, the UltraSharp 32 Ultra HD 8K matures at CES, but your PC may not be ready Dell's wild 8K monitor goes on sale with a just-as-stunning price tag Video Let's Play Thimbleweed Park Getting 8K displays to work with Windows 10 PCs can be difficult, as Dell is finding out. But playing with 8K on PCs is a discovery process for Dell, which shipped the first-ever 8K display -- the Dell 32 UltraSharp 8K Monitor -- last week. The small initial stock of the $5,000 display sold out in a few days. The display won't work on all PCs and needs specific hardware and display ports. But Dell is finding out that more hardware than it originally thought can handle 8K graphics, including AMD's Radeon Pro WX 7100 workstation GPU. [ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ] The 32-inch display shows images at a resolution of 7680 x 4320 pixels. The monitor shows stunning colors and features 33.2 million pixels and more than a billion colors. But being first to market has its own shortcomings. The display has a 60Hz refresh rate, not enough for gaming or fast-moving video because new frames draw slowly. The monitor is mainly aimed at applications like image manipulation, engineering, and space exploration, where static and deeper images matter more. Dell willingly admits that this monitor isn't for everyone or for all PCs. But the company is learning more as it works with GPUs, connectors, PC configurations, and drivers. There is only a handful of GPUs that support 8K. In early demonstrations of the monitor, Dell used a workstation with Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. AMD's Polaris-based Radeon Pro WX 7100 workstation GPU can now be added to the small list of GPUs supporting the 8K monitor, said Michael Turner, manager for monitor products at Dell. The 8K monitor has two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, and both need to hooked up to a PC to support the full 8K resolution. A single DisplayPort connection won't achieve the 8K resolution. The PC and GPU running the monitor also need to support DSC (Display Stream Compression), so compressed 8K content can be delivered to the monitor via the two DisplayPort connections. Outside of the new high-end GPUs, many don't support DSC, ruling out 8K support, Turner said. Standards-setting organizations are developing other connectors for 8K monitors and PCs. The new HDMI version 2.1 specification will support 8K at 60Hz, but Dell doesn't have enough information about it yet to consider the technology. Intel's superfast Thunderbolt 3 connector does not support 8K yet, Turner said. New details about the HDMI 2.1 specification for 8K could emerge at the upcoming NAB Show in Las Vegas in two weeks. Turner is curious about what the 8K-compatible HDMI cable compatible will look like. But Microsoft's Windows 10 is ready for 8K, and the OS is capable of scaling to the resolution. Users must ensure they have the right GPU and the latest drivers that scale beyond the 4K resolution. Users are still warming up to 4K displays, and it may be many years until 8K goes mainstream.  An important milestone for 8K will be in 2020, with the Tokyo Olympics is expected to be broadcast at that resolution. At CES, Chinese TV maker Changhong showed off an 8K TV, and chipmaker Ambarella touted its H3 chip for drones and video cameras that can capture 8K video at 30 frames per second.

Serving the city's law profession since 1854 Search for: Home Courts Assignments Court Call Search Opinions Rosters Calendar Public Notices 40 Under 40 Subscribe Posted April 5, 2017 1:46 PM Share  |  |  |  |  |  Arizona pushes envelope on self-driving car regulations By Bob Christie and Josh Hoffner Associated Press writers A crash that caused an Uber self-driving SUV to flip onto its side in a Phoenix suburb serves as a stark reminder of the challenges surrounding autonomous vehicles in Arizona, a state that has gone all-in to entice the company by promising minimal government regulation. The crash, which happened a week ago, was blamed on the driver of an oncoming SUV that turned left in front of the Uber vehicle carrying two test “drivers” and no passengers. There were no serious injuries and the driver of the other car was cited for a moving violation. But images of Uber’s Volvo SUV rolled onto its side reverberated heavily on social media. Uber responded by briefly suspending its self-driving cars in its three testing locations — Arizona, San Francisco and Pittsburgh — as it investigated the accident. Uber’s self-driving car program is rolling out amid questions about how much government regulation it should endure on issues such as accidents, insurance and reporting instances in which the person behind the wheel in test cars needs to take control of the vehicle. The San Francisco-based startup endured a shaky December rollout in California — including running red lights — that culminated in a standoff between Uber and state regulators who wanted more transparency and reporting. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey seized the opportunity and used lax regulations to entice Uber, which decided to ship more than a dozen SUVs to metro Phoenix. “California may not want you, but Arizona does,” said Ducey, who took the first ride as a passenger in an Uber self-driving car last month. Uber spokesman Taylor Patterson said the company is operating more than a dozen of the 21 vehicles it has registered in Arizona. Some pick up passengers. In Arizona, companies such as Uber only need to carry minimum liability insurance policies to operate self-driving cars. They are not required to track crashes like the one that occurred in Tempe last week or report any information to the state. That means that self-driving test cars are essentially treated like all other cars on the road. Ducey spokesman Daniel Scarpinato said in a March 3 interview that the cars are safe and there is sufficient oversight under existing automobile rules. “There’s a driver in the car,” he said. “The state oversight is: There are not cars without drivers in them.” John Simpson of the California-based advocacy group Consumer Watchdog said Ducey has abandoned his responsibility to protect the public by buying into the hype surrounding Uber. “It’s a fundamental responsibility of a governor of a state to make sure that when companies are using the state’s public highways as their own private laboratories, that there is some obligation to protect public safety,” Simpson said. “There are no rules in Arizona.” In March, Uber obtained permits for two of its Volvo SUVS to again hit the streets in San Francisco. California’s rules for autonomous vehicles require a $5 million insurance policy, and the companies must reports accidents to the state within 10 days and release an annual tally documenting how many times test drivers had to take over. Also, unlike in Arizona and Pennsylvania, passengers are not allowed to ride in autonomous vehicles in California. Ducey doesn’t believe self-driving car testing needs extra regulations because drivers can take over if something goes wrong, but his office said last week after the accident that “public safety remains our top priority and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.” Kevin Biesty, deputy director for policy for the Arizona Department of Transportation, said the state could set up a system to monitor local police accident reports involving self-driving cars but chose not to do so. “At this point we don’t see an issue if the vehicles are being operated safely — they’ll be responsible for whatever issues arise, just like any driver,” Biesty said. Uber’s SUVs have been tooling around Phoenix and Tempe for more than three months, and police in both cities said they knew of no accidents before last week. Other companies testing self-driving cars in Arizona include Waymo, a Google spinoff company, and General Motors. Intel has a fleet of self-driving cars that are being tested, although they are not used in autonomous mode on city streets, company spokeswoman Danielle Mann said. There’s no Arizona state data showing how many accidents the cars may have been involved in or caused. Police in suburban Chandler said the Google cars have been in at least four wrecks over the past three years. None of the GM cars have been involved in accidents, said Kevin Kelly, the company’s spokesman for advanced technology projects. Uber’s recent crash comes amid a series of public relations woes at the company, including an upheaval of its executive ranks and allegations that it routinely ignores sexual harassment. The New York Times also revealed the company’s use of the “Greyball” program that helped Uber identify law enforcement agents who may be trying to catch it operating illegally in some places. The company’s chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, subsequently promised Uber would no longer use the program. Send to friend Please enter email address.Please enter an email address.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Ryzen 5 1600 performance showcased in early review Ryzen 5 1600 performance showcased in early review Paul Taylor 12 hours ago CPU, Featured Tech News It looks like someone broke the Ryzen 5 street date as a Spanish site this week published an early review for the Ryzen 5 1600 CPU, using a retail sample obtained prior to the official release. The review is fairly comprehensive too, showing AMD’s affordable 6-core in a wide range of benchmark tests. Unbound by the restraints of non-disclosure, Iván Martinez of elchapuzasinformatico.com,  took the retail version of the Ryzen 5 1600 through the paces and saw some interesting results, further confirming that AMD’s Ryzen has its good and its bad sides. First thing’s first: the Ryzen 5 1600 is not the highest-performing chip in the AMD Ryzen 5 stable. Sitting shy of the top SKU (the 1600X), the 1600 clocks in at 3.2GHz, with 3.6GHz boost and, as a two-CCX design, it carries the full 16MB of L3 cache that we can see on the higher-end Ryzen 7 CPUs. The chip comes rated at 65W. The reviewed unit came equipped with an AMD Wraith cooler. Facing off against several Core i7 and i5 CPUs, as well as a Ryzen 7 1700X, the Ryzen 5 1600 seems to provide some amount of surprise, in particular against its Ryzen 7 big brother, generally matching its performance core-for-core. In purely synthetic benchmarks like wPrime and CPU-Z, which leverage the number of cores, the Ryzen 5 scored well above Intel’s quadcores, but naturally fell short of the 8-core/16-thread 1700X. The review confirmed that benchmarks that rely on core count revealed the true power of the CPU, with its 6 cores / 12 threads really pulling ahead of Intel in just about every scenario, while memory benchmarks showed some dodgy latency (several levels worse than some A8 and A10 APUs and almost twice as much as an i7-4770K) with average read/write speeds. 1080p gaming revealed a competitive, albeit lower overall, performance than the Intel offering. 4K gaming did level out the playing field by putting the load on the GPU, making the CPU hardly break a sweat and generally proved that 4K is irrelevant (right now) to demonstrate Ryzen’s CPU performance. You can find the graphs below, sourced from elchapuzoinformatico.com: There is one serious caveat to take into consideration in the review: the reviewer, despite his best intentions, had to lower the RAM speed to get four slots to work together, and user testing has proved that memory speed and latency hold a huge sway on performance on Ryzen. The biggest hurdle for AMD right now stems from the partner boards which are still below par when it comes to memory support (in this case an MSI X370 XPower Gaming Titanium). Finally, the site also confirmed the release date (April 11th), and the pricing for the entire Ryzen 5 family (in Euros), estimating an approximate upmark of 15% over US pricing: Ryzen 5 1600X will cost 285 Euros Ryzen 5 1600 will cost 249.95 Euros Ryzen 5 1500 will cost 215 Euros Ryzen 5 1400 will cost 195 Euros KitGuru Says: While the review is just one of many that will soon hit the web, it does offer some idea of the bang-for-your-buck ratio. The fact that the reviewer was challenged by the DDR4-2400, seems to indicate that the review was conducted in sub-optimal conditions and shouldn’t be the be-all-end-all of the Ryzen 5 reviews. We might see huge performance gains as board partners improve memory support. At the end of the day, this is a 250 Euro CPU which is performing on par with Intel’s own offers.

However, most respondents were slightly more in favor of the Clintons facing more scrutiny from the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. A Rasmussen Reports poll showed that while 50 percent of likely voters believed the investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged links to Russia last year should be expanded, 52 percent said the Clintons should also be included. Read: Will Fox News Fire Bill O'Reilly? While reflecting deep political entrenchment over the ever evolving scandals, the poll also showed that 45 percent of respondents thought Congress should be more focused on the economy and other policies. Still, 35 percent disagreed that the Clintons, who have faced accusations over their global charity organization and its links to Russia, should be included in the probe while 13 percent were unsure. The results greatly depended on party affiliation. A vast majority of Republicans, 69 percent, wanted the Clintons added to the investigation while only 37 percent of Democrats agreed. Similarly, 70 percent of Democrats wanted Congress to further its investigation into Trump and Russia and only 28 percent of Republicans were for the idea. Independents were relatively split but mostly wanted the Clintons tacked on, with 50 percent in favor of widening the probe while 44 percent weren’t. But 51 percent of independents wanted the Clintons included while 33 percent were against it. The poll was conducted between March 30 and April 2 and was taken over the telephone and online with 1,000 likely voters responding. Read: Russia, Germany, France To Share Terror Intel Prior to and ever since he took the Oath of Office, Trump’s administration had repeatedly faced more accusations of links to Russia’s purported efforts to hack or influence last year’s election. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn was reportedly ready to offer testimony to Congress in exchange for immunity, which Trump’s critics used as a means to blast his previous statements about Clinton’s staff also asking for immunity. Nevertheless, the Clintons did face serious accusations over donations to their foundation that coincided with a Russian-controlled company slowly taking over one-fifth of the uranium production in the United States, according to The New York Times report in April 2015. A slight majority of likely voters want Congress to include Hillary and Bill Clinton into its probe of President Donald Trump's alleged links to Russia, a poll released Wednesday showed.

(UMC, 聯電) confirmed on Wednesday knowledge of staff having received legal notices, as media reports alleged legal actions were taken against over a hundred Taiwanese engineers to prevent key technology and business secrets from leaking to mainland Chinese rivals. UMC said the legal action was taken against individuals only, stressing they had nothing to do with the company and that their dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip development project will continue. DRAM is a type of memory chip that is commonly used in smartphones. According to recent reports, U.S. memory chipmaker Micron has been supporting government inspectors in legal efforts to combat mainland firms' hiring drive, as China has been stepping up initiatives to grow a competitive semiconductor industry. Micron denied revealing any details stating that it was still an ongoing investigation, but the company confirmed it has been cooperating with Taiwanese inspectors in an investigation into the possibility of data theft. Hundreds of Inotera Memories (華亞科) employees, a leading Taiwanese DRAM maker acquired by Micron last December, reportedly jumped ship to mainland rivals such as Hefei Chang Xin Network Technology Co., Ltd. (合肥長鑫), Tsinghua Unigroup (紫光集團) and Fujian Jin Hua Integrated Circuit Company (福建晉華集成電路) mainly because of lucrative up to triple-fold salary-increase offers. The Chinese-language Economic Daily News previously reported Micron had submitted affidavits to former Inotera employees that had jumped ship to mainland chipmakers or other companies involved in projects to help Chinese rivals develop DRAM technology. UMC, the world's third top contract chip maker, has been helping the government-backed Chinese chipmaker Fujian Jin Hua develop DRAM technology. Under their agreement, Fujian Jin Hua would provide funding, while the Taiwanese chipmaker researches and develops the technology that would subsequently be jointly owned by the two firms. China Boosts Indigenous Tech The news comes at a time the Chinese government is demonstrating a relentless ambition to cultivate its own home-grown chip industry in the world's top semiconductor market — to reduce a heavy reliance on foreign products and catch up with global chip titans such as Intel, Qualcomm, Micron, Toshiba, MediaTek, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. Micron is world's third largest DRAM provider and No.4 NAND flash memory chipmaker, supplying these crucial memory chips to electronic device makers including Apple. The company has become Taiwan's largest foreign investor after it bought out the share of its local partner Nanya Technology (南亞科) to gain full control over their joint venture, Inotera Memories. Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron lead the DRAM market with more than 93 percent of global output, according to research company Trendforce.

Mark Alexander · Apr. 5, 2017 Tweet “Human nature itself is evermore an advocate for Liberty. There is also in human nature a resentment of injury, and indignation against wrong. A love of Truth and a veneration of Virtue. … If the people are capable of understanding, seeing and feeling the differences between true and false, right and wrong, virtue and vice, to what better principle can the friends of mankind apply than to the sense of this difference?” —John Adams (1775) When we launched The Patriot Post 20 years ago, the Internet was a new and untested information medium. But we estimated then that publishing online would enable us to reach the greatest number of people for the lowest cost. We knew we could bypass all the limitations and expenses of traditional print publications, particularly the time it took to put timely news, policy and opinion in front of our readers. As it turned out, the Web was a good medium, and today, by the grace of God, we are among the three oldest online publications. Chief among our motivations for launching The Patriot Post was to dislodge the mainstream media’s monopolistic stranglehold on public opinion. In the two decades prior to our launch, the MSM had metastasized into what we coined “the Leftmedia,” little more than a propaganda network for statist leftists and their Democrat Party machine. Our Founders intended the First Amendment’s assurance of freedom of speech and of the press to be among the most significant checks on centralized government power. But by the late 20th century, the press had become the primary empowering agent of the central government’s exponential (and extra-constitutional) growth. From day one back in 1996, we’ve eviscerated the Leftmedia’s unrelenting prejudice, and its underlying motivation to dumb-down public opinion in order to advance leftist social, cultural and political agendas. In recent weeks, I’ve called out “The Faking News Fakers” and the MSM’s continuing efforts to delegitimize Donald Trump’s election in order to keep his administration off-balance and derail its agenda. Our team has hammered the MSM for its elitist arrogance. Thirty years ago, Americans somehow survived with about 23 minutes of national news in the evening and whatever could be gleaned from the newspaper the next morning. Today, however, media outlets left and right inundate the airwaves with hyperventilated ad-revenue-driven media shock banners and alerts, ad nauseam, endeavoring to command the public’s attention, to secure market share for their 24-hour news cycle redundancy. And print outlets, believing themselves of a much higher caliber because they must be read rather than watched, are not much better. These include two of the most widely recognized print brands in the world. The once-noble Washington Post, left of center but much more reliable than The New York Times (which sold its soul to statist socialism a century ago), completed its own sell-out last year when it became the de facto public relations directorate for Hillary Clinton. Indeed, the WashPo abandoned its esteemed standing as our nation’s premier political and policy paper and became nothing more than a pathetic and petulant propaganda sheet for Barack Obama’s heir apparent. In 1891, the Times endeavored to recover from its bankrupt status as a yellow journalism rag, when the paper’s management adopted a new slogan, “All The News That’s Fit To Print.” It restored some temporary dignity, but in the century-plus that followed, it has returned to its yellow journalism roots, becoming the nation’s leading advocate for statism, dressed up with populist entertainment, literary and arts sections. As for The Washington Post, it was founded in 1877 and, unlike the Times, had a long record of journalistic integrity until it was purchased by limo liberal Jeff Bezos in 2013. Unlike the Times, the Post had managed to survive all these years without a print motto — until now. In February, asked why he had purchased the failing paper, Bezos responded, “I think a lot of us believe this, that democracy dies in darkness, that certain institutions have a very important role in making sure that there is light.” Apparently, Bezos did not include the Post among those institutions. Also that month, the WashPo announced it was adopting a new motto: “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” Fitting indeed. In 2008, the paper began its slide to the dark side with its adoring coverage of Barack Obama — whose election marked the most dramatic turn toward death and darkness since our nation’s founding. Since 2013, the Post has become little more than Jeff Bezos' soapbox. Last year, becoming a stump for Clinton, even that platform crumbled. To be fair, the rest of the MSM took the same desperate Clinton dive last year. Evidence of the degraded journalistic standards at the Times and Post was on full display this week, with their blatantly biased covered of two news stories — one involving a high-profile Obama administration official caught in yet another lie, and the other involving a low-profile military contractor. Obama’s former national security advisor, Susan Rice, lead propagator of the Benghazi lie cover-up for Obama just ahead of his 2012 re-election bid, was caught in another lie this week. Turns out she may have been the key player in Obama’s use of the FBI and CIA to dig up dirt on the Trump team, both before and after the election last year. Former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy notes this revelation may be more significant than the Watergate cover-up. However, the Times belittled the story with this headline: “Trump Tries to Deflect Russia Scrutiny, Citing ‘Crooked Scheme’ by Obama.” The Post declared, “Susan Rice Isn’t a ‘Smoking Gun.’” On the other hand, a former Navy SEAL and controversial military contractor, Erik Prince, a relative of a then-Trump nominee, may have had a meeting with a Russian last year. For the record, the MSM’s fascination with Russian meetings is trumped-up nonsense. That notwithstanding, the Times ran this headline: “Trump Campaign Adviser Met With Russian Intel Operative.” The Post went with “Blackwater Founder Held Secret Seychelles Meeting to Establish Trump-Putin Back Channel.” Both papers, and the rest of the Leftmedia, are burying the Rice story under a heap of Prince headlines, and with it, any vestigial pretense of journalistic integrity. Of course, if you are reading this, you are most likely already skeptical of any MSM headlines. What these once-revered publishing operations lack is the high standard of impartiality our Founder’s had hoped would be adopted in defense of Liberty. Instead, most of the print media and other mainstream outlets have become the archenemies of Liberty. As our longtime readers know, The Patriot Post has steadfastly held to the vision of our Founders — which is one reason you’ll find them quoted in every edition. To that end, allow me to share a few observations from our Founders about how the press should exercise its First Amendment responsibilities. Benjamin Franklin, perhaps our nation’s most famous early printer and a sage for all time: “Without Freedom of Thought there can be no such Thing as Wisdom; and no such Thing as Public Liberty, without Freedom of Speech. … If by the liberty of the press were understood merely the liberty of discussing the propriety of public measures and political opinions, let us have as much of it as you please: But if it means the liberty of affronting, calumniating and defaming one another, I, for my part, own myself willing to part with my share of it.” Thomas Jefferson, the inspirational author of our Declaration of Independence: “Our liberty cannot be guarded but by the freedom of the press, nor that be limited without danger of losing it. … No experiment can be more interesting than that we are now trying, and which we trust will end in establishing the fact, that man may be governed by reason and truth. Our first object should therefore be, to leave open to him all the avenues to truth. The most effectual hitherto found, is the freedom of the press. It is, therefore, the first shut up by those who fear the investigation of their actions. … Our citizens may be deceived for awhile, and have been deceived; but as long as the presses can be protected, we may trust to them for light. … No government ought to be without censors & where the press is free, no one ever will. … Where the press is free and every man able to read, all is safe.” James Madison, the visionary author of our Constitution: “The right of freely examining public characters and measures, and of free communication among the people thereon … has ever been justly deemed the only effectual guardian of every other right. … To the press alone, chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity, over error and opression.” The Patriot Post has its roots in these words from our Founders, and you can depend on us to carry their standard forward in defense of Liberty in this generation in order to extend it to the next. Footnote: Patriots, while our annual budget is a small fraction of the big Beltway organizations, our outreach is greater than most. Today, countless grassroots and grasstops conservatives rely on The Patriot Post as a steadfast touchstone for Liberty, and we remain the most cost-effective conservative force multiplier on the Web. Please help us extend Liberty to the next generation of American Patriots.

Military In Danger Of Cyber Warriors By Greg Price @GP_IBTimes On 04/05/17 AT 12:42 PM Close China had increased its cyber warfare efforts in recent years and experts believe the Asian superpower aims at disrupting the U.S. military. The U.S., meanwhile, has remained more focused on defensive measures or counterstrikes against the Chinese rather than proactive attacks. Commander of the U.S. Cyber National Mission Force and Vice Adm. Tim White, speaking at the Navy League’s Sea-Air-Space conference Tuesday, delved into what the Chinese have been up to since its government announced its plans to focus on “war in the electromagnetic spectrum, space and cyberspace almost a year and a half ago," military website Defense One reported Tuesday. Read: Americans Would Defend Asian Ally From China "They are building what I would call campaigns," White said of China and Russia. "They are being very thoughtful about it and being purposeful in their approach and there is some design that they are organizing themselves. It’s not just a single mission, point of time, or place. It’s interwoven together to achieve a national purpose." White also said the U.S. wasn’t nearly as organized like China or Russia when it came to cyber warfare. “They’re on the field and we are figuring out how to get on that field,” White said. “What nations are doing in this space, it’s more coordinated. It’s more interoperable from their perspective. It’s more structured and it’s more integrated.” The report also cited the head of cybersecurity studies at the U.S. Naval Academy, Martin Libicki, who stated in a piece published by The Cipher Brief Sunday that since 2000, China had at first relied on private hackers to “harass” perceived enemies and also state-funded hackers to focus on foreign defense ministries as well as business and technology firms abroad. But after the U.S. had called the Chinese out for its hacking, it wasn’t until Nov. 2015 that China and all other Group of 20 nations agreed to aid and support each other against the hacking of intellectual property and other commercial entities. Read: Russia, Germany, France Talk Sharing Intel Still, the Chinese have re-fixed their gaze on the U.S. for fear of an “intervention into Asia,” Libicki wrote, specifically against the military. "China is pursuing the ability to corrupt U.S. information systems – notably, those for military logistics – and disrupt the information links associated with command and control," Libicki said. "The latter is also tailor-made for electronic war – hence the overall moniker for its effort, “Integrated Network-Electronic Warfare.” Experts said China had targeted the U.S. military and space as a new battlefield for hacking efforts.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 04.05.17. 04.05.17 Time of Publication: 12:03 pm. 12:03 pm Building an AI Chip Saved Google From Building a Dozen New Data Centers Google server racks loaded with TPUsGoogle Google operates what is surely the largest computer network on Earth, a system that comprises custom-built, warehouse-sized data centers spanning 15 locations in four continents. But about six years ago, as the company embraced a new form of voice recognition on Android phones, its engineers worried that this network wasn’t nearly big enough. If each of the world’s Android phones used the new Google voice search for just three minutes a day, these engineers realized, the company would need twice as many data centers. At that time, Google was just beginning to drive its voice recognition services with deep neural networks, complex mathematical systems that can learn particular tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. In recent years, this form of machine learning has rapidly reinvented not just voice recognition, but image recognition, machine translation, internet search, and more. In moving to this method, Google saw error rates drop a good 25 percent. But the shift required a lot of extra horsepower. Rather than double its data center footprint, Google instead built its own computer chip specifically for running deep neural networks, called the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU. “It makes sense to have a solution there that is much more energy efficient,” says Norm Jouppi, one of the more than 70 engineers who worked on the chip. In fact, the TPU outperforms standard processors by 30 to 80 times in the TOPS/Watt measure, a metric of efficiency. Google A Neural Network Niche Google first revealed this custom processor last May, but gave few details. Now, Jouppi and the rest of his team have a released a paper detailing the project, explaining how the chip operates and the particular problems it solves. Google uses the chip solely for executing neural networks, running them the moment when, say, someone barks a command into their Android phone. It’s not used to train the neural network beforehand. But as Jouppi explains, even that still saves the company quite a bit. It didn’t have to build, say, an extra 15 data centers. More Chips Cade Metz Google’s Making Its Own Chips Now. Time for Intel to Freak Out Cade Metz How AI Is Shaking Up the Chip Market Cade Metz Microsoft Bets Its Future on a Reprogrammable Computer Chip Cade Metz Intel Looks to a New Chip to Power the Coming Age of AI The chip also represents a much larger shift in the world of computer processors. As Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other internet giants build more and more services using deep neural networks, they’ve all needed specialized chips both for training and executing these AI models. Most companies train their models using GPUs, chips that were originally designed for rendering graphics for games and other highly visual applications but are also suited to the kind of math at the heart of neural networks. And some, including Microsoft and Baidu, the Chinese internet giant, use alternative chips when executing these models as well, much as Google does with the TPU. The difference is that Google built its own chip from scratch. As a way of reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of its vast online empire, the company builds much of its own data center hardware, including servers and networking gear. Now, it has pushed this work all the way down to individual processors. In the process, it has also shifted the larger market for chips. Since Google designs its own, for instance, it’s not buying other processors to accommodate the extra load from neural networks. Google going in-house even for specialized tasks has wide implications; like Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft, it’s among the biggest chip buyers on Earth. Meanwhile the big chip makers—including, most notably, Intel—are building a new breed of processor in an effort to move the market back in their direction. Focused But Versatile Jouppi joined Google in late 2013 to work on what became the TPU, after serving as a hardware researcher at places like HP and DEC, a kind of breeding ground for many of Google’s top hardware designers. He says the company considered moving its neural networks onto FPGAs, the kind of programmable chip that Microsoft uses. That route wouldn’t have taken as long, and the adaptability of FPGAs means the company could reprogram the chips for other tasks as needed. But tests indicated that these chips wouldn’t provide the necessary speed boost. “There’s a lot overhead with programmable chips,” he explains. “Our analysis showed that an FPGA wouldn’t be any faster than a GPU.” In the end, the team settled on an ASIC, a chip built from the ground up for a particular task. According to Jouppi, because Google designed the chip specifically for neural nets, it can run them 15 to 30 times faster than general purpose chips built with similar manufacturing techniques. That said, the chip is suited to any breed of neural network—at least as they exist today—including everything from the convolutional neural networks used in image recognition to the long-short-term-memory network used to recognize voice commands. “It’s not wired to one model,” he says. Google has used the TPU for a good two years, applying it to everything from image recognition to machine translation to AlphaGo, the machine that cracked the ancient game of Go last spring. Not bad—especially considering all the data construction it helped avoid in the process. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. chips google processors Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

The report provides a basic overview of the industry along with relevant definitions, classifications, applications and the industry’s chain structure. For those considering investment in the 3D camera industry, it is important to understand development policies, plans, manufacturing processes and cost structures of the industry. The report covers all these aspects as well as import/export, supply and consumption figures, revenue and gross margin by regions (United States, EU, China and Japan). The same data can be added for other regions. The report also provides in-depth information about the leading 3D camera industry players with their company profiles, product pictures/specifications, capacity, actual production, product price, revenue and contact information. This storehouse of information will enrich the knowledge of the industry insiders and potential entrants or investors. The valuable statistics presented in the report about the industry will serve as an important source of guidance and direction for companies and individuals interested in the 3D camera market. Outlook for 3D Camera Industry The incorporation of 3D technology in cameras has facilitated capturing of high quality three-dimensional, life-like visual images of objects. This technology is being used extensively in professional cameras, camcorders, smart phones, and tablets. People who are exposed to 3Dcamerasfind their transition from old photography technology to the new technology refreshing.  3D cameras have diverse use in media, entertainment industry, security, and military training. Their technology has even made it possible to learn plane flying through simulations. The film industry has also contributed immensely to the growth of the 3D camera industry. Movie goers are now becoming more aware of the technology by viewing 3D movies.  In the gaming industry also, the use of 3D technology is on the rise to enhance the virtual experience of gaming. Another growth area is security surveillance, home automation and mobile robots, where the 3D imaging is being used extensively. Developments in 3D scanning technologies enable the market players to launch products delivering high-quality images or videos. Constant innovations in 3D scanning applications and advent of technically advanced applications such as 3D imaging in smart phones or tablets are the drivers for the growth of the market. Segmentation in the 3D Camera Industry 3D camera technologies are segmented into time-of-flight, stereo visioning and structured light imaging. The time-of-flight cameras render high sophistication and quality. The stereo visioning cameras are cost effective solutions, commonly used in movie-making applications. The structured light cameras are least portable, but they capture details of an object from multiple angles simultaneously. The time-of-flight technology is used in automotive, healthcare, and industrial sectors for providing 3D camera solutions for various purposes. It is very useful for autonomous driving with increased safety through real-time alerts of driving conditions. In industrial applications, time-of-flight sensors are useful for recognizing and calibrating human gestures. These ensure human safety in human-machine interfaces and automated processes. The 3D cameras are also classified into two categories based on the focus technology used by them.  These categories are – target camera and target-free camera. The target camera focuses at one particular-object, whereas the target-free camera does not focus on any particular-object.  The features of target cameras make them useful in object tracking and surveillance. They are used for asset monitoring of industrial applications. North America – Hub for 3D Camera Technology North America is a dynamic hub for the growth and developments in 3D camera technology, particularly the target cameras. It has a notable share in the revenue generation of the 3D camera industry. The USA is a major user of the 3D technology owing to its industrial and military requirements. Among the companies who sell 3D cameras in the USA not all are based in the USA. It would be interesting to look forward to how the global 3D industry shapes under the stringent rules and regulations for companies proposed to be implemented by President Trump.  The North American hub of the 3D camera industry will receive a challenge from the Asia-Pacific market which is constantly growing and advancing. The population in developing countries will have more access to 3D camera technology in future, considering improvement in the standard of living, more disposable incomes and technological developments which will make the 3D camera technology cheaper and accessible.

As a refresher, this CPU has six cores with SMT, runs at a base clock speed of 3.2 GHz, and boosts up to 3.6 GHz. The lack of an 'X' in the name means the chip lacks the highest level of AMD's XFR self-overclocking feature. ECI claims not to have signed any non-disclosure agreement. The review sample appears to be a retail unit purchased from a store that did not respect AMD's sales date restrictions. ECI ran a number of synthetic benchmarks on its Ryzen 5 1600 in addition to a few games. For the most part, its performance nips at the heels of its big brother R7 1700X, scoring a couple of surprising wins in games using older graphics APIs. The review provides average FPS figures only, though. Readers will likely have to wait until April 11 to see any frametime testing of the new chip. We should note that ECI's figures are early, and firmware support for the 5-series may not yet be up to spec. Overall, ECI's verdict on Ryzen 5 1600 wasn't far from TR's findings with the Ryzen 7 series. Performance in single-threaded applications can't quite keep up with Intel's best. The biggest wins for the 1600 came against similarly-priced Intel chips in heavily-threaded tests. The lower price point of the Ryzen 5 1600 helps make the deficit in single-threaded performance relative to Intel's Core i7-7700K easier to swallow, too.

Pic: agsandrew/Shutterstock 5 Apr 2017 at 15:04, Dan Olds, OrionX HPC Blog The upcoming HPC Advisory Council conference in Lugano will be much more than just a bunch of smart folks presenting PowerPoints to a crowd. It will feature a number of sessions designed to teach HPCers how to better use their gear, do better science, and generally humble all those around you with your vast knowledge and perspicacity. The first "best practices" session will feature Maxime Martinasso from the Swiss National Supercomputing Center discussing how MetroSwiss (the national weather forecasting institute) uses densely populated accelerated servers as their basic server to compute weather forecast simulations. However, when you have a lot of accelerators attached to the PCI bus of a system, you're going to generate some congestion. How much congestion will you get and how do you deal with it? They've come up with an algorithm for computing congestion that characterises the dynamic usage of network resources by an application. Their model has been validated as 97 per cent accurate on two different eight-GPU topologies. Not too shabby, eh? Another best practice session also deals with accelerators, discussing a dCUDA programming model that implements device-side RMA access. What's interesting is how they hide pipeline latencies by over-decomposing the problem and then over-subscribing the device by running many more threads than there are hardware execution units. The result is that when a threat stalls, the scheduler immediately proceeds with the execution of another threat. This fully utilises the hardware and leads to higher throughput. We will also see a best practices session covering SPACK, an open-source package manager for HPC applications. Intel will present a session on how to do deep learning on their Xeon Phi processor. Dr Gilles Fourestey will discuss how Big Data can be, and should be, processed on HPC clusters. Pak Lui from Mellanox will lead a discussion on how to best profile HPC applications and wring the utmost scalability and performance out of them. Other session topics include how to best deploy HPC workloads using containers, how to use the Fabriscale Monitoring System, and how to build a more efficient HPC system. Tutorials include a twilight session on how to get started with deep learning (you'll need to bring your own laptop to this one), using EasyBuild and Continuous Integration tools, and using SWITCHengines to scale horizontally campus wide. Phew, that's a lot of stuff... and it's all free, provided you register for the event and get yourself to Lugano by 10 April. I'll be there covering the event, so be sure to say hi if you happen to see me. Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register UK splurges £20m on six regional HPC centres Why?

He set up a private Instagram account only followed by family members, and subscribed to Twitter under a false name. After just one mention in a public speech, it took only a few hours of a reporter’s time to discover the accounts with certainty approaching 100 percent. (Apparently in response to the story, the Twitter account — which quickly started gaining followers — is now available only to subscribers approved by its owner.) If anyone really wants Comey’s family pictures and media-reading history, the Instagram and Twitter accounts will be hacked in no time. In any case, the companies involved have the data, and the Senate recently voted to allow internet service providers to sell personal browsing and app usage histories to advertisers — or, presumably, to anybody who wants them. Meanwhile, the internet privacy of non-US citizens is not protected at all thanks to an executive order that tells agencies foreigners are exempt from the US Privacy Act, even though European officials cling to the illusion of an unenforceable “Privacy Shield” arrangement with the US (Under it, affected Europeans are invited to sue in US courts; I’d have to be officially accused of being the leader of ISIS before I’d contemplate that.) People the world over should be aware that using any of the services provided by major US-based internet companies means giving up privacy altogether and opening up the most personal data to governments, advertisers, the press and private investigators. It also makes malicious hackers’ work a lot easier because a lot of eggs are being put in large baskets. Up until now, the services have flourished anyway thanks to the well-known privacy paradox: people say they care about their privacy, but in practice they willingly give it up for convenience. My favorite explanation of the phenomenon is so-called “benefit immediacy”: When the benefits of disclosure are instantaneous while the risks are delayed, the benefits are perceived to be higher than the risks. Last year’s Pew Research study of the paradox showed a plurality of Americans is fine with giving up shopping histories in exchange for a discount card, but not with putting tracking devices in cars in exchange for cheaper car insurance. The trade-off, though, is highly fluid; customers may become hostile to privacy intrusions by the tech industry if there are more major security breaches and more people are personally affected. So while investment currently flows mostly to companies whose products further compromise privacy — such as Uber, which knows everything about its customers’ movements and has been known to misuse the information, or Internet of Things startups that essentially install surveillance technology in people’s homes — privacy protection may be Silicon Valley’s next hot play. While there are many privacy protection products available, from browsers that block trackers to messenger applications offering end-to-end encryption, using one or several such products doesn’t guarantee true safety: users need a holistic approach that entails lifestyle changes to stay safe but still connected to the tech-enabled universe. A company called Purism, for example, sells laptops with maximum privacy and security in mind. It means not using certain processors — like recent Intel ones — that enable remote access to the computers even when they’re powered off. It also employs an operating system (Linux-based) that prevents information collection, and has privacy-ensuring software, from a custom browser to encrypted messaging to a Google-bypassing map app. If one has the discipline to give up the social networks (especially Facebook, whose data-collection practices are so complex that it’s probably fair to say no outsider understands them), a Purism machine can take care of all the basic privacy and security needs. But Purism is a tiny firm, which has had to crowdfund its component inventory. It gets some attention in the tech press, but not enough for a breakthrough: Its target audience is considered paranoid. Because much of the tech economy is advertising-financed, and advances in important fields such as big data and artificial intelligence depend on people’s propensity to share lots of information, much of it inadvertently, privacy concerns have taken a back seat. That doesn’t mean, however, that the status quo is sustainable. I wrote recently about a similar lack of investment in devices that work to reduce, not increase, people’s device dependency; at some point, when medical science judges the digital media addiction as dangerous as the tobacco one and there’s public pressure to combat it, the money will come. The same goes for privacy. The more intrusive the tech industry becomes, the less users want to be the commodity sold by tech companies to advertisers or other exploiters of behavioral data and the more demand there will be for means of resistance. Investors betting on a Big Brother future may be in for some nasty surprises; those who bet against its endurance may be rewarded for their prescience.

(CSCO) View All Posts U.S. stock futures have turned positive this morning ahead of minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting and President Donald Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Energy stocks led yesterday’s meager gains, after natural gas prices hit a two-month high and oil prices rebounded on supply concerns — both are moving higher again this morning. At last check, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 0.12%, S&P 500 futures had risen 0.05% and Nasdaq-100 futures were flat. On the options front, volume was anemic on Tuesday, as only about 11.6 million calls and 10.8 million puts crossed the tape. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio swung lower to 0.62, while the 10-day moving average broke lower to a one-month low of 0.62. Driving Tuesday’s options volume, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw a resurgence in call options activity despite NVDA stock receiving a downgrade at Pacific Crest securities. Elsewhere, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) also attracted heavy call volume following a bullish report on the PC market from BlueFin Research Partners. Finally, Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) jumped nearly 7% after natural gas futures hit a two-month high on supply concerns.  Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Share of leading PC graphics chip maker Nvidia plunged more than 7% yesterday, after Pacific Crest downgraded NVDA stock to “underweight” from “sector weight.” According to the ratings firm, Nvidia is facing heavy market saturation and a potential pause in data-center chip sales. “Desktop graphics card manufacturers are noting material demand deceleration in sell-through since February … orders to Nvidia are unlikely to meaningfully resume until July given high channel inventory of three months,” Pacific Crest told clients in a report yesterday. Despite the selloff and the downgrade, NVDA options traders remained in high spirits. Total volume rose to 562,000 contracts, with calls gobbling up 60% of the day’s take. That said, there is a growing trepidation among short-term traders, as the April put/call open interest ratio arrives at 0.93, with puts nearly in parity with calls. What’s more, both peak put and peak call OI rest at the at-the-money $100 strike, hinting that neither call nor put traders are expecting NVDA to stray far from current levels.

The company issued a press release Monday announcing an abrupt end to the relationship between the two companies — it had supplied Apple with its PowerVR graphics processing units (GPUs), which were deployed in every iPhone since the first one. Read: Apple Might Be Making Its Own GPUs Post the announcement, Imagination Technologies’ shares fell 7.64 percent at the time of filing this report. The declining share price could actually open the door to Apple buying out the company itself, CNBC reported Wednesday, citing a note from investment bank Jefferies. "A Byzantine analysis would have Apple intent on taking over Imagination for PowerVR, and using the warning of cessation to depress its prey's valuation (and emphasize its dependence on Apple) before pouncing. A version of this would see Apple standing by to acquire IMG's IP (intellectual property) in any future crisis – perhaps at least providing a safety net to value," Jefferies said in a note Tuesday. The fact that Apple could be working towards making its own GPUs should not come as a surprise — the company has acquired many chip makers including the P.A. Semi microprocessor design company, which made processors for Intel. The company is reportedly one of the bidders in the sale of Toshiba’s chipset manufacturing unit. Read: Apple And Google Among Bidders For Toshiba’s Chipset Unit  “Apple has used Imagination’s technology and intellectual property for many years. It has formed the basis of Graphics Processor Units (GPU) in Apple’s phones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches. Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology,” Imagination Technologies said in its press release, announcing the end of the relationship between the two companies. The company had also asserted its doubts to whether Apple could actually design a GPU without violating one of its patents. “Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions,” it stated.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 4, 2017 Credit: Apple More like this Apple to drop Imagination's IP for graphics chips, is working on its own... Mysteries of the GPU in Apple's iPhone 7 are unlocked Smartphone CPUs put desktops to shame Video WWDC 2015: The top 3 biggest reveals Apple has one big reason to move to a homegrown GPU: It wants full control over the hardware and software in its devices. The device maker is apparently developing its own GPU from scratch after dumping Imagination Technologies' PowerVR architecture, which is being used in the iPhone 7. The smartphone runs on the PowerVR A10 Fusion chip. [ It’s on! Office vs. iWork vs. G Suite on the iPad. | Stay up on mobile developments with InfoWorld’s Mobile Tech Report newsletter. ] It's not certain when Apple's homegrown GPU will appear in devices, and the company didn't respond to request for comment. Apple has made graphics improvement a priority in its iPhone and iPad models, so users should get better gaming experiences. The homegrown GPU could also boost artificial intelligence capabilities on Apple's devices, and also bring on board features like image recognition. Apple already uses its own CPU, and a homegrown GPU was the next logical step. The company has already developed its own storage controllers and wireless chips in a bid to cut reliance on external suppliers. To build the best chip for devices, Apple needs to have control over all the critical pieces, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "Apple's looking at the iPhone and saying, 'How can we make it better?'" said McGregor. Apple tunes its software to work hand-in-hand with its hardware. With the homegrown GPU, Apple will optimize the graphics to work closely with its Metal graphics API, which is similar to Microsoft's DirectX. Apple's iOS also supports OpenGL. The GPU will add more versatility to iPhones and iPads, and likely push Apple into new markets, said David Kanter, president of Real World Technologies. GPUs are being used to run digital assistants, image recognition, natural language processing, and other AI applications. Apple's GPU could be tuned for Siri, and also for image analysis and filtering in the Safari browser and other apps. Apple will be able to harness the processing power of GPUs -- which are generally considered faster than CPUs -- to accelerate other applications. Apple supports the OpenCL parallel programming framework for Mac applications but has no iOS implementation yet. The time had come for Apple to develop its own GPU as Imagination's PowerVR wasn't a good match for the iPhone 7. Though the A10 Fusion GPU was faster than the competition, it was too power hungry and couldn't sustain high levels of performance for long. "We believe the iPhone 7, to avoid overheating, throttles back from its top GPU speed after a minute or less, preventing it from achieving a high score for all users," said analyst Linley Gwennap, of The Linley Group, in a research note in December. Relying on Imagination Technologies for graphics was risky for Apple. Apple is a minority shareholder in Imagination, which has been rumored to be on the sales block. Moreover, Imagination wasn't the graphics chip leader it once was. Qualcomm, ARM, Nvidia, and other vendors offer mobile GPUs and have jumped ahead of Imagination in recent years. Apple built up a team to design a GPU by poaching graphics experts out of Imagination, AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. The company is also looking to hire many graphics experts for Macs and mobile devices, with a focus on chip design. The company has the patience, skilled employees, and resources to make its own GPU, Kanter said. Apple's approach to bringing graphics technologies in-house has been gradual. It developed Metal, the compilers, and has been incorporating custom graphics cores that are now used in the iPhone 7. Last year, Kanter's analysis of the GPU in the iPhone 7 led to a conclusion that the company was likely on its way to making a homegrown GPU. He found Apple making big changes in the GPU in the A10 chip's PowerVR architecture, such as a redesigned shader core. At the time, Kanter said Apple "could continue to customize more and more of their GPU – eventually designing out Imagination Technologies." There are also rumors about Apple putting its ARM-based chips in Macs, which demand more graphics power. Designing a more powerful GPU that consumes more power can be complicated, and it's perhaps something Apple won't be chasing for now, Kanter said. Apple's approach to developing a homegrown GPU is similar to that of Google. Google picked up data center hardware from regular suppliers, customized it, and eventually, made the hardware itself. But challenges for Apple remain, particularly legal challenges from Imagination, which has questioned Apple's claim of developing an independent GPU technology. Imagination did not accept Apple's claims, saying it would be "extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture" from scratch without Apple infringing on Imagination's IP rights. "Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property, and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it," Imagination said in a statement.

Prepared by the NPO Development International (DI), the study rated the legal compliance, affirmative practice, and transparency of 1,909 companies’ anti-human trafficking and slavery-related disclosure statements of 2016. The law in focus: the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (CA-TISCA). The companies subject to this law include U.S. as well as foreign companies with a combined global revenue of $48.4 trillion in 2016. In the interactive webinar, DI’s principal investigator Dr. Chris Bayer and DI’s analyst Jesse Hudson are joined by former UN Goodwill Ambassador Julia Ormond, founder and president of the Alliance to stop Slavery and End Trafficking (ASSET), which was instrumental in passing the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the UK Modern Slavery Act (2015). Register here Date and time: April 5, 2017, 10:00 AM – 11:00 AM PDT | 11:00 AM – 12:00 PM MDT | 1:00 PM – 2:00 PM EDT | 12:00 PM – 1:00 PM CDT | 6:00 PM – 7:00 PM BST | 7:00 PM – 8:00 PM CEST  Speakers Julia Ormond, Founder and President, Alliance to Stop Slavery and End Trafficking (ASSET) Dr. Chris N. Bayer, Principal Investigator, Development International Jesse Hudson, Analyst, Development International Marc Church, President of U.S. Sales and Operations, iPoint-systems About CA-TISCA CA-TISCA requires retailers and manufacturers doing business in the state of California with annual worldwide gross receipts exceeding $100 million to publicly disclose the measures they have taken to eradicate modern-day slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. About the 2016 Benchmarking Study The iPoint-funded study indicates that the companies in focus have improved on all fronts as compared to reporting year 2015. More companies had a statement, more were compliant, and more pro-active initiative has been taken by these businesses in their efforts to responsibly produce and source goods which they sell in California. Among the 20 companies which received a combined compliance, affirmative, and transparency score of 86% and above are American Eagle Outfitters (95%), HP (93%), Intel (92%), Burberry (90%), Brooks Sports (90%), Patagonia (89%), GAP (88%), Papyrus (88%), Bath & Body Works (87%), Vans (87%), and Apple (86%). Resources Evaluated companies can request their individual scorecards with a breakdown of their disclosure compliance, affirmative practice, and transparency score, from this website: http://www.ipoint-systems.com/ca-tisca-2016/ The full report, entitled “Corporate Compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act: Anti-Slavery Performance in 2016”, can also be downloaded from this website.

Introduction2. Bundle & Cabling3. External4. Internal5. Testing Methodology & Results6. Closing Thoughts7. View All Pages Today we finalise our coverage of the latest Seasonic PRIME Platinum platform by analysing the 650 watt model in the range. This fully modular, 80 Plus Platinum certified model is priced at £155 in the United Kingdom, around £30 less expensive than the PRIME 650W Titanium supply which we reviewed back in August 2016. High grade Platinum power supplies are expensive. At £155, this is one of the most cost effective units in the new Seasonic range, but it is still a fair chunk of cash for a 650 watt supply. Like other models in the range it ships with a low noise Fluid Dynamic Bearing cooling fan incorporated and we hope Seasonic have over specified this unit to similar levels as the 650W Titanium unit we analysed last summer. 650W PRIME Platinum Specifications: – Model name: SSR-650PD – 80 PLUS®: Platinum – Form Factor: Intel ATX 12 V – Dimensions: 170mm (L) x 150mm (W) x 86mm (H) +/-1 mm – Fan Size: 135 mm – Fan Control: Premium Hybrid Fan Control – Fan Bearing: Fluid Dynamic Bearing – Life Expectancy: 70,000 hours at 40 °C, 15 % – 65 % RH – Modularity: Fully Modular – Cable type: Flat black cables – Operating Temperature: 0 – 50 °C – MTBF @ 25 °C, excl. fan: 150,000 hours – AC Input: Full Range – Protection: OPP, OVP, UVP, OCP, OTP, SCP – Safety and EMC: cTUVus, TUV, CB, CCC, BSMI, EAC – Environmental Compliance: Energy Star, RoHS, WEEE, ErP Lot 6, REACH Review photography handled in house at KitGuru with a Leica S series medium format camera and S series prime lens.

This abundance is not the product of good fortune, nor is its continuity a foregone conclusion. We must consider how we got here and use that insight to identify a clear path to the growth and prosperity that America deserves. Much of the foundation of America’s energy renaissance — in shale oil and gas, renewable energy, and other technologies — can be attributed to federally-funded technology research and development that has occurred over many years, enjoyed bipartisan support, and which the private sector has relied on to help to commercialize market-creating technologies. ADVERTISEMENT Those investments have had a profound impact on America’s economy. A 2015 study from the Harvard Business School and the Boston Consulting Group found unconventional oil and gas development added more than $430 billion to U.S. GDP in 2014 — supporting more than 2.7 million jobs that pay double the U.S. median wage. In 2015 there were 769,000 Americans working in the renewable energy sector alone.   Federal investments in energy innovation are also important to America’s long term competitiveness. The United States has long dominated global science and technology, but the spoils of that supremacy are increasingly at risk. Recent assessments of global innovation ecosystems peg the United States anywhere from fifth to tenth, dragged down by the insufficient investment in energy R&D relative to the size of our economy. The global energy market is more than six trillion dollars and investments of $1.8 trillion in 2015 alone are the result of fierce global competition to meet the enormous growth projected in the global market. Investments in R&D are absolutely critical in an energy sector where many technologies are capital-intensive and long-lived, requiring large up-front cash investments with slower returns than most investors are willing to tolerate. The fact that energy is a commodity also means new energy technologies have to compete against incumbents on price alone. Market forces dictate that the private sector underinvest in energy research, especially early stage, basic research. The American Energy Innovation Council (AEIC) is a group of business leaders and executives that we chair, which advocates for an increased commitment to American energy innovation. Our experiences as executives have shown us that not only are federal investments key to developing new technologies, but that those new technologies enhance our competitiveness, create new jobs and sometimes even new industries. We are encouraged that President Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTop Pence aide considering run for Georgia governorship: report Trump speaks with Japanese leader after North Korea's missile launch The Memo: Trump shifts on Syria, with few specifics MORE has recognized the importance of committing to necessary investments in research that will improve the lives of every American. In addition to the bipartisan support on Capitol Hill and in the states for energy innovation, the broad business community has also embraced the importance of fostering innovation. Critics of federal support for energy innovation have suggested that the private sector will adequately invest in those energy technologies worth supporting and that federal investment merely crowds out private funding for research. Yet the energy sector invests just 0.3 percent of its revenues back into R&D, compared to nearly 20 percent in the pharmaceutical industry, 10.6 percent in computers and electronics and 7.6 percent in aerospace. We’ve already highlighted the primary reasons: high capital costs, high degrees of technical risk, and lengthy time horizons all make it nearly impossible for private companies to justify these risks to shareholders. Instead, examples abound of the value of federal energy R&D investments and the public-private partnerships born out of that research that have been so critical to America’s prosperity. Clean, safe and affordable energy is vital to our economy. As business leaders, we know the private sector can be mobilized to meet these needs, but we also know the government has a critical role to play as well. The opportunities to accomplish these goals while reaping enormous economic benefits are vast — if we invest in them.

Follow Hot Topics: Susan Rice Gorsuch Nomination Surveillance Immigration Cuomo Cozies Up to Liberal Rep.; Tag-Teams on Nunes Attacks By Jackson Richman | April 4, 2017 | 5:11 PM EDT Share it Tweet it 0 shares CNN's New Day anchor Chris Cuomo conducted a softball interview Tuesday of Democratic Representative Jim Himes (Conn.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, who slammed Chairman Devin Nunes and other Republicans over their approach to investigating possible ties between Presdient Donald Trump's campaign and Russia. "Can't take anything seriously that comes out of that committee because you have Nunes who you know, at worst, lied, at best, confusing about where he got that information from and it seemed to be a naked attempt for a front run to the white House," Cuomo prefaced. "Why should anybody believe anything that comes out of that committee?" "This isn't the first time, you know, his objectivity has been called into question. You recall a couple weeks ago he and Chairman on the Senate side knocking down a New York Times news story," Himes responded. "So I understand that shadow exists." "Look, we are going to stay in this investigation because we don't have an outside commission. Other the FBI and commission, we're the only game in town. We might walk out if we can't do what we need for a good report," Himes added. This prompted Cuomo to reply, "The fear is a propaganda arm of the White House." Cuomo also asked the congressman about the Intel Committee investigating apparent connections between Blackwater founder Erik Prince and Russia. Himes replied the committee will look into the matter.

Here is the April 4th exchange: New Day 04/4/2017 7:22:28 AM – 7:28:44 AM [6 min., 16 sec.] CHRIS CUOMO: The suggestion former National Security Adviser Susan Rice improperly unmasked identity of Trump associates, part of what the President calls a ‘crooked scheme.’ An associate of Rice says it's just plain false. Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Jim Himes. He serves on the House Intel Committee, something that has also been accused of being a crooked scheme because of what happened to Nunes. Met last night. Can you get back to work in earnest?  JIM HIMES: I think so, Chris. After a week of canceled meetings and back and forth over this whole issue, we did meet yesterday. I'm happy to say it looks like we're under way. We've been promised access and, of course, the lead Democrat Adam Schiff, lead has gotten access to the material that sent Devin Nunes off on his, I guess, escapade would be the right word. And so I do think we’re getting back to business, which is really important here, for both the investigation and for the oversight role we have to play. CUOMO: Okay, answer this criticism then. Can't take anything seriously that comes out of that committee because you have Nunes who you know, at worst, lied, at best, confusing about where he got that information from and it seemed to be a naked attempt for a front run to the white House. Why should anybody believe anything that comes out of that committee?  HIMES: For starters, we will be there. The minority opposition is in the room. We will not be there if we are denied access to witnesses, if we're denied access to particular lines of inquiry. Look, I understand that there's always going to be a little bit of a question around the Chairman's motivations. This isn't the first time, you know, his objectivity has been called into question. You recall a couple weeks ago he and Chairman on the Senate side knocking down a New York Times news story. So I understand that shadow exists. Look, we are going to stay in this investigation because we don't have an outside commission. Other the FBI and commission, we're the only game in town. We might walk out if we can't do what we need for a good report.  CUOMO: The fear is a propaganda arm of the White House. The next piece of evidence, brick if the wall of what Phil Mudd, a CIA guy calls ‘purposeful deception’ with this ‘unmasking’ scandal, suggesting unmasking is leaking when it isn't. Suggesting Susan Rice undertaking this scheme of surveillance of Trump folk, which is demonstrably untrue. If that's coming out and it’s going to be backed up by Nunes, how is that oversight. HIMES: I guess I've observed a Republican could do all that, certainly a Republican who is interested in joining to cloud the waters on existence of FBI investigation to Trump administration links and possible collusion with the Russians but backing up this absurd tweet about surveillance of Trump Tower. You can do that investigation or no investigation. What's more concerning to me, Chris, that you know, when you have a president who relies on false hoods and lies, the biggest inauguration ever, 3 million fraudulent votes, my health care bill will cover more people, be terrific, beautiful, and wonderful, when your castle is constructed on utter falsehood, one of the things you have to do over time is take all of the power out of the truth. You need to suggest that maybe Susan Rice's activities which everybody is saying if they occurred were perfectly proper for a national security adviser, you have to sort of say, oh, that's the other side of the story. All of this is just Republicans fighting Democrats one more time. Forget about the fact the FBI is investigating this administration. Forget about the fact the president openly promotes falsehoods because this is just another darn Democratic versus Republican fight. That's a huge win for a White House that wants to both distract the attention of the American people but also for whom doing away with an absolute sense of truth with any power to it is really important.  CUOMO: So did this meeting in the Seychelles between Erik Prince who has numerous connections financial, familial, and otherwise to the Trump administration—with a Putin adviser. Did that get any attention in your last meeting? HIMES: Well, you know, it only broke yesterday, so it’s only on the list of possibly odd-looking meetings between people associated with this administration and the Russians. And so, yes, of course we'll look into that. But let me step back, in the interest of truth, let me say something the other side has not been willing to say about the Susan Rice thing. There's not necessarily anything improper about Erik Prince meeting in the Seychelles, there’s nothing necessarily improper about Jeff Sessions talking to the Attorney General. This is what the investigation is for. This is to determine if something was improper. But as one of your previous correspondents said, the best way to get to the answer about whether there's anything improper is for the White House don't ask, don't tell the exact opposite of what they have been doing for the last couple months, which is, “Guys, let's move on. In order to show you there's nothing here I'm not going to criticizes as a witch hunt, I'm going to do everything I can to help it because the investigation will clear me and my people.” Of course, the White House has acted in exactly the opposite fashion of a White House which knows there was no wrongdoing and which wants to move on.  CUOMO: Congressman, you know I'm on you about the integrity of the investigation not because of you necessarily but because of answers themselves being so important and what happened with Russian interference, who knew, how we avoid it going forward. You always have a forum here to discuss what you think the public needs to know about the investigation. Thank you.  HIMES: Yeah, absolutely. This is why we always wanted an outside commission so you couldn't level these charges of partisanship, but we didn't get that. So again we're kind of one of the few games in town.  CUOMO: Jim Himes, thanks for being on.  HIMES: Thanks, Chris.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Economy Bengaluru vs Hyderabad in IPL 2017 is about more than cricket...it's about the soul of the IT sector Hyderabad, the joint capital of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, is increasingly challenging Bengaluru, India's 'Silicon Valley' in wooing IT firms. S V Krishnamachari   April 5, 2017 15:42 IST Sunrisers Hyderabad celebrate after winning IPL 2016 at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, on May 29, 2016IANS When last year's defending champions Sunrisers Hyderabad (SH) take on runners-up Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the inaugural encounter of IPL 2017 on Wednesday, it will be in a different backdrop, from a business viewpoint. If you are feeling intrigued, please jog your memory: Karnataka slipped to the 13th spot in the ease of doing business ranking in 2016 from 9th in the previous year, while Telangana, a new state, jumped to the top position along with Andhra Pradesh, from 13th in 2015. The two states jointly share IT hub Hyderabad as their capital. The rankings were developed jointly by the Indian government and the World Bank for the period July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016. The results were published five months after SH defeated RCB in the final match of IPL 2016 last May. Karnataka's capital Bengaluru (earlier, Bangalore) can continue to take pride that it is home to some of the most-famous names in the IT world — Infosys, Wipro — in addition to many global and other IT firms having their development centres, but Hyderabad is giving India's "Silicon Valley" a run for its money, in recent years. While Bengaluru's sublime climate has always attracted global IT firms such as Microsoft, Google and Intel, in addition to many others like Shell and SABIC having their IT operations, Hyderabad successfully woo firms such as Salesforce.com Amazon.com Inc. and Uber Technologies in the recent past to set up offices, thanks to Telangana's pro-active IT minister Kalvakuntla Taraka Rama Rao.  The results manifest in the form of 13.2 percent growth in Telangana's IT/ITeS exports in 2015-16 to Rs 75,070 crore from Rs 66,276 crore in the previous fiscal, adding 35,611 jobs in the process to take it to 407,385, according to an update by the state's IT ministry. The state has a long way before it catches up with Karnataka, whose IT/ITeS exports were projected to hit Rs 2,20,000 crore for 2015-16 with over 10 lakh directly employed by the sector. Of some consolation is the fact that Bengaluru still ranks at No. 4, a notch above Hyderabad in the list of India's top 10 cities from a GDP point of view last year, according to an update by the Pincode India.  Related AP, Telangana top ease-of-doing-business list; Gujarat slips to number three IPL 2017 live cricket streaming: Where to watch Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) vs RCB on TV, online IPL 2017: Top 7 cricket mobile apps to track live match scores; Cricbuzz, HotStar and more Also read Sunrisers Hyderabad ropes in Ultratech, Reliance Jio, others as sponsors for IPL 10 Quick Links IPL 2017 Post Comment IBT TV Close Brexit day: Prime Minister Theresa May tells parliament that Article 50 has been triggered Why advertise with us?

The CORD Project said it attracted new members in Sprint, Deutsche Telekom, Ixia and Xpose as it looks to further the telecommunication industry’s efforts in the central office re-architected as a data center platform. The CORD project, which was formed by the Open Network Operating System in early 2015, is focused on accelerating the adoption of open source software-defined networking and network functions virtualization solutions for service providers using open source platforms like ONOS, OpenStack, Docker and XOS. The project was recently folded into The Linux Foundation as an independent open source project, and was quickly followed up by the release of its first open reference implementation targeted at providing a single integrated solution platform for creating new customer services. The reference design is said to allow developers to autobuild CORD on a single node within one hour. “Over the last year, CORD has continued to evolve at record speed,” said Guru Parulkar, executive director of the Open Networking Foundation, ON.Lab and Stanford Platform Lab, in a statement “Much of the success of CORD has been driven by the various pre-integrated releases based on CORD to deliver solutions for various operator use cases. We’re excited to gather with the equally fast-growing CORD community at ONS to celebrate recent developments and collaborate on future innovation.” Sprint, DT, Ixia and Xpose are set to join CORD carrier members AT&T, China Unicom, Google, NTT Communications, SK Telecom, Comcast and Verizon Communication; and vendor partners Ciena, Cisco, Fujitsu, Intel, NEC, Nokia, Radisys and Samsung. “CORD combines the best of SDN, NFV and cloud technologies, creating an integrated platform that enables agile deployment of innovative cloud-scale services,” said Ron Marquardt, VP of technology at Sprint. “We are excited to work closely with leading ecosystem players to drive greater scalability and innovation. Through the contribution of our own open source code for CUPS and SDN, we appreciate the power of the community driven co-development process and encourage its rapid adoption throughout the mobile industry.” As part of this week’s Open Networking Summit, CORD said contributors plan to partner with the broader ONF community to showcase the open innovation pipeline and capabilities of CORD solutions in ONOS, and interactive demonstrations of residential CORD, “5G” mobile CORD and enterprise virtual private network.

The revelation gives weight to the belief that Obama officials planned the current uproar over whether or not insiders in the administration of President Donald Trump colluded with Russians in phone conversations, a national newspaper stated in an editorial Monday. While nothing has been confirmed about the allegation against Ms. Rice, the editorial stressed the disclosure or “Unmasking” of names was “perfectly legal” and had not revealed to date “that anyone on Team Trump said anything improper on those calls.” The surveillance likely started a year ago with the motive of preventing Team Trump officials from disregarding any information the Intel revealed. Unmasking the information makes it easier to spread, thereby making it easier to leak. That, the newspaper said, “Broke the Spirit of the Laws” protecting privacy. The leaks have actually not proved to be a large issue for President Trump, and has not hobbled our President on initiatives in his agenda. The White House has captured the news cycle and deflected any claims about charges made against his administration. You recall that it was Ms. Rice in her role as Mr. Hussein Obama’s national security advisor who spread the false information about a video causing the Y 2012 attack in Benghazi, leading the editorial to conclude she “certainly was not politically naïve about the political uses of intelligence information.” Which now we know why House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) revealed that Trump officials had been surveilled by Obama. The newspaper editorial defined the 2 issues involved from the surveillance: “Russian meddling in the election which is fake, and the Obama Gang’s efforts to sabotage Team Trump.” Stay tuned…   election, Hussein, information, Intel, Nunes, Obama, president, rice, Russia, surveillance, Trump Hussein Obama & Gang Created the Russia “Uproar” added by Paul Ebeling on April 5, 2017 View all posts by Paul Ebeling → The following two tabs change content below.

The new outstanding innovation, is owned by the Porsche Design Group (owned by the same parent company as automaker Porsche AG) already crafts watches, headphones, and more for wealthy clientele with refined tastes. The Book One’s official marketing has kicked off in April for $2,495, to present the first real challenge to Microsoft’s Surface Book considered, which belongs to the high—class laptop category. The Book One does set new standards for laptop beauty. The laptop is designed in Germany and manufactured by Quanta Computer in Taiwan. However, it clearly sacrifices much of its power characteristics for the sake of looks and affordability. The company deserves credit for bringing some beauty to the device’s form factor that faces constant pressures to be slimmer and lighter. The Book One starts with a brushed-aluminum shell and chiseled corners, elements you’ll find on other luxurious laptops. It’s also extremely thin, at just 15.9mm (0.63 inches). Next, it adds hints of Porsche automotive heritage in details such as the radiator-like ventilation grilles on the sides of the display. The gear-like hinge mechanisms are made of polished stainless steel. You can admire how they roll smoothly over each other and keep the two halves closely matched. That’s thanks to a small additional mechanism that Porsche calls the intelligent distance ring, which deftly tilts the hinges around each other. That’s far better than the awkward up-and-over you see with most laptops. According to PC World magazine, if we’re talking aesthetics, however, that little ring -seen in the middle of the hinge- is simple white plastic and looks out of place among all the metal bling. Characteristics of Porsche Design Book One The Book One is the first laptop to have both a 360-degree hinge and a detachable display. The glossy IPS screen, protected by Gorilla Glass 4, has a sky-high resolution of 3200×1800 pixels, and a 5MP front camera plus an infrared camera for enabling Windows Hello face authentication. The beautiful aluminum stylus, designed with Wacom, sticks to the right side of the display using magnets. Users can detach the display by pressing a small button on the right side of the Book One. A small light on the bottom of the screen turns green when the display is ready to be released. You pull it up and off fairly easily, leaving a slender bar attached at the hinges. The lower half has a full-size backlit keyboard and a Microsoft Precision Touchpad, which can accept an advanced set of taps, touches, and gestures for easier navigation. Most of the computer’s components are placed in behind the display so it can function independently as a tablet. The main specs include Windows 10 Pro and an Intel 7th-generation Kaby Lake Core i7 processor; the 512GB SSD is roomy and fast. The one thing that lacks for luxury in this device is the graphics. For a brand so closely associated with high performance, the Book One was expected to have discrete graphics. To be fair, however, there’s only so much the Book One could do with the space it has (it’s a little smaller and thinner than the Surface Book), and it would have been difficult to build a discrete GPU into the display half without a lot more ventilation and other compromises. On the other hand, the Book One offers a total of 70Wh of lithium polymer battery with a projected life of up to 14 hours. That battery is split between the display, and the keyboard. Porsche Design says you can charge the unit fully within two hours. As hard as it is for PC enthusiasts to admit, many users would willingly trade some performance for longer battery life, which can be missed with Book One. Having a non-computer company like Porsche Design come in with a high-style product like the Book One confirms that people are willing to pay more money for pretty PCs. Hardware enthusiasts may grumble about a compromise or two, but this PC is really speaking to a different audience.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Computers Reliance Jio eyeing PC market: A premium Jio 4G-compatible laptop in the works? Reliance Jio GigaFiber broadband with 1Gbps Internet speeds, Jio DTH service, Jio 4G LTE feature phone and Jio Car Connect are a few ideas the company seems to be working on behind the scenes. Sami Khan   April 5, 2017 13:59 IST [Representational Image]Reuters Is Reliance Jio planning to be everywhere after its unparallelled success in the telecom industry? It sure seems that way. The Mukesh Ambani-led firm hasn't made any official comments on its plans to explore new areas outside the MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) market, but there have been consistent rumours suggesting otherwise. The plans may still be in the early stages, and we may or may not see them come to fruition anytime soon, but the constant flow of rumours strongly suggest that Jio has several tricks up its sleeve. Reliance Jio GigaFiber broadband with 1Gbps Internet speeds, Jio DTH service, Jio 4G LTE feature phone and Jio Car Connect are a few ideas the company seems to be working on behind the scenes. As new information come to light, Jio might be planning to expand its hardware portfolio beyond smartphones (LYF), hotspot devices and routers. If the rumour holds true, you might soon be able to buy a Jio-branded laptop with 4G LTE support through a dedicated SIM card slot. Phone Radar reported that the Jio 4G laptop could be a rebranded version of Foxconn-manufactured laptop for the US-based smartphone brand, Infocus. Details of the laptop are scanty at the moment, but the leaked test variant seems to be running Windows 10 OS. If Jio chooses Windows to power the laptop, it will have to bring its entire suite of Jio apps to a new platform. But using a Chrome OS makes more sense, as the apps already support Android. As for the hardware and design, the tipster revealed that the Jio 4G laptop will have a 13.3-inch Full HD display with 16:9 ratio, a HD camera for video calls, magnesium alloy body measuring 12.2mm and weighing just 1.2kg. The laptop is to be powered by Intel Pentium quad-core processor, 4GB RAM and 64GB eMMC storage and 128GB SSD storage. Like many laptops, the Jio 4G laptop will have Bluetooth 4.0, 2 USB 3.0 ports, micro HDMI port and a microSD card support. Currently, Xiaomi offers a 4G-compatible laptop, Mi Notebook Air 4G, in the market. It is unclear if Jio's laptop will compete against Xiaomi and be priced competitively, but the company is known to disrupt any industry it enters and this might just be in line with the company's current practice.

Chris Hall5 April 2017Smartwatches Tag Heuer/Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Tag Heuer has a new Connected watch, bringing some innovation to smartwatches with the introduction of modularity. It looks very much like the previous Connected 46 watch, with both offering a sporty style and firmly placed in the luxury segment of the smartwatch market.  But which Tag should you go for? Here's how the differences break down.  Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 vs Connected 46: Design Both offer sporty design Modular 45 offers much greater customisation Better waterproofing on Modular 45 The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 sticks to the same design as the Connected 46, offering sporty looks like Tag's "normal" Carrera watches. Both watch bodies are titanium (although there are rose gold and other material options), but the original Connected 46 is grade 2, the new Modular 45 is grade 5, a titanium alloy. The Modular 45 is a smaller diameter at 45mm compared to 46mm of the older model - hence the names. The older Connected 46 is 12.8mm thick whereas the new Modular 45 is 13.75mm thick. The new Modular model is 62.5g compared to 52g of the 2016 model.  The case back on the new Modular 45 is also titanium, whereas the original Connected 46 is plastic. The original watch is IP67 rated, whereas the new Modular 45 is rated to 5ATM, so it's better protected. However, the biggest design change is that the lugs are a separate piece from the watch module - so the lugs can be changed - and the watch module can be swapped from the Android Wear unit to a mechanical unit on the Modular 45. You'll be able to buy a Calibre 05 automatic or tourbillon chronograph module separately, providing a lot more options. The strap designs are similar, with both offering rubber in many colours, leather, ceramic and metal band options, but the Modular 45 has the obvious advantage of being more customisable. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 vs Connected 46: Display  AMOLED display with higher resolution on the 45 Old Connected 46 has a larger display  Ignoring the mechanical options on the Modular 45, the new watch comes with an AMOLED display that's 1.39-inches diameter with a 400 x 400 pixel resolution, for 287ppi. The original Connected 46 has a 1.5-inch LCD display with 360 x 360 pixel resolution for 240ppi.  The new model is smaller, but it is a better type of display technology with a higher resolution, so it looks better. Both are topped with a sapphire glass cover for protection. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 vs Connected 46: Hardware specs Same Intel Atom Z34XX processor Less RAM in the new watch Same 410mAh battery  Both watches are Intel powered, the Connected 46 offering an Atom Z34XX processor with 1GB RAM and 4GB storage. The new Modular 45 is also powered by an Atom Z34XX processor, but is detailed as having 512GB RAM and 4GB storage. There doesn't seem to be much difference in performance based on our experience. Both Tag Heuer models also have 410mAh battery that use contact changing. Both watches also claim to be able to give you 24 hours of use, although the new model is pushing a higher resolution display and has more sensors to support. In reality, both watches need charging overnight. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 vs Connected 46: Sensors and connectivity Modular 45 gets NFC Modular 45 gets GPS The new Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 gets a range of new upgrades that open the door for more options. Both watches offer the regular Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for connectivity, and both also include motion sensors and gyroscope.  The Modular 45, however, has GPS, meaning its better placed to serve you as a sporty device. You'll be able to track your location in various apps, so you'll know how far you've walked, run or biked without the need for your phone. NFC also means you can use the Modular 45 with Android Pay. This adds convenience, meaning you can just tap your watch on compatible payment terminals, so there's no need to get your card or phone out of your pocket. Neither watch offers heart rate tracking, but you could use a Bluetooth heart rate sensor. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 vs Connected 46: Price  Tag Heuer Connected 46 is £1100 Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 from £1200 The Tag Heuer Connected 46 is £1100, with the Modular 45 available from £1200. As detailed, you get a range of enhanced technologies for your money like those additional sensors and a better display. The expense is more likely to be explained away by the modular nature, in addition to the titanium backplate. This is only at the core level, however.  The advantage that the Modular 45 offers is the wide range of customisation you're offered. Although the Connected 46 offers 11 base models - apart from opting for the £7500 rose gold body - the only real difference is the strap. The Modular 45, however, has 56 base models in the collection. Not only can you choose the straps, you can choose the lugs - diamond set, rose gold, black ceramic - you can buy a mechanical watch body to replace the digital body, as well as pick a body that with a different colour bezel. There's the potential to spend a lot more money with the Modular 45 as you choose the perfect watch for you, but at the same time, there's so much choice, you can make your watch a masterpiece. However, if you've one design in mind, the Connected 46 could save you a little cash.
