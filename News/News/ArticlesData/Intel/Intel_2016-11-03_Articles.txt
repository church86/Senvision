Intel Falcon 8+, to be distributed by Topcon in Canada and the United States, features triple-redundant AscTec Trinity autopilot capability and has full electronic system redundancy, the company said. It also includes the Intel Cockpit ground control and Powerpack smart battery system. The Intel Falcon 8+ foray into North American markets is a good one, particularly because Topcon has one of the largest UAS reseller and support networks, said Anil Nanduri, Intel UAV Group manager. "The Intel Falcon 8+ System expands on the success of our rotary-wing UAS offering," said Eduardo Falcon, Topcon GeoPositioning Solutions Group executive vice president and general manager. Falcon said the UAS offers high-precision GNSS, weight-to-payload ratio, stability in harsh conditions, and is easily exchangeable. Other features include a dual-battery system, comprised of Intel Powerpack smart batteries, which include automatic balancing, storage mode, charging and LEDs that display remaining battery life to meet airline shipping requirements, the company said. In addition, the Intel Cockpit ground control is water resistant, so operators to plan and execute complex missions with the integration of a single hand, flight control joystick, the company said. The Intel Cockpit ground control also features an Intel-based tablet and supports low-latency digital video links, the company said. Some Intel Falcon 8+ applications include providing precision data for inspection and monitoring, survey, and mapping applications. Copyright © Gibbons Media & Research LLC, all rights reserved.

There are those who have tried to explain and rationalize the gaping holes in Apple’s presentation. Part of Apple’s structuring of the event may have been driven by Intel’s CPU/GPU roadmap. Part of it may have been that Apple executives have been sidetracked by the Apple Car, Campus 2 construction and EU/Ireland affairs. Part of it may have been that they were taken by surprise by both the Microsoft’s Surface Studio design and the warm reaction to it. This might be constructed as some of the case for the defense. The prosecution claims that Apple took too long update all of its Mac lineup. There should have been more periodic updates along the way for each kind of Mac. Leading up to the event, the often cited MacRumors Mac Buying Guide showed that all of the Macs, except the MacBook, have been painfully neglected. The addition of a Touch Pad to the Skylake-based 2016 MacBook Pros wasn’t enough of a broad corporate affirmation to both the mobile and desktop lines. The tagline, “hello again” suggested that Apple would reignite the Mac. It didn’t happen. Neglect and indifference to consumers as well as to technical and creative professionals were cited. Below, I have a list of notable articles for each side of the argument. Then my verdict. Apple’s MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Apple’s Defense 1. Jason Snell presented: “Why 2016 is such a terrible year for the Mac.” He lays out the best defense for Apple by explaining Apple’s situation and the elements of the huge pushback. He’s critical of Apple in parts, but also explains some of Apple’s plight. With respect to Intel’s roadmap: In this case, Apple’s timing appears to have been bad. There’s no way to know for sure, but it seems like Apple decided to dance to its own rhythm, skip an Intel chip generation, and then wait for the good stuff, only to get bitten by slippage in Intel’s schedule. If that’s what happened, it’s hard to blame it on Intel. After all, it was Apple’s gamble. 2. Horace Dediu, in his quintessential analytical style, lays out the business and market forces related to desktop and mobile computing. “Wherefore Art Thou Macintosh.” If the market, the tendencies, the future and all the money are on mobile, it’s going to be hard for Apple not to place all of its attention there. This is a great article. An excerpt: The Mac is thus not treated disparagingly. It deserves and gets respect. It is preserved but with limited responsibilities…. It’s [the Mac] not obsolete but it is a decreasing share of engagement. Alternate ways of doing the jobs it does well with direct input are emerging on the third pivot but they are not yet good enough. The children are still adolescent and making lots of stupid mistakes. There’s still life in the parents…. The Mac is what it is because it’s not alone. It’s part of a family. It is a parent. It strives to be better but will not take the future from its child. 3. Finally, belatedly, the defendant takes the stand. The Independent was later given an interview by Apple SVP Phil Schiller. “Apple’s Philip Schiller talks computers, touchscreens and voice on the new MacBook Pro.” SVP Schiller responds to all the negative outcry about Apple’s deafening silence regarding other Macs. I hope everyone gets a chance to try it for themselves and see how great the MacBook Pro is. It is a really big step forward and an example of how much we continue to invest in the Mac. We love the Mac and are as committed to it, in both desktops and notebooks, as we ever have been. Not everyone will see that mea culpa.  That one sentence in the event itself would have saved the day.  Now, on to Apple’s prosecution on page 2.

I should have left reading this until Monday. I looked at that Surface Studio machine ad. That is a pretty slick looking piece of equipment. I am also starting to hear good things about Win10 (but it is still WINDOWS ) I then went to the Apple site and priced out a loaded 2016 MBP. (Warning, I live in Canada). Damn near had a heart attack! Almost $6000.00. That does not even include a monitor and the necessary converters to attach all my external drives and other devices. It is extremely unlikely that there is one of these in my future. I will make my existing 15″ rMBP last as long as possible. If Apple is determined to exit the PC business (in spite of their protestations to the contrary), then the least they could do is license macOS. That is the main reason I use Apple PCs in the first place. I can wait for a while, but when I am ready for a new machine, I will be evaluating very carefully if it is worthwhile to remain in the Apple ecosystem. November 4, 2016 at 5:48 EST PM Albatrossflyer November 4, 2016 Until people stop buying iPhones because Apple won’t provide the MacBook Pros, iMacs, & Mac Pros they want, Apple won’t give a damn what you think about their computer lineup. November 4, 2016 at 7:03 EST PM TT November 4, 2016 Maybe Siri will get smart enough to tell Apple engineers how to…fix their Mac lineup. November 4, 2016 at 10:14 EST PM MarcusNewton November 5, 2016 With my 20/20 hindsight, I think Apple should have released a spec-bumped MacBook Pro back in July with Skylake processors, and waited until June 2017 to release the touch-bar MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake processors. This would have allowed Apple to shift the blame squarely on Intel for a delayed redesign, instead of releasing a compromised MacBook Pro this month. One article I read this week said that this new MacBook Pro is not a continuation of that Pro line we are use to (the 2012 line), but it is instead the “full” version of the 12″ MacBook. Based on everything I have read this week I have to sadly agree. I have also seen people now referring to it as MacBook Amateur. I remember when I bought the original iMac, everything necessary was already in the box; including a phone cable so I could connect the modem to the wall outlet. I love the Ad that Jeff Goldblum did for the iMac where he was explaining the 3 steps to get an iMac on the Internet and there was no step 3. One of the main reasons I have so strongly advocated Apple products to friends and family is that I knew that just about everything they would need would be mostly likely included and well thought out with whatever they bought with Apple. With the new MacBook Pro I feel like Apple has set its users adrift into a sea of adapters, cables, dongles, and hubs with little regard as to how that affects the overall Mac experience. Especially, after Amazon revealed how many counterfeit and bogus cables where being sold on its site. Playing Russian roulette with 3rd-party cables and adapters is hardly a positive and consistent user experience. With that said, I am happy about Thunderbolt 3 finally emerging. I love the idea of being able to run two 5K monitors from a single cable while also charging a laptop. However, that is the only thing I need Thunderbolt 3 for. All of my current devices: the audio interfaces, external hard drives, graphics tablets, scanner, and printer, all max out at USB 3 speeds. I am not going to update my $300 Yamaha audio interface just so I can use a USB-C cable; there is literally no improvement. Finally, Apple not supporting 4K on the Apple TV is making me move away from it. I saved up my money and bought a 65″ Samsung 4K SUHD TV with HDR (the KS8000). It is amazing. The TV has Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Now apps built right in. Streaming 4K shows off of Netflix like Daredevil, Narcos, and Marco Polo is breathtakingly good. The only reason I have even turned on my Apple TV in the last three weeks was to watch the “hello, again” keynote. I can shoot 4K video on my iPhone, edit the 4K footage in both iMovie and Final Cut Pro on either my iPad Pro or MacBook Pro, but I cannot play it at 4K on my Apple TV. November 5, 2016 at 12:24 EST AM shameermulji November 5, 2016 “Observers have noted that Tim Cook’s presentation seemed strained, not as well rehearsed, and invoked what seems to be filler material at the outset. The team seems to have been up late, re-thinking the agenda in light of what Microsoft announced. All the earmarks of failure to execute are there.” In light of no evidence, that’s nothing more than idle speculation. I think Schiller did a stand up job. November 5, 2016 at 3:17 EST AM geoduck November 5, 2016 It has to be said. Tim Cook must go. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. I tried to tell myself that his style was different from Steve Jobs style. Not better or worse just different. That his Apple would be different from the old Apple but the core of what made Apple my favourite company would still be there. But there’s a difference between following a different course and being rudderless. Today’s Apple reminds me a lot of the mid 2000s Microsoft under Balmer. Lots of little pet projects that come and go, but the core systems have stagnated. Apple now worries more about share price, and profit centres more than making great products. That is a philosophical change that starts from the top. The philosophy of Jobs Apple was to make delightful products and profit would follow. The philosophy of Cooks Apple is to chase profit and assume the products will sell. Apple needs another dreamer, someone who knows that these aren’t toasters. Someone that worries more about making the product perfect, than how many pennies he can shave off the cost to get it made. There are people like that out there. The new head of Microsoft is exhibit number 1. Bill Gates choice of Steve Balmer as his replacement showed that the founder of the company is not necessarily the best person to make that choice. It’s time to admit that Steve Jobs choice of Tim Cook was just as misguided. Tim, you had five years, but it isn’t working. You’ve shown that, as talented as you are, you are not the right person for the job. It’s time for Tim to go. November 5, 2016 at 10:12 EST AM Lee Dronick November 5, 2016 Maybe Siri will get smart enough to tell Apple engineers how to…fix their Mac lineup. And fix that horrid iOS Music app November 5, 2016 at 11:38 EST AM JoelS November 5, 2016 Totally agree John, but it is worse than that. It is not just the Mac, there is lame all over at Apple. It is time for Tim Cook to go. It is deja vu all over again and they are playing the part of Microsoft 1999. November 5, 2016 at 11:45 EST AM Lee Dronick November 5, 2016 So who replaces Tim Cook? Certainly Jonny Ive. Elon Musk perhaps. November 5, 2016 at 2:21 EST PM bjeast November 5, 2016 It’s been a long time since there’s been this much criticism about Apple from all quarters. I tried to give Tim cook the benefit of the doubt, but at this point he’s getting perilously close to Ballmer’s reign of error. Yes, the company is still making money. But the Mac is still suffering from neglect. Under his watch, there has been incredibly poor rollouts of the new Maps and Apple Music. Schiller is, amazingly, getting worse at presenting. In fact, this was the worst presentation ever. From the awkward, awkward demos of the touch bar, to the amazingly lame comparison of the new MacBook Pro to an early Apple portable (utterly pointless), the presentation just dragged. It was easily a half an hour or more longer than it needed to be. And yes, I completely agree with everyone who says that the slogan “Hello, Again” was a significant misstep. How anyone could have thought that was a good idea and wouldn’t raise expectations is beyond belief. November 5, 2016 at 4:01 EST PM jeffsz November 5, 2016 There is such a thing as “too much elegance and not enough practicality/value.” I think Apple has crossed over this line with the current crop of MacBooks (I will not call them Pro machines). Thin in a consumer device is nice but really is out of place in a Pro machine. Too thin? Yes. While some are claiming Tim Cook should go, I think his only failing is not having enough balls to stand up to Jone Ive and say, “No! Stop obsessing about thinness!” How about a screen with NO bezel… well, it needs to be thicker. How about some useful legacy ports… well, it needs to be thicker. November 5, 2016 at 5:28 EST PM Jamie November 5, 2016 I hate to admit it, but I agree with the other posters. Tim’s Apple seems to have lost its way. I have no idea who is ultimately responsible, I doubt very much it’s one individual, but I haven’t had thoughts like these about the company since the System 7 days. Something has gotta change. November 5, 2016 at 11:26 EST PM geoduck November 6, 2016 For those that argue that it’s OK because Apple is still making money, I’d like to point out that no matter how Balmer’s Microsoft blundered, it was also profitable. No matter how utterly clueless, leaderless, or feckless Microsoft became, it still made money. November 6, 2016 at 8:29 EST AM archimedes November 6, 2016 I’m not going to join the chorus calling for the head of Messrs. Cook/Schiller/Ive, but I’m puzzled as to why there has been no follow-through on the 2013 Mac Pro, and I agree that “Hello, Again” raised expectations to iMac ’98 level but delivered less of a step forward than Apple’s 2012 Retina MacBook Pro (or the neglected 2013 Mac Pro.) On the other hand, unlike many commenters here, I am a huge fan of the iPad Pro. I rarely use the Microsoft-style smart keyboard, but I use the iPad all the time and find the 12″ form factor to be a definite sweet spot for many uses (sketchbook, music apps, sheet music, reading, video, etc..) Apple doesn’t usually respond directly to competitors, but I would be interested in hearing more from Cupertino about why they think the adjustable drafting table format (e.g. Surface Studio) is a losing idea, and what they think is better for artists, designers and musicians. Personally I find the idea of a large format iOS device to be somewhat appealing. November 6, 2016 at 8:21 EST PM archimedes November 6, 2016 “heads” – sadly there seems to be no editing for TMO comments! November 6, 2016 at 8:23 EST PM Scott B in DC November 6, 2016 Before I make my comment: “heads” – sadly there seems to be no editing for TMO comments! May I recommend Grammarly. Even if you just sign up for the free version and add the Safari Extension, it might be enough to help you get past those typing nits! Since it is getting to be all about the apps, the software we use, what is the difference if that software runs on a Mac or a PC. I can get along without Safari since I use Firefox as an alternative. Other than Photos, what other Mac-only software will keep my tied to my Mac? Don’t get me wrong, I was hoping for an excuse to replace by late-2009 27-inch iMac. But I can see keeping this machine as my bridge for iOS (no, I do not use iCloud) and Photos while I get a Surface Studio for everything else. I’ve already ditched a laptop for an iPad Air, why not ditch the Mac if working in a browser, Word, Evernote, and the other programs work closer to how they do on my iPad than on my Mac? November 6, 2016 at 11:53 EST PM brilor November 7, 2016 Developer Marco Ament wrote a well-reasoned piece. See it here: November 7, 2016 at 10:31 EST AM brilor November 7, 2016 Here is the link. November 7, 2016 at 10:32 EST AM wab95 November 7, 2016 John: For a topic like this, it’s hard to know where to begin, so let me begin with a quote from HL Mencken, “For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong”. To illustrate, as a young intern, I had a complicated post-op patient who had had surgery for aesophageal strictures (look it up if you’re curious). During his recovery, he became febrile. We gave him acetaminophen (Tylenol), and did a workup to rule out infection. There was none. Still, he complained of fever. Clearly, in order to break his fever, I’d have to use something stronger than Tylenol, so I gave him a true non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID), ibuprofen. What could be simpler? As expected, his fever broke. And then he began to cough up blood. And bleed. I took no consolation that he was finally afebrile as he was wheeled off to the ICU. It turns out that what the patient had was ‘atelectasis’ or isolated areas of lung collapse that can happen post surgery and can cause fever. The cure for his fever was to make him take deep breaths, and not NSAIDs, which can lead to bleeding, and in this case, made things worse. Who’d have known, right? A more knowledgeable and experienced physician, that’s whom. As an inexperienced intern, I was focussed on the fever and not the whole patient.(I also learnt that New Yorkers have a rich repertoire of words for ‘stupid’, some of them in Yiddish, but I digress). It was a valuable lesson. As an avid Mac user, I realise that the Mac is important, but it’s no longer the core of Apple’s existence, and may not be a vital organ of Apple’s future. Still, it’s tempting to look at Apple, focus on their computer line in isolation and say, ‘Let’s make Apple great again’, on the grounds that the Mac made Apple great in the first place. What could be simpler? The problem with that narrative is that it’s false. Post SJ2, as great as they were, Macs never made Apple great. Rather, that was mobile. The so-called halo effect meant that expanded Mac market share was lofted on the wings of the iPhone, and not by the Mac’s own bootstraps. What about fixing Apple by replacing Tim Cook as Apple’s CEO? Okay, with whom? The point above was that, in a complex situation, clear and simple solutions are seldom correct, and may be harmful. What do we know about CEO replacements at Apple? Empirical data on bringing in CEOs from outside Apple indicate a poor outcome, and that was during a simpler time for the industry and for Apple’s product line up, and pre-dated their global expansion. Leadership today requires an experienced and knowledgeable CEO, proficient both in that system and in leveraging those assets into a prosperous future. That can best be achieved through an apprenticed CEO from within. If anyone doubts this, then point to that company that is currently outcompeting Apple across the entire spectrum of products and services, and is beating Apple at being Apple. Apprenticeship takes time, and is doubtless already underway, but would likely be premature today. The industrial context in which Apple compete is characterised by uncertainty. I suggest that that uncertainty is driven by two things: 1) a plateauing of mature technologies, like CPUs and GPUs, in which real world gains are marginal, and; 2) an abundance of potentially new directions driven by emerging technologies, like AI, virtual reality, robotics, and smart devices like wearables and transportation, to name a few. The choice of direction should be driven by one question; what is the company’s goal? Apple have stated that their goal is to unleash human creativity and make the world a better place. However Apple achieve that, they cannot do so but from a position of strength in finances, footprint, growth and mindshare. I posit that the path to that goal is not a retreat to a comfortable past rooted in mature technologies, particularly one based on a false narrative around one product line nestled in simpler time that no longer exists. Apple, like all living things with a hope of a future, have to adapt and evolve. Finally, regarding the criticism that Apple have squandered precious time on abortive research and development, like the Apple Car, progress from R&D is not, nor has ever been, linear. Furthermore, R&D among integrated technologies has carry-over benefits into related areas even if a specific project is aborted. NASA tech is rife with examples. One can imagine Apple’s car R&D leading to benefits in software, secure systems, robotics, AI, and a host of smart devices, to name just a few. However, such progress is inapparent until Apple invest this in new products, which too are likely under development. The point is that, in an environment of evolving complexity, such as the tech industry, adaptation is essential, but the direction of that adaptation will come at a cost, and if poorly selected, can lead to extinction. The clearest, simplest solution is seldom the right one. A knowledgable and experienced CEO can best shepherd that process, and his/her prescription may, and likely will, run contrary to lay expectations. Further, there is always a lag between environmental change and effective adaptation. While it may not be clear in what direction Apple will or should go, a panicked jettison of their leadership, internal cohesion, or simplistic management of the complex interplay between today’s Apple and their increasingly complex environment will not get them there, neither will an over-emphasis on legacy technology that was never responsible for their rise to prominence.

Similar Robotics View the transcript | Show production credits Intel is entering the commercial drone market with this, the Falcon 8+ INTEL’S FALCON 8+ DRONE The drone is the first from Intel aimed at business users, a market predicted to be worth tens of billions of dollars over the coming years. It’s roots are in the Falcon 8, a drone from Germany’s Ascend Technologies, which Intel acquired in January, and has been designed with the aerial photographing market in mind. “This is a V-shaped Octocopter. It has 8 rotors. It’s designed so that when you have a payload, such as an SLR, none of the rotors are in the images.” The drone can carry a number of different cameras and comes with a host of safety systems to keep it in the sky in the event of a problem. “It’s a fully redundant electronic system. What I mean by that is, with the 8 rotors, you can have up to 2 rotors on each side stop and still fly the drone safely home.” The autopilot has three sensing systems to make it more resistance to interference and even an dead battery won’t make it crash. “we include the Intel Powerpack batteries. So there are two batteries in there and if one is drained out it understands which ones to use to make sure we have a safe flight.” Also new is this controller, the Intel Cockpit. The last one was based on a model airplane controller, this one is way easier with a single joystick for the drone and a second joystick for the camera. Intel hasn’t announced a launch date or price for the drone yet, but it’s part of the company’s push into the drone market.

Photos of an Intel-Powered Windows Phone Get Leaked GO Evan Blass posts teaser of Windows phone with Intel chip Nov 4, 2016 22:03 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft is betting big on ARM chips, and the company still thinks they’re the future, but it turns out that the software giant at least considered an Intel-powered Windows phone at some point, according to a new leak. Evan Blass, also known as @evleaks, has posted photos of what appears to be an Intel-powered Windows Phone, with many believing that it could be an early prototype of the Surface Phone that everyone (still) expects to launch sometime next year. First and foremost, it’s worth mentioning that Evan says absolutely nothing about the Surface Phone, so it’s not clear if it was designed by Microsoft or not. Then, the message he posted hints that this was a project that has already been abandoned, with little chances to see it in production in the coming future. On the other hand, he does confirm that it would have been powered by a laptop-class Intel processor, which means that, instead of Windows 10 Mobile, this phone was capable of running Windows 10 and thus address all the problems of the smartphone operating system, including the lack of apps. Intel-powered Windows phones This isn’t the first time when an Intel-powered Windows phone makes the rounds, and there were even rumors claiming that Microsoft itself was planning such a configuration for the Surface Phone. And while an Intel chip would obviously create a series of advantages on a Windows phone, the biggest challenge would be to offer at least decent battery life, and judging from the design we see here, such a thing was impossible. Fitting a large battery in such a thin body is super difficult and this could be one of the reasons the project was abandoned, if it ever existed in the first place. Unfortunately, this is nothing more than just another teaser that Windows Phone could have done better if some ideas were brought to fruition, so the only thing we can do now is hope that Microsoft is indeed working on a Surface Phone that would be truly innovative. Powered by a laptop-class Intel processor, would this have blown your mind? pic.twitter.com/0n2yZPvU65 — Evan Blass (@evleaks) November 4, 2016   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Microsoft#Windows Phone#Intel#Surface Phone#Windows 10 Mobile subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Steve Ballmer Says Windows Phones Broke His Friendship with Bill Gates Finally: Here’s a Windows Phone Surviving an Underwater Test Windows Phone Can Now Remotely Control Windows Phone Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Creators Update Build 14959 Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 Available Now Linux Kernel 4.4.32 LTS Adds Networking Improvements, Updated AMDGPU Drivers 2 photos    Renders of possible Intel-powered Windows Phone new windows phone apps My Vehicles: Log all expenses related to the maintenance of your car(s) with a smart app for your phone Easy Shopping: Get a friendly assistant for your shopping sessions and use it on the go, from your phone Briefcase: A complete file management solution that supports local files and OneDrive content HQ Music Downloader: A useful helper for finding and getting the preferred music tracks while on the go Gloomlogue: Customize you photos with amazing effects and filters then share the pics on the go Percentages: A useful pack of percentage calculators you can use on your Windows Phone while on the go Account Vault: A simple app made to provide a safe haven for login credentials and other personal data Reader comments Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Weighing in at less than a pound, the small quadcopter is designed to fly in unison with hundreds of other drones, all controlled by a single operator. An individual pilot flew 500 Shooting Star drones simultaneously in early October, breaking the Guinness Book of World Records for most drones operated at once by a single pilot. The flight took place in a small town outside of Munich, Germany, where Intel received a waiver from local regulators to perform the record-breaking flight. Each drone is packed with full-color-range LED lights. The drones fly with the help of Intel’s automation software, which allows artists to design aerial animations with hundreds of drones. It’s the type of coordination that would typically take weeks or months, but Intel says its system can design a complex light show in days. Intel is better known in the drone world for its collision avoidance camera technology, Real Sense, which is used in its industrial-grade Falcon 8 drone, as well as Yuneec’s Typhoon H drone. The system allows drones to weave between obstacles without being piloted, but the new Shooting Star drones aren’t equipped with Real Sense. Intel Instead, the drones are completely controlled by the master computer and operator on the ground. The drones don’t communicate with each other either, so they’re not a swarm, but are rather radio controlled. Although the Shooting Star is the company’s second fully-branded Intel drone — the first was the Falcon 8+ in October — neither is available for sale yet, and the company isn’t sharing how it plans to bring the technology to market. But Intel is better known for what it packs inside computers, like chips and microprocessors, and is less known for its hardware offerings. So until the company provides clarity about how others can buy and use its drones, the technology could just be a demonstration of what might one day end up in other machines, rather than Intel’s own marketable product. Shooting Stars can travel up to 22 miles per hour and can fly in light rain. Watch the video of Intel’s record-breaking flight, featuring 500 drones flying simultaneously under the operation of a single pilot. recode_divider More From Recode LinkedIn’s CEO says the U.S. cares too much about four-year college degrees Where we choose to work is a big deal, office designers Yves Behar and Ryan Mullenix say Google’s Diane Greene says the singularity won’t arrive in her sentient lifetime LinkedIn’s CEO says more than five million jobs will be lost to new tech by 2020 Dropbox is all in on collaborative work, COO Dennis Woodside says TaskRabbit is generating operating income in every city it’s in Trending Google’s Diane Greene says the singularity won’t arrive in her sentient lifetime No satire: The stars of HBO’s ‘Silicon Valley’ say they got ‘cucked’ in an LA bar Marc Benioff says companies buy each other for the data, and the government isn’t doing anything about it Philz Coffee can’t pay baristas $25 an hour, but it can help make their lives better Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff: ‘Without Twitter, you wouldn’t have President-elect Trump’ More in Trending Newsletters Recode Daily Top stories of the day.

Whether it’s the Fourth of July, Guy Fawkes Night in Britain, or a New Year’s Eve celebration, the ecstasy of loud, flying projectiles that go whizz-bang-pop eludes no human. But the folks over at Intel, most well known for making the chips that go inside of your computers, want to use fleets consisting of hundreds of drones to create light shows in the night sky instead. Using small quadcopters that fly in numbers, dubbed Shooting Stars, the company reckons that its drone light shows can “redefine entertainment” by creating “new experiences.” Intel launched 500 of its Shooting Stars in a test in Germany recently, and the results are watchable below. The Shooting Star quadcopter, each of which weighs in at 280g, can stay flying for around 20 minutes, said Intel, and together the fleet can create more than four billion colour combinations with its red, green, blue, and white LEDs. “With the improved software and animation interface on the Intel Shooting Star drone, a light show can now be created in a matter of days instead of weeks or months,” said Intel. The drone shows could come in stark contrast to the rigorous planning, cost, and safety aspects tied to traditional firework displays. According to the American Pyrotechnics Associations, the total annual fireworks industry revenue in the USA is more than one billion dollars, with an approximate 3.5 injuries per 100 lbs of fireworks used. Reusable drones, operated by one pilot as opposed to a crew of safety stewards and display artists, could eradicate much of this. Read more: A Meteor Gave Spain a Fireworks Show on New Year’s Eve “Intel’s proprietary algorithms can automate the animation creation process by using an image and quickly calculating the number of drones needed, determining where drones should be placed and formulating the fastest path to create the image in the sky.” We have to admit—it does look bloody cool. What’s more, Intel says it has worked with the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) in the US to fly these drones as a fleet with just one pilot, meaning that these aerially choreographed feats are fairly easy to organise. But Intel isn’t the only one gunning for a fireworks finale. As reported by MarketWatch, Walt Disney also wants in on the action. The company filed patents for drones called “Flixels” in 2014—small UAVs that would coordinate in fleets and put on a sparkling light LED light show. Either way, while it’s obvious fleets of drones will soon create incredible night sky performances that could be tailored for specific events, fireworks are best kept alight and exploding (as long as they’re not fired at drones).

When it comes to Intel hardware they do much better however, being able to draw on their massive legacy of x86 apps. This has led many to suggest Microsoft should dump Windows Mobile for simply Windows 10 running on mobile x86 chips, but many naysayers have said this was impossible, despite a few Intel powered Android phones shipping in the past. Now Evan Blass has tweeted a picture of what we suspect may have been a design concept of an Intel-powered Windows Phone which according to his tweet would have run on a laptop class (ie not Atom) Intel processor. In many ways however this power would have been wasted on Windows Mobile, unless Continuum for Phones allowed one to unleash the full power of desktop apps. Blass’s tweet suggest this device is from the past and that there are no plans to take it forward. Hopefully he will release more information soon to let us know exactly what we missed out on. Update: Blass has posted some more images which are clearly marketing material, suggesting the project may be further along than we suspected earlier. His tweet in particular says it’s “More than just a concept” and to stay tuned for more. .@tomwarren Much more than just a concept. Stay tuned. pic.twitter.com/KmPYCPyGV4 — Evan Blass (@evleaks) November 4, 2016 See those pictures in larger size below: The last picture in particular is interesting, because if we are looking at a wireless Continuum for phones scenario, the app on the screen is clearly a win32 desktop app, suggesting we may be looking at Continuum with actual desktop apps. Let the speculation flow below. Update 2: Its a Dell! Read more here. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Intel said the deal will accelerate its strategy to build a broad portfolio of solutions to deliver “new, immersive sports experiences for athletes, fans and content producers”. Voke’s proprietary stereoscopic capture system offers a natural view of the action, allowing fans to see realistic proportions and depth. Its ‘TrueVR’ experience can be accessed from PC, tablet, phone and VR headset. “The Voke team brings more than 20 years of VR expertise, and they’ve captured the attention and the imagination of broadcasters, leagues and teams with their technology and what’s possible,” said James Carwana, general manager of the Intel Sports Group. Intel created its new Intel Sports division earlier this year following its March acquisition of Replay Technologies – which, through its freeD format, uses high-resolution cameras and graphics to let viewers experience sporting events from multiple angles.

According to this blog they will be used in IBM's public cloud, Bluemix, for customers to check out Optane performance, being made available free of charge on so-called innovator testbeds, and installed in IBM's Bluemix data centres. The blog claims: Intel Optane technology promises to change the face of computing with an unparalleled combination of low latency, very high endurance, and very high quality of service at extremely high and balanced read and write IOPS. Example application areas are blockchain, quantum compute simulations, cloud-assisted autonomous navigation workloads, high-frequency trading, realtime analytics/databases, and cloud gaming. Intel is contributing to these testbeds and IBM says the Optane SSDs deliver high IOPS at low queue depths, and have higher endurance than NAND SSDs. IBM Bluemix marketing manager John Le writes that an Optane-fitted server can run more virtual machines (VMs) with guaranteed service levels and provide high IOPS per VM. Example SSD-optimised database workloads can experience a fourfold throughput improvement at drive level when using Optane SSDs instead of Intel's P3700 NAND-based SSDs. The P3700 is a PCIe-connected SSD (NVMe) using 20nm MLC flash, and comes in capacities of 400GB, 800GB, 1.6TB and 2TB. It does random read/write IOPS at up to 450,000/175,000 and its sequential read/write bandwidth is up to 2.8GBps and 2GBps respectively. We understand its latency is 20μs for writes and 85μs for reads. Its endurance is up to 62.05PB written, meaning 17DWPD/5 years. This is not a slow SSD nor one that will wear out quickly. We note that IBM, and Intel, are saying that example database workloads on a server with an Optane SSD have four times more throughput at drive level than one with P3700 SSD, not revealing the read/write mix or the block size. We assume, perhaps wrongly, that this is at equivalent capacity levels. So let's go with this and say that, assuming 4K block sizes, and a 4X improvement for both reading and writing, the Optane SSD has (4 x 2.8) = 11.2GB/sec sequential read bandwidth, a startling figure, and (4 x2) = 8GB/sec write bandwidth; equally startling. This seems a bit of a stretch, and therefore unlikely. We're going to assume as well that the random read/write IOPS are higher than the P3700's as well, and that Optane's latency is lower, perhaps 10μs for writes. And its endurance may be higher than Intel's P3700 as well. At this point we'll stop trying to derive Optane SSD performance characteristics from IBM's blog as it's getting into far-fetched territory. Bluemix will extend this Optane testbed activity by offering what IBM calls a broad services suite in the second half of 2017. Presumably, though this isn't spelled out, it will also use Lenovo Optane servers. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 1 Comment More from The Register Lenovo HPC bounces back after IBM spinoff High performance biz has grown... and customers.. well, they're a little different Fujitsu seeks PC exit, finds willing buyer in Lenovo But can they fund the deal? 13 Comments Lenovo soups up storage for supers servers DDN buddy-up A-OK for HPC Lenovo be Nimble, Lenovo be quick, inks deal to take on Dell EMC kit Swaps all-flash array, analytics for channel access 5 Comments Lenovo downward dogs with Yoga BIOS update supporting Linux installs Somewhere a Lenovo engineer is crying over how your OS is accessing the SSD 65 Comments Lenovo big cheese walks Dave McQuarrie tipped to join HP Inc Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Lorie Wigle, VP & GM, IOT Security Solutions, Intel LAS VEGAS – At the Intel Security Focus Security Conference here, the company warned that the recent distributed denial of service [DDOS] attack – the largest in history – may well be a harbinger of things to come. While a window exists to remedy the problems with Internet of Things [IoT] security, it is rapidly closing. “It was probably a good thing that the DDOS attack happened now, because it was a wakeup call,” said Lorie Wigle, VP & GM, IOT Security Solutions, Intel. “Time is expiring on IoT security. The current state of things is not what it needs to be, and we saw this in the DDOS attack last week. We have a window to address this, but it is rapidly closing, because the number of devices will only keep ramping up.” While the Internet of Things is identified with cheap sensors, many of its items are rather more expensive, long lasting items. “Many of these things like fridges, we will have for 20 years,” Wigle said. “We need to get the security built in. We need to operationalize them. We have to be able to patch and upgrade them during their lives.” Wigle said that in the DDOS attack, attackers found devices unguarded because users never entered a password. This isn’t uncommon in the consumer space, because many consumers are afraid they will forget the password. “The problem here is that the consumers who owned the devices that were breached weren’t really negatively impacted,” she indicated. “The real victim was usually somebody else. But in the next phase of attacks, the attack could bring ransomware, which would have direct impacts.” Wigle said that Intel Security is responding to this by protecting across the threat defense lifecycle, which with the IoT, is manifested in a couple different ways. “First, it means taking full advantage of what we can build into processors and SoCs and putting the right software on top of it,” she said. “Being able to determine actual device identity will be fundamentally important for the IoT. “The other thing different about the IoT that needs to be comprehended is that they interact with the physical world – like oil pipelines,” Wigle stated. “This means that you also need to consider the safest way for them to fail.” Wigle noted that Intel Security has been using McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator [ePO], targeted at the energy industry, for IoT management. “We harden the device, secure the communication and manage and monitor it using ePO and possibly a SIEM,” she said. “This recently won us a Department of Energy Award.” Wigle also noted the growing industry-wide collaborative effort around IoT security. “No one company can solve it, so we have to co-operate,” she said. She identified three organizations in particular. The Industrial Internet Consortium, which now has about 350 members, has put together a 75 page prescription on how to secure an industrial internet. The Open Connectivity Foundation, which operates more in the consumer space, achieved a signal achievement by bringing two competing groups together. They do open source implementations as well as standards. Finally, she noted that the GSMA, the people behind the Mobile World Congress, who are most significant in Europe, have published guidance for IoT security and developed a self-certification checklist. “We think this is a really promising effort,” she said. “Lots of governments now want to do something around IoT security. This provides them with a thoughtful approach regulators can build on.” Regulatory growth around the IoT is inevitable in any event she said, including some type of regulatory security rating coming through the EEC. Finally, Wigle, a long-time Intel employee who was sent on assignment to Intel Security three years ago, noted that the upcoming separation next year of McAfee from Intel will not jeopardize the continuing research efforts. “We absolutely envision that collaboration continuing in the new setup,” she said. “It’s something I am personally committed to.” Share the Buzz: Tweet More Email Print Share on Tumblr Related Also Buzzing on this topic: Expanding Intel Security Innovation Alliance sees momentum in Open DXL Goodbye McAfee brand, hello ‘Intel Security’ Intel software chief: Security needs to be reinvented McAfee Teams with Distributors Arrow and Avnet on Embedded Security Intel Security to open DXL to spread the technology’s use Tags:Denial of Service ePolicy Orchestrator Intel Security Internet of Things McAfee Post navigation ← Cisco joins the endpoint security fray Cisco chief outlines digital transformation opportunity, strategy →   1 comment for “Intel Security warns window to address Internet of Things security is rapidly closing” Pingback: Intel Security warns window to address Internet of Things security is rapidly closing - Threat Brief Add your own buzz: Comment Below Cancel reply Subscribe to the daily e-mail newsletter from ChannelBuzz.ca and get the latest Canadian channel news delivered to your desktop every weekday morning.

It'd be pretty ugly for the former. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 4, 2016 at 11:00AM For many years now, a dark cloud has hung over Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) highly successful data-center processor business: the prospect of ARM architecture-based servers. The fear is that if chip companies building processors based on the ARM architecture can collectively take a significant portion of business away from Intel in the server market, Intel's business would suffer, perhaps dramatically. Intel hopes that integrating FPGAs, like the one shown above, with its processor technologies will allow it to better serve data-center customers. Image source: Intel.  ARM Holdings has said publicly that by 2020, it expects its partners will collectively capture 25% of the server processor market. Given that Intel has virtually 100% share, that 25% would necessarily have a significant and highly negative impact on Intel's financials. Let's consider how the loss of such a large amount of market segment share in the server market could affect Intel's financials. Doing some napkin math Intel now expects its data-center group, or DCG, to see revenue growth in the "high-single-digits" percentage range -- let's call it 8%. If we assume that this level of growth continues through 2020, and if we assume that Intel doesn't lose any market segment share in that time, then Intel's total revenue from DCG in 2020 would be in the ballpark of $21.7 billion. Next, if we assume that ARM expects its partners' revenue share to roughly track their unit share (i.e., 25% unit share translates into 25% revenue share), then this would imply that ARM expects its partners to capture approximately $5.43 billion in server chip revenue for themselves, leaving $16.27 billion for Intel.  In other words, if ARM and its partners achieve their shared goal, then Intel's DCG revenue in 2020 will be back to the levels that it saw back in 2015. Does this sound realistic? If ARM's partners do grab the kind of share that ARM is expecting, then their collective share gain would have to happen very rapidly. Intel hasn't given full-year guidance for 2017 yet, but executive Stacy Smith did say on the company's most recent earnings call that management expects to be able to grow its data-center business at a "robust growth rate." Since Intel is apparently planning for DCG to grow in 2017, the substantial share loss that would need to occur for ARM to hit its targets would need to start in earnest during 2018 and probably accelerate quickly through the end of 2020. This certainly isn't out of the realm of possibility, but it would take a combination of incredible execution on the part of several ARM-based server chip vendors, as well as what could only be described as very poor execution on Intel's part for that scenario to realistically play out. Considering Intel's track record here of continued product and market-share leadership and the track records of the various ARM-based vendors -- which is to say, a lot of talk, but also a lot of mediocre products that haven't gained much traction in the marketplace -- ARM has probably placed a little too much faith in its partners' abilities.  Intel can't afford to rest on its laurels, though Although ARM's market share prediction seems overly optimistic, particularly in the timeline given, Intel cannot afford to rest on its laurels or make business decisions under the assumption that it won't face credible threats. Indeed, Intel should work as if its competition is just one product generation away from potentially disrupting its lucrative data-center business. Given that the company continues to step up its investments in DCG, it's likely that management is doing just that.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

The VP and GM of Intel's UAV Segment explains why drones fit perfectly into the company's global strategy. By Kelly McSweeney for Robotics | November 4, 2016 -- 14:13 GMT (07:13 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Intel is getting serious about drones, with a string of announcements about unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology. The company is known best for its processors, but the Internet of Things makes computers harder to recognize. While yesterday's computing was done in a heavy rectangular box, today's processing takes place in everyday objects and tiny gadgets. Drones are no exception. "We see them as flying computers," Anil Nanduri tells ZDNet. He is Vice President and General Manager of Intel's UAV Segment. Today Intel unveiled its latest creation: The Intel Shooting Star Drone. Nanduri says: Think of it not just as a drone, but as a fleet of drones. It's targeted and specially designed for a light show, and using that system we've already set a new Guinness World Record of 500 drones simultaneously flying. The Shooting Star system is designed for light shows, so it will initially be used for entertainment, such as shows as theme parks, sports stadiums, and large public events (Fourth of July, New Year's Eve, etc.). The show is a bit like battery-powered fireworks, but with Intel's brains behind the operation, fancy animation can be created in just a few days. Each quadcopter weighs just over half a pound, with built-in LED lights that can create more than 4 billion color combinations. The system's algorithms determine where drones should be placed and optimize the flight path. An entire fleet of hundreds of drones can be controlled by a single computer. PHorlbeck The drones include safety features such as propeller cages and geofencing, and they are so lightweight that Nanduri says he didn't even notice when one landed on his head when he stood in the middle of a fleet's landing zone during testing. In the future, Intel's UAV fleets could also be used for more serious pursuits, such as automated building and utility inspections or search and rescue missions. The 500-drone demonstration (and new world record) took place in Germany, but similar drone light shows could be coming to the United States soon. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s new Part 107 commercial drone rules normally prohibit this kind of application, but Intel received a waiver that allows one pilot to be in charge of multiple drones, even while flying at night. Coordinating multiple flying robots is not easy, and swarm robotics is still an emerging technology. Nanduri says that it was particularly challenging for Intel's drone team to manage multiple systems so they don't collide with each other. "So it's not just about a record in terms of the number," he says, "but also the complexity of getting that done and having the system to be able to do that with a single click of a button. We've designed all the software, all the algorithms, everything that we need to manage that in house." Shooting Star is just the latest drone-related announcement from Intel. Earlier this week, Intel announced the acquisition of MAVinci GmbH -- a startup that specializes in fixed wing drone technology and flight-planning software for commercial use. In October, the company launched its first commercial drone, the Intel Falcon 8+ . And at the beginning of the year, Intel acquired German drone maker Ascending Technologies. Now that the FAA is starting to loosen restrictions on commercial drones, these flying robots are being used for many different applications. The result, says Nanduri, is that the drones themselves are becoming smarter, which requires significant computing power. Additionally, he explains, "There's tons of data that needs to be processed, which is going to drive more computing requirements. And anything that requires more computing requirements fits very well with the Intel strategy."

One of the key elements of this new architecture is the opening of its McAfee data exchange layer (DXL), and the introduction of a software development kit (SDK) that anyone can use to "gain the ability to attach to a shared real-time communication fabric and exchange security intelligence as well as orchestrate actions for the shortest possible execution of the threat defense lifecycle," as Intel Security explains in its press release. Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) bought McAfee in 2010. Most of the new security architecture is based on use of McAfee products, but not everyone is an Intel Security customer. Intel Security says it will open DXL to the industry. DXL provides a standardized application framework to integrate technologies from different vendors with each other and with in-house developed applications, Intel Security said. The OpenDXL Initiative will adopt an open source strategy; the new SDK is in beta. Barbara Kay, senior director of strategic marketing for Intel Security, explains to Light Reading that opening DXL means that organizations will be able to connect their security solutions in standardized way. "If you're able to go through an abstraction layer, it means no more one-to-one integrations," she says. "It will be more frictionless." The approach is already getting buy-in. Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq: CHKP) and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. recently joined the Intel Security Innovation Alliance, and are integrating security products through DXL. (See Intel Security Expands Alliance Ecosystem, Adds BT) Intel Security's announcements were pinned to its annual conference, Focus16, but also happen to follow some notable escalation in the perpetual cat-and-mouse game of network security. A week ago Friday, there was a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack that took down several prominent websites for hours and hours. Prior to all that, there were security experts who thought companies like Dyn (the central target of that attack) were well prepared to fend off such assaults. A month prior to that, there was a lesser-known but equally troubling DDoS attack aimed at Brian Krebs, a prominent journalist who covers network security; that assault set a record for DDoS size -- 665 Gbit/s. (See Attacks Have Major Internet Sites on the Ropes) Meanwhile, more and more critical systems are being networked, and when those defenses are breached -- as they inevitably will be -- the potential damage gets more and more severe. We are, Intel accurately says, "in a world where more than money is at stake and where private and public sectors are fighting against time and working to justify trust." The security "architecture" is unified inasmuch as it attempts to stitch together a web of security coverage that encompasses endpoints, data center/cloud, data itself, and security operations, based on the full range of McAfee products. Want to know more about how to secure data, networks, and services? Check out our security channel here on Light Reading. It used to be that an organization could establish adequate security at the gateway. "Well, the perimeter doesn't exist anymore," Kay notes. Intel is expanding endpoint security through the latest versions of McAfee Endpoint Security (rev 10.5) and McAfee Active Response (rev 2.0). These products bring together a set of capabilities that include Patient Zero Protection, which protects against patient zero and ransomware threats, Machine Learning for malware classification; Integrated Web and Endpoint Protection designed to check the spread of malware; and Real-Time Advanced Threats Protection which uses the cloud to accelerate investigations into attacks. Intel Security's approach to pervasive data protection is to unify software-as-a-service (SaaS) security so that organizations can manage access to sensitive data. The approach relies on two existing products: McAfee DLP 10.0, which introduces unified policies and incident management for both endpoint and network DLP, and on McAfee Web Gateway Cloud Service. The company also has in beta test its new McAfee Cloud Data Protection. It features Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) technology, to provide an integrated view of risky endpoint and cloud events, including the ability to perform a real-time endpoint health check, ensuring only trusted devices are able to access sensitive information. Intel Security's Data Center and Cloud Defense solution combines server security, network security and threat intelligence sharing to enable a single view of security across data center environments. The commercial application of machine learning is new in general, and new in the security area, and only going to accelerate. Kay tells Light Reading that machine learning will help security systems get more predictive about security breaches. When it comes to behavior on the network, "we're getting beyond known bad and known good -- we're getting to where there's a lot of gray. We have to learn to recognize attributes of suspicious behavior. That will allow us to pay more attention when something looks unusual. "The more beyond normal it is, the closer you should look. The more beyond normal it is with more valuable assets, the faster you should look," Kay adds. That's what machine learning is particularly good at. Simultaneously, Atos, a digital services company based in Europe, announced a new managed security service provider (MSSP) partnership with Intel Security. Atos will provide the first ever managed offering built to deliver the McAfee Threat Defense Lifecycle as a cloud, on-premises, or hybrid service. — Brian Santo, Senior Editor, Components, T&M, Light Reading (3)  |  Comment  |  Print  |  RSS Comments Newest First  |  Oldest First  |  Threaded View        ADD A COMMENT [close this box] Login 50% 50% Mitch Wagner, User Rank: Lightning 11/7/2016 | 9:12:01 PM Re: Togetherness Linux drives an awful lot of x86 sales.

Sure, the argument can be made by the company that open platforms and tight security don't go together well, but I can't say I would buy that as a good enough excuse.  Reply  |  Post Message  |  Messages List  |  Start a Board Login 50% 50% Mitch Wagner, User Rank: Lightning 11/3/2016 | 12:29:31 PM Togetherness Seems like Intel is flying the flag of togetherness but is proposing a conventional partner program where Intel controls the APIs. If it really wants collective action, Intel should join with peers to form a standards body or open source project where everyone is equal.  Reply  |  Post Message  |  Messages List  |  Start a Board Educational Resources sponsor supplied content Cybersecurity: Priorities & Proposals for Small ISPs Arbor & Cisco: Stopping DDoS Attacks Threat-Centric Security Solutions for Service Providers Cisco ASR 9000 vDDoS Protection Solution Cisco ASR 9000 Integrated DDoS Mitigation with Arbor Networks Peakflow TMS Cisco ASR 9000 vDDoS Protection Solution Frost & Sullivan: The Expanding Role of Service Providers in DDoS Mitigation Cisco ASR 9000 vDDoS Protection Solution Overview Educational Resources Archive Light Readings Upskill U is a FREE, interactive, online educational resource that delivers must-have education on themes that relate to the overall business transformation taking place in the communications industry.

Click Here Post a Comment Animals with Phones Archive Live Digital Audio Power to the Pipeline: How Sprints Plugging the Leaks Even when there's a strong pipeline of female talent in the comms industry, it tends to leak all the way to the top. McKinsey & Company says women experience pipeline leakage at three primary points: being unable to enter, being stuck in the middle or being locked out of the top. Each pipeline pain point presents its own challenges, but also opportunities to stop the leak. Wireless operator Sprint is making a conscious effort to improve its own pipeline from new recruits to the C-suite, and it wants the rest of the industry to do the same. In this Women in Comms radio show, WiC Board Member and Sprint Vice President of Enterprise Sales Nelly Pitocco will give us her take on the industry's pipeline challenges. Pitocco, who joined Sprint in May and has spent 20 years in the comms industry, will also offer solutions, share how Sprint is tackling the challenge within its own organization and take your questions live on air.

The Shooting Star, the second Intel-branded drone, is made specifically for coordinated use in fleets, using a lightweight design with safety cages around the propellor rotors. Intel released a new video showing an event in Germany where it says a Guinness World Record was set for most simultaneous airborne UAVs in a light show featuring 500 synchronized Shooting Stars.  Earlier this year, Intel received a Part 107 waiver from the FAA that it said will allow the company to demonstrate the new technology in the U.S. Previously, Intel staged what it called "Drone 100," a light show with 100 drones in Palm Springs, CA, but the company said the new waiver will allow it to fly hundreds or thousands of drones at night in the U.S. in the future. "We believe drones are an important computing platform for the future and we are continuing to invest in technologies and companies that will enable us to provide the best compute, sensor, communications and software integration for the growing drone ecosystem," said Anil Nanduri, VP of Intel's New Technology group, in a blog post, "These announcements represent a string of progress we've made in the drone space."

The compact PC is designed to drive up to four 4K displays at once and can be used both for gaming as well as for productivity applications that demand multiple monitors. In fact, the manufacturer officially positions the system as an entry-level machine for VR gaming. The ZOTAC ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 PC is powered by Intel’s Core i5-6400T processor (4C/4T, 2.2 GHz/2.8 GHz, 6 MB LLC cache, 35 W TDP) as well as a custom LGA1151 motherboard with two slots for DDR4-2133 SO-DIMM memory. AMD’s Radeon RX480 MXM module, one M.2-2280 slot for a SATA SSD, a SATA connector, two Gigabit Ethernet controllers, a 802.11ac Wi-Fi/BT 4.2 module and a USB 3.1 controller make up the other key features. When it comes to connectivity, the ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 is an example of reasonable set of I/O ports. The system features two HDMI 2.0, two DisplayPort 1.3, two GbE, two 3.5mm audio, two USB 3.0, two USB 2.0, one USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A and one USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C connectors. In addition, the PC has a 3-in-1 card reader (SD/SDHC/SDXC UHS II). Users with 5.1- or 7.1-channel speaker systems will have to use an external USB audio solution however.  From performance point of view, the ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 meets the minimum requirements that Oculus VR set for games compatible with the Oculus Rift VR headset back in the first half of 2015: it has a quad-core CPU along with AMD’s Radeon RX 480 GPU, supports up to 32 GB of DDR4 memory and can be equipped with 2 drives (1x M.2 and 1x 2.5"). If game developers follow recommendations of Oculus VR, the MAGNUS ERX480 should run VR titles for Oculus VR with decent framerate.  ZOTAC ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 Specifications     ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 (barebones) ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 PLUS (w/ DRAM+M.2) ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 WINDOWS (w/ DRAM+M.2) CPU Intel Core i5-6400T (4 cores, 2.2 GHz/2.8 GHz, 6 MB LLC, 35 W) PCH unknown 100-series Graphics AMD Radeon RX480 at 1050 MHz: 2304 stream processors 144 texture units 32 ROPs 256-bit memory interface 4 GB of GDDR5 7 GT/s memory Memory Two SO-DIMM slots, up to 32 GB of DDR4-2133 8 GB of DDR4-2133 (one module) Storage M.2 SATA 1x SATA 6 Gbps 2.5" 120 GB M.2 SATA SSD 1 TB 2.5" HDD Wi-Fi 802.11ac + BT 4.2 Ethernet Two Gigabit Ethernet with RJ45 connector Display Outputs 2 × HDMI 2.0 2 × DisplayPort 1.2 Audio 3.5 mm audio in and audio out USB 2 × USB 2.0 Type-A (480 Mbps) 2 × USB 3.0 Type-A (5 Gbps) 1 × USB 3.1 Type-A (10 Gbps) 1 × USB 3.1 Type-C (10 Gbps) Other I/O 3-in-1 card reader (SD/SDHC/SDXC UHS II) Dimensions 210 mm × 203 mm × 62.2 mm 8.27 × 7.99 × 2.45 inches PSU External OS - Windows 10 Home Speaking of dimensions, it should be noted that like other MAGNUS-series PCs, the ERX480 is not as tiny as Intel’s NUC, but it is not as large as some other models in Zotac's lineup. The relatively small size of the new compact PC from ZOTAC is a result of the company’s decision to use relatively low-power components (the manufacturer claims that the power draw of the ERX480 is 160 W) and air-cooling. We do not know whether the PC gets noisy under high loads, but this is a possibility as the system uses two blowers. ZOTAC traditionally plans to offer three versions of the MAGNUS ERX480: a barebones with just the CPU and GPU installed; a Plus version with a 8 GB DDR4 memory module, a 120 GB SATA M.2 SSD as well as 1 TB HDD; and a Windows edition with DRAM, storage and Windows 10 Home operating system pre-installed. The manufacturer does not disclose its MSRPs at this time, but claims that all the PCs will be available by the end of November.

POST A COMMENT 28 Comments View All Comments hojnikb - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link Any word on when zotac will refresh it's passive mini PCs with kaby lake ? Reply lmcd - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link Looks like this particular 480 is notably underclocked compared to retail cards. The question though is whether that underclocking is cautionary or reckless (not enough thermal relief). Makes me regret my Skull Canyon, slightly. Reply TheinsanegamerN - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link It could be the mobile varient of the 480, which would be clocked lower and binned higher for lower power consumption. People on forums have underclocked the 480 to dramatically drop it's TDP. People running the 480 at 1100MHz have cut significant voltage off of the chip, reducing it to sub 100 watt TDP in some cases. This may be what zotac did here. Reply TheinsanegamerN - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link *1000mhz, not 1100 Reply philehidiot - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link The other question is of course if the desktop 480 hit the bare minimum requirements for VR, does this variant with the lower clock speed mean this that VR performance is compromised? I know they're saying it does, but then the question becomes throttling - are they testing the components using VR in an open enclosure or in the real chassis? Or has it been tested properly with VR at all? Are they just taking components which themselves are rated for VR and then putting a stamp on it without testing how the system performs? I'd honestly be very cautious about buying something like this and expecting decent VR performance, especially if they're having to mess with clock speeds to keep within the thermal envelope. Reply TheinsanegamerN - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link true, although a stock desktop 480 also throttles pretty badly in some cases. it was also memory bandwidth bottlenecked IIRC, so that lower clock rate may not do as much harm as it would other cards. It also depends on resolution and graphical quality. You can run VR on a 470 with some sliders turned down, the 480 underclocked should still work pretty well. Reply lmcd - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link I think the real thing to emphasize though is how much the Gigabyte BRIX from a recent Anandtech review struggled in spite of its far-superior cooling system. I can't see this system fairing better. Not to say that the Brix ran into real struggles, but it was an appropriate amount of cooling. With a lower-TDP chip and what appears to be a much better cooling design in the same volume, I'd say this Zotac is probably in trouble. Reply Death666Angel - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link "[...]Gigabyte BRIX from a recent Anandtech review struggled [...]" You mean the GTX950/i7-6700HQ one? Where did that struggle? It ran the CPU @ 3.1GHz, above base clock and the GPU @ 1024 continuously, no throttling. The test even said: "It is heartening to note that the thermal design is indeed very effective even in our unnatural power-virus test." Reply BrokenCrayons - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link Interesting system, but I never liked the idea of companies using CGI renders of their products instead of photos of the actual item in their announcements and promotional materials. You really only get a vague sense of the product's look and feel. It's excusable in Zotac's case because the company has, I think, a pretty solid reputation for delivering on their promises, but still...meh Reply jaydee - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link It certainly gives the impression that the product isn't going to be out for awhile, because it makes you think they didn't have an actual product to take pictures of.

It is good that the attack has happened now, said Wigle, because it shows that the current state of IoT security is far from where it should be. The technology industry has a window of opportunity to ensure IoT is adopted with maximum security and minimum risk, but that window is small and closing rapidly, she warned. This window is important, said Wigle, because the number of IoT devices is only going to grow and a lot of IoT devices will be in use for decades. “[Internet connected] cars will be on the road for at least 10 to 15 years, so we need to get the security built into these devices,” she said. Equally important, said Wigle, is the need to ensure that security can be “operationalised” in the sense that these devices must be capable of being updated and upgraded when necessary. “This is important because, just five years from now, the threats will probably be of a kind we cannot even imagine today,” she said. Default usernames Returning to the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on Dyn, Wigle said one of the most significant aspects of that incident is that the attackers were able to find devices that had default usernames and passwords. “The manufacturer had not shipped them with the requirement that the password be changed, which was a problem because many users had not done so,” she said. For this reason, Intel with its security group is working on technologies to ensure that devices can be “on-boarded” in a way that does not require the user to enter a password using pre-programmed credentials, for example. “In the meantime, we have this tremendous set of vulnerable devices out there that the Dyn attackers were able to take advantage of,” said Wigle. The other significant aspect of the Dyn attack, she said, is that the owners of the IoT devices used to carry out the attack were unaffected and unaware. “There may have been a slight dip in performance, but the real victims were not the owners of the IoT devices,” said Wigle. Threat of ransomware The next phase of attacks taking advantage of vulnerable IoT devices could include weapons such as ransomware, she warned. “If we don’t get ahead of this, we are going to see another wave of attacks that will be a lot more harmful to the consumer,” said Wigle. “What we are working on, which is consistent with other work at Intel Security, is protecting against the threat defence lifecycle, looking at what we need to do to detect, protect and correct, and then adapt. “There are several ways we are doing this, such as making sure there is a good hardware foundation by taking full advantage of what can be built into Intel processors and SOCs and then putting the right software on top of it.” Unique aspects of IoT Intel is also looking at taking advantage of the unique aspects of the IoT. In the automotive sector, for example, the supply chain is hugely important, with up to 80% of component integration done by third-party suppliers. “For this reason, it is very important that we have very good security development lifecycle practices, including managing the supply chain, which is a big part of our approach to protection,” said Wigle. “We also believe that device identity is a fundamental capability that will be really important for IoT, and that it plays a role in both protection and detection, and then, of course, we need to correct.” Read more about IoT security Growth of the internet of things will be slowed or stunted if the industry fails to be proactive about data security, according to IoT Security Foundation. The influx of internet of things devices will inevitably bring security headaches. Don’t miss out on the opportunities of IoT, but learn how to avoid IoT security issues. The five key information security risks associated with the internet of things that businesses can and should address. The growing threat of the internet of things is quickly becoming a reality as new attack methods emerge. The other unique aspect of the IoT that needs to be thoroughly understood by system makers is the fact that, in many cases, IoT devices interact with the physical world, said Wigle. “This is one of the things that make IoT devices unique, so we need to be thoughtful in system design about what happens if a compromise is detected, so that devices fail in a safe way,” she said. Intel believes the key to enabling secure IoT starts with a secure hardware foundation, which includes, for example, secure boot, having a place to store secrets, having hardware identity, having software identify – or a way to attest that it has not been modified – and a trusted execution environment. “Then we have a lot of capabilities that we can put on top of that,” said Wigle. “Things like our whitelisting technology – McAfee embedded control – which is a wonderful capability for IoT devices because most of them have a limited set of functions that they need to perform, so it is much easier to lock down what can run rather than trying to keep a set of hashes up to date to blacklist what can’t run.” Other key elements include encryption of the data, policy management for the security activities associated with the devices, and mechanisms for provisioning and revocation. Wigle emphasised that no single company can solve the IoT security problem. “We need to work together as an industry,” she said, and highlighted three key cross-industry initiatives: 1. The Industrial Internet Consortium 2. Open Connectivity Foundation 3. GSM Association In collaboration with the Industrial Internet Consortium of about 250 companies, Intel Security has recently published a security framework document, said Wigle. “This is a 75-page prescription for how to secure an industrial internet system, which has been extremely well received by the industry and the analyst community,” she said. The Open Connectivity Foundation effort is more consumer-focused, but significantly has united two previously competing initiatives by Qualcomm and Samsung and Intel. “It also includes open source implementation, so the group does specifications but also does open source implementations that makes it easier to adopt,” said Wigle. The GSM Association effort, she said, is being driven more from Europe, but is working with Intel Security, which contributed to the publication of guidance for IoT security. “This contains strong recommendations for device makers, network makers and cloud services providers, as well as a self-certification checklist,” said Wigle. The checklist is aimed at helping device makers to evaluate their organisational capacity to do things like risk assessments and follow a secure development lifecycle, and to evaluate specific devices and implementations. “This is a really promising effort, and we are excited about it because a lot of governments want to do something around IoT security, and this is a thoughtful industry approach that hopefully regulators can build on,” said Wigle.

Hmm... Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 04 November, 2016 04:56 0 - - - - print email Very few people have likely either seen or heard of VR sports at this point, but that hasn’t stopped Intel from quickly snapping up its second startup, Voke, to lock up what it calls “immersive sports experiences.” Intel said Thursday that it has bought Voke, described as a leader in bringing “live, virtual reality experiences to consumers.” “Imagine being able to witness a slam dunk from the defender’s perspective or the defensive rush from the quarterback’s perspective,” James Carwana, the general manager of Intel’s Sports Group, wrote in a blog post. “This kind of experience may sound futuristic, but it’s closer than you think.” Voke uses an array of paired-lens, stereoscopic cameras to capture events like the Final Four and New York’s Fashion Week, then allows users to hopscotch around them to view the action from their choice of perspective. That’s somewhat similar to Intel’s second VR acqusition, Replay Technologies, which Intel bought in March. Replay uses what it calls “freeD” cameras scattered around a basketball court, and combines the video inside Intel’s own servers. The aggregated, stitched-together video feed essentially turns a live feed of a basketball game into a live 3D model of the action, which users can also rotate or zoom in and out of to experience the action as they want. It appears that Voke’s technology may be used to provide more realistic video images that could be later stitched together using the Replay technology. Voke’s technology can be viewed via phones, the Web, or the PC, as well as a VR headset. The company partnered with Oculus and Facebook to broadcast the NCAA men’s basketball final in 3D. Why this matters: If you’ve sat through any of Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich’s recent speeches, you’ve probably seen Intel’s newfound love of data represented in a variety of ways: 4K camera-equipped drones, or measuring the “vert” of a BMX biker as she flies through the air. All of these either use an array of sensors or machine interpretation of live video, generating tons of data for Intel’s processors to crunch. Meanwhile, Intel’s hoping that a new generation of fans who tweet and blog and play fantasy football regularly will be interested in a sports broadcast experience that can be manipulated and assessed in real time, turning fans into analysts. Culturally, that means one major change, too: Because broadcasters like NBC can’t deliver an interactive experience, that means games delivered via the Voke technology would be viewable only on a PC or smartphone. Meanwhile, so-called smart TVs have typically only been able to display streaming media like Netflix. Could Intel have something more powerful in mind?

Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

Intel has said it will derive revenue from Optane sales this year, but shipments aren't expected to flow until early 2017. It's widely accepted that once Optane and rival storage-class non-volatile memory arrives it will spark a rethink of how we build applications, servers, storage and networks. But because no plan survives contact with the enemy, figuring out just what will need to change is largely a speculative venture. Some opine that Optane will mean servers will have such rapid access to data that networks will become a bottleneck. Others The Register has encountered suggest that Optane and its ilk could become a new tier of RAM. The Gen-Z alliance of Dell, HPE, IBM, ARM, Samsung and pals even suggest a memory fabric is needed, perhaps alongside boxes that do nothing but provide memory to servers in the same rack. IBM's silent on just what its Optane cloud will offer, but has given us a hint by also announcing it's cooked up a cloudy Optane testbed that will feature Lenovo servers stuffed to the gills with Intel's new offering. Big Blue says the testbed is intended for “end users and software vendors looking to discover new innovations as well as test and optimise applications.” Interested?

Ian King More stories by Ian King November 3, 2016 — 6:14 PM EDT November 3, 2016 — 6:14 PM EDT Room Service, From a Robot Relay is waist-high. It has mood lighting, touch screens, and chirps as it wheels along hotel hallways, delivering Cheetos,  Kraft Mac and Cheese, and hairspray to guests. There are only a handful of Relays deployed in several Silicon Valley hotels right now. But Intel Corp., which invested in the robot's maker, Savioke Inc., thinks the future will be full of such helpers.  Underneath Relay's curvy exterior is artificial intelligence software that allows it to use cameras and other sensors to independently navigate through the hotel without running anyone over. Being aware of what's going around them is crucial if robots are going to transition from cages on factory floors to hotels, homes and other places where they could easily hurt humans. "Technology's gotten to a point where robots can make sense of the world in real time,'' said Steve Cousins, Savioke's founder and chief executive officer. "If the robot can see the world, process what it's seeing, and make a decision in real time, then it can be around us.'' Relay robot has a compartment to hold items. Photograph: David Nicholson, Bloomberg The markets that have provided Intel with the bulk of its sales-- personal computers and smartphones-- are slowing. Robotics is one of a number of fields that the company is hoping will pick up the slack. Yet robots alone can't make up for PC market contraction and they aren't even close to matching the 1.2 billion annual shipments of the smartphone sector. "We are a couple of decades away from that,'' said Gartner robot analyst Gerald Van Hoy. He estimates the current market for robots is in the tens of millions of units per year and significant growth won't start until around 2020. Savioke isn't chasing mass volume sales. It leases the robots to hotels and manages them remotely. That provides it with recurring income and incentivizes it to build products that are reliable and will last, Cousins said. It also removes the burden of maintenance and management from the hotel. "The team at Savioke has done an exemplary job growing the market for service robotics,'' said Wendell Brooks, president of Intel's investment arm. "Intel Capital sees significant opportunity in this important new market." At the Crowne Plaza San Jose, their version of Relay, which they've named Dash, started making deliveries last year. Front desk workers take orders from guests, then put the requested item into a plastic container under a lid on the top of the robot. They punch a room number into the touch screen and go back to whatever they were doing. ``In the beginning, everyone was just excited about a new toy,'' said David Wang, head of sales at the hotel. ``Then we saw all the benefits that he had for both the employees and the guests.'' Relay robot on its way to make a delivery. Photographer: David Nicholson, Bloomberg The robot makes deliveries within around three minutes of the order being placed, Wang said. Dash chirps when it's about to move, and can summon elevators. It uses a map with sensors to navigate the building, and if it comes across a person or laundry cart, it either stops and waits or looks for a way around. When guests receive an automated call to let them know their delivery has arrived, they open the door to find Dash waiting with its container lid open. Giving the service a five-star rating on Dash's  touch screen triggers a robot happy dance. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The Good The Yuneec Typhoon H offers features that are above its price, such as a 360-degree rotating 4K camera, retractable landing gear and the option to control the drone and camera separately. It has sonar-based object detection, but is also available with Intel Realsense obstacle avoidance. Replacement parts are easy to find, and you can service it yourself for the most part. The Bad The hexacopter is not sturdy, especially its flimsy camera mount. Controller size and layout are not the most user-friendly. Not as user-friendly as similarly priced models. The Bottom Line The Yuneec Typhoon H is a well-equipped prosumer camera drone, but its build quality and lackluster user experience keep it off our short list. 6.5 Overall Design 5.0 Battery 7.0 Features 8.0 Ease of Use 6.0 Review Sections Review Prices User Reviews facebook twitter more more + comments 0 pinterest googleplus email tumblr stumble reddit linkedin digg CNET Sport and Outdoors Drones Yuneec Typhoon H When the Yuneec Typhoon H showed up at CES 2016 it stood out from the horde of other flying machines at the gigantic electronics show (the Ehang 184 being a notable exception). Its six-rotor design and sonar sensors in front for obstacle detection give it the look of a flying insect, while its removable 360-degree rotating gimbal camera and retractable landing gear are things you can only really find on the $2,000 DJI Inspire 1. But the ready-to-fly Typhoon H was just $1,300 when it shipped in April and is currently $1,000 (AU$2,100, £1,000). To top it all off, the Typhoon H is available in a Pro version for $1,500 (£1,550, AU$3,000) which adds Intel's Realsense technology for advanced obstacle avoidance and downward-facing optical flow sensors to help you fly it if a GPS connection isn't available or is lost. (This Intel demo at CES shows just a bit of this system's capabilities.) Naturally, I had high expectations for the Typhoon H. I mean, I really like the Inspire 1, but it's simply not practical for anyone but professionals and enthusiasts with deep pockets. The Typhoon H offers comparable features (so much so DJI filed a lawsuit for patent infringement) in a more compact body and for a whole lot less money. You're getting a lot more drone for the price of DJI's top consumer drone, the Phantom 4. View full gallery Joshua Goldman/CNET Up, up and aw-hey, come back! For the first couple flights the Typhoon H performed really well. It handled wind with no issues and everything functioned as promised. There are two modes you can fly in, Angle and Smart. Angle moves the drone in the direction the control stick is pushed relative to the nose of the aircraft. Smart mode move it in the direction the right-hand control stick is pushed relative to the pilot and no matter which way the nose is pointed. Its Android-based ST16 Ground Station controller is somewhat unwieldy, takes seemingly forever to boot up and is not the most thoughtfully laid out or labeled, but it's great to have a 7-inch touchscreen built right in so you don't have to worry about attaching a phone or tablet. All the controls are at your fingertips for both the drone and camera. Transmission range for both video and control is rated at up to 1.6 km or 1 mile. Then it happened: While it was hovering in place (during a video shoot), it began to drift. When I went to correct it, the Typhoon H didn't respond to the controls, and sent itself into a tree. It didn't hit hard, but it was enough to snap one of its carbon-fiber arms in half and bust the camera mount, though the camera itself was fine. View full gallery Mark Licea/CNET Yuneec sent a second drone to test, but honestly, it took me awhile to attempt the retest because I was afraid of a repeat performance. Anyone who's experienced a flyaway knows how gut-wrenching it is to watch the drone uncontrollably crash or disappear into the distance. The fact is, though, flyaways happen. It's not unique to Yuneec and, in fact, on my DJI reviews you'll probably find at least one commenter asking me to do a web search for "DJI flyaway." But my Typhoon H problem was not an isolated incident: Yahoo's David Pogue and Videomaker.com's review of the Typhoon H point to flyaway problems similar to what I experienced. Round 2 Out of the box, my second Typhoon performed well again with no issues whatsoever. That lasted two flights.

Lattice is not consistently profitable going forward. 2004: Lattice restates financial results amid an accounting probe. 2005: Tsui and another executive are fired following shareholder allegations of excessive bonuses and lavish corporate spending. Steve Skaggs is named CEO. Lattice lays off 140. 2008: Skaggs is fired and replaced by Bruno Guilmart. 2009: Lattice posts its first profitable quarter in nearly three years. 2010: Guilmart quits unexpectedly, replaced by Intel veteran Darin Billerbeck 2015: Lattice moves from longtime Hillsboro headquarters to The U.S. Bancorp Tower (Big Pink) in downtown Portland, pays $600 million for California-based Silicon Image, and lays off roughly 200 workers in two rounds of job cuts. Portland’s biggest tech company, Lattice Semiconductor, sold Thursday to an obscure California investment firm that says its funding comes from China. Canyon Bridge Capital Partners said it will pay $1.3 billion for Lattice, or $8.30 per share. The offer represents a 30 percent premium over Lattice’s closing stock price Wednesday. Lattice’s shares shot up more than 18 percent on news of the deal, to $7.54. That’s well below Canyon Bridge’s offer price, though, reflecting skepticism about whether the little-known investment firm will be able to complete the deal. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland left his price target on Lattice at $7.50 despite the $8.30 offer, writing in a note to clients that he’s unsure Thursday’s deal will close given the uncertainty about Canyon Bridge’s ties to China and the firm’s track record. Canyon Bridge did not immediately respond to an inquiry about its background, portfolio or funding. Lattice’s sale would not be a surprise — the chip industry is undergoing a massive wave of consolidation — and the Portland company had topped the lists of takeover targets for more than a year. But the decision to sell to a unknown investment firm, instead of another chip company, is unexpected. California-based Canyon Bridge could be looking for opportunities to improve Lattice’s results before putting it on the market again. Just last week, Rolland said that Lattice would be an attractive acquisition for Xilinx, Qualcomm, Marvell or even Apple, which apparently is already a Lattice customer. On Thursday, though, Rolland told clients the Canyon Bridge deal faces uncertain prospects because of murky information around the investment firm. He noted that Canyon Bridge identifies its funding as coming from “limited partners in China.” In his note, Rolland said he believes the Chinese government is seeking to buy chip companies in other countries to integrate with a Shanghai-based company, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. Lattice would be a neat fit, he wrote, because its chips are made by contractor manufacturers based on older technology of the kind SMIC uses. Additionally, Rolland said, Lattice is small enough, and its technology sufficiently low-tech, that a sale to Chinese investors would probably pass muster with United States regulators who review such deals for national security implications. For its part, Lattice said Thursday it expects business as usual under its new ownership. Historically, the company has had about 200 employees in Oregon, split between its Portland office and its former headquarters in Hillsboro. Lattice employed 1,146 worldwide at the start of the year. “Importantly, we will operate as a standalone subsidiary after the acquisition and do not expect any changes in our operations or our unwavering commitment to continued innovation for our customers,” Lattice chief executive Darin Billerbeck said in a written statement. The company told employees that its headquarters will remain in Portland. Lattice is the smallest of three companies that dominate the market for a kind of chip called a field programmable gate array. The programmable chips play supporting roles in everything from telecommunications networking equipment to digital cameras and TVs. Last year, Intel paid $16.7 billion for another programmable chip company, Altera. And Lattice had made deals of its own, paying $600 million last year for a California company called Silicon Image. Lattice reported $406.0 million in revenue last year, up from $366.1 million in 2014, before the Silicon Image deal. Lattice lost $159.5 million in 2015, including $93 million in restructuring, accounting and acquisition-related expenses. Founded in 1983 by alumni of Tektronix and Intel, Lattice literally trademarked the term “Silicon Forest.” It has never had an easy path, though. Lattice filed for bankruptcy in 1987, revived the business, then withstood a formidable downturn following the dot-com crash. It endured an accounting scandal in 2004 and fired longtime CEO Cyrus Tsui a year later amid shareholder accusations of lavish corporate spending. The company’s business rebounded somewhat in recent years by focusing on the low-end of the programmable chip business, but results were uneven and Lattice laid off workers in 2012 and twice last year. The buyer, Canyon Bridge, has no public track record and its website identifies no other companies in its portfolio. The firm lists a Palo Alto address and two partners, including former Cadence Design Systems CEO Ray Bingham. Lattice’s sale is the latest in a long string of deals for Oregon’s biggest tech companies. Earlier this year, Beaverton-based Cascade Microtech sold for $352 million and FEI Co. sold for $4.2 billion. Wilsonville-based Mentor Graphics, the state’s largest pure tech company, is under pressure from investors and has reportedly hired an investment bank to put itself on the market. All three of those companies serve the chip industry, which is consolidating as maturing businesses look to expand their markets and reduce costs by acquiring peers in related fields. Oregon tech, with no really big companies of its own, tends to be on the selling end of those transactions.

Big changes that the channel should already be aware of are coming in 2017, however. Intel channel chief Richard Steranka LAS VEGAS – Intel Security announced major achievements in its product integration strategy on Wednesday here at its Focus Security Conference. No channel announcements were made, but the channel strategy will follow the same course as the product one, along lines which have already been telegraphed to the channel. The company is emphasizing that independence as a separate company next spring will bring consistency rather than change on the channel front. “From a channel perspective, as Intel Security we operated the same way we operated before we integrated into Intel,” said Chris Young, SVP and GM of the Intel Security Group. “It has been the same group of channel partners throughout. We built in new leadership last year with Richard Steranka – and Ken McCray runs North American channels today. As we become an independent company, we don’t want to introduce any disruptions.” That doesn’t mean that significant channel change won’t appear at the new McAfee next spring. Those changes, however, are the continuation of actions that have already been in motion throughout 2016. The channel has already come a long way from the days when it was largely endpoint-centric, said Steranka, Head of Global Channel Operations at Intel Security. Some further steps are still required to keep the channel transformation in line with the company’s transformation from being focused on product to today’s focus not just on solutions, but on broadly integrated solutions. “This has been a 18 month evolution in product development, where tying them together has required some ground-up redevelopment,” Steranka said. “We are at the onset of stages where partners can begin to deploy the vision that we shared 18 months ago. That will require a skillset around architecting and deploying those solutions. The vision of where we are taking the platform lends itself to those channel priorities. Steranka said that this restructuring is also necessary to attract and retain top partners at a time when they are restructuring their own practices to focus on fewer, more strategic vendor partners. “The channel program is following the same direction that our strategic partners are already going in, where they are consolidating, going from having many vendors to having as few as five,” he said. “We want to be one of those strategic vendors. We have been reshaping the channel program as a result – not just around sales capabilities, but service capabilities and managed services capabilities based on our platform.” This will mean that compulsory alignment around services competencies, in line with sales ones which have already been implemented, will be coming. “We started with sales competencies, and the next iteration will be services competencies, and we will – be doing that in 2017,” Steranka said “Service capabilities exist today. We have 100 partners who have them authorized already. The difference is that 2017 will see it made compulsory. Today, Platinum partners need to have three of our sales competencies, and Gold partners need to have one. The services competencies will be aligned to this in the same way.” One change that was announced early this year will kick in at the end of Q4, the change in definition of the Platinum Tier from volume-based to value-based as defined by sales competencies. Another change which was related to partners at the start of Q3 for Q4 – but which was not announced publicly – is a new Platinum incentive rebate program. It applies only to that tier, about 5 per cent of Intel Security’s total partner base. The new rebate has three objectives, Steranka said. “We wanted to make it more rewarding for partners to drive new business growth, and this rebate is for new paper,” he said. “We also wanted to be simple. Partners told us that in the past, you needed a math degree to figure out our payouts. Finally, we also wanted partners to have more visibility to see where they were in the quarter in order to maximize the payouts.” Another change is that more professional services resources – 19 per cent — have been added in the calendar year. 11 per cent more will be added in the next couple of months. “We want the channel more heavily involved in professional services, and these resources will be a key part of our strategy there,” Steranka said. Steranka indicated the vendor is looking for more MSP partners. “More is better there,” he said. Intel Security has a focus on very large enterprises, where they have significant share there, and the mid-market, which has a partner-led strategy, is also very significant. The SMB sector is covered in some cases by Intel Security’s consumer group selling upmarket. MSPs are likely to become more critical to this segment going forward however, as the more complex integrated solutions become the dominant purchases. “These integrated solutions are aimed at a reasonably sophisticated and dedicated security team,” said Brian Dye, vice president in the Intel Security Group and general manager of the group’s global security products. “At the lower end of the market, customers will consume them through service providers. The most effective route to market for things like Dynamic Endpoints are through a MSP. That’s how we think about it.” Steranka also pointed to Intel Security’s decision to open source DXL, which they announced Wednesday at Focus, will be a big plus for partners. “With DXL structure moving to an even more open world, you don’t have to be a big tech vendor to do customized development with it,” he said. “By providing SDKs to be able to do it, we’ve opened doors for partners to be able to participate more fully. Their ability to add their own IP to the platform, especially around analytics orchestration and event management will all them to build in significant differentiation.” “There is a clear partner solution focus to DXL,” Dye said. “They can see a clear line of sight to a happy customer and more margin, just as they see benefit in us moving from a point product player to a solutions player.” Share the Buzz: Tweet More Email Print Share on Tumblr Related Also Buzzing on this topic: Intel Security to revamp program, incentives around new strategy Intel Security boosts requirements for top tiers New Intel Security channel chief Steranka aims to stay the course Intel Security channel chief sees channel partners becoming alliance partners Intel Security renames, revamps McAfee Partner Program Tags:Brian Dye Chris Young DXL Intel Security professional services Richard Steranka Post navigation ← Expanding Intel Security Innovation Alliance sees momentum in Open DXL Cisco joins the endpoint security fray → Add your own buzz: Comment Below Cancel reply Subscribe to the daily e-mail newsletter from ChannelBuzz.ca and get the latest Canadian channel news delivered to your desktop every weekday morning.

Not just one of the best Game Sevens, one of the best games period. If you’re an Indians fan, my condolences. The team had an amazing season, and the comeback last night was stirring. I did not foresee Rajai Davis hitting a home run off of Aroldis Chapman when he was choking up on the bat, and just trying to make contact. As a former denizen of the Windy City, I’m thrilled for Cubs fans. They waited 108 years! The last time the Cubs won a World Series, the Ottoman Empire was still around, the world’s tallest building had 47 floors and Henry Ford had just unveiled the Model T. As for the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was around 60. It’s now at 17,964. At least Cubs fans got paid while they waited… Going Virtual Sticking with the sports theme, Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) today announced the acquisition of Voke, a maker of special cameras that capture sports action from many angles, allowing broadcasters to bring fans into the action with immersive, 360-degree “virtual reality” experiences. The technology can also be used for concerts and other live events. It’s cool stuff. Based in Santa Clara, Intel’s home town, Voke is a small firm (15 employees), but its technology already has been used by the Sacramento Kings and at the NCAA Final Four and international soccer tournaments. This move expands Intel’s aggressive move into virtual reality sports experience, which also can be translated into video games. By promoting VR technologies, Intel hopes both to create new markets for its specialty semiconductors and further diversify its revenue stream beyond chips. And today Linda McDonough, chief strategist for Profit Catalyst Alert, is recommending another camera company that will cash in on drones and the virtual reality systems hitting shelves this holiday season. Friday’s Jobs Report The October jobs report, to be announced tomorrow, is expected to show a rebound in hiring after two solid but somewhat disappointing months. The consensus estimate is 175,000 jobs created. This will be the last jobs report before the election, and it could have an impact if it’s significantly better or worse than expected.   Economists also will be watching the workforce-participation number for a continued return of workers to the job market. If it’s strong enough, that actually raises the unemployment rate, but it would be considered a healthy sign that companies are continuing to hire. Unless jobs really tail off, all signs are go for the Fed to raise interest rates in December. (As expected, yesterday’s Fed meeting was a non-event; officials didn’t want to do anything to interfere with the election.)   Stock Talk — Post a comment Comment Guidelines Our Stock Talk section is reserved for productive dialogue pertaining to the content and portfolio recommendations of this service.

The $2 billion acquisition of Oculus by Facebook in 2014 lent the neo-futurist hobby a decidedly shortened timeline for consumer adoption. To the tech titans operating alongside it, the purchase was a signal. Mobile’s most prominent success story was setting its eyes on what could possibly be the next platform shift. To the companies that had been burned by mobile, this was a signal to act on virtual reality. It’s ironic, if not unsurprising, that so many of the companies investing heavily in VR and AR are the ones that screwed up the mobile revolution or lost control of it. HTC is actively positioning itself to turn VR into a core business as its handset sales collapse. Nokia, once the mobile phone market king, is building high-end virtual reality capture systems. Microsoft, which never seemed to strike a chord with Windows Mobile, is working heavily to build up Windows Holographic OS for headsets. Intel’s past decade has in many ways also been defined by its failure to capitalize on the demands and opportunities of the mobile platform shift. Decisions to cling to the past in terms of system architecture made it difficult for the company to keep up with companies like Qualcomm, Apple and Samsung. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to lay off nearly 12,000 employees and kill development on some of its Atom mobile chipsets. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich will be the first to tell you that his company’s mobile woes are its own doing. He sees his company’s virtual reality initiatives as very early-stage projects that could end up becoming a critical business for the nearly 50-year-old Intel, where he’s worked since joining as an engineer in 1982. That year, VR was mostly a futuristic dream captured by movies like Tron. VR has arguably arrived in 2016, yet there’s still a growing cynicism that current VR efforts are nothing more than a host of PR stunts for many wayward companies to feign innovation with modest R&D dollars. All of this was on my mind as I traveled to Intel’s Santa Clara headquarters to take an exclusive first look at the company’s virtual reality lab where it’s researching how to virtually replicate our sensory experiences. This research into how we see, hear and feel the world is feeding into the company’s first major head-mounted display initiative, Project Alloy. It’s a wireless standalone VR headset optimized for its own brand of VR — something it calls “merged reality.” The Mantra If Intel’s early tease of its Project Alloy wireless HMD brought gasps, the announcement that the headset would highlight a new type of interaction called “merged reality” ushered groans. When it comes to terminology, we already have virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality and, I think, real reality (though I’m growing less sure of that everyday). I’m not going to say that merged reality is a term that needs to be added to the dictionary, but the philosophy behind it is notable. Merged reality is basically a fusion of VR and computer vision that gives a virtual reality headset the ability to understand the context around it, including the people, places and things that are unique to the environment. The technology heavily relies on Intel’s RealSense computer vision camera arrays, which the company has also been using to power robots, drones and autonomous cars. When it comes to merged reality, RealSense enables the headset wearer to seemingly gaze through the display and see parts of the real world (like your body and other people) in a wholly virtual environment. Intel hopes that this technology will be able to let you seamlessly merge the impossible environments of VR with the physical complexities of reality. The Lab Intel’s Santa Clara campus is a machine at work. The mouse-clicking and mechanical keyboard-clacking of engineers offered a light hum as I marched down the hallways with a team of Intel execs and employees guiding me through increasingly strict levels of security access. The first thing I noticed on the first floor section of the lab was its emptiness. The lab was largely cleared of employees while I was there touring the facilities, and certain areas were cordoned off. The click-clack hum had also hushed; this section of the lab contained a state-of-the-art 3D sound chamber where Intel is studying dynamic audio for merged reality environments. The first friendly figure to greet me was a robotic arm encased in a sensor-adorned open cage. This is where Intel does much of its work related to studying hand movements and building the algorithms to let the company’s RealSense sensors track the gestures. While VR compatriots like Oculus, HTC and Sony have introduced motion-tracked controllers for interacting with VR content, Intel is hoping to bring its hand-tracking tech to a level of finesse that makes interaction seamless, though many experts see some major challenges ahead for building this as a primary input method. After waving goodbye to the tireless robo hand, I ventured up to an even emptier sixth floor where Intel was designing the inside-out tracking technologies that allow its Project Alloy headset to be completely wireless. Right now, most good VR is tethered, meaning that you have a very long cord running from the back of your headset off to an expensive computer pushing high-end graphics. These systems are also positionally tracked by external sensors so that the system knows exactly where you are as you move about. Conversely, Project Alloy relies on a pair of RealSense sensor arrays to track your position based on your relative proximity to objects within your environment. You don’t have to set anything up or drill anything into your walls; you just walk into a room and toss on the headset. Speaking of which… The Project After spending a bit of time with an insanely creepy-looking misshapen robotic head with camera eyes that Intel uses to test head-tracking on RealSense, I was prepped for my exclusive demo with Project Alloy. I first got a few new details on the hardware specs that the first-generation headset is running. The kit positionally tracks its location with a pair of DS4 RealSense cameras and relies on a Skylake chipset for application processing with an Intel Atom tackling the computer vision. Though it’s still in development, the next generation (dubbed “Alloy 2”) will gain a new RealSense 400 camera and will see an upgrade to a Kaby Lake processor, but most interestingly the headset will ditch the Atom and move to a visual processing unit from Movidius, one of Intel’s latest acquisitions. After a bit of geeking out, I resized the surprisingly comfortable headset and balanced it gently on my head. Though I played around with the headset for about 15 minutes, my impressions were immediate. Building headsets that need high-end PCs would seem like a fairly natural plan for a company that builds chipsets for high-end PCs.   Certain things were very crude, others were very sharp but overall it felt like a decidedly different VR device, if not more of an aspirational concept. The inside-out tracking on the prototype certainly worked but the precision of the DS4 RealSense cameras left more than a bit to be desired. The next-generation model will thankfully see the resolution of the depth camera triple which will allow for more precise tracking, giving everything a considerably more crisp feel. Ultimately, the overall hardware experiences that arrive next year from OEMs will be the more critical take. Intel was quick to point out that consumer hardware isn’t really its forte; it’s focusing more on throwing something together to showcase the underlying tech. “At Intel we specialize in the hardware and experience, but we’re not by any stretch of the imagination best at building physical devices,” Intel exec Tim Parker told me as he walked me through the demo. Alloy 2 will ultimately still be a reference design, albeit one that Intel will team up with “Microsoft and other partners” to refine the build on. Intel isn’t planning to move into the consumer hardware business anytime soon, but Krzanich hopes that the headset can establish these Intel technologies into the DNA of next-gen VR devices. “By the middle of next year, we’ll have Alloy done, open-sourced. That’s really our goal, you know. You open source this thing and allow everyone to build on it, kind of like the old Microsoft PC business,” said Krzanich. What I remain very curious about is how Intel will choose to move its tech into tethered merged reality experiences. It’s important to note that Intel already boasts a strong connection to tethered virtual reality thanks to those fancy desktop chipsets that it seems to make a few of. Interestingly, the executives I spoke to largely seemed to downplay the wireless nature of Alloy. In fact, the conversation often seemed to drift back to tethered VR pretty organically. “We could unfree you of the cord because we can put all of the compute in [the headset] and we can do all of the mapping, but if you really want the low-latency, high-end gaming, then [tethered VR] is always going to be the leading-end system,” Krzanich said. A major decision for Intel will come down to deciding whether merged reality is important enough to make the investment in producing a VR-specific chipset. Otherwise, building headsets that need high-end PCs would seem like a fairly natural plan for a company that builds chipsets for high-end PCs. Parker did not directly comment on whether the company was currently looking at VR-focused chipsets. The Vision With the demo under my belt, the only thing I could think of was where Intel goes from here. Alloy is, at its heart, an internal development kit, but there are so many directions open for the company to take it thanks to RealSense and Movidius. Through the course of several sit-downs with RealSense and Movidius executives, it became clear that Intel may have the virtual/augmented reality space a bit more figured out than it’s letting on. In a slightly cramped room, Achin Bhowmilk, VP of Intel’s Perceptual Computing Lab, showed me an advanced demo of the company’s latest RealSense model in a merged reality setting. The sensor array was not just mapping the space but identifying the objects within the multi-room environment. A feed of the capture session ran as the sensor identified a table and four chairs within the space to varying percentages of certainty. “The idea behind this product was to build in the ability to sense and understand the world,” Bhowmilk told me. This system is a far cry from the RealSense tech I’ve used on PCs. RealSense’s first incarnations were a bit of a mess. What was dreamed up as a new method of human computer interaction was introduced to consumers in the form of a clunky, if not largely useless, PC input system that simply was not ready for primetime. With virtual reality, RealSense has earned a computing platform more deserving of its computer vision agility. Krzanich told me that one day he hopes to have this tech be able to identify people from your contacts for you while you’re strolling about and then bring up the appropriate notifications in your field-of-view. “RealSense was originally thought up in our labs; we were trying to think about how the keyboard and the mouse have been around for 20 years now—how it’s been the same way we interact with computers—and so we thought that maybe we could release peoples’ hands from them,” Krzanich said. “Then a bunch of us were just playing with virtual reality over the last year and started to realize that you were kind of limited by those setups.” At Intel we specialize in the hardware and experience, but we’re not by any stretch of the imagination best at building physical devices. — Tim Parker, Intel exec   RealSense gives spatial and contextual awareness to headsets, and Alloy gives hardware manufacturers a more accessible reference to integrate the tracking tech into their own products. The thing is, a great deal of these headset makers will already be using Intel tech, in the form of chips belonging to Intel’s soon-to-be-acquired Movidius. Movidius’s low-power Myriad 2 visual processing unit has become an industry standard amongst HMD manufacturers for its computer vision chops. Movidius was an early partner for Google’s Project Tango smartphone AR system and has announced partnerships with Lenovo to collaborate on VR devices. Myriad 2’s early ubiquity is certainly to Intel’s advantage as it looks to bring RealSense to more devices. RealSense and Movidius will undoubtedly be growing cozier, but Krzanich insists that Movidius will still be sold as a standalone product though it’s clear that both sides hope to see the products integrate quite closely. “We’ll continue to drive enhancements to the Movidius architecture, and what we’ll try to do moving forward is understand how that architecture can best be merged or connected to Intel architecture,” Krzanich said. Movidius CEO Remi El-Ouazzane also sees his product becoming more optimized for the RealSense platform, which he noted he’s been excited to closely integrate and “use the hell out of.” “Today, the truth is [the Movidius platform] is entirely agnostic,” the Movidius CEO told me. “I think that could change, I think we need to develop, with Intel, the competitive edge that makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts.” The Future Many of the biggest proponents of virtual reality only see it as a holdover technology for augmented reality tech that will overlay digital images onto the world around us. Intel seems to be rather interested in observing how VR eventually morph into AR. Augmented reality is an exciting—if not suspiciously secretive—space. Developers have access to Microsoft’s HoloLens headset at the moment and the Meta 2 development kit will start shipping soon despite delays, but details are still scant regarding some of the other heavily hyped head-mounted display manufacturers. Magic Leap, which has raised nearly $1.4 billion from investors including Google and Alibaba, has yet to show off so much as a prototype of their upcoming headset. And though sources close to the company have told me that Apple is currently building multiple “mixed reality-type” headset prototypes based on different display technologies, there has been no official word from Cupertino regarding an actual product. Many of these headsets may have one item in common however, that being Movidius. “I’ll say very humbly that there is no big AR platform out there not using Movidius,” El-Ouazzane told me. He also detailed that Movidius technology was enabling its partners to miniaturize the head-worn glasses on many of these augmented reality systems by moving compute to pocket devices. He believes that inconspicuous form factors will help improve reception of the devices. “At the end of the day we should all have learned our lesson from the ‘glasshole syndrome.’ AR glasses will have to be devices that weigh 25 and 30 grams and will be fairly interesting devices to wear,” he detailed. “The vision, no pun intended, is to have as low electronics as possible so it will be a vision processor and a variety of components in terms of display with all the compute being taken care by what you have in your pocket which most likely will be your smartphone. That’s where all the AR engagement we have is.” There is no big AR platform out there not using Movidius. — Remi El-Ouazzane   Though Krzanich stressed in our conversations that the industry is “a year or two away from getting the optics tech needed for augmented reality,” he hinted that Intel already has “all kinds of development” going on in the AR space currently. Merged reality is a fascinating venture into closing the gap between VR and AR. While Project Alloy is an early venture with apparent shortcomings, it’s clear that Intel is laying out plenty of runway for the company’s VR efforts. These efforts will continue to build out the computer vision and visual processing acuity necessary for more robust augmented reality devices and experiences. Intel is taking its time. Neither Movidius or RealSense are going entirely all-in on VR/AR headsets; each of them is also focusing its talents on other, more imminent, tech platforms as well, such as autonomous driving, security systems and drones. Project Alloy and merged reality give the company a clear product and product class to begin building up its efforts in the broader space across VR and AR. Predicting the next computing platform or distinguishing fad from future has never been an exact science, but Intel understands what’s at stake here with AR/VR and is setting itself up well to ensure that it doesn’t lose touch with these realities.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | November 3, 2016 -- 17:34 GMT (10:34 PDT) | Topic: Virtual Reality Voke's TrueVR platform. Intel is buying virtual reality startup Voke VR in an effort to build out a portfolio of services for its new immersive sports business. The end goal for Intel is to have the ability to broadcast live events in VR. What's Hot on ZDNet Why Samsung's Harman purchase will be seen as Apple blunder decades from now Nintendo announces release date for Super Mario Run on iOS Why automation is finally revolutionizing quick service restaurants and what it means for jobs Major Linux security hole gapes open Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it includes Voke's technology and platforms, talent, and clientele. Founded in 2004 and headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif., Voke is a strong player in the virtual reality segment. The company was previously backed by Intel and the Sacramento Kings, the latter of which used the investment to offer VR live streams of its NBA games. Voke's platform includes a proprietary paired lens and stereoscopic capture system that make its VR streams look more realistic in terms of depth and proportion. Voke's videos can be viewed on multiple platforms including PCs, tablets, smartphones, and VR headsets. According to Intel, Voke's platform was designed for simple integration into existing broadcaster and league channels -- something the chipmaker highlighted as one of the key factors in buying the startup. "Together, we can innovate and scale our new immersive sports business faster to bring fans the most personalized, fully immersive VR experience ever imagined and change the way networks, sports leagues and teams engage with their audiences," said James Carwana, GM of Intel Sports Group. Intel's new sports division also includes the freeD technology team, which came to Intel after the company acquired Replay Technologies in March. Both Replay and Voke help round out Intel's portfolio of VR technology, as the chip giant works to expand beyond its legacy business.

These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers. Click here to register and download your free 30-day trial of Intel® Parallel Studio XE. Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel® DAAL) is a performance library for data analytics that provides optimized building blocks for data analysis and machine learning on Intel® platforms. The functions in Intel DAAL cover all the stages of data processing in machine learning, from preprocessing, transformation, analysis, and modeling to decision-making. For each stage of processing, Intel DAAL includes functions and utilities that are optimized for Intel® architecture, including Intel® Atom™, Intel® Core™, Intel® Xeon®, and Intel® Xeon Phi™ processors. Intel DAAL supports batch, online, and distributed processing modes, and it supports three programming APIs: C++, Java*, and Python*. Here, we’ll explore a C++ example of the Intel DAAL application in handwritten digit recognition—a classical type of machine learning problem. Several application algorithms are relevant. Support vector machine (SVM), principal component analysis (PCA), Naïve Bayes, and neural network can all be used to tackle this problem with different prediction accuracy. Intel DAAL includes most of these algorithms. We have chosen SVM to demonstrate how a library algorithm in Intel DAAL can be used in handwritten digit recognition. Loading Data in Intel DAAL In handwritten digit recognition, recognition is essentially the prediction or inference stage in the machine learning pipeline. Given a handwritten digit, the system should be able to recognize or infer what digit was written. For a system to be able to predict the output with a given input, it needs a trained model learned from the training data set that provides the system with the capability to make an inference or prediction. The first step before constructing a training model is to collect training data. For our sample application, we are using public data downloadable from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, where there are 3,823 preprocessed training data and 1,797 preprocessed testing data. Intel DAAL supports several data formats (CSV, SQL, HDFS, and KDB+), as well as user-defined data formats. In our example, we’ll use the CSV format. Let’s assume we store the training data in a file named digits_tra.csv and the testing data in a file named digits_tes.csv. Intel DAAL provides some utilities to help load data into memory from the data source. Here, we first define the object trainDataSource, which is a CSVFeatureManager that can load the data from a CSV file into memory. Inside Intel DAAL, data in memory are stored as a numerical table. With CSVFeatureManager, a numeric table is automatically created. To load the data from the CSV file, simply invoke the member function loadDataBlock(). Now the data are loaded into memory as a numeric table that is ready for further computation. The core parts of the C++ codes for loading the training data from the CSV file are shown in Figure 1. /* Input data set parameters */
    string trainDatasetFileName = "digits_tra.csv";
    string testDatasetFileName = "digits_tes.csv";

/* Initialize FileDataSource<CSVFeatureManager> to retrieve input data from .csv file */
    FileDataSource<CSVFeatureManager> trainDataSource(trainDatasetFileName,
    DataSource::doAllocateNumericTable, DataSource::doDictionaryFromContext);

/* Load data from the data files */
    trainDataSource.loadDataBlock(nTrainObservations); Figure 1 - C++ codes for loading training data Training SVM-Based Handwritten Digit Recognition Model Now that the training data are loaded into memory, it is ready to learn from the data and build a training model. We pick the SVM algorithm for training. In this example, since the training data set is small, data can be fit into memory all at once. We’ll use batch processing mode for our demonstration. After an algorithm is defined, set the related parameters needed for algorithm, such as the number of classes (in this case, 10). Then the training data is passed to algorithm via the training data numeric table trainDataSource.getNumericTable(). By invoking algorithm.compute(), the SVM computation is active. After that, training is complete. The trained model is embedded in the object trainingResult, which is obtained by invoking algorithm.getResult(). The sample codes of the training process are shown in Figure 2. services::SharedPtr<svm::training::Batch<> > training(new
    svm::training::Batch<>());

/* Create algorithm object for multi-class SVM training */
    multi_class_classifier::training::Batch<> algorithm;
    algorithm.parameter.nClasses = nClasses;
    algorithm.parameter.training = training;

/* Pass training dataset and dependent values to the algorithm */
    algorithm.input.set(classifier::training::data,
    trainDataSource.getNumericTable());

/* Build multi-class SVM model */
    algorithm.compute();

/* Retrieve algorithm results */
    trainingResult = algorithm.getResult();

/* Serialize the learned model into a disk file */
    ModelFileWriter writer("./model");
    writer.serializeToFile(trainingResult->get(classifier::training::model)); Figure 2 - Sample process training codes Intel DAAL also provides serialization functions that can read out the trained model from memory into a file and deserialization functions that can load the trained model file into memory. As shown in the last two lines of codes in Figure 2, we define a ModelFileWriter that writes to a file named model. By invoking writer.serializeToFile(), the trained model embedded in trainingResult is written to the file named model. This serialization/deserialization utility is useful in a case where, after training, a server can port the trained model to a client, and the client can do the prediction or inference using the trained model without training. We will see how this model file is utilized in the section "Handwritten Digit Recognition Application." Testing the Trained Model With the trained model, we can do testing. As we did for training, we store the testing data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository in a CSV file and load it with testDataSource. loadDataBlock(). We still need to define the SVM algorithm object algorithm for prediction. We have two inputs for algorithm: the testing data and the trained model. Testing data are passed by testDataSource.getNumericTable(). In batch testing, the trained model is passed by a pointer of trainingResult->get(). (In the section "Handwritten Digit Recognition Application," we will see how to pass the trained model by a file.) After setting up algorithm inputs, calling algorithm.compute() will complete the testing process. The sample codes for testing are shown in Figure 3. The predicted results after testing are retrievable by calling algorithm.getResult(). services::SharedPtr<svm::prediction::Batch<> > prediction(new
    svm::prediction::Batch<>());

/* Initialize FileDataSource<CSVFeatureManager> to retrieve the test data from .csv file */
    FileDataSource<CSVFeatureManager> testDataSource(testDatasetFileName,
        DataSource::doAllocateNumericTable,
        DataSource::doDictionaryFromContext);
    testDataSource.loadDataBlock(nTestObservations);

/* Create algorithm object for prediction of multi-class SVM values */
    multi_class_classifier::prediction::Batch<> algorithm;

    algorithm.parameter.prediction = prediction;

/* Pass testing dataset and trained model to the algorithm */
    algorithm.input.set(classifier::prediction::data,
        testDataSource.getNumericTable());
    algorithm.input.set(classifier::prediction::model,
        trainingResult->get(classifier::training::model));

/* Predict multi-class SVM values */
    algorithm.compute();

/* Retrieve algorithm results */
    predictionResult = algorithm.getResult(); Figure 3 - Sample codes for testing Intel DAAL also includes functions to calculate the quality metrics, such as the confusion matrix, average accuracy, error rate, etc. With SVM, for the test data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the quality metrics are shown in Figure 4, where 99.6 percent average accuracy is achieved for the whole test data. Figure 4 - Quality metrics SVM Performance Comparison between Intel DAAL and scikit-learn* The SVM algorithm is a classic algorithm that many machine learning frameworks or libraries have in their packages. scikit-learn* is a popular Python library for machine learning. In the scikit-learn SVM classification example, the same training and testing data are used for a handwritten digit application. We compared the SVM performance between Intel DAAL and scikit-learn for both training and prediction. The results are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5 - SVM performance boosts using Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel® DAAL) versus scikit-learn* on an Intel® CPU The comparison is done on a system with two-socket Intel® Xeon® processors E5-2680 v3 @ 2.50 GHz, 24 cores, 30 MB L3 cache per CPU, 256 GB RAM. The operating system used is Red Hat Enterprise Linux* Server release 6.6, 64 bit. The versions of libraries used are Intel DAAL 2016 Update 2 and scikit-learn 0.16.1. As shown in Figure 5, for both training and testing, SVM in Intel DAAL outperforms scikit-learn. In training, SVM in Intel DAAL is 6.77x faster than scikit-learn, and in testing or prediction, SVM in Intel DAAL is 11.25x faster than scikit-learn. Handwritten Digit Recognition Application As mentioned earlier, the trained model learned in a server can be ported to a client for its application. Here we have a simple handwritten digit recognition application where the trained model is ported. There is only prediction or testing in this interactive application. The snapshot of the interface of the application is shown in Figure 6 as a Doodle Frame. In the Doodle Frame, there are two white panel boxes. The left big white box is where a digit from 0 to 9 can be written one at a time; the right small white box displays the digit that the system believes is written on the left panel. In Figure 6, the number 3 is handwritten in the left box, and the system recognizes that number and then displays the inferenced result, 3, in the right box. Figure 6 - Digital recognition application For this application, we are only testing or predicting one digit at a time. For any written digit, a test CSV file is generated that contains the features that are extracted from the handwritten digit by using some preprocessing techniques. (The preprocessing is beyond the scope of this article and will not be covered.) Now that we have the test data, we still need a trained model for the object algorithm as inputs. As mentioned above, we have already built a trained model, and have actually written the model in a file named model. Now it is time to load that trained model from the file, which means deserializing the model into memory. We define a ModelFileReader to read from the file named model by calling reader.deserializeFromFile(pModel). The trained model is loaded into memory, where pModel is the pointer to the model. The C++ codes are shown in Figure 7, where most of the codes are the same as in Figure 3. After algorithm.compute(), we get the prediction result predictionResult1, which contains the label, or the predicted number, for the given input digit. services::SharedPtr<svm::prediction::Batch<> > prediction1(new
    svm::prediction::Batch<>());

/* Initialize FileDataSource<CSVFeatureManager> to retrieve the test data from .csv file */
    FileDataSource<CSVFeatureManager> testDataSource(testDatasetFileName,
        DataSource::doAllocateNumericTable,
        DataSource::doDictionaryFromContext);
    testDataSource.loadDataBlock(1);

/* Create algorithm object for prediction of multi-class SVM values */
    multi_class_classifier::prediction::Batch<> algorithm;

algorithm.parameter.prediction = prediction1;

/* Deserialize a model from a disk file */
    ModelFileReader reader("./model");
    services::SharedPtr<multi_class_classifier::Model> pModel(new
multi_class_classifier::Model());
    reader.deserializeFromFile(pModel);

/* Pass testing dataset and trained model to the algorithm */
    algorithm.input.set(classifier::prediction::data,
testDataSource.getNumericTable());
    algorithm.input.set(classifier::prediction::model, pModel);

/* Predict multi-class SVM values */
    algorithm.compute();

/* Retrieve algorithm results */
    predictionResult1 = algorithm.getResult();

/* Retrieve predicted labels */
    predictedLabels1 = predictionResult1->get(classifier::prediction::prediction); Figure 7 - C++ codes Summary Intel DAAL provides the building blocks for the whole pipeline in machine learning. With the SVM C++ code snippets, we’ve shown how to use Intel DAAL in an application: specifically, how to load data from a file, how to build the training model, and how to apply the trained model in the application. Since the functions in Intel DAAL are optimized for Intel architecture, developers can get the best performance by using the building blocks in Intel DAAL on Intel platforms for machine learning applications. As we’ve seen, SVM in Intel DAAL outperforms SVM in scikit-learn.

These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers. Click here to register and download your free 30-day trial of Intel® Parallel Studio XE. Java* has long been a favorite developer language—one that is gaining traction with enterprise, embedded, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Intel® VTune™ Amplifier power and performance profiler (part of the Intel® software tools suite) has been profiling managed code like Java and .NET for quite some time. Python* has also become a popular programming language due to its ease of programming and ability to integrate systems more efficiently. With the growth in popularity of these two different programming languages, it’s important to make sure applications are effectively using the available CPU capabilities. In response to these demands, Intel VTune Amplifier has extended its profiling capability to both Java- and Python-based applications. Here we explore using Intel VTune Amplifier to gain more understanding about how an application is performing. What is Intel VTune Amplifier? Intel VTune Amplifier is a performance and power profiler that can help you discover the specific modules/processes that are taking more CPU time (hotspots). It can also help catch issues at the microarchitectural level (e.g., cache misses, page walks, TLB issues, and others) through a sampling technology with minimal overhead. Why Application Performance Profiling? Application performance profiling is necessary to figure out the various code blocks that are consuming more CPU clock cycles. This kind of information can be retrieved by manually inserting timing APIs. But manual inspection and discovering the module that is causing problems takes more time when your project has many modules. Intel VTune Amplifier offers many profilers that can help drill down to the issue. Intel VTune Amplifier Features Intel VTune Amplifier has various features that make it intuitive and easy to use. It: Uses sampling technology, which has a minimal overhead compared to instrumentation used for profiling. Is an easy-to-use profiler with various grouping/filters/caller-callee options, which can help to focus on the problematic code. Can provide the information at source level and assembly level. Can provide various types of microarchitectural information about the application. Profiling a Java Application There are four steps to profiling a Java application: Create an Intel VTune Amplifier Project. Select the Application/Process to Profile. Select the type of analysis. Collect the results and interpret. Create an Intel VTune Amplifier Project on a Windows* System First, set up the environment variables with the amplxe-vars batch file. For example, if you installed Intel VTune Amplifier using the default directory, type: C:\[Program Files]\IntelSWTools\VTune Amplifier XE\amplxe-vars.bat The batch file displays the product name and the build number. Next, launch Intel VTune Amplifier. For a standalone GUI interface, run the amplxe-gui command. Or, for command-line interface, run the amplxe-cl command. Create an Intel VTune Amplifier project (standalone version only): Click the menu button in the right corner and go to New > Project. Specify the project name and location in the Create Project dialogue box. Note: If you are working on a Linux* platform, see Getting Started with Intel® VTune™ Amplifier XE 2016 for Linux* OS to learn how to create a new project. Select the Application/Process to Profile In the Analysis Target tab, select a target system from the left pane and select an analysis target type from the right pane. You can: Launch an application to be profiled using Launch Application. Attach the profiler to an application that is already running using Attach to Process. Observe an application’s interaction with system calls by selecting Profile System. If you select Launch Application, provide the path to the java.exe file in the Application field and a set of parameters like "Java options" or "prop files" in the Application parameters (Figure 1). Additionally, you can give the set of environment variables that your application might need to run in the User-Defined Environment variables field. Alternatively, define a *.bat file with the various environment variables, java.exe binary, and parameters and provide this *.bat file in the Application field rather than the java.exe file. Figure 1 - Choose target and analysis type Select the Type of Analysis Switch to the Analysis Type tab, select the Basic Hotspots analysis type, and click Start. Collect the Results and Interpret We have used the SPECjbb2000 benchmark for this example. Once the data collection and finalization are done, a Summary tab opens showing the various metrics. Let’s interpret some of the metrics here: In the first section of the Summary Tab (Figure 2), we see the Elapsed Time of the application (wall clock time from start to stop of an application), CPU Time (time during which the application was actively utilizing the CPU), Total Thread Count (number of threads that were deployed in our application). Figure 2 - Elapsed time The second section of the Summary tab (Figure 3) shows Top Hotspots, which are the functions that account for the most CPU time. In our example, we have the top five hotspots, with the first hotspot accounting for 13.165 seconds. However, we can observe that we have both [Dynamic code] and [Compiled Java code] under the Module column, which are Java methods that cannot be attributed to any module in terms of native binary. All Java user methods are attributed to the [Compiled Java code] module. Also, JVM can generate some methods for its internal usage and report them to the Java profiler. Such methods are attributed to the [Dynamic code] module. Figure 3 - Top hotspots The third section of the Summary tab (Figure 4) includes the CPU Usage Histogram, which visualizes the number of logical cores being used to run the application. The color coding signifies how Intel VTune Amplifier classifies the number of cores used by the application as Idle, Poor, OK, and Ideal. Figure 4 - CPU usage histogram We can retrieve more details by looking at the Bottom-Up tab (Figure 5), where we have the timeline view to visualize the workload on the threads with various groupings and filters and focus on a specific time interval. We can further drill down to the sources by double-clicking on the function/module of interest. Figure 5 - Bottom-Up tab To quickly start optimizing code, it is helpful to drill down to a specific source file location. In addition to the source, we can also see the highlighted the corresponding assembly generated for a given source line (Figure 6). Figure 6 - Assembly generated for a source line Besides knowing the modules that are consuming most of the CPU resources using the Basic Hotspots analysis type, we can find the context switches and transitions between threads using the Concurrency Analysis type (Figure 7). The yellow lines signify the transitions between threads. Figure 7 - Concurrency analysis Use the General Exploration analysis type to perform an architectural analysis to deep dive and understand the various issues related to caches, TLBs, page walks, false sharing, and many more. Profiling a Python Application Python profiling is a new feature in the 2017 version of Intel VTune Amplifier. See the article, "Getting Your Python* Code to Run Faster Using Intel® VTune™ Amplifier XE," in Issue 25 of Parallel Universe magazine to learn how to get started with Intel VTune Amplifier for profiling Python applications. The article focuses on mixed-mode profiling, resolving symbols of *.pyd modules, and setting up the compiler and linker flags for Cython* compilation. Mixed-Mode Profiling Python is an interpreting language and doesn’t use a compiler to generate binary execution code. Cython is also an interpreting language (but a C-extension), and it can be built to native code. Intel VTune Amplifier 2017 can fully support reporting hotspot functions in both Python and Cython code. Cython works in a two-step process: Convert a *.pyx (Cython) file into a *.c file Compile this *.c file into a *.pyd file (equivalent of a .so on Linux) The sample being used for this example is a matrix multiplication of 512*512 size. Below are the steps for generating the *.pyd files and using VTune Amplifier to resolve the symbols: Set up the setup.py file with extensions and compiler and linker flags, which allows you to use Cython to convert the *.pyx source code from Python to C. #setup.py
from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize
from distutils.extension import Extension
from Cython.Distutils import build_ext

setup(
    cmdclass = {'build_ext': build_ext},
    ext_modules = [Extension('Matrix_mul', sources=["Matrix_mul.pyx"],
        extra_compile_args=['/Z7'],
        extra_link_args=['/DEBUG']),
    ],
) In the setup.py file above, extensions were created with compiler flags /Z7 and linker flags /DEBUG to generate the debug symbols. Including flags is important if we want to drill down to the source level in Intel VTune Amplifier. If you are working on Linux platforms, use -g both in extra_compile_args and extra_link_args. Call Python with the following command to convert it to C using Cython: python setup.py build_ext This command generates the corresponding *.c and *.pyd module. In our case, we should see Matrix_mul.c and Matrix_mul.pyd. Since we have also requested the generation of symbolic information, we should see a *.pdb file as well. Create a Python script importing the Matrix_mul.pyd module as shown below : #simple.py
import Matrix_mul
Matrix_mul.func(); Use the Basic Hotspots analysis type in Intel VTune Amplifier 2017 to analyze the application with simple.py as the parameter to the Python interpreter (Figure 8). Figure 8 - Choose target and analysis type Once the Basic Hotspots analysis completes, the modules/functions can be seen on the Bottom-Up tab (Figure 9). Figure 9 - Modules/functions In this example, the Matrix_mul.pyd module (converted module) is one of the top hotspots that is consuming most of the CPU time. In the Filter section at the bottom of the page, we have selected "Only user functions" as we were interested in analyzing/profiling the user code alone. To view the user- and system-level functions and their interaction, select "User/system functions." We can further drill down into each of these source files to figure out the issue at the specific source line of these modules. We can also see the corresponding assembly for the C code being generated. By double-clicking the first user-function hotspot above, we get the corresponding source file as shown in Figure 10. Figure 10 - Clicking the first user-function hotspot Using the Source View, we can relate the generated C code for a corresponding Python code (Line 1052-1058, corresponds to Python code). Using this data, a user can focus on a problematic piece/module of Python code identified by Intel VTune Amplifier and begin optimization. Use the Caller/Callee tab to see the caller-callee for the selected function/module (Figure 11). Figure 11 - Caller/Callee tab Summary Intel VTune Amplifier can be used to narrow down performance analysis to the specific code that is consuming more CPU time (hotspots) in Java or Python applications. This is possible for both pure Python application as well as mixed Python/Cython code.

Check Point, Huawei and other industry leaders have joined the partner ecosystem aimed at providing an integrated, connected security ecosystem that maximises customer investments in security infrastructure. The number of partner companies that already have or are developing technology integrations with the McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL) has doubled in the past year, according to Intel Security.   The announcement comes just a day after Intel Security announced that it would be opening up DXL for any organisation to use to enable real-time threat intelligence sharing between different point products in their infrastructure. McAfee DXL provides a standardised integration and communications fabric for products regardless of underlying proprietary architecture. This open security architecture enables organisations to integrate their security systems and gain visibility across their IT environment, analysing data more efficiently and yielding more available and actionable intelligence, said Intel Security. “In today’s quickly evolving threat landscape, security products that do not interact with each other not only increase operational cost, they increase risk,” said DJ Long, head of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. “By joining forces with industry leaders, the alliance is providing a truly integrated, unified security ecosystem, enabling rapid deployment, simplified management and maximised protection,” he said. The integration between McAfee DXL, McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) and Check Point firewall products is aimed at enabling intelligence sharing and workflow optimisation. Read more about Intel Security Intel Security has detailed a wave of product innovations at Focus 2016, with more to come when it is spun out as an independent company under the McAfee banner. Pure-play cyber security has real value, says incoming McAfee head Chris Young. Intel Security adjusts its channel strategy in response to a market shift towards services-based security. According to the alliance, real-time communication between these products allows customers to scale and automate their security environment to save time and resources. Huawei and Intel Security will work to provide indicators of compromise (IOC) data alerts to McAfee DXL and McAfee TIE, providing dynamic behaviour analytics and intelligence sharing to customers. The alliance also announced that Intel Security products McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) and McAfee Enterprise Security Manager (ESM) now integrate with Intel alliance partner HPE Aruba’s ClearPass product. This cross-supplier integration covers threat intelligence sharing, and automatic detection and remediation, the alliance said. In the past year, the alliance said Intel Security and alliance partner MobileIron have integrated systems to solve the key challenges of extending data protection to mobile devices, addressing mobile threat protection and unifying admin workflows and user experience between mobile and endpoint devices. It said partner customers will now have the added capability of user behaviour analytics (UBA) to accelerate attack detection and incident response, and to pinpoint anomalies in real time. UBA automates the detection of attacks and risk behaviours inside an organisation and can dramatically reduce the time and skill needed to investigate and respond to security events, the alliance said. Through their integration with McAfee ESM, alliance partners now providing UBA include CyberArk, Exabeam, Fortscale, Gurucul, Interset, Niara and Securonix.   CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

Young focused on his vision for the new company, its roadmap for achieving that, the need for rapid innovation and the importance of cross-industry collaboration. “One of the things I love about this conference is that we all come together to find ways to win, to work together,” he said. First, Young highlighted the publication of the book The Second Economy – the race for trust, treasure and time in the cyber security war. The main objective of the book is to help chief information security officers (CISOs) communicate the battles facing everyone to others in the c-suite. “So that we can recruit them into our fight. We need to enlist others on our journey if we are to be successful,” he said. Challenging assumptions The book is also aimed at encouraging information security professionals to challenge their own assumptions. “I plan to send two copies of this book to the winner of the US presidential election, because cyber security is going to be one of the most important topics they could possibly face,” said Young. “The book is about giving more people a view of the dynamism of what we face in cyber security, which is why we have to challenge our assumptions continually,” he said. “That is why we challenge our assumptions in the book as well as our assumptions about what we do every day.” Young said Intel Security had been asking thousands of customers to challenge the company’s assumptions over the past 18 months so it can improve. “This week, we are going to bring a lot of that feedback to life in the delivery of a tremendous amount of innovation across our entire portfolio,” he said. Young then used a video to underline the message that the McAfee brand is built on the belief that there is power in working together, and that no one person, product or organisation can provide total security. Read more about Intel Security There is real value in being totally focused on cyber security, according to incoming McAfee chief executive Chris Young. Intel Security adjusts its channel strategy in response to a market shift towards services-based security. Intel to raise $3.1bn by spinning off security business. Security industry needs to do more, says Intel Security head Chris Young. By enabling protection, detection and correction to work together, the company believes it can react to cyber threats faster. By linking products from different providers to work together, the company believes the security of networks becomes better. By bringing companies together to share threat intelligence, better ways can be found to protect each other. The company said cyber crime is the greatest challenge of the digital age, and this can only be overcome by working together. It revealed a new tagline: “Together is power”. The video also revealed the new independent company’s logo, which Young called a symbol of its new beginning and a visual representation of what is core to the company’s strategy. “The shield means defence, and the two interlocking components are a symbol of the togetherness we are about in the industry,” he said. “The red colour is a callback to our legacy in the industry.” Three main reasons for independence According to Young, there are three main reasons behind the decision to become an independent company. First, is to be completely focused on cyber security at a company level, solving customers’ cyber security problems and dealing with customers’ cyber security challenges. Second is innovation. “Because we are committed and dedicated to cyber security alone at company level, our innovation is centred around it,” said Young. Third is growth. “Our industry is moving faster than any other sub-segment of IT. We have to grow as quickly, if not more quickly than everything that is happening in our space,” he said. The new company will have 7,500 employees and more than $2bn in revenue with a growing profit base. “Because we are committed and dedicated to cyber security alone at company level, our innovation is centred around it” Chris Young, Intel Security “The challenges in our industry have moved on and so must we,” said Young. “We are looking forward, and will accelerate what we are doing as a new organisation so we can be better at solving security challenges in the future.” He added that in the past year, the company has invested more than $500m in research and development. Record numbers According to Young, the company also has 21% more engineers than at the start of 2016, as well as 25% more product managers and 19% more professional services staff, with another 11% to come in the next few months. “This week, we are announcing 18 new product and partner innovations – a release across every single part of our product portfolio, in addition to the integration of new partners. It is a record number of solutions and innovations for any year in this company’s history,” he said. He detailed some of these innovations, before announcing the company’s decision to make the McAfee data exchange layer (DXL) available to everyone in the industry for real-time threat intelligence sharing between different point products in their infrastructure. “We are doing this because it is the right thing for our industry in order to move forward,” he said, calling on attendees to challenge every supplier they do business with to integrate with DXL. “There are no more excuses. In the past, suppliers said they could not integrate with DXL because they first had to become members of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. But there is no excuse now. It is open. Everybody can use it,” said Young. CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

Intel acquires Voke VR as it moves into immersive sports tech Posted Nov 3, 2016 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden), Lucas Matney (@lucas_matney) 0 SHARES Next Story YouTube upgrades its comments system to give creators more control Intel has made another acquisition to build out its virtual reality strategy and business: the chip giant has acquired a startup called VOKE, which specialises in immersive sports video experiences, and counted both Intel and the Sacramento Kings among its investors. Financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed but Intel tells me that it is acquiring VOKE’s technology, talent and existing business, which included broadcasting NBA games in the U.S. and Kabaddi tournaments in India. Voke will become a part of a new division called Intel Sports Group, the company tells me. The core of VOKE’s business is a product it markets as TrueVR, which is based around a special stereoscopic camera that is used to record experiences, as well as software to then deliver it to various devices. (The camera is pictured above.) In Intel’s view, it’s the special lens and capturing system, along with the fact that the final product can be viewed on a range of devices and through different channels (Internet, broadcast, etc) that is what attracted Intel. “VOKE’s technology lets fans be where the action is without ever leaving their living rooms,” said James Carwana, GM of the Intel Sports Group, in a statement. Notably, the VR experiences can be delivered live, which opens up an interesting market for how VR could be used in a number of real-time, mass market use cases. Sports, with its focus on action and close-up visuals, is an obvious end point for VR technology, and Intel has been positioning itself as a large player in the latter market as it looks to find a place in newer, emerging areas to offset declines in its legacy business. So it’s no surprise to know that Intel has been wedging itself into a number of sports-related activities in recent times. They have included the X-Games in Aspen and the NBA All-Star Weekend. The new Intel Sports division will also include its freeD technology team, which joined Intel when the company acquired Replay Technologies earlier this year. “We’re making great progress bringing innovative technology and amazing experiences to the world of sports, but there’s more to come,” Carwana notes. Intel has some pretty ambitious goals when it comes to bringing immersive sports entertainment to people’s living rooms. VOKE and Replay Technologies will be a big part of that. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich spoke to TechCrunch recently about his goals for taking the massive amount of 3D data from Replay and turning it into an immersive live sports experience for fans. “Right now we have about a two-minute delay between when the [Replay data] comes off the field and when we can finish the stitching,” Krzanich told TechCrunch. “We think in two, maybe two-and-a-half years, we can get it down so that there’s milliseconds of latency and we can compress the files such that it’s more easily managed.” With that in mind, he says, you could create an entire 3D stitch of the stadium, and a viewer could capture the perspective of the game from anywhere. Companies like NextVR are already setting up stereoscopic camera rigs on the sidelines to give viewers points-of-view they wouldn’t normally have, but with this tech Krzanich hopes viewers can one day jump right into the play or watch the game straight from the players’ bench. Voke, which was founded back in 2004, had only disclosed $12.5 million in funding, with other investors in addition to Intel and the Kings including A&E Television Networks LLC, Nautilus Ventures, F50 and the Cowles Company. Other recent Intel acquisitions in the VR space have included computer vision specialists Itseez and Movidius. The company has acquired some 83 companies to date. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase VOKE Founded 2012 Overview VOKE is at the forefront of Virtual Reality based viewing of real events and on-demand media.

Check Point*, Huawei* and other industry-leading companies have joined the Intel Security Innovation Alliance to provide a truly integrated, connected security ecosystem that maximizes the investment customers are making in their cybersecurity infrastructure. One year ago, at its FOCUS 15 event, Intel Security unveiled a new strategy emphasizing an integrated, open security system powered by a connected architecture across Intel Security and third-party products alike. Since that time, the Intel Security Innovation Alliance has executed on that strategy, doubling the number of partner companies that have existing, or are developing, technology integrations with McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL). » View the Intel Security FOCUS 16 press kit McAfee DXL provides a standardized integration and communications fabric for products regardless of underlying proprietary architecture. This open security architecture enables customers to integrate their solutions and gain visibility across their IT environment, analyzing data more efficiently and yielding more available and actionable intelligence. In todays quickly evolving threat landscape, security products that do not interact with each other not only increase operational cost, they increase risk, said D.J. Long, head of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. By joining forces with industry leaders, the Intel Security Innovation Alliance is providing a truly integrated, unified security ecosystem, enabling rapid deployment, simplified management and maximized protection. Key new Intel Security Innovation Alliance highlights include: Check Point  The integration between McAfee DXL, McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) and Check Point firewall products enables intelligence sharing and workflow optimization. Real-time communication between these products allows customers to scale and automate their security environment, thereby saving time and resources. HP Enterprise Aruba*  Intel Security products McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) and McAfee Enterprise Security Manager (ESM) now integrate with Intel Security Innovation Alliance partner HPE Aruba product ClearPass*. This cross-vendor integration covers two dimensions in the latest advanced security protection paradigm: threat intelligence sharing, and automatic detection and remediation. Huawei  Together, Huawei and Intel Security will work to provide indicators of compromise (IOC) data alerts to McAfee DXL and McAfee TIE, providing dynamic behavior analytics and intelligence sharing to customers. MobileIron*  FOCUS 16 marks the one-year anniversary of the Intel Security and MobileIron partnership through the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. In the past year, the companies have integrated solutions to solve three key issues facing the enterprise today: extending data protection to mobile devices, addressing mobile threat protection, and unifying admin workflows and user experience between mobile and endpoint devices. Through the Intel Security Innovation Alliance customers will now have the added capability of user behavior analytics (UBA). Security professionals now can deploy a new wave of UBA products to accelerate attack detection and incident response and pinpoint anomalies in real time. UBA automates the detection of attacks and risk behaviors inside an organization and can dramatically reduce the time and skill needed to investigate and respond to security events. Through their integration with McAfee ESM Intel Security Innovation Alliance partners now providing UBA include CyberArk*, Exabeam*, Fortscale*, Gurucul*, Interset*, Niara* and Securonix*.

By Liam Tung | November 3, 2016 -- 13:26 GMT (06:26 PDT) | Topic: Mobility The Eve community has designed its dream Window 10 machine, the Eve V. Image: Eve The makers of the community-designed Eve V have detailed more specs for its forthcoming Windows 10 2-in-1. The Finnish company's latest spec sheet for the Eve V promises a 12.3-inch display hybrid tablet-laptop powered by Intel's seventh-generation core processors. Last month Eve said its Eve V project had received backing from Intel and later this month it will kick off a campaign on Indiegogo, seeking backers to help pay for manufacturing costs. The device will be configurable with 8GB or 16GB RAM, and 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage. It will also feature a fingerprint sensor built into the power button that is compatible with Windows Hello biometric authentication. According to Eve, this design decision is to allow the fingerprint reader to function when the tablet is detached. Better than Microsoft's Surface Pro? Here's the Windows 10 2-in-1 being built on public opinion Canvassing users for their feature wishlist before you build a machine is an unusual step -- but it's at the heart of the approach adopted by Finnish startup Eve Tech. Read More Eve initially aimed for Intel's sixth-generation CPUs, but following Intel's investment it has upgraded the design to accommodate the latest generation. These chips include the Intel Core m3-7Y30 processor with a clock speed of up to 2.6GHz, the Core i5-7Y54 with a speed of up to 3.2GHz, and the Core i7-7Y75 offering up to 3.6GHz. Other sensors that Eve plans to add to the convertible include a Hall proximity sensor, gravity sensor, light sensor, and gyroscope. While it also intends to add GPS, it's concerned the aluminum body will impact GPS functionality. "Since Eve V has aluminum unibody enclosure, we can't say yet for sure will the GPS work properly in the Wi-Fi model. What we can promise is that in the LTE model it would work. We just don't know when the LTE model would be available," the firm writes. While it is postponing the LTE version, Eve says some telcos have shown interest in that model. Eve is still hashing out the exact design for the LTE model, again due to the metal frame's impact on antennas. "We need to create a new aluminum enclosure to introduce the LTE model. It has to house an additional plastic area for the LTE antennae to pick up the signal efficiently. Naturally, the casing would also have to feature the extra slot for the sim card," it explains. Only a small batch of 500 Eve V laptops will be available during the fund-raiser, which kicks off on November 21.

Check Point*, Huawei* and other industry-leading companies have joined the Intel Security Innovation Alliance to provide a truly integrated, connected security ecosystem that maximizes the investment customers are making in their cybersecurity infrastructure. One year ago, at its FOCUS 15 event, Intel Security unveiled a new strategy emphasizing an integrated, open security system powered by a connected architecture across Intel Security and third-party products alike. Since that time, the Intel Security Innovation Alliance has executed on that strategy, doubling the number of partner companies that have existing, or are developing, technology integrations with McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL). McAfee DXL provides a standardized integration and communications fabric for products regardless of underlying proprietary architecture. This open security architecture enables customers to integrate their solutions and gain visibility across their IT environment, analyzing data more efficiently and yielding more available and actionable intelligence. “In today’s quickly evolving threat landscape, security products that do not interact with each other not only increase operational cost, they increase risk,” said D.J. Long, head of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. “By joining forces with industry leaders, the Intel Security Innovation Alliance is providing a truly integrated, unified security ecosystem, enabling rapid deployment, simplified management and maximized protection.” Key new Intel Security Innovation Alliance highlights include: Check Point – The integration between McAfee DXL, McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) and Check Point firewall products enables intelligence sharing and workflow optimization. Real-time communication between these products allows customers to scale and automate their security environment, thereby saving time and resources. HP Enterprise Aruba * – Intel Security products McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) and McAfee Enterprise Security Manager (ESM) now integrate with Intel Security Innovation Alliance partner HPE Aruba product ClearPass*. This cross-vendor integration covers two dimensions in the latest advanced security protection paradigm: threat intelligence sharing, and automatic detection and remediation. Huawei – Together, Huawei and Intel Security will work to provide indicators of compromise (IOC) data alerts to McAfee DXL and McAfee TIE, providing dynamic behavior analytics and intelligence sharing to customers. MobileIron * – FOCUS 16 marks the one-year anniversary of the Intel Security and MobileIron partnership through the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. In the past year, the companies have integrated solutions to solve three key issues facing the enterprise today: extending data protection to mobile devices, addressing mobile threat protection, and unifying admin workflows and user experience between mobile and endpoint devices. Through the Intel Security Innovation Alliance customers will now have the added capability of user behavior analytics (UBA). Security professionals now can deploy a new wave of UBA products to accelerate attack detection and incident response and pinpoint anomalies in real time. UBA automates the detection of attacks and risk behaviors inside an organization and can dramatically reduce the time and skill needed to investigate and respond to security events. Through their integration with McAfee ESM Intel Security Innovation Alliance partners now providing UBA include CyberArk*,Exabeam*, Fortscale*, Gurucul*, Interset*, Niara* and Securonix*.

Appealing to women’s “help gene” could be very helpful in attracting them to cyber security, said Celeste Fralick, adding that it is important to engage girls as young as possible on the opportunities that exist. “Schools have an important role to play in ensuring that girls feel comfortable taking subjects traditionally regarded as being mainly for boys, such as maths and science,” said Lisa Depew. “When there are only one or two girls in a maths class, schools need to ensure that they do not feel isolated and alone, and it can be challenging to get girls through that at a time in their lives when they are going through so many changes. But if we lose them at that point, it is difficult to get them back,” she said. Educating girls and women is only part of the solution, said Depew. “We also have to change security culture in organisations to ensure that there are incentives for women to join and that it is easier for women to see and take up the opportunities,” she said. “Generally there is no obvious incentive, and the perception again is that cyber security is purely technical, but we have to show that it is also about working creatively and working collaboratively in teams to solve problems, said Depew. Grindstaff advised recruiters to use their professional networks to raise the awareness of the profession and to identify potential candidates in other professions or other parts of the business. Inclusive environments Even when women are able to overcome the barriers to working in cyber security, the panel said another common problem is ensuring that they remain in the profession. Retention is almost as great a challenge as attracting them in the first place, they said. Once again, it is a cultural challenge inside organisations, said Depew. “Many organisations are failing to understand what motivates the people in their cyber security teams and consequently failing to keep them because they are not made to feel as if they are valuable members of the team,” she said. Organisations need to pay more attention to creating a more inclusive environment, said Grindstaff. “It is not only important to manage external perceptions of the profession, but also to work internally to change people’s ideas of what kinds of people can do well in cyber security,” she said. For example, Fralick said she had been recruited into cyber security by Grindstaff who saw her potential because of her skills in analytics. “I have a PhD in biomedical engineering, but Lynda [Grindstaff] helped me to realise that my skills were portable and that I could learn everything I needed to know about cyber security,” she said. Read more about women and information security Women remain under-represented in the information security workforce, yet represent a talent resource that the industry should tap into, a report has revealed. At RSA Conference 2015, Cloudmark’s Angela Knox discussed how she started a career in InfoSec and how the security industry can appeal to women like her. Female information security professionals say the industry needs to do more to not only encourage women to pursue infosec careers, but also help mentor them along the way. Facebook’s director of security operations says women can have successful careers in information security, and more diversity can help shift the playing field toward security defenders rather than attackers. On the question of skills retention, Fralick said it is important – particularly with younger recruits – to ensure that they have the freedom they need so that they do not become bored or frustrated. “There is so much to learn and to explore, but we need to think about giving young recruits the freedom they need to keep them interested,” she said. Fralick said although the gender bias is beginning to fade, she said it is still mainly up to women to take the first step to becoming accepted by their male colleagues. “I still read the sports page simply so that I can keep a dialogue going with my male colleagues. I still need to be mindful of being inclusive of them and not to expect them to be inclusive of me,” she said. CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

Home Industry Companies TAG Heuer invades Apple’s home turf with office in Silicon Valley TAG Heuer invades Apple’s home turf with office in Silicon Valley TAG Heuer will open an office in Silicon Valley, marking the first time a big Swiss watchmaker has expanded into the cradle of the U.S. technology sector and cementing its smartwatch alliance with Google and Intel Corp. By: Bloomberg | Published: November 3, 2016 4:33 PM The move shows how the Swiss have battled back against Apple Inc.’s encroachment into the market for fancy timepieces. (Source: Reuters) TAG Heuer will open an office in Silicon Valley, marking the first time a big Swiss watchmaker has expanded into the cradle of the U.S. technology sector and cementing its smartwatch alliance with Google and Intel Corp.The office, which opened Nov. 1 and is located on Intel’s campus in Santa Clara, California, will house about a dozen research and development employees, according to Chief Executive Officer Jean-Claude Biver. TAG Heuer also hired Intel’s Tom Foldesi to lead its smartwatch program, tasked with setting up labs and product teams. The move shows how the Swiss have battled back against Apple Inc.’s encroachment into the market for fancy timepieces. TAG Heuer sold out all of the 60,000 smartwatches it produced this year, at $1,500 a pop. The LVMH unit plans to sell some 150,000 pieces of an advanced smartwatch that should go on sale in April. “We want to have our finger on the pulse,” Biver said in an interview. “In Switzerland, we’re where everything is happening in the traditional watchmaking industry. We believe in the future of connected watches, so we have to go where they’re being developed.” The Silicon Valley office also makes it easier to recruit smartwatch specialists and be close to startups that the company might acquire, he added. Early concerns that the Apple Watch’s arrival in 2014 would threaten the Swiss watch industry as a whole didn’t materialize, though it has hurt sales of lower-priced timepieces. Brands such as Montblanc and TAG Heuer went on the offensive by introducing electronic functions of their own. TAG Heuer’s model gives consumers the option of paying a fee to trade it in for a mechanical version once it’s out of date. “The connected watch will definitely be a permanent part of the TAG Heuer brand,” Biver said. The label is selling a $9,900 18-carat rose gold version of its smartwatch for the Christmas season and is working on offering a collection with various sizes, materials and price segments. The announcement comes just two months after Apple discontinued its $17,000 18-karat gold version of the Apple Watch. Failing to gain much of a foothold in the luxury watch segment, Apple has now pushed more into fitness functions. Still, Apple was the second-best selling watch brand in the world by revenue last year, behind Rolex, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in September. Foldesi will report to Guy Semon, TAG Heuer’s head of research and development. He previously held various executive positions at Intel, where he also helped develop wearables.

By Corinne Gretler. Added by Agency Staff on 3 November 2016. Saved under Top, World Tags: Apple, Guy Semon, Jean-Claude Biver, Tag Heuer, Tim Cook Tweet The Tag Heuer Connected Rose Gold smartwatch Tag Heuer has openen an office in Silicon Valley, marking the first time a big Swiss watch maker has expanded into the cradle of the US technology sector and cementing its smartwatch alliance with Google and Intel. The office, which opened on 1 November and is located on Intel’s campus in Santa Clara, California, will house about a dozen research and development employees, according to CEO Jean-Claude Biver. Tag Heuer also hired Intel’s Tom Foldesi to lead its smartwatch programme, tasked with setting up labs and product teams. The move shows how the Swiss have battled back against Apple’s encroachment into the market for fancy timepieces. Tag Heuer sold out all of the 60 000 smartwatches it produced this year, at US$1 500 (about R20 000) a pop. The LVMH unit plans to sell some 150 000 pieces of an advanced smartwatch that should go on sale in April. “We want to have our finger on the pulse,” Biver said in an interview. “In Switzerland, we’re where everything is happening in the traditional watch making industry. We believe in the future of connected watches, so we have to go where they’re being developed.” The Silicon Valley office also makes it easier to recruit smartwatch specialists and be close to start-ups that the company might acquire, he added. Early concerns that the Apple Watch’s arrival in 2014 would threaten the Swiss watch industry as a whole didn’t materialise, though it has hurt sales of lower-priced timepieces. Brands such as Montblanc and Tag Heuer went on the offensive by introducing electronic functions of their own. Tag Heuer’s model gives consumers the option of paying a fee to trade it in for a mechanical version once it’s out of date. “The connected watch will definitely be a permanent part of the TAG Heuer brand,” Biver said. The label is selling a $9 900 (R134 000) 18-carat rose gold version of its smartwatch for the Christmas season and is working on offering a collection with various sizes, materials and price segments. The announcement comes just two months after Apple discontinued its $17 000 (R230 000) 18-carat gold version of the Apple Watch. Failing to gain much of a foothold in the luxury watch segment, Apple has now pushed more into fitness functions. Still, Apple was the second-best selling watch brand in the world by revenue last year, behind Rolex, CEO Tim Cook said in September. Foldesi will report to Guy Semon, Tag Heuer’s head of research and development. He previously held various executive positions at Intel, where he also helped develop wearables.  — (c) 2016 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 13Social media analysis pointing to Trump upset 10Brian Molefe quits as Eskom CEO 9Vodacom to launch VOD platform 9New ICT BEE code comes into force 8Trouble brewing in Android land Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

The addition of the Touch Bar, that strip of touch sensitive OLED panel just above the keyboard, is something innovative for sure. But then, Apple went ahead and did a typically Apple thing – dumped all standardised ports in favour of four USB Type C Thunderbolt 3.0 ports. This has certainly not gone down well with a lot of professionals. Apple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc — Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 Like someone joked on Twitter, Apple’s fastest growing product category are its 17 adapters. Sure, the USB Type C port keeps future proofing in mind, but the dropping of USB Type A ports and an SD card slot are just ridiculous moves. Professional photographers who shoot a lot and want to quickly transfer images onto their MacBook Pro computers will have to get another adapter to transfer content from SD cards now. And yes, even though a lot of cameras support Wi-Fi image transfer, we all know how terribly annoying that process is. Dropping of ports aside, the entry barrier to the new MacBook Pros is quite high. The 13-inch base model, with Touch Bar, will start at Rs 1,55,900. Add in the cost of the adapters, you would need to go with these new MacBook Pros and you are looking at quite a high cost of ownership. And as we well know, Apple adapter don’t really come cheap. Investing in a 2015 MBP For those on the fence regarding investing in a brand new MacBook Pro, at their current price points, it is understandable. Not everyone is a Photoshop expert, a DJ or an FCP meister. A lot of MacBook Pro users are people who just want a powerful macOS based laptop. If you have a functioning older MacBook Pro, it just make sense to wait it out. As analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has pointed out, Apple MacBook Pro prices are expected to drop in 2017. And there are expected to be upgrades in the form of 32GB RAM and 7th generation Intel Core series processor. If your current Mac is over 3-4 years old and you are keen on just investing in a new MacBook Pro, then it makes more sense to go for the 2015 MBPs rather than the new ones. The top end 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display comes with a 4th gen Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD and you get an optional AMD card variant as well. It costs almost Rs 40,000 cheaper and it has all the ports you will need, so you save up on adapter costs. If you are looking for Windows based alternatives to the MacBook Pro, then here is a list of laptops you should be looking at. Sure, none of these come with something like a Touch Bar. Many may not even have a dedicated graphics processor. But they certainly offer a better value proposition than the new MacBook Pros. More importantly, you will not have to invest separately in multiple adapter accessories. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Although this a generation old, the Surface Pro 4 along with the Surface Type cover and Surface Pen, makes for a great alternative to the MacBook Pro. It features an excellent build quality, responsive keyboard, along with all the ports you may need to get work done. The 12.3-inch IPS LCD PixelSense display has a high resolution 2736 x 1824 pixel resolution with a 3:2 aspect ratio. This works out to a pixel density of around 267 ppi. We reviewed the base model that is selling in India, which houses the 6th generation Intel Core i5 6300U and is a dual-core, hyper-threaded part clocked at 2.5GHz. It comes with an Intel HD 520 graphics solution. The processor is paired with 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD storage. You can go for the higher end Core i7 variant as well. Other alternative to the Surface Pro 4 is the Surface Book, which has been refreshed now with longer battery life and more powerful specs. Only issue is that it doesn’t officially sell in India. Dell XPS 13 This was one of the best looking laptops we tested this year. Coming in a compact size despite its 13-inch form factor, the Dell XPS 13 packs in quite a punch. It houses a 6th gen Intel Core i7 6500U with Intel HD 520 graphics, 8GB RAM, 256GB NVMe SSD. In terms of ports and slots, you get two USB 3.0 ports, a mini displayport (USB Type-C based thunderbolt also available), an SD card reader, a 3.5mm combo jack and a Kensington lock port. There is also soft button on the left edge to check the battery status without having to open the lid. One of the USB ports is always on, which means you can charge USB based devices like a smartphone. Lenovo Yoga 900 Shown above is a Lenovo Yoga 900. Lenovo has been innovating on its Yoga series of products to an extent where event the ThinkPad lineup has a Yoga notebook. The Yoga 900 is Lenovo’s current flagship in its consumer segment of laptops. Yoga means the laptop can be used in a multi-mode arrangement. The Yoga 900 ultrabook measures just around 15mm thick when the lid is closed and weighs a mere 1.27kg. The Yoga 900 is powered by an Intel Core i7 6500U, a dual-core hyper-threaded CPU which has a base clock speed of 2.5GHz and a turbo boost frequency of 3.1GHz. It comes with 8GB RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. The 13.3-inch display has a 3200 x 1800 pixel QuadHD+ resolution. There are downward firing JBL Stereo speakers with Home Theatre certification. Coming to the ports, on the right hand side you have the USB 3.0 port at the top, followed by the 3.5mm audio jack, rotation lock key, reset button and the power button which has an inbuilt LED indicator. On the left hand side there the power port at the top followed by another USB 3.0 port, a USB Type C port with video out and finally an SD card reader. Acer Aspire S13 Acer’s Aspire S13 was easily one of the surprises this year. In our testing, we found it to be one of the best Windows ultrabooks out there. The hardware choice for the Acer Aspire is very sensible. You get a 15W Intel Core i7 6500U processor clocked at 2.5GHz (dual-core with HT), 8GB LPDDR3 RAM and a 512GB SSD. The screen resolution is a bit low at 1920×1080, but it’s enough for a 13.3-inch screen. You get two USB 3.0 ports, one on each side, a USB Type-C 3.1 port and HDMI output. You also get an SD card reader and 802.11ac Wi-Fi with MU-MIMO support, which is to be expected in this day and age. It is light-weight and high performance laptop, which can be your daily driver. HP Spectre  Image: IANS This is one the most gorgeous looking laptops out there. HP claims that it’s the world’s thinnest laptop and at 10mm thickness, it is difficult to argue. But despite the slim profile it packs in some high end goodies such as an Intel Core i7 6500U processor with 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD storage and Windows 10 Pro out of the box. There are two USB Type C Thunderbolt 3.0 ports and one USB Type C port for charging. But unlike the new MacBook Pros, HP bundles in the necessary adapters for USB, HDMI and Ethernet port. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon For a business user who does not have much need for the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon makes for a great alternative. ThinkPad X1 Carbon comes with an Intel Core i5 6300U with vPro features and Intel HD520 graphics. It clocked at 2.4GHz and is paired with 8GB of RAM. It also supports security features that are important in an IT setup, such as the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) encryption. It comes with 192GB Samsung M.2 SSD storage. In terms of connectivity, you get Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, 3x USB 3.0 port, 1x HDMI port, 1x miniDP, a microSIM card and more. It has an impressive battery life and really good standby time for a Windows laptop. So there you have it, some Windows laptops you can consider if you are not really convinced about the new MacBook Pros. Do let us know if you think we missed out on any.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 2, 2016 at 9:38PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) operates in many different product segments, spanning personal computers to data centers to different types of Internet of Things devices. And within those segments, the company builds several products to serve a range of customer demands. That's why it can be quite difficult to single out an Intel product line -- generally a processor or family of processors -- as being the company's "best" release each year. However, within the company's broad portfolio of products, there are clearly those that are much more important to its financial results today and its prospects tomorrow. Of all the product families that Intel launched in 2016, there was one that was noteworthy -- the 10-core Core i7 6950X Extreme Edition processor. A $1,723 processor for gamers and enthusiasts The Core i7 6950X chip arrived as part of a family of processors commonly referred to by their code name, Broadwell-E. The Broadwell-E family of chips is targeted at what Intel refers to as the high-end desktop market, which consists of gamers and other personal-computer users who want as much processor power as they can get. Image source: Intel.  Intel priced this chip at an eye-popping $1,723, making it one of the most expensive consumer-grade processors the company has released in recent years. Looking back to 1997, Intel's 300MHz Pentium II processor was priced at $1,981 -- or just shy of $3,000 today, adjusted for inflation. The launch of this chip, particularly at its price point, smacked of putting out a "feeler" for whether there would be much of a market for such an expensive consumer-grade chip. Going by comments from CEO Brian Krzanich in July, sales of the 10-core chip in the months following its launch were "much better than what even [Intel] anticipated." So it would appear that there is, indeed, real demand for such a processor.  Why this product was so important It's hard to imagine that the revenue impact from this single product would be enough to move the needle for a behemoth like Intel. Even at very high average selling prices and probably excellent margins, the absolute volumes are just too low to have a big impact. Nevertheless, the success of this product relative to Intel's expectations probably has the company seriously considering putting more effort into building high-end products specifically tailored for gamers and other personal-computer enthusiasts. For some context, Intel has made it clear that its sales of gaming and enthusiast-related processors continue to enjoy "double-digit" percentage year-over-year growth rates. By focusing on this market more, the company might be able to accelerate unit growth there through even better products -- as well as revenue and average selling prices -- by introducing even higher-end processors within a given gaming-focused product line. Runner-up? Knights Landing A very close second to the Core i7 6950X Extreme Edition gaming chip was Intel's second-generation of Xeon Phi processors, commonly referred to by their code name, Knights Landing. These chips were targeted at high-performance computing and deep-learning applications. Intel's prior-generation Xeon Phi processors saw some traction in the marketplace, but the second generation of products launched early in 2016 look much more competitive. That hypothesis is seemingly verified by the fact that Krzanich told investors back in July that during the first half of 2016, shipments of its second-generation Xeon Phi processors were up eight times relative to the total number of first-generation Xeon Phi chips that Intel sold during the full year of 2015. But just like the Core i7 6950X Extreme Edition, robust sales of the second-generation Xeon Phi processors won't dramatically move the needle for Intel, as the revenue base from which sales growth is occurring is quite low. However, that early success should give the company more confidence to invest in future iterations of the product line. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Intel, Netflix, Apple And The Power And Influence Of Sonic Branding Forbes 03/11/2016 Jordan Passman, Contributor © Provided by Forbes Media LLC (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg) Twenty-two years ago, three seconds of audio comprised of five musical notes was written to help a tech brand with its marketing. Today, you can’t think of Intel without hearing the iconic “Intel Inside Bong.” You’ve heard it so many times, even with different variations, but the core five note progression is always the same. How can something so simple be so effective? Well, when you really examine Intel’s use of the mnemonic, you realize that it’s hugely associated with its brand, and its success. What you hear are adjectives that the company wants you to associate with Intel: A modern, trustworthy, sleek, intelligent, simple and efficient brand. According to Walter Werzowa, the composer of the Intel theme, the mnemonic is worth millions of dollars, which shouldn’t be surprising to anybody. Werzowa worked closely with Intel to craft the theme in 1994 - today, it’s older than most college students! I reached out to Yogiraj Graham, Director of Production for Intel Global Production Labs, who explained, “The Intel bong is one of the most powerful assets we have. We’re always looking for ways to showcase the amazing experiences that Intel enables, and the Intel bong sound helps keep our messaging consistent.” Apple is another brand that has prioritized crafting beautiful sounds for their users to associate with their experience. Whether you are scrolling through the soothing sounds of your Apple TV on a lazy Sunday, rebooting your computer at work or receiving a highly-anticipated text message, you are met with pleasant and carefully thought out sonic branding. Netflix has also done an amazing job with their logo mnemonic, which I’ve heard is a nod to Frank Underwood’s infamous double table knock in House of Cards. There are so many more–AOL’s “You’ve Got Mail,” the McDonald’s “I’m Lovin’ It,” Nationwide’s “Nationwide is on your side,” the THX “Deep Note,” NBC’s “Chimes”—all are powerful examples of logo branding. With a mention of the name, you can hear the brand. According to the Harvard Business Review, research presented at the 2012 Audio Branding Congress showed that “congruent sound cues can increase the speed of a visual search for products (a key for success in both online and retail settings), as well as improve the perceived taste of food and wine.” In addition, “the strategic use of sound can play an important role in positively differentiating a product or service, enhancing recall, creating preference, building trust, and even increasing sales.” In a world where every company feels the mandatory importance of visual logos, you have to wonder why there are still plenty of brands that don’t take advantage of this incredible branding tool. One hurdle is that the process of creating your own sound and logo mnemonic can be challenging and expensive for brands. If you’re not confident with music/sound direction, it may be much easier to pick apart what isn’t working, rather than creating your own brief for a composer to work with. This is why industry leaders attempt to simplify the process. If you can speak in your native language about the general marketing strategy for your company and how you want to be portrayed, a great sonic branding firm can translate that into sound. Experts in the industry close deals up to the high six figures for their professional services. A package often includes the core melody (let’s use the five notes from Intel, for example) and then additional versions with various instrumentations for different moods (an acoustic version, an electronic version, a full version, a simplified version etc.). The mnemonic must be built to scale, from massive stadiums or to a mobile device, the quality must be exceptional. So how can you keep a long-standing mnemonic fresh? Earlier this year, in collaboration with ad agency mcgarrybowen (music production by Jerry Krenach & Jean Scofield), Intel launched a global TV spot using an inventive musical adaptation created by the mnemonic legend himself, Werzowa.  According to Graham, “With a mixture of pride and humility, [Werzowa] once said to me, ‘The Intel bong is the emperor of Mnemonics.’  I think he’s right.  We hold it dear and recognize its power.  The piece of music he created for our campaign brought together Beethoven’s  5th symphony and the sound of the Intel bong.  The desire was for people to hear those 5 notes in a completely new way.  The result was extraordinary.” Hear it below: Will you or your company inspire the next “Intel Inside” logo mnemonic?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 2, 2016 at 9:38PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) operates in many different product segments, spanning personal computers to data centers to different types of Internet of Things devices. And within those segments, the company builds several products to serve a range of customer demands. That's why it can be quite difficult to single out an Intel product line -- generally a processor or family of processors -- as being the company's "best" release each year. However, within the company's broad portfolio of products, there are clearly those that are much more important to its financial results today and its prospects tomorrow. Of all the product families that Intel launched in 2016, there was one that was noteworthy -- the 10-core Core i7 6950X Extreme Edition processor. A $1,723 processor for gamers and enthusiasts The Core i7 6950X chip arrived as part of a family of processors commonly referred to by their code name, Broadwell-E. The Broadwell-E family of chips is targeted at what Intel refers to as the high-end desktop market, which consists of gamers and other personal-computer users who want as much processor power as they can get. Image source: Intel.  Intel priced this chip at an eye-popping $1,723, making it one of the most expensive consumer-grade processors the company has released in recent years. Looking back to 1997, Intel's 300MHz Pentium II processor was priced at $1,981 -- or just shy of $3,000 today, adjusted for inflation. The launch of this chip, particularly at its price point, smacked of putting out a "feeler" for whether there would be much of a market for such an expensive consumer-grade chip. Going by comments from CEO Brian Krzanich in July, sales of the 10-core chip in the months following its launch were "much better than what even [Intel] anticipated." So it would appear that there is, indeed, real demand for such a processor.  Why this product was so important It's hard to imagine that the revenue impact from this single product would be enough to move the needle for a behemoth like Intel.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 4, 2016 at 5:45PM When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its latest 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro computers, there were some potential buyers who were completely put off by the prices. The base model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar runs $1,799, and the base 15-inch MacBook Pro runs a cool $2,399. Apple's new MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple.  These are clearly high-priced, premium systems. However, there's a difference between an overpriced product and an expensive one. The former is a product that doesn't deliver the value that its price tag suggests, while the latter is simply a product with a high price. And the latest MacBook Pro computers, although expensive, are not really overpriced.  Head-to-head: Spectre x360 vs. 13-inch MacBook Pro To give you a sense of the value offered by the 13-inch MacBook Pro (with Touch Bar), I'll compare it with HP's (NYSE:HPQ) premium Windows-based Spectre x360 laptop. (A similar comparison should be possible for the 15-inch MacBook Pro and a suitable Windows-based alternative.) The latter has gotten very good reviews, with Laptop Magazine calling it "the convertible laptop to beat." In the table below, I've put the specifications of a "maxed-out" Spectre x360 side by side with a similarly configured 13-inch MacBook Pro, pulled from HP's and Apple's respective websites -- and for some of the MacBook Pro details, AnandTech:   Spectre x360  13-inch MacBook Pro w/Touch Bar  Processor Core i7-7500U Core i7-6567U Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel Iris Graphics 550 Display 1920 x 1080 IPS, touch-enabled 2560 x 1600 IPS, non-touch Memory 16GB LPDDR3-1600 16GB LPDDR3-2133 Storage 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD 512GB PCIe-based SSD Expansion ports 2x USB Type-C, 1 USB 3.1 Gen 1, 1 headphone/microphone combo 4x Thunderbolt 3 ports Wireless connectivity 802.11ac (2x2) and Bluetooth 4.0 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 Trackpad HP Imagepad Force Touch trackpad Battery capacity 57.8 Wh 49.2 Wh Weight 2.85 lbs 3.02 lbs Price (as configured) $1,299 $2,499 Source: HP, Apple, AnandTech. There's no beating around the bush -- the HP system is about half as expensive as the MacBook Pro system. However, if we walk through each of these specifications and closely compare the two systems, it becomes clear that, at the very least, the premium that Apple charges is directly related to component costs. Let's do just that. The tricky processor comparison First, let's look at the processor and graphics technologies in each system. Although the Apple system uses an older sixth-generation Core processor while the HP uses a newer seventh-generation Core processor, the chip inside of the MacBook is faster. The processor architectures of the i7-7500U and i7-6567U are identical, meaning that, at a given frequency, these two chips will perform the same. The main advantage of the seventh-generation Core processors is that they are built on a newer version of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) 14-nanometer process, which should allow the seventh-generation Core processors to run at higher speeds than the sixth-generation Core processors, all else being equal. The 6567U has two processor cores that run at 3.3GHz base and can turbo to 3.6GHz. The 7500U has two processor cores that run at 2.7GHz, but can turbo to 3.5GHz. It's likely, then, that in CPU tasks, it's a wash between these two. In terms of graphics architecture, once again, the sixth-generation Core and seventh-generation Core processors are virtually the same. However, the chip inside of the MacBook Pro uses Intel's higher-performance Iris graphics -- more graphics cores, dedicated eDRAM memory built into the chip package -- so I would expect that in graphics tasks, the MacBook Pro chip will have a clear edge in graphics tasks over the chip inside of the Spectre x360. The trade-off that Apple is likely making by using a chip with Iris graphics is that it's certainly more expensive to manufacture than a similar chip without Iris graphics. The size of the main processor is larger, and the Iris parts include a fairly large on-package memory manufactured in Intel's 22-nanometer logic process.  Intel almost certainly charges more for chips that cost more to make, adding to Apple's bill-of-materials costs relative to HP's.  The display comparison Moving beyond the processor, the HP system has a 1920-by-1080 resolution IPS display, while the MacBook Pro has a higher resolution 2560-by-1600 resolution IPS display. The display on the MacBook should be sharper. The comparison doesn't end there, though. The display on the MacBook Pro supports the much wider DCI-P3 color gamut, while tests performed by NotebookCheck show that the display on the HP fails to fully cover even the narrower sRGB color gamut. Finally, per NotebookCheck, the average brightness of the display found on the Spectre x360 is 318.6 nits. The site found the average brightness on the new 13-inch MacBook Pro display to be 563.6 nits. Apple's machine has a sharper, brighter, and more colorful display. HP's, on the other hand, supports touch input while Apple's doesn't.  Comparing everything else As far as memory and storage go, both have 16GB of LPDDR3 memory and 512GB of storage. However, it's worth pointing out that the MacBook Pro, as configured, uses faster 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory while the Spectre uses slower 1600MHz LPDDR3. 9to5Mac also points out, citing Computer World, that the new MacBook Pro systems are around "two years ahead of most of its competition" in terms of solid-state drive speeds. The MacBook Pro is slightly heavier, but they're both in roughly the same weight class. The Apple system uses a Force Touch trackpad, while HP's system uses what it dubs an HP Imagepad. And finally, the MacBook includes an OLED touch bar with Touch ID support, while HP's system doesn't. Distinguishing price from value Apple's new MacBook is clearly an expensive system, but across the board, it appears to offer more features and better performance than the newest Spectre x360 -- a top Windows notebook. This isn't an attempt to disparage HP's Spectre x360 -- it has received extremely positive reviews from many reputable outlets, and is frankly a very attractive Windows-based machine. The point of this comparison is to show that Apple crams in a lot of things here and there that might not individually mean much to potential customers, but ultimately serve to enhance the user experience. Engineering often consists of making smart trade-offs that balance cool features against cost structure. Apple's new MacBook computers traded off price in order to build extremely feature-rich products. HP, on the other hand, did what it could within a system that it could sell for $1,300, which, frankly, is quite high for a consumer Windows-based notebook.  We'll get a better idea of how receptive customers are to Apple's choices vis-a-vis the new MacBook Pro computers when the company reports its financial results in January.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Business Technology Is Google Fiber going wireless for the last mile? Google Fiber has paused the rollout of new cities for its high speed Internet service while its explores other technology options. Reuters Google Fiber has paused the roll-out of its high speed Internet in new markets including San Diego while it explores other technology options such as wireless. Google Fiber has paused the roll-out of its high speed Internet in new markets including San Diego while it explores other technology options such as wireless. (Reuters) Mike FreemanContact Reporter A key hurdle to widespread gigabit-speed Internet is the high cost of getting fiber optic lines over the last mile -- from the fiber backbone in nearby streets to each house. But increasingly, cellular operators, broadband providers including Google Fiber and several startups are exploring a new, less expensive way to bridge the last mile gap – wireless technology. Google Fiber – which named San Diego as a potential city for building an ultra-fast fiber optic Internet network -- said last month that it would pause future fiber optic roll outs in San Diego and seven other potential Google Fiber cities while it explored new approaches.  Among those is wireless, including high frequency airwaves, which can deliver gigabit data rates over short, line of sight distances but also tend to bounce erratically off obstacles and degrade in rain or fog. “Millimeter wave is one of several different technologies (Google Fiber) is looking at, but it does seem to have the most promise,” said Karl Bode of broadband watchdog DSL Reports. “There are line of sight issues here, and weather can impact signal,” he continued.  “As such you need transmitters relatively close to the home, meaning you still have some notable deployment costs. Still, that's cheaper than digging up streets, which is why Google is interested.” Don’t expect Google Fiber to incorporate wireless into fiber networks anytime soon. There are still many questions about how viable wireless can be, and what licenses would be required from federal regulators in various airwave bands. But recent improvements in antenna technology and beam forming techniques to more precisely steer these high frequency airwaves are fueling optimism about their ability to span the last mile. Certain high frequency airwaves have been earmarked to become part of the spectrum dedicated for upcoming gigabit class 5G cellular networks. Last week, Verizon Communications Chief Executive Lowell McAdam spoke at the Intel Capital Global Summit in San Diego about the bandwidth capabilities of millimeter wave 5G technology, calling it “wireless fiber,” according to Murthy Renduchintala, president of Intel’s mobile and Internet of things group. “I think he said 50 percent of his costs in a fiber roll-out is from the lamp post to the home,” said Renduchintala. “So he’s basically saying if I can get high-speed ‘wireless fiber’ to the house, it would make deployments much more rapid and much more economically viable.” Verizon built its FiOS fiber optic TV and Internet network in nine states but stopped expanding into new markets in 2010, in part because of high installation costs. In October, San Diego’s Qualcomm said it would deliver the first 5G mobile modem chip, called the Snapdragon X50, next year for testing. It expects to reach top-end download speeds of 5 gigabits per second when shows up in commercial devices in 2018. Qualcomm is targeting the X50 for mobile handsets. But analysts think that “fixed wireless” markets – such as boxes that link the fiber optic backbone in the street to individual homes  – also are potential uses of this technology. With five gigabits of bandwidth, users could download an entire digital movie in less than a minute.  Skyriver, a San Diego start-up, recently completed field trials for millimeter wave point-to-multi-point technology to fuel gigabit broadband. The company said it has been acquiring spectrum rights in millimeter wave bands in several markets. For Google, affordable bandwidth is the key to its Web businesses such as Google search and YouTube. In 2012, it got into the Internet Service Provider business with Google Fiber. Today 12 cities nationwide either have Google Fiber up and running or are in development. Google has worked with these cities to install fiber on existing power poles, among other things, to keep costs down. The company’s entrance into the high speed Internet business has spurred on cable and telecom competitors to ramp their fiber optic roll outs – though most have limited expansion to new housing developments. Google has been talking with eight additional cities – San Diego, Los Angeles, San Jose, Portland, Phoenix, Chicago, Jacksonville and Tampa – as the next potential markets for Google Fiber expansion. Last month, it put those plans on hold, raising concern that it had lost its enthusiasm for Google Fiber. . In its third quarter earnings conference call, Google/Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the company will continue to be an Internet Service Provider in the 12 existing cities where fiber is deployed or in the development pipeline.  “We are making great progress in those cities, and we remain very committed to growth across those cities,” she said. “We are pausing for now our work in eight cities where we have been in exploratory discussions. But very much to your question, it is to better integrate some of the technology work we have been developing.” The company is still talking with San Diego officials about permitting, micro trenching and other issues, said Stacey LoMedico, San Diego’s assistant chief operating officer.  A meeting was held earlier this week. The two sides have not yet talked about wireless, said LoMedico. Last year, Google purchased San Francisco based Webpass, which uses point-to-point microwave to deliver high speed Internet to urban apartment buildings, condo complexes and businesses in San Diego and five other cities. The company is licensed in the 70/80 Gigahertz spectrum bands, according to a Google spokesperson. It installs large antennas on top of buildings to deliver point-to-point Internet. Its then distributes bandwidth to each apartment or office. “In San Diego, Google Fiber and Webpass will work together to extend and accelerate deployments via point-to-point wireless,” said a Google spokesperson in an email. “In addition as we’ve said, we’re actively expanding our roadmap to include innovative technologies like fixed wireless that expand access to more people, faster.” A key question is how far can a high bandwidth wireless signal travel to connect the fiber node to homes? Some companies have claimed the signals can travel a bit over a mile (about two kilometers) in tests. But industry analysts think it’s unlikely to be that far in actual deployments. “I don’t think there will be any trouble going a couple hundred meters, but I think a lot of engineers are trying to figure this out,” said Christopher Taylor, director of radio frequency/wireless components at industry research firm Strategy Analytics.   Three must-see headlines <h1>Gunman killed by police shot City Heights family, took hostage</h1> <h1>Cellphone crud could help I.D. crime victims</h1> <h1>CEO in San Diego resigns after online threat to shoot Trump</h1> Gunman killed by police shot City Heights family, took hostage Cellphone crud could help I.D. crime victims CEO in San Diego resigns after online threat to shoot Trump See more videos mike.freeman@sduniontribune.com;  Twitter:@TechDiego 760-529-4973 Copyright © 2016, The San Diego Union-Tribune US Politics Latest Most Popular Jobs Homes Cars Customer Help Today's Paper 64°
Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak Intel X299 Chipset Platform To Power Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X Processors By Hassan Mujtaba Posted 2 weeks ago 108Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel’s next generation chipset to power their HEDT (High-End Desktop Platform) has been confirmed as X299. The chipset will be used to power entire platforms that will support the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPU family. Intel X299 HEDT Chipset To Power Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X Based Platforms Intel launched their X99 chipset platform back in 2014. This platform features support for Haswell-E and Broadwell-E processors. The platform utilized a new socket known as LGA 2011-3. Now, Intel plans to be delivering an update to their HEDT platform in the form of X299. The move to switch to X299 doesn’t come as a surprise as Intel would like to push their HEDT platform in the 200-series branding. Intel would be using the 200-series branding for all PCH’s (Platform Control Hubs) on the mainstream lineup hence it makes sense from a marketing perspective to keep parity, following the same 200 series naming scheme as the rest of the chipsets. Intel X299 chipset will not only be replacing the X99 chipset, but it would also introduce a new socket. The new socket will be required to support Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processors. We have known this socket as LGA 2066. The name reveals that the socket will feature exactly 2066 pins. This is an increase of 55 pins from the previous socket. Since Skylake is architecturally different than Haswell and Broadwell, it was necessary to make the shift. The new socket will span at least three generations of processors, Skylake, Kaby Lake and Cannonlake. Intel will only need to update it when they introduce their Ice Lake architecture based processors which would be around 2020. That new socket would be known as LGA 2076, more details on that here. Total War WARHAMMER DX12 Benchmark - Our GPU & CPU Test Intel Skylake-X HEDT Processors For X299 Chipset The Intel Skylake-X family is a new name for Skylake-E which is built for high-end desktop PCs. The family will be aimed at enthusiasts and will be launching in 2H 2017. The Skylake-X chips will be replacing the Broadwell-E family which launched a few months ago. Advertisement Information suggests that Skylake-X processors will be available in same core configuration as Broadwell-E with 10, 8 and 6 core variants and TDP’s adjusted around 140W while delivering better IPC with the new Skylake architecture. We can expect similar if not higher pricing structure for these processors. Intel Kaby Lake-X HEDT Processors For X299 Chipset Intel would also be offering Kaby Lake-X processors on their HEDT platform. They would launch at the same time as Skylake-X but available in only Quad Core package. The surprising thing here is that the Kaby Lake-X SKUs will feature a 112W TDP on a 14nm node. This means that we might be looking at much higher clock speeds compared to current generation quad core models. In fact, the Kaby Lake family uses a more optimized architecture compared to Skylake which will allow Intel to finer tune its performance for better performance and efficiency. The Kaby Lake-X series of processors feature up to 16 PCI-E Gen 3.0 lanes. It’s odd to see Intel splitting Kaby Lake “Unlocked” Quad Cores on mainstream and HEDT platforms but it kind of makes sense too. While LGA 1151 (Z270) will have its set of unlocked flagships, HEDT users will be allowed an entry level product that will allow them to upgrade later onward or take advantage of multiple PCI-e lanes that will be offered on X299. Some other details about the Basin Falls-X platform includes quad channel memory support on Skylake-X and dual channel memory support on Kaby Lake-X processors. Speeds as high as 2667 MHz are supported by these chips. The Kaby Lake-X PCH itself offers 24 PCI-E Gen 3.0 lanes along with 10 USB 3.0, 8 USB 2.0 ports and Intel LAN (Jacksonville PHY) chipset.

Used as a gaming PC with GTX1070 still seeing no bottleneck with this CPU, getting over 144FPS (refresh rate limit) solid in games like overwatch with most everything on 1080p.. CPU/system over 4 years old now only upgrade was GTX580SLI's for one GTX1070 and few ssd's. It still maxes out refresh rate of 144 with no fps dropping below? Old board has Intel RAID I have made my own BIOS and updated (in x58 days old ROM would not detect SSD over 60G intel tried to tell you new mainboard was answer instead of just updating ROM on their old raid controllers...) to run 3 SSD's in RAID getting 750-800MB transfers even with the sata II bottleneck (using 3x ssd's), so not in rush to upgrade for storage speed... Whats with the everyone's rush to get newer CPU, honestly can't see need for it when already maximum settings in game 1080P? Or is it just an epeen thing to post better benchmarks in synthetic benchmark apps to boast? This is not a troll post, Its coming from a gaming perspective. I am not using this PC for anything else (pr0n doesn't count ) so high values for synthetic benchmarks or compressing 3d rendering software are irrelevant. Has time come to upgrade, and if so for what reason if all the games I play already top settings at my 1080P with 144Hz refresh limit?

On X58 I've been for very long time and I needed get something to try and to compare there Hope this helps Thanks,Jura     jura11 View Public Profile Find all posts by jura11   (#3) Sir Galahad Master Guru     Videocard: EVGA GTX 980 Classified Processor: 4690K 4.5GHz 1.25v H110 Mainboard: Asus Maximus VII Ranger Memory: 16GB Corsair VenPro 2400 Soundcard: Creative SB ZXR+Sen HD560 PSU: Corsair AX860i 11-05-2016, 18:41 | posts: 422 | Location: England If it's running ok for you then you don't need to upgrade no matter what anyone tells you. After all it's your PC not ours. Upgrade when you think the time is right. On another note. I kept my old Q9650 @ 4GHz as my main gaming PC from 2008 up until mid 2014. At that time the Q9650 was starting to struggle with some games that came out at the time. It was ok, I was going down to 40FPS though is some games and for me that's as low as I can bare so I upgraded to the 4690K I have now. However some more recent games have ran really well on the Q9650 (I still have the PC up and running with GTX970). Doom on vulkan is amazing, maxed out at 1080p it gets over 100fps in most situations. I'm now beginning to regret upgrading when I did as there is still plenty of life left in the Q9650 and I could have held out a little longer and bought something newer and better.     Sir Galahad View Public Profile Find all posts by Sir Galahad « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Email this Page Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     ATI Tray Tools         ATI Tray Tools Generic Discussion             ATI Tray Tools Public Beta Section     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2016, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

These existing devices use first generation of TI USB-C chipset (TPS65982) in combination with Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 chipset (Alpine Ridge). Apple requires the 2nd generation TPS65983 chipset for peripherals to be compatible. Certification of solutions across different device types is still in-progress for this 2nd generation chipset. From the Plugable product line, our dual display graphics adapters for DisplayPort and HDMI (TBT3-DP2X and TBT3-HDMI2X) are affected. So we offer these products as Windows-only Thunderbolt 3 devices until a future hardware update. Our Thunderbolt 3 cables do not require this chip, and therefore are compatible. We’ve also postponed our TBT3-UD1 Docking Station to update to the TPS65983 chipset and re-certify to make this docking station MacBook-compatible. Our Flagship TBT3-UDV dock with Power Delivery/Charging was already planned to use the next generation controller chip from TI, and will be compatible with the 2016 Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks. We’ll continue to post updates with new Thunderbolt™ 3 product and release information as it becomes available. Thunderbolt™ 3 brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at speeds up to 40 Gb/s, creating one compact port that does it all – delivering the fastest, most versatile connection to any dock, display, or data device. For the first time, one computer port connects to Thunderbolt devices, every display, and billions of USB devices. A single cable now provides four times the data and twice the video bandwidth of any other cable, while also supplying power. IMPORTANT Your PC may need updates for the Thunderbolt 3 ports to function properly. For more information go to https://thunderbolttechnology.net/updates Plugable’s line of Thunderbolt 3 products Flagship Thunderbolt 3 dock for Windows and Mac (Plugable TBT3-UDV) Expected Q1 2017 Plugable’s new Thunderbolt 3 Dock will eliminate the need to constantly plug and unplug multiple devices to your notebook or tablet. The dock’s anodized aluminum enclosure and black bezel design can be positioned horizontally or vertically. Connect two uncompressed 4K 60Hz (4096 x 2160) displays (one via a DisplayPort++ port and the other via the 2nd USB-C port), up to three USB 3.0 devices, Gigabit Ethernet, and stereo audio in/out all while creating a more productive and clutter free workspace. The second Thunderbolt 3 port on the dock supports up to 5 daisy chained Thunderbolt 3 devices, up to 128 USB 3.1 (10Gb/s) devices, or the second DisplayPort display. Supports USB Power Delivery (PD) 2.0 with support for charging compatible laptops and tablets up to 60W. Note that PD support is system dependent — only certain computers will charge via the USB-C connector. Volume Thunderbolt 3 dock (Plugable TBT3-UD1) Expected October 2016, Estimated street price $179 USD Postponed indefinitely for MacBook Pro 2016 compatibility All the same functionality as our flagship dock, with charging limited to 15W (5V 3A) to the host laptop or tablet. Gigabit Ethernet (Network Connection) USB 3.0 (USB Peripherals) Audio Line In (Microphone) Audio Line Out (Headphones / Speakers) Identical to #6 Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C 3.1 Gen2. Connect one port to host Computer and second port to any Thunderbolt 3 or USB device DisplayPort++ (Additional Display) Power In (12V DC / 6A) USB 3.0 (USB Peripherals) USB-C 3.1 Gen1 (USB devices only, does not support Thunderbolt devices or VESA Alternate Mode video output) Thunderbolt 3 HDMI Dual-Display Adapter for Windows (Plugable TBT3-HDMI2X) Launched May 2016, Windows Only, Estimated street price $99 USD Supports two HDMI monitors up to 4K 30Hz (3840 x 2160), uncompressed and at full GPU performance. Thunderbolt 3 DisplayPort Dual-Display Adapter for Windows (Plugable TBT3-DP2X) Launched May 2016, Windows Only, Estimated street price $89 USD Supports two DisplayPort monitors up to 4K 60Hz (4096 x 2160), uncompressed and at full GPU performance. These are “native” DisplayPort ports, so conversion to HDMI or VGA can only be done with active adapters (not less expensive DP++ passive adapters). So generally we recommend this adapter for enthusiasts who who have chosen DisplayPort native monitors with the best possible performance and resolution in mind.

A: No. Thunderbolt 3 docks and adapters will only work with Thunderbolt 3 USB-C computers and ports. Connecting to a USB-C port without Thunderbolt 3 capability will not work. Note that computers and docks may have a mix of Thunderbolt 3 and other USB-C ports that look very similar. Look for the Thunderbolt icon on both sides of the connection to ensure the port and device support Thunderbolt 3. Please note that existing Thunderbolt 3 peripherals are not compatible with the MacBook Pro 2016.   Q: Are Plugable’s Thunderbolt 3 cables compatible with the new 2016 MacBook Pro systems? A: Yes! Q: Are Plugable’s Thunderbolt 3 devices compatible with the new 2016 MacBook Pro systems? A: The version of OS X on the new MacBook Pros (late 2016) will not work with existing Thunderbolt 3 docks and adapters that were certified for Windows prior to the release of the MacBook Pro. These existing devices use first generation of TI USB-C chipset (TPS65982) in combination with Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 chipset (Alpine Ridge).

So we offer these products as Windows-only Thunderbolt 3 devices until a future hardware update. Our Thunderbolt 3 cables do not require this chip, and therefore are compatible. Q: Is Plugable planning on releasing any Thunderbolt 3 devices which are compatible with the 2016 MacBook Pros? A: Yes. Our upcoming Flagship Thunderbolt 3 Docking Station with Power Delivery (TBT3-UDV) will be compatible with Macs, and we’ve postponed our TBT3-UD1 Docking Station to evaluate adding MacBook compatibility. Q: What happens if I plug in an unsupported Thunderbolt 3 device into a 2016 MacBook? You will not receive any warnings or errors, but the device will not function. Examination of the device enumeration tree (System Information -> Hardware -> Thunderbolt -> Thunderbolt 3 Bus -> {Your Device Name}) will simply show {Your Device Name} – Unsupported Device Q: Will the Thunderbolt 3 dock charge my phone, tablet, or laptop with a USB-C cable? A: Thunderbolt 3 uses the standard charging methods available with the USB-C connector. Thunderbolt 3 certification also insures a minimum bar that Thunderbolt 3 ports must signal 5V 3A of available power, and handle up to 15W draw on that port. Optionally, hosts and devices may support the more complex USB Power Delivery (PD) specification, which would allow negotiation up to 100W per port. That’s the good news. The more complex site of the story is there is no requirement for laptops, tablets, or phones to use the USB-C port for charging. Some with USB-C ports will only charge via a DC barrel plug. Some will charge on USB-C, but only when connected to their own branded power adapters. Others may require a specific voltage during PD negotiation which don’t match any voltage offered by the power adapter, so the negotiation fails. And the PD spec is evolving from version 2 (current devices) to version 3 (devices later in 2016). Because of these factors, charging behavior is device specific. We will be providing tables with test results with the most common laptops, tablets, and phones when used with our Thunderbolt 3 and other USB-C docks. Q: I have a DisplayPort monitor. How can I connect it via Thunderbolt 3? A: Any Thunderbolt 3 dock or adapter with DisplayPort or DisplayPort++ ports will connect to DisplayPort monitors directly. If the monitor has only a mini-DisplayPort (mDP) connector, a DP to mDP adapter is needed. Q: I have a HDMI monitor. How can I connect it via Thunderbolt 3? A: The Plugable TBT3-HDMI2X adapter will support your HDMI monitor without additional adapters. For Thunderbolt 3 docks with a DisplayPort++ port, you can use it in combination with any DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter (active or passive). Q: I have a VGA monitor. How can I connect it via Thunderbolt 3? A: For the Thunderbolt 3 docks with a DisplayPort++ port, you can use it in combination with any DisplayPort-to-VGA adapter (active or passive). For Thunderbolt 3 dual-display adapters, your best choice is the dual-display HDMI adapter, with two active HDMI-to-VGA adapters like our $16.95 Plugable HDMI-VGA cable. Q: I have a DVI monitor. How can I connect it via Thunderbolt 3? A: For Thunderbolt 3 docks with a DisplayPort++ port, you can use it in combination with any DisplayPort-to-DVI adapter (active or passive). For Thunderbolt 3 dual-display adapters, your best choice is the dual-display HDMI adapter, which can then be combined with any passive HDMI to DVI cable.

Intel OpenCL Beignet 1.2.1 Released Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 4 November 2016 at 06:15 AM EDT. 4 Comments Intel's open-source team has announced the release of Beignet 1.2.1 as the newest version of their OpenCL GPU hardware implementation for Linux. Beignet 1.2.1 only ships bug fixes over Beignet 1.2.0 that was released back in August. Beignet 1.2.1 has various fixes such as adding some missing PCI IDs, runtime improvements, and more. No real new features for Beignet 1.2.1 as those are being saved for Beignet 1.3. There also is not yet any OpenCL 2.x support in Beignet while the OCL20 branch hasn't been updated now in five months. The changes for Beignet 1.2.1 can be found via their Git repository. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Rumored to Come Out Early in 2017 with a High-End Chipset and Running on Windows 10 Redstone 2, More Details Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 05, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Contrary to previous speculations that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will come out during the Microsoft event on October 26, the device was a no-show. The latest iteration of the combination laptop and tablet from the Redmondian company is now being rumored to be launched early next year with the high-end chipset in Intel’s Kaby Lake and possibly running on the new Windows 10 Redstone 2 that Microsoft just launched last month, notes News Everyday. The device shall also come out with an upgraded Surface Pen that can run on rechargeable batteries, which can be charged in a wireless mode since it is magnetically linked to the Microsoft Surface Pro 5. Redstone 2 has been referred to as the Creator’s gadget, a software with the potential capability and much improved to Microsoft’s Edge, personalization capabilities, and adjustments to built-in apps. Faster and more optimal performance Having the Intel Kaby Lake processor also assures that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be faster and exude a more optimal performance, reports Game & Guide. It shall also feature a USB Type-C charging port, which has become the new paradigm in modern-day devices for faster data transfers. Based on its rumored specifications and features, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is going to be a spectacular piece of device when it finally arrives on the market next year. It shall reportedly come out with an improved Surface Pen, which will be an integral component of Microsoft Surface devices from thereon. According to analysts, one of the main reasons why the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 was rumored to come out last month is because its predecessor, the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, completed its one-year market cycle also last month. But the same rumors are also consistent in saying that Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be a lot better than the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 although based on the supposed leaked design of the upcoming device, the changes do not appear to be that much, externally that is. Simply not feasible While the Redmondian company would like nothing but to launch the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 last month, it later on became clear that it was not just possible and feasible since Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, which Microsoft intends to use for its hybrid laptop-tablet line, is due for mass production before the end of the year yet. The Kaby Lake processor was announced by Intel on August 30, 2016 but it began shipping to manufacturers and OEMs in the second quarter of this year, Mass production is not expected to commence until late this year. Thus, it seems logical to assume that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will come out to the market sometime next year although no exact date has been given thus far. The Intel Kaby Lake processor is reported to be a power-efficient and very powerful processor that could double the performance of the hybrid laptop-tablet. One of the major problems of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, when it was launched last year, was its poor battery. The Intel Kaby Lake processor, in effect, fixes the battery issue on the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 right off the bat. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 shall also be sporting a 4K Ultra HD display with an option for a lower-end variant with a 2K display. The devices shall feature 16GB of RAM, a rear-facing 16-megapixel camera, and an 8-megapixel front-facing snapper. More than the name of the processor, what’s really interesting is the fact that Intel actually used 14-nanometer technologies in designing the Kaby Lake processor which means that it is more high-tech and more advanced. As such, it is also expected that the Kaby Lake processor shall bring about more impressive features for the Microsoft Surface Pro 5.

Skip Article Header. Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Sarah Zhang. Sarah Zhang personal frontiers Science Date of Publication: 10.31.16. 10.31.16 Time of Publication: 4:00 pm. 4:00 pm How Doctors Could One Day Use Your DNA to Cure You The Voorhes “I don’t mean to be morbid,” Eric Dishman told a friend as he was winding down his job at Intel. “But this may be the last time you see me.” Dishman, a longtime leader of the company’s health research division, was preparing to die. The kidney cancer he’d been diagnosed with in college had caught up to him two decades later. His kidneys had failed, and the chemo drug that kept him alive was incompatible with dialysis. Eric Dishman is finally cancer-free after more than 20 years—and, following a kidney transplant, he now heads the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program at the National Institutes of Health.Joe PuglieseBut that friend happened to work for a DNA sequencing company, and he offered to analyze the genome of Dishman’s cancer cells. What could it hurt? Weeks later, Dishman got two 1-terabyte hard drives by courier, loaded with his genomic data. Another copy went to his doctors. And just days before he was to start dialy­sis—he already had the surgical port in his arm—his doctors called. Dishman’s kidney cancer mutations looked like they actually belonged to a form of pancreatic cancer. He switched to a drug designed for tumors in a totally different organ. It worked. Dishman is finally cancer-free after more than 20 years—and, following a successful kidney transplant, he now heads the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program at the National Institutes of Health. There, he’s in charge of recruiting 1 million Americans to share their DNA and medical histories for a massive study. As research like this pinpoints links between genetic variation and disease, doctors could someday look up a patient’s DNA and use it to prescribe custom treatments for cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and more. Dishman’s case is still an anomaly. “I was ­triple lucky,” he says: lucky to have his DNA sequenced, lucky his doctors waded into the data, and lucky—most of all—that the information led to a cure. But Dishman hopes his million volunteers will help him discover more markers that lead to successful tailored treatments. And that would make the survival equation a little less luck and a lot more science. This article appears in our special November issue, guest-edited by President Barack Obama. Subscribe now.

The Asus ZenBook UX310UA is a premium and stylish 13.3-inch Ultrabook that doesn’t break the bank. With a starting price of just £550, this mid-range laptop comes with high-end features. These include a beautiful, thin and light metal-coated body, Intel Skylake processors, solid-state storage, a USB Type-C port and a backlit keyboard. Navigating Asus’ confusing naming conventions isn’t easy: the new UX310UA is the direct successor to the UX303UA (we gave this laptop a 4/5 back in February 2016). There isn’t a whole lot new here, and it isn’t perfect, but for the money the Asus ZenBook UX310UA is one of the most tempting laptops I’ve reviewed in quite some time. Its £800 price tag puts it in the same territory as the Lenovo IdeaPad 710S Trusted reviewed earlier this year, although the two offer slightly different experiences. With the MacBook Air seemingly abandoned by Apple, the Windows Ultrabook market is starting to look more promising than ever. Related: Best laptops to buy Asus ZenBook UX310UA – Buying Information With a retail price of £799.99, my review model is the top-spec UX310UA featuring a i7-6500U dual-core processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, 500GB secondary hard drive and a QHD+ resolution display. Considering the Dell XPS 13 costs £100 more for the base i5 Full HD model, I’m really impressed with what you get for your money. If you’re on a tighter budget, the entry-level UX310UA sports an i3-6100U processor, 4GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD and a Full HD display. Related: Intel Core i3, i5 and i7 explained Here it's worth comparing the specifications of the top-end Lenovo IdeaPad 710S: For the same money you get a larger and faster 256GB SSD, better integrated graphics and a slightly faster Core i7-6560U processor. The IdeaPad is also slightly lighter, but only gets a Full HD screen. Watch: Trusted explains how to choose a laptop Asus ZenBook UX310UA – Design and Build There’s no fancy touchscreen or 360-degree hinge here – this is a traditional clamshell laptop. The UX301UA’s all-aluminium coating looks as premium as it feels. Weighing 1.45kg – that’s 550g lighter than the MacBook Pro 13 – and only 18mm thick, this is the ideal travel companion. Asus’ famous spun-metal finish on the lid looks great, catching the light as you open it. If you’re not a fan of the grey colour on review, the ZenBook is available in bronze and grey metal too. On the whole build quality is great, screen wobble is minimal, there’s very little flex in the metal body, and the keyboard depresses only slightly with a firm push. If I have one complaint, it’s that the chunky bezels detract from the high-end aesthetic of the laptop. Next to a Dell XPS 13 and its “infinity-edge” bezels, the UX310UA looks a little dated. It’s a minor gripe but something I’d like to see addressed on future models. As for ports, the UX310UA offers a peculiar combination of old and new. There are three USB ports, but only one of them is the faster USB 3.0 type. It’s odd to see two USB 2.0 ports on a 2016 laptop – although it isn’t much of an issue if you just use these to plug in mice, keyboards or other peripherals. The good news is the UX310UA does offer one of the latest reversible USB 3.1 (Type-C) ports, which is a nice piece of future-proofing. Elsewhere there’s a full-size HDMI port, headphone and microphone combo port, card reader and DC power port. It’s hard to think of anything that’s missing here. Asus ZenBook UX310UA – Keyboard and Touchpad The full-sized chiclet-style keyboard on the UX310UA is above average. While the keys do feel a little spongier than I‘d like, they offer a good amount of travel; I was comfortable typing on the keyboard within seconds of using it for the first time. It’s fully backlit, too – a feature the UX303 lacked – which not only adds to the laptop’s premium aesthetic but makes it easier to use in the dark. There’s a hint of flex in the keyboard if you press firmly toward the back-middle of the keyboard, but it isn’t something you’ll notice with normal use. The big, glass trackpad feels great. The smooth surface has two built-in buttons integrated into the bottom of the trackpad. I found it slightly less responsive than I’d like out of the box, but increasing the cursor sensitivity by a notch in Windows easily resolved the issue. Asus ZenBook UX310UA – Screen You have the choice of Full HD (1,920 x 1,080) or 3,200 x 1,800-pixel display, depending on which model of the UX310UA you go for. My review model sports the higher-resolution QHD+ panel, which looks terrific – but I’m not convinced that anyone needs it on a 13.3-inch laptop. You’ll definitely need to make use of Windows scaling (which actually works well in Windows 10) to make the text and icons comfortably usable. While I appreciate the sharpness (276ppi), unless you put the screen right up to your eye it isn’t something you’ll ever notice. I also believe it has a significant impact on battery life, but we’ll talk more about that later. What I do like is the IPS panel, which is bright and offers wide viewing angles. Whether you’re watching a Netflix movie, YouTube video or just browsing the web, the display is nice to look at. Asus’ quoted 500:1 contrast ratio is lower than average, and means blacks are less inky and whites are a tad duller than you might expect given the type of panel used. For the price, though, the screen is adequate. On the plus side, the solid 375cd/m2 maximum brightness combined with the matte panel makes it easy to use the UX310UA when you’re out and about. I found the display remained readable even in direct sunlight (hard to find during the Autumn in the UK).

Reuters/Danish Siddiqui The iMacs have always been a top favourite for numerous tech enthusiasts and they would love to see more of the powerful PC when the Apple iMac 2017 releases. An update seems imminent as it’s been a long time since the iMac has been updated. Macworld reported in October that US retailer Best Buy had accidentally listed a Kaby lake iMac on its website for sale. The listing was taken down soon. However, this raised hopes of thousands of Apple fans who desperately want to see the Kaby Lake chipset in the upcoming Apple iMac 2017. The potential refresh is coming and it could be in the first quarter of 2017. The Kaby Lake chipset is expected t bring awesome powers to the iMac 2017 and the processor will also be based on Intel’s Speed Shift V2 technology. Analysts are certain that the delay in the iMac release is primarily because of the Intel Kaby Lake processor. Apple may also be entering the VR race soon and what better way to do so than with the iMac 2017! There are talks that the iMac 2017 would be made VR capable as all major players are exploring VR capabilities for their gadgets and devices. The Apple iMac 2017 may have the Polaris 10 and 11 chipsets that are capable of providing decent VR experience. The Polaris graphics chips help in improving the resolution significantly and that’s particularly great for gamers, writes Tech Radar. Moreover, these chipsets are better than many other available chipsets in the market as they offer lower power consumption and faster speeds. The Apple iMac 2017 would be having the Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C ports for faster data transfer and battery charging. Apple could also be considering making the flash storage the next storage standard from the iMac 2017. The fusion drives could very well be the default storage for the new iMacs.

Its TrueVR  platform has been used for a range of live shows and events, including the NCAA Men’s Basketball Final Four, New York Fashion Week, the 2016 Kabaddi World Cup, live streams of concerts, and select NBA, NFL and college football games.   Intel Capital recently led a $12.5 million “A” round in Voke, along with participation from the Sacramento Kings, A+E Networks and Nautilus Ventures.   “Together, we can innovate and scale our new immersive sports business faster to bring fans the most personalized, fully immersive VR experience ever imagined and change the way networks, sports leagues and teams engage with their audiences,” Carwana said.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1 is ready for anything by Zak Killian  2:59 PM on November 3, 2016 Panasonic's Toughbooks are well-known and respected in industrial and emergency environments for their durability, reliability, and long battery life. The company also sells similarly-ruggedized tablets under the Toughpad brand, and today it announced that the latest version of its 10.1" Toughpad FZ-G1 is now available in the U.S. We haven't really talked about the Toughpads previously here at TR. The FZ-G1 is now in its 4th revision, but you wouldn't know by looking at it; the exterior is unchanged since its inception. Inside, the machine is now powered by an Intel Core i5-6300U SoC and its HD 520 graphics. There are 8GB of DDR3L memory on tap, a 256GB solid-state drive (a 512GB unit is optional), and 64-bit Windows 10 Pro. This latest revision includes an Intel 8260 chip providing dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1. The FZ-G1's 1920x1200 LED-backlit IPS display remains unchanged. Panasonic fits the tablet with a ridiculously powerful backlight that can ramp the brightness up to 800 cd/m² to ensure outdoor readability even at mid-day. The capacitive touchscreen has 10-point multi-touch capability, as well as gloved and wet-touch support. The machine includes a waterproof active stylus and seven hardware buttons along the bottom edge of the screen, two of which are user-configurable. As with most tablets, the FZ-G1 includes both a front-facing camera and an 8MP rear camera. Of course, the real point of the Toughpad is its extreme durability. Panasonic describes the machine as "fully rugged," and that moniker seems apt. The tablet's chassis is crafted from magnesium alloy, and then that frame is encased in ABS plastic with thick elastomer corner guards. It has MIL-STD-810G certification for shock, vibration, and weather resistance, too. The spec says it will consistently survive drops from four feet, and also that it's weatherproof. Curiously, Panasonic says the solid-state drive has its own heater. Panasonic also proudly states that the battery life of the FZ-G1 has nearly doubled since its original incarnation, from 8 hours to 14 hours. The company also offers an optional long-life battery that it says supports up to 28 hours of continuous operation. If that's not enough, the device has a multi-function bay that can accept a bridge battery to allow users to change main batteries without shutting down the machine. Panasonic offers additional options for the multi-function bay, like a serial port, an Ethernet port, a magnetic stripe reader, or a GPS unit. While that all sounds pretty fancy, top-class engineering like this doesn't come cheap. Panasonic says the FZ-G1 is available at US distributors now starting at $2,899.

While Apple's offerings are true laptops with a few mobile-inspired perks, Microsoft bills the Surface Pro 4 as a tablet that can replace your laptop. For the purpose of this comparison, we're focusing on the two current 13-inch MacBook Pros and the varying configurations of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. The Surface Pro is sold as a tablet, but it gains much of its laptop-esque functionality from the add-on (but essential) Type Cover, a detachable keyboard and trackpad extension that's sold separately. Size Apple's laptops are relatively thin for their size. Meanwhile, the Surface Pro 4 (sans keyboard) is one capacious and hefty tablet – at least compared to mobile-only tablets like the iPad. Keep in mind that the Surface's keyboard adds some extra total depth (not factored into this measurement) when it's folded shut over the screen. Weight The 13-inch MacBook Pros weigh 1.37 kilograms, or about 3 pounds. The Surface Pro's weight depends on what configuration you're using. The lightest tablet plus keyboard combination possible is 1.06 kilograms. If you upgrade to an i5 or i7 processor (see below) the set-up will weigh 20 grams more. That would still be about 25-percent lighter than a MacBook Pro. Build MacBooks are still rocking their characteristic aluminum unibody. Microsoft uses a magnesium alloy for the Surface Pro build. The Type Cover is made from a soft, fabric-like material. Colors MacBook Pros are available in two neutral metallic tones. The Surface Pro tablet is only available in silver, but the Type Cover is available in black, blue, bright blue, red or teal. Display size The MacBook Pro display is an inch larger across the diagonal. That gives it an 11-percent area advantage over the Surface Pro 4. Display resolution The Surface Pro's pixels are 16-percent more dense, which may be especially noticeable when viewing it closely in tablet mode. Still, there is more to display quality than resolution alone, and we don't have any complaints about the new MacBook Pros. Touchscreen Apple has reiterated that there are no intentions of creating a touchscreen MacBook, but Microsoft isn't afraid to create machines with several input options. The Surface Pro 4 has a full-fledged touchscreen. Tablet mode No surprises here – the Surface Pro is a tablet first, and you don't need to buy the Type Cover to use it as such (though it wouldn't make for much of a product without its transforming 2-in-1 nature). Trackpad This year's MacBook Pros have huge glass solid-state trackpads. The trackpad doesn't actually move but instead has click-mimicking haptic feedback. It's also Force Touch-equipped, which means it differentiates between a light touch and a more forceful press. Apple has been playing up this pressure-sensitivity as a big efficiency measure, but we sometimes find it a little too touchy. You'll need a Type Cover to get trackpad functionality with the Surface Pro. The Type Cover has a traditional glass trackpad (similar to pre-Force Touch trackpads on the MacBook). Touch Bar 13-inch MacBook Pros are available with or without a Touch Bar. The Touch Bar replaces the row of Fn keys at the top of the keyboard with a dynamic app-specific shortcut bar that you can control with a fingertip. Stylus Every device in the Surface Pro line comes with a pressure-sensitive Surface Pen stylus for drawing, writing and mousing on-screen. Fingerprint sensor Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pros have built-in Touch ID. The versions with traditional Fn keys do not have a fingerprint sensor. There's no fingerprint sensor on the Surface Pro or on the base model Type Cover. For an additional US$30, however, you can spring for a Type Cover with integrated fingerprint sensor for additional security. Processor MacBook Pros have an Intel Core i5 (Skylark) processor. The Touch Bar version reaches higher speeds than the base model. The entry level Surface Pro has a relatively weak Intel Core m3 processor, but there are options to upgrade to the much better i5 or i7 chips instead. Microsoft hasn't published clock speeds. One bonus of going with the entry-level SP4 is that it's fanless and silent as the grave. Graphics These machines have integrated Intel GPUs. With the Surface Pro, each processor has a different pairing. All MacBook Pros have a generation-newer Intel GPU. Storage MacBook Pros are ready-built with either 256 or 512 GB. You can also special order 1 TB versions directly from Apple. Storage options for the Surface Pro vary depending on which processor you choose, but there are several options. The smallest 128 GB option is only available with the m3 processor; the 1 TB storage option is only possible with the top-shelf i7. USB ports MacBook Pro ports are exclusively Thunderbolt 3/USB-C. There are two on the base model and four on the Touch Bar variant. The Surface Pro has one full-size USB port. Either way, you'll probably need an adapter or two to meet your various needs. SD card reader The MacBook Pro does not have an SD card reader, an omission that's sparked the ire of some power users. The Surface Pro has a microSD slot. Charging port To charge a MacBook Pro, you'll occupy one of the aforementioned Thunderbolt ports. The Surface Pro has a separate, dedicated port that holds the charge cable in place magnetically. Headphone jack The good news: Both of these have a dedicated headphone jack. The bad news: iPhone 7 or 7 Plus owners won't have a place to plug in their Lightning-port headphones. Battery Microsoft hasn't published the Surface Pro's battery size(s), but battery life estimates indicate you'll get a little more time with the full-size MacBook Pro. Camera Neither of these devices are touted for their photography power, but the built-in cameras work for applications like video conferencing. MacBook Pros have one 720p webcam, but like most tablets, the Surface Pro has both a front and rear camera. Facial recognition login That front camera on the Surface recognizes your face for another layer of security. Software Both machines run full desktop software. MacBook Pros ship with MacOS Sierra and Surface Book has Windows 10 Pro. Release The non-Touch Bar versions of the MacBook are shipping now, while the Touch Bar models are available for pre-order and ship within 1-2 weeks. The Surface Pro 4 has been around for a year. Starting price The entry level MacBooks start at US$1,499; the Touch Bar models will set you back at least $1,799. Full retail price for the Surface Pro 4 starts at $899 for the tablet only, though it's fairly easy to find this year-old device at a discount. The Pro 4 Type Cover starts at $130. MacBook Pros are more expensive, but then again, they're a generation newer and are made of metal all around, including on the base. But depending on how you want to use it, it may make sense to cut costs – and size – and opt for the more adaptable Windows tablet. Operating system preferences will doubtlessly play into this decision, so it's wise to consider the differences between MacOS Sierra and Windows 10 as well. We will post a full-length review on a Touch Bar MacBook Pro in the near future, so stay tuned. So far, even the base model 2016 MacBook Pro looks and feels promising, and the Surface Pro 4 is an excellent choice for those who favor 2-in-1s – despite growing a little long in the tooth.

This represents a 30% premium to Lattices final trade price on November 2, 2016, the last trading day prior to the announcement. This latest acquisition leaves Xilinx as "the last man standing" with regard to the larger FPGA players. Actel was acquired by Microsemi in 2010 and Altera was acquired by Intel in 2015. In both of those cases, there was a technology play behind the story. Microsemi is big in security, and Actel's Flash-Based SmartFusion SoC FPGAs can play a big role in the secure boot process, for example. Meanwhile, Intel is huge in CPUs, and the combination of these CPUs with Altera's FPGAs — as separate devices, mounted in the same package, or, ultimately, fabricated on the same die — will be very important with regard to applications like high-performance computing (HPC). In early 2015, Lattice acquired Silicon Image, touting the advantages of having both an FPGA and ASSP play (see Lattice Deal: Harbinger of FPGA & ASSP Union). One of the first offspring from this marriage was the CrossLink family of video bridge pASSPs (programmable ASSPs). There is no technology play in the case of Canyon Bridge acquisition of Lattice — this is purely a financial play. The newly-formed Canyon Bridge wants to be a player in the technology market, and it sees Lattice Semiconductor as the anchor for their long-term investment portfolio, said Doug Hunter, senior director of marketing at Lattice Semiconductor in an interview with EE Times. Canyon Bridge is going to leave the Lattice team in place while providing investment to accelerate what Lattice is already doing, Hunter told us. This actually makes a lot of sense, because for Lattice has been carving out a nice niche (a large and growing niche) for itself over last few years with regard to small-to-medium capacity, low-power FPGAs deployed in a wide range of mobile, home, and augmented/virtual reality market applications (in addition to FPGAs, Lattice also boasts its pASSP products and a suite of power and thermal management solutions). Hunter says that Lattice has been talking to shareholders and investors about its long-term vision, and that Canyon Bridge believes in this vision and wants to play a part in it. But does Canyon Bridge know how to handle a high-tech company? Well, even though its described as "a newly formed, global private equity buyout fund," the Canyon Bridge leadership team has deep roots in Silicon Valley. Collectively, the principals in Canyon Bridge have more than 50 years of experience in the global technology, private equity, and M&A markets from the perspectives of founders, senior management, board members, and equity investors. In this day and age, where everyone is buying everyone else, Lattice was starting to look a little left out. Lattice's strategy of focusing on niche markets was good as far as it went, but niche markets simply arent going to cut it in the current business environment. Having serious investment from Canyon Bridge — coupled with the explosion in the IoT and cognitive (thinking, reasoning) systems boasting artificial neural networks and machine learning, vision, and speech — may allow Lattice to evolve and grow its "niche" and become a major player.

The certified integration will link the patented industry leader for least privilege management on Windows with the most advanced, extensible and scalable centralized security management software in the industry. Through its commitment to preventing privilege misuse and stopping unauthorized access, BeyondTrust plans to become fully integrated with McAfee ePO to provide a unified approach to least privilege and endpoint security. According to the 2016 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, 86% of users have too much access to corporate assets. When a data breach happens as a result of the misuse or abuse of excessive user privileges, the natural reaction for IT is to enhance endpoint protection and remove admin rights. This reaction is designed to stop future attacks on important assets, but often requires multiple tools that don't talk to one another in order to implement. Integrating PowerBroker for Windows with McAfee ePO will help overcome the complexity involved with making these changes and will allow cohesion within a single user interface to manage endpoint and privileged risks. Integration will address several critical use cases for organizations embracing least privilege: Deliver a lightweight client that integrates with the existing environment to perform least privilege functions Provide a single platform for event, policy and reporting of privileged events Enable the capability to remove administrative rights without impacting the end user's workflow on desktops and servers Protect against keystroke loggers and password stealing techniques like Pass-the-Hash using a least privileged client to perform application elevation Audit and report on all privileged and requested privileged activity in accordance with security best practices and regulatory compliance initiatives "Our customers require cohesive, integrated solutions that cover a broad range of security needs, so we are pleased to see that PowerBroker for Windows will be integrated with McAfee ePO," said DJ Long, head of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. "We look forward to presenting our customers with this central console for administrative visibility over their security and least privilege environments that helps them better understand and take action against privilege-based risks." "BeyondTrust is proud to be working towards integration with McAfee ePO, joining the simple, flexible and scalable console of security offering it provides," said Brad Hibbert, Chief Technology Officer, BeyondTrust. "Our commitment to stopping privilege misuse and unauthorized access fits perfectly into the mission of McAfee ePO, and we look forward to providing our leading protection more broadly than we have to this point."

Montréal, Québec (PRWEB) November 03, 2016 Cicada Security Technology today announces a successfully completed integration of Cicada Physical Data Protection (PDP) with McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) and McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL), aimed at protecting endpoints compromised due to attempted theft or tampering. Cicada PDP protects active and authenticated laptops, desktops, servers and other endpoint devices by monitoring multiple trigger points and identifying specific actions which are common to physical threats. Once triggered, Cicada PDP responsively invokes protective actions to prevent unintentional data exposure at the precise moment theft or tamper is detected. Cicada’s patented PDP technology is the first commercially available solution that allows data privacy focused organizations to extend the capabilities of their protective environments to include risks posed to their mobile work force. The extended capabilities include targeted attacks and human error for both active and authenticated devices. Cicada Security Technology actively participated in the Intel Security Innovation Alliance to achieve interoperability and has concurrently attained McAfee compatibility with the McAfee DXL framework. McAfee DXL affords Cicada PDP immediate compatibility with other McAfee DXL-compliant vendors by natively delivering physical threat awareness to these respective product platforms with minimal development effort during integration. McAfee DXL provides Cicada PDP a valuable platform which enables the intercommunication of threat event alerts between other security technologies, including physical risk aware encryption, authentication or other protective technologies. “Cicada PDP’s integration with McAfee technologies is an important step in the efforts to extend the scope of data protection technologies. This integration enables those responsible for the delivery of absolute data privacy to not only prevent data exposure on active and authenticated endpoints, but to effectively manage these events in an enterprise environment,” said Ryk Edelstein, CEO of Cicada Security Technology. “We are pleased to add Cicada Security solution to the select list of Technology Partners in the Intel Security Innovation Alliance program,” said D.J. Long, head of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. “We expect our joint solutions to stimulate powerful new workflows for security and compliance, a key goal of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance program.” Cicada’s innovative approach to protecting mobile data has gained considerable interest from government, public and private sector clients facing significant challenges in securing an elastic security perimeter. “The Cicada technology addresses real capability gaps, not only in federal civil agencies but also across the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community.” said Dr. Thomas A. Cellucci, Chief Commercialization Office U.S. Department of Homeland Security (Ret.). Cicada PDP Technology Availability Founded in 2010, Cicada Security Technology is the worldwide leader in physical threat aware data protection technologies.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 3, 2016 -- 02:27 GMT (19:27 PDT) | Topic: PCs Dell Business Black Friday and Cyber Monday ads have both leaked. Hot off the heels of the Dell Home Black Friday ad being leaked, its small business arm has seen its ads leaked not only for Black Friday, but Cyber Monday to boot. There's nothing as eye-popping as the $100 laptop and desktop specials the consumer ad revealed, but there are still plenty of PC deals for those looking for solid performance systems. Black Friday 2016 CNET 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Microsoft preview promises deals on Surface devices, Windows laptops Hhgregg ad has 12.9-inch iPad Pro deal Office Depot/OfficeMax ad features $119 Windows 2-in-1 tablet, $169 HP laptop Best Buy ad reveals $100 Windows laptop deal, $125 iPad Air 2, Pro savings Walmart ad features $199 Apple iPad mini 2, $119 Chromebook deals Target ad has iPad Pro for $449, iPad Air 2 for $274 HP ad leaks with PC deals from $250 Staples ad leaks with laptops, tablet deals Costco ad leaks with laptop, desktop, tablet deals Ads for Dell Small Business leak BJ's Wholesale ad features $33.33 Amazon Fire tablet Sam's Club ad leaks with HP laptop, desktop deals Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals The lowest-priced notebook in the four-page Black Friday ad is an Inspiron 15 3000 with Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and a 15.6-inch display that's just $199 starting at 8 a.m. on Black Friday morning. For a little more ($329), you can grab a beefier configuration with an Intel Core i3 CPU, or move up to the Inspiron 15 5000 model with Core i5 chip and double memory and hard drive space for $499. If you'd prefer the more business-oriented Latitude instead, there's a 14-inch model available starting Monday the 21st from 11 a.m. for $429 that features a Core i3 processor with 4 gigs of RAM and 500GB hard drive, or a 15-inch version stocked with Core i5 CPU, 8GB of memory, and a terabyte hard drive for $499. Desktop deals include an Inspiron tower (Core i5, 12GB of RAM, 1TB hard drive) doorbuster at 2 p.m. on Black Friday for $429, a $379 small-form-factor Inspiron with Core i3 CPU, 8 gigs of RAM, and 500GB hard drive, and a small-form-factor OptiPlex 3040 with Core i5 chip and the same amount of RAM and hard drive as its small Inspiron sibling for $579. If you need more performance, the XPS 8900 includes a Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, terabyte hard drive, and a GeForce GT 730 graphics card for $699, though that's just the $30 off the current price. If you need an XPS 8900 with more memory, there's one with 16GB of RAM that is a $729 Cyber Monday doorbuster at 3 p.m. Other Cyber Monday desktop sales include an Inspiron Small Desktop for the same price as on Black Friday, though this one has half the RAM and twice the hard drive capacity. A trio of other systems cost $529: a similarly slim Precision Tower 3420 comes with a Core i3, 4 gigs of memory, and a 500GB hard drive, the OptiPlex 3040 includes Core i5, 4GB of RAM, and 500GB hard drive, and an Inspiron with Core i5, 8 gigs of memory, and a terabyte hard drive. There are also a gaggle of Cyber Monday laptop sales. A 9 a.m. doorbuster is the midrange XPS 13 with Core i5, 8GB of RAM, 13.3-inch display, and 256GB solid-state drive for $949.99, followed by an 11 a.m. special on a Latitude 15 with Core i3 CPU, 4GB of memory, and 500 gigs of hard drive space for $429.

Lasta Nov 2, 2016 | 9:46 PM Apple finally unveiled a new line of MacBook Pro devices after a long wait and much speculation during these past few months. The press conference, called "Hello Again," that launched the redesigned MacBook Pro 2016 was held last Thursday in Cupertino, California. The only major features which are new to the MacBook Pro 2016 are the Touch ID, new processor, and the OLED panel in the upper portion keyboard. With this in mind, consumers wonder if they should even bother upgrading to the latest MacBook Pro or stick with their older version. New Features One of the most prominent features of the MacBook Pro 2016 is the Touch Bar. This is an OLED panel that is located at the top of the keyboard and supports multi-touch and changes interface depending on what app is currently in use. The MacBook Pro 2016 also has a Touch ID feature and is powered by a 6th gen Skylake processor. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit The MacBook Pro 2016 comes in two models, the base model which has a 13-inch screen, and a 15-inch screen model. The 13-inch screen version doesn't have an OLED Touch Bar, nor does it have the Touch ID feature. It runs with a 2.0-GHz dual-core Intel iCore i5 processor. It also has a 256 GB SSD and an Intel Iris Graphics 540 GPU. It starts off with an 8 GB RAM which you can upgrade to 16 GB. The most lavish version of the 15-inch model has a Touch Bar, 512 GB SSD, Intel HD Graphics 530, 2.7 GHz quad core Intel Core i7 processor and Radeon Pro 455 GPU. Both 13-inch and 15-inch versions have Force touch trackpads and butterfly keyboards. Aside from these new features, MacBook Pro 2016 and the MacBook Pro available last year has lots of similarities. For one, both models have the same Retina display, although the 2016 version is brighter by 67%. No Touch Screen Some fans and analysts are disappointed that the MacBook Pro 2016 doesn't have touch screen capabilities like the all-new Microsoft Surface Studio. According to Jon Fingas of Engadget, "Apple has made a point of publicly resisting the pressure to introduce touchscreen Macs. Computers need a fundamentally different interface than your smartphone or tablet, Apple argues, and it's cumbersome to keep raising your hand to the display." Still, Fingas adds that the addition of the OLED panel may be an acknowledgement from Apple that having touch input "can improve your computing experience." Price MacBook Pro 2015 model has a starting price of $1,299 while the 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 model is worth $1,499. The 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 is $1,999 and a newer version is worth $2,999.

Follow @JournalistNikki By NICOLE RAZ LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL Local drone industry insiders say they are working to make Nevada the industry’s “global destination of choice” and consistently tout Nevada as an industry leader. But is it? The Review-Journal caught up with several out-of-state industry experts at the Commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Expo held Monday through Wednesday at the MGM Grand to find out. In short, the answer is mostly yes, Nevada is an industry leader nationally, but the jury is still out on its place in the global industry. Baptiste Tripard, director of business development and strategy for strategy for Intel’s New Technology Group, which works on commercial drones, said Nevada is “a little bit ahead” because of its Federal Aviation Administration designation as an unmanned aerial systems test site. Nevada is the only state authorized as a test site; the other six test sites are state agencies, airports or universities. “Nevada, in the drone community, is recognized as one of the leading states for drones,” he said, because of its FAA designation and the relationship the state has formed with the FAA which is “leading drone growth.” For others, like Colorado-based Eric McCuaig, market manager at Trimble, Nevada definitely has some buzz, but it’s too soon to label any state as “the” industry leader. “I’ve heard about a lot of the initiatives that Nevada has taken, so I think they do have a leadership role,” said McCuaig. “A lot of states are getting into the UAS (unmanned aircraft system) space, Nevada has got a history, along with California, New Mexico and other places in terms of aviation, so I think that they’ll be right there with a lot of other states in a leadership position.” Bruce Carpenter, vice president of business development at Utah-based Fortem Technologies, similarly said Nevada is one of many states competing for such a title, and described Utah as the “mountain Silicon Valley.”   “There is nothing I can think of that delineates them (Nevada) as being an expert in a certain area outside of the other geographical locations. There’s a lot of universities involved in UAV development right now and there are a lot of large companies that are focused on it,” he said. “The great thing is there’s a diverse capability throughout the US and Nevada is contributing to that.” Everybody said the industry is infused with a healthy dose of competition, domestically and abroad. “The rules, in all areas (around the world), have all been moving along at a similar pace,” McCuaig said. Back in 2011, when Trimble was developing their UAS in Belgium, for example, the European rules they were operating under were a bit more streamlined than the US. McCuaig said that some things “would have been a lot more difficult to do” in the US at that time. But, today US regulations for drones have surpassed Europe’s, he said. Carpenter and McCuaig listed Israel, Poland and Australia as countries competing with US for the “global destination of choice” title. “There’s nothing wrong with Nevada being inspired to reach that level,” Carpenter said. “There’s some very healthy competition out there for them to deal with, but it’s definitely great goal for Nevada to want to maintain and hold onto.” Contact Nicole Raz at nraz@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4512.

Jaewon Kang Nov 4, 2016 3:22 PM EDT GoPro (GPRO)  is plummeting after yet another disappointing quarter, but investors of action camera chip supplier Ambarella (AMBA)  can keep their heads up. GoPro shares are down about 4% mid-day Friday to $11.45 after reporting a weak Q3 Thursday after the markets close. The actions camera maker missed revenue and earnings per share estimates, posting $240.6 million in revenue and loss of 60 cents per share. Analysts were anticipating $313.4 million in revenue and loss of 35 cents per share. GoPro, which also missed full-year revenue guidance and fourth-quarter projected revenue, has seen its shares continue to plummet after a series of weak execution with new gadgets. In fact, shares are down about 87% since its record-high of $86.97 in 2014.  While GoPro struggles to turn the corner along with other peers in the gadget sector such as FitBit (FIT) -- FitBit plummeted over 30% after disappointing earnings this week -- GoPro chip supplier Ambarella continues to move onward and upward.  Chipmaker Ambarella, which relied on GoPro for about 50% of revenue when it went public in 2012, has slowly but steadily diversified away from the camera maker and gained exposure to more stable markets. And the semi is well-positioned for further upside thanks to its unique video processing technology. Compared to 2015 when GoPro made up approximately 30% of Ambarella's revenue, GoPro is estimated to contribute to just 10%, said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy by phone, adding that the percentage will likely stay the same in 2017.  Ambarella is increasingly spending its capital toward other end-markets such as autonomous vehicles, Cassidy said.  "Home security is the fastest growing market," he said, adding that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based semi's long-term growth strategy has pivoted around diversification.  The semi has four main target markets: security, automotive, sports and broadcast content processing.   "The design of the chips is to handle video," Cassidy said, further explaining that other semis such as Qualcomm (QCOM) and Intel (INTC) have tried to gain exposure to video processing.  "This is a core technology that would make Ambarella attractive to acquire because they have a core technology that nobody else has," he added. Cassidy further said Qualcomm, Intel or even Nvidia (NVDA) could eventually take a look at Ambarella. Still, Nvidia hasn't historically been an active acquirer while Qualcomm just agreed to pay about $38 billion for NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) . Intel is currently digesting its $16.7 billion purchase of Altera last year.  Ambarella has also been growing over 20% annually and is run by a strong management team with impressive achievements.  Ambarella co-founder and CEO Feng-Ming Wang wrote the patent for MPEG and JPEG when he was working on his PhD degree. Company's CTO Les Kohn is the mind behind scalable processor architecture (SPARC) chips that are still used by Intel. His company Afara Websystems was bought in 2002 by Sun Microsystems, which was subsequently acquired by Oracle (ORCL) in 2009.  "These people are world class designers at the core," Cassidy said. Shares of Ambarella climbed up 3% mid-day Friday to $58.01. Ambarella is up about 4% year-to-date. NXP Semiconductors is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

Toggle navigation Blog Kubernetes Jobs Community Impressum Nov 4, 2016 New sandbox features in systemd Restricting the privileges of Linux services and reducing the actor vector has always been challenging. You need to adapt your software  or start looking for  a sandbox program or a manager that handles this for you. And at this moment you should look at systemd. systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system. systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons and keeps track of processes using Linux control groups. systemd also supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a replacement for sysvinit. [1] Securing services is not only useful for the cloud but also for the embedded and IoT industries. In a  world where all components are tied together, things move fast and you have to accelerate your development/shipping cycle, you need a manager for your services or applications that will keep you secure. It should 1) solve the most basic problems of system and service management in an efficient way. 2) handle security and sandbox operations. If your service is affected by a vulnerability, then you want to reduce the exposure. 3) handle resources consumption. 4) be reliable, stable and able to restart your services on failures. And this is where systemd enters the arena. systemd is supported by the major actors in the industry, for example Red Hat, Intel or SUSE. These players offer the resources to make it a reliable technology, while it covers all these issues we just listed. Current states In this quick summary we will show you some of the security features that help you secure your services and applications: 1) Set root directory for your service RootDirectory= | Sets the root directory for executed processes of the unit. It uses the plain old chroot() functionality. 2) Protect your file system and disk PrivateDevices=yes | Prevents your services from accessing the raw disks. 3) Disable network PrivateNetwork=yes | Securely turn off network access for executed processes of the unit. 4) Protect your file system ProtectSystem= | Makes /usr, /boot and even the full file system read only. Preventing any modification of the file system. This is particularly useful for Embedded Systems to support factory reset. 5) Private temporary directory  PrivateTmp=yes | Gives a private temporary file system for the processes of the unit that is not shared by other processes. 6) Set user, group and supplementary groups for your service User=, Group= , SupplementaryGroups= | Sets the user, group, and supplementary Unix groups under which the processes of the unit are executed. 7) Watchdog and restart your services on failure RuntimeWatchdogSec= of /etc/systemd/system.conf, ShutdownWatchdogSec=, WatchdogSec=, Restart=on-failure | Supports hardware and software watchdog features to allow the hardware to reset itself, or to enable automatic service restarts on failure using the software watchdog feature. 8) Control CPU usage LimitCPU=, CPUAccounting=, CPUQuota= | Turn on CPU accounting and sets the CPU limits for the processes of the unit. 9) Control Memory usage MemoryMax=, MemoryLow=, MemoryHigh= and TasksMax=N | Sets the memory limits for processes of the unit and the maximum number of tasks that can be created. 10) Control Linux Capabilities CapabilityBoundingSet= and AmbientCapabilities= | Sets which Linux capabilities the processes of the unit will have. 11) Block access to Linux interfaces SystemCallFilter= | Blocks access to Linux system calls. This is particular useful if there is a vulnerability in Linux and you want to block access to it. As an example you could block the recent Linux kernel madvise vulnerability [2] by using “SystemCallFilter=~madvise” . This blocks access to Linux madvice system call, thus effectively blocking all exploits. New security features: These are cool features, but there is more. Endocode engineers helped with and contributed to some new features that will improve the security of your system even more.   Here are some of the new features we just worked on: 1) Block loading and unloading arbitrary Linux kernel modules.

The UNYQ Align is described as a "personalised, fashionable and breathable" back brace by its makers UNYQ. The Seattle- and Seville-based company, which specialises in orthopaedic and prosthetic products, worked with 3D-printing pioneer Francis Bitonti and technology company Intel on the product. Braces are a common treatment for scoliosis, which affects an estimated 6 to 9 million people in the United States. "The condition typically develops in 10-15 year olds, occurring equally among both genders," said UNYQ in a statement. "Young girls, however, are eight times more likely to progress to a curve magnitude that requires treatment." As members of this demographic can be particularly self conscious about their appearance, the goal was to create a more discrete brace that wearers would feel comfortable in. Related story Cortex 3D-printed cast by Jake Evill Typically, the apparatus has to be worn for up to 18 hours a day to be most effective. "Traditional braces, which have not been advanced for half a decade, make it difficult for patients to reach the minimum recommended bracing period per day because they are constricting, bulky and perceived as unattractive," said UNYQ. Using digital design and algorithms, Bitonti's studio was able to create a lattice that has 75 per cent less material than its predecessor – the Boston Brace – but still provides the necessary support. The new form gives better manoeuvrability and looks less obtrusive, the team claims. "The first patient to try it on was very happy that she could actually bend from her waist when wearing it," Bitonti told Dezeen, "something she had never been able to do before." The brace is also embedded with tiny data-capturing computer modules developed by Intel, which allow the user to monitor their progress via an app. It debuted during an event at the White House earlier this year, and was presented as part of the FashioNXT event in Portland last month. "It's not everyday you see a medical device launch at a fashion show," said Bitonti. "UNYQ AlignTM demonstrates how innovative technologies, designers, and technologists can combine to revolutionise treatment of medical conditions and dramatically improve the lives of the people who rely on assistive devices." UNYQ Align will be available from a select number of hospitals in the US from early 2017 through a charter programme. "It's a momentous step forward and the launching point for further innovation to continuously advance scoliosis treatment," said UNYQ CEO Eythor Bender. 3D-printing is being used for a variety of medical purposes. Similar to the brace, the technology has been proposed for lattice-like casts for fractured bones. More complex applications involve printing replacements for missing sections of bone or whole body parts, and even internal organs – though the latter is still under development.

STMicro, Sony, and Intel could all benefit from buying the motion sensor maker. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 4, 2016 at 1:00PM Chipmaker InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) is reportedly interested in selling itself, according to multiple reports citing unnamed sources. InvenSense supplies motion sensors to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, and other mobile-device makers, but it's had a rough year because of rising competition and sluggish smartphone sales. Image source: InvenSense. Analysts expect the chipmaker's revenue to fall 24% this year, compared with 47% growth in 2015. Those bleak expectations sent the stock tumbling almost 40% over the past 12 months. With an enterprise value of just over $600 million, InvenSense now has an enterprise value-to-sales ratio of 1.6, making it a fairly cheap purchase for companies interested in its "best-in-breed" motion sensors -- accelerometers and gyroscopes. Let's take a closer look at the three most likely suitors for the struggling chipmaker. STMicroelectronics Chipmaker STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM), which competes directly against InvenSense in the motion-sensor market, could buy InvenSense to become the undisputed market leader in gyroscopes and accelerometers. With $1.68 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of last quarter, STMicro could theoretically acquire InvenSense in an all-cash transaction. STMicro previously supplied Apple with motion sensors for its iPhones, but InvenSense won that spot from the iPhone 6 onward. STMicro struck back at InvenSense by supplying the motion sensor for the Apple Watch, but Apple still apparently uses InvenSense sensors in the iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. By gobbling up InvenSense, STMicro would become Apple's primary supplier of gyroscopes and accelerometers, regardless of which brand the iPhone maker picks. But there's also a risk that Apple -- not wanting to let a single supplier gain too much clout -- could start buying its motion sensors from STMicro and Invensense's rival Bosch instead. Sony InvenSense would also be a good fit for Sony (NYSE:SNE), which could use its motion sensors to complement its camera, image sensor, and Internet of Things (IoT) businesses. It would be a fairly cheap purchase for Sony, which finished last quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and equivalents. InvenSense is mainly known for its smartphone motion sensors, but it also supplies optical image stabilization sensors for cameras. Sony produces its own optical image stabilization sensors, but that unit could benefit from merged technologies and the inclusion of InvenSense's customer list. InvenSense also has a rapidly growing IoT business, which provides motion sensors for wearables, drones, and other devices. That unit would directly complement Sony's acquisition of IoT 4G chipmaker Altair earlier this year and enable it to grow its content share across various connected devices. Integrating InvenSense's motion sensors could also help Sony tighten up the supply chain and reduce operating costs at its mobile unit -- the same reason Apple and Samsung use first-party silicon in many of their own devices. Intel Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the world's top manufacturer of PC and data center chips, has been stuck in a rut because of weak growth in both markets. Its inability to penetrate the mobile market also forced it to seek growth in other markets, such as IoT modules, programmable chips, non-volatile memory, and depth-sensing cameras. One of Intel's key strategies to expand beyond PCs and data centers is to create all-in-one "reference designs" that enable OEMs to quickly create devices such as drones and VR headsets. These designs bundle together Intel's chips, RealSense depth-sensing cameras, and other first-party components to widen its moat against larger rivals. Intel's Project Alloy. Image source: Intel. Intel's VR/AR headset reference design, a standalone device dubbed "Project Alloy," is powered by Intel's sixth-generation Core processor and RealSense camera. It's unclear who supplied the gyroscopes and accelerometers, but Intel could certainly beef up that bundle with InvenSense's sensors. The same could also be said about Intel's reference designs for drones or other IoT gadgets. With $17.8 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of last quarter, InvenSense would be a bite-sized purchase for Intel. But will InvenSense actually be acquired? It makes strategic sense for STMicro, Sony, or Intel to buy InvenSense, but it's also logical to simply wait for InvenSense to become cheaper. With sales slipping and the company struggling to defend its moat against bigger rivals, it seems InvenSense could become even cheaper over the next few quarters. Therefore, investors shouldn't buy InvenSense with the expectation that it could be acquired in the near future. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Insights on Mac's upcoming future Listen | Print By Claudio Buttice     Nov 4, 2016 in Technology 2016 was quite a bad year for Mac users, and many keep asking if Apple still cares about the underwhelming future of what now seems to be a second-rate product. The entire 2016 has been quite devoid of major Mac announcements and updates about the new products, making everyone anxious about what's the real future that Apple devised for this line of goods. Even the new MacBook Pro is long overdue, clearly showing how Apple is neglecting its high-end PCs instead of using these products as a spearhead to drive off competition. While iMac, Mac Pro, or Mac mini weren't so fortunate and never saw any update, even the MacBook Pro seems to be quite limited with its just 16GB of RAM and Intel’s Core i5 and i7 chip, compared to the forthcoming Microsoft Surface Studio and its innovative touchscreen technology. Apple did not even care about waiting a few more months for the next-generation quad-core Kaby Lake processor to become available before releasing the current model, worrying Mac users with what seemed to be a "we couldn't care less" attitude. One of the most widely advertised features of Macs is their alleged superior security that led many users into thinking that their computers were completely free from all kind of vulnerabilities. Expert users could prevent unauthorized access without any third-party program with a powerful built-in feature to encrypt the various Mac folders, and many new tools like Little Flocker and BlockBlock added further layers of security to an environment that is universally thought of as one the safest around. However, Mac OS X is all but invulnerable to outside attacks, as showed by the recent Russian "Fancy Bear" hacker group hit. Their "Komplex" Trojan did not exploit a software vulnerability: instead, the cyber espionage group simply used a phishing email to unload their payload in the form of an executable code disguised as a PDF. Today's users need to use their own Mac OS X VPNs to protect their browsing much like PC users, losing more and more ground against the simpler and more appealing Windows operating systems. Apple keeps putting Mac products in a declining category of run-of-the-mill classic "keyboard and mouse" devices that, although far from being obsolete yet, is not cutting-edge or avant-garde either. The new MacBook Pro seems to be more optimized for lightness and thinness rather than power and high-end computing features, a strategy that, although viable, yet again sounds much more like 2014 than 2016. Mac users always have been more interested in computer specs rather than design, and even this choice seemed to be at least questionable. If Apple will not renew its entire line of Mac products within a few months, including the largely overlooked iMac and Mac Pro, there's a distinct possibility that the whole line will fail to get through 2017.

Looks Undervalued at Today’s Levels (AAPL) Nov 4, 2016, 11:00 am EST  |  By , Zacks Investment Research     View All   Those of us who have seen Apple Inc. (AAPL) growing unit sales quarter upon quarter despite what may be going on in the PC and smartphone markets, tend to overlook the fact that these things affect Apple too. And how well a company manages these factors relative to peers gives us a fair idea of how it’s really doing. What’s Bitten the PC Market As Intel Corporation (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich said earlier this year, the PC replacement cycle has gotten longer: “Four years was the average, now it has moved to about five to six years.” And that’s mainly because older Intel Sandy Bridge processors are able to run the latest operating systems from Microsoft Corporation (MSFT). But there’s another reason: users in traditional markets have multiple devices taking care of most of their needs while the majority in emerging markets prefers smartphones, tablets, phablets, etc. since these take care of most computing needs. Apple, which has a greater presence in traditional markets, didn’t do well in the September quarter. According to IDC, its worldwide Mac shipments fell 13.0% while U.S. shipments fell 13.2%. Apple lost notable market share. Gartner’s numbers are slightly better: although worldwide shipments declined 13.4%, U.S. shipments were down 10.7%. What About The Smartphone Market? IDC estimates that the overall smartphone market grew a mere 1%, driven by Chinese brands OPPO, vivo and Huawei in that order. Samsung, Apple and the “other“ group declined with Apple declining the least. The highlights of these results is that OPPO and vivo grew triple digits with strength in China because of offline marketing expertise and some Western European countries as part of new athletic sponsorships, according to IDC. OPPO has been more focused on international markets particularly India, while vivo has focused on tier 3 to tier 5 Chinese cities and also grown in India. New phone models are helping the Chinese players. How Organized Is Apple? From the above, two questions come to mind. Why is Apple losing share in the PC market? And second, will its smartphone decline continue, particularly in China? On the call, management explained the seeming lack of demand for Apple devices: “We ended the quarter below our four to five week target range for Mac channel inventory.” and… “We also reduced channel inventory [of iPhones] by over 4 million units compared to about 0.5 million units a year ago, so sell-through was down by 8%.” and also… “By far, the largest portion of our global channel inventory reduction [of iPhones] was in Greater China.” Most of us don’t buy a phone or a PC everyday so when an upgrade is in the offing, it would be natural to wait for it. This is even truer of enterprise buyers, i.e. the ones that buy in bulk. In Apple’s case, the Mac was due for an upgrade and the iPhone had just got a refresh. 7 Growth Stocks That Should Replace Apple in Your Portfolio What happens to older inventory? Is it a good idea to trash it, discount it, or clear it? Apple took the last option, which is what any management would do unless they were trying to manage the business from quarter to quarter. As a result, the company can now look forward to a seasonally stronger quarter where it can sell a good number of higher-ASP devices. We may expect some bulk purchasing as well because “corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.” Management also quoted survey results from 451 Research indicating demand for iPhones in the U.S.: Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measured a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating with purchase intention for this quarter at 75%. Among consumers, the customer satisfaction rating is 97% and purchase intent 65%. But what’s really on the minds of Apple investors?

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Microsoft Surface Book 2 Fans Momentarily Get their Thirst Quenched with the Release of the Hybrid Surface Book i7, More Details Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 05, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» On October 26, Microsoft launched the Surface Book hybrid which it officially named as Surface Book i7. It is definitely not the long-awaited Microsoft Surface Book 2 but it somehow quenched the thirst of fans for the latest laptop line from the Redmondian company. The following day, it was the turn of Apple to launch its long-awaited 2016 MacBook Pro which prompted tech analysts to deduce that the Surface Book i7 is meant to go head-to-head with the 2016 MacBook Pro or vice versa, notes Neurogadget. The Surface Book i7 offers up to 16 hours of battery life, which is 30% more than the original Surface Book, but it runs on the same processors as the 2016 Macbook Pro range, which is why it is named as i7. Microsoft no longer waited until next year, when the seventh generation Kaby Lake series from Intel will hit the market, so it opened pre-orders for the new Surface Book i7 on the Microsoft Store. Those who pre-ordered the device can get their units as early as November 10. Comparing the two new devices The Surface Book i7 and the 2016 MacBook Pro both look great, have a powerful software, and also come with a high price tag. One thing that seems to go in favor of the Surface Book i7 is the fact that its display is detachable and is also touch screen. The 2016 MacBook Pro is just touch screen. The new Surface Book i7 keeps the same design as the original Surface Book, including the slightly divisive hinge that means the laptop does not fully close. The screen can detach from the body and be used as a tablet. The laptop has a magnesium alloy body. On the other hand, the 2016 MacBook Pro is lighter and thinner than its previous models. It has an all-metal body and keeps the same simple, but stylish look, albeit with a few tweaks, such as a much larger touchpad. The 2016 MacBook Pro is available in two screen sizes – 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch while the Surface Book i7 only comes in one size – 13.5-inch, details Betanews. The 2016 MacBook Pro features Touch ID, so users can log into the laptop using a fingerprint. Surface Book i7 does not have a fingerprint scanner but does have Windows Hello, which uses facial recognition to log the user in. The Surface Book i7 and the 2016 MacBook Pro can both be had in a choice of configurations, so users can opt for a sixth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processor. More important among the considerations and comparisons are the prices of the variants. The price for the entry-level 2016 MacBook Pro starts at $1,499, but it would not have the Touch Bar for that. For models with a Touch Bar, the cost is $1,799, particularly for the 13.3-inch display and the Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. The price for the 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro, with Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and Radeon Pro 450 graphics, starts at $2,399. The price of the Surface Book i7 starts at $1,349, for which the user gets the Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD. There is also the i7 version, with 256GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM, and it costs $2,399. The 1TB version with 16GB RAM of i7 version is pegged at $3,299. The better deal Critics believe that the Surface Book i7 is the better all around deal, and the screen can be used as a tablet, which is a welcome bonus. The 2016 MacBook Pro, on the other hand, is a svelte beast, with good looks, and future-proof ports which might require the user to use a dongle or two, but which will be standard in the coming years. Meanwhile, the Microsoft Surface Book 2 has been previously rumored to come out last month along with the Surface Pro 5. But that did not happen.

Equity indices stumbled in the opening hour as a reversal in crude oil and weakness in the influential technology sector weighed on the broader market. This was the eighth successive drop for Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a sixth straight day, declining 28.97 points, or 0.2%, to close at 17,930.67. The Nasdaq Composite fell 47.16 points, or 0.9%, to 5,058.41, as Facebook, one of its largest components, dropped sharply. The S&P 500 finished down 9.28 points, or 0.4%, at a nearly four-month closing low of 2,088.66, with eight of the main 11 sectors closing lower. The tech and health care sectors led the decliners, each with a 1% loss. Eighteen out of thirty Dow components ended lower with shares of Pfizer and Intel dragging on the average. A number of economic reports, including jobless claims, productivity data, factory orders and the nonmanufacturing ISM survey, largely underlined a theme of steady economic growth and were seen as strong enough to justify expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its December meeting. The central bank kept interest rates unchanged Wednesday, but signaled that it's inching closer to a December interest-rate hike. Oil began the day on a modestly higher note, rebounding from its recent losing streak. The energy component has been under pressure in recent days as investors reassess the previously announced OPEC supply freeze agreement and mull over some disappointing weekly inventory data. WTI crude slipped below the $45.00/bbl in the opening hour, finishing down 2.0% at $44.45/bbl. Shares in Facebook closed down 5.7% after the social-media giant warned late Wednesday that growth rates for its advertising revenue will come down meaningfully. Among economic reports expected for the day, the number of people who applied for unemployment benefits at the end of October rose by 7,000 to a three-month high of 265,000, but the rate of layoffs in the U.S. remains extremely low. Initial claims for the week ending October 29 rose by 7,000 to 265,000 (consensus 256,000). Continuing claims for the week ending October 22 decreased by 14,000 to 2.026 million. Meanwhile, American firms and employees boosted their productivity in the third quarter for the first time in 2016, but the longer-term trend is still a poor one that bodes ill for the U.S. economy. Nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased at a 3.1% annual rate in the third quarter (consensus 1.8%). This was the first increase after three consecutive quarterly declines and was further underpinned by an upward revision to second quarter productivity to -0.2% from -0.6%. Separate report showed that factory orders rose 0.3% in September. Meanwhile, ISM services index fell to 54.8% in October from 57.1%, below the 56% forecast. Treasuries finished on a mixed note as the long end of the curve underperformed. The yield on the 2-yr note finished flat (0.82%) while the yield on the 10-yr note finished the day up one basis point (1.81%). Today's trading volume was above the average of 860 million as more than 880 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will include the 8:30 ET release of the September Trade Balance (consensus -$38.5 billion) and the Employment Situation Report for October. Market expects the jobs report to show an increase of 175,000 in nonfarm payrolls.

Nicholas New hopes some of it will be worked on by a processor that parses data using laser light, built by his U.K. startup, Optalysys. New says his company’s exotic approach to crunching data can dramatically upgrade a conventional computer by taking over some of the most demanding work in applications such as genomics and simulating weather. “The grunt work can be done by the optics,” he says. Researchers have worked on the idea of using optics rather than electronics to process data for decades, with little commercial traction. But New argues that it is now needed because manufacturers such as Intel admit that they can’t keep improving conventional chips at the pace they used to (see “Moore’s Law Is Dead. Now What?”). Manipulating laser beams encoded with data offers a shortcut on certain tricky computing operations. Optalysys’s technology performs a mathematical function called the Fourier transform by encoding data, say a genome sequence, into a laser beam. The data can be manipulated by making light waves in the beam interfere with one another, performing the calculation by exploiting the physics of light, and generating a pattern that encodes the result. The pattern is read by a camera sensor and fed back into a conventional computer’s electronic circuits. The optical approach is faster because it achieves in a single step what would take many operations of an electronic computer, says New. The technology was enabled by the consumer electronics industry driving down the cost of components called spatial light modulators, which are used to control light inside projectors. The company plans to release its first product next year, aimed at high-performance computers used for processing genomic data. It will take the form of a PCI express card, a standard component used to upgrade PCs or servers usually used for graphics processors. Optalysys is also working on a Pentagon research project investigating technologies that might shrink supercomputers to desktop size, and a European project on improving weather simulations. French startup LightOn, founded earlier this year, has also built a system that uses optical tricks to process data being carried by laser light. The company is targeting a trick used in machine learning that compresses information by multiplying it with random data. That technique is useful, but onerous for conventional computers working with large data sets, says Laurent Daudet, LightOn’s chief technology officer and a professor of physics at the Université Paris Diderot. His system gets the same effect more easily by exploiting the random scattering that naturally occurs when light passes through translucent material. “Computers really suck at this, [but] you can use nature to do it instead,” says Daudet. He and LightOn’s two other founders published results last year showing how that works. The company  is working to show its system can perform other operations, too, and aims to put a new prototype online as a cloud service for others to experiment with, says Daudet. The timing is good for these startups. Recognition that existing chip designs will no longer improve at the exponential pace they used to is making the industry more open to new ideas, says Horst Simon, deputy director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “As conventional chips don’t get faster any more, alternative routes look more attractive,” says Simon. Those alternative routes include quantum computers and chip designs specialized for AI, as well as optical computing systems. Simon doubts that optical technology will take over all kinds of computing, but says it might finally find a practical place. “There may be niche applications where its performance makes sense,” he says.

If accurate, it means at least some early Thunderbolt 3 docks already on the market will not work with Apple’s newest Mac laptop. Apple’s New MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Message from Plugable: On the product page for Plugable’s Thunderbolt 3 product line, the company posted the following note: Update 11/3/16: The version of OS X on the new MacBook Pros (late 2016) will not work with existing Certified Thunderbolt 3 docks and adapters (released prior to November 2016). These existing devices use Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 chipset (Alpine Ridge) in combination with the first generation of TI USB-C chipset (TPS65982). Apple requires the 2nd generation TPS65983 chipset for peripherals to be compatible. Certification of solutions across different device types is still in-progress for this 2nd generation chipset. From the Plugable product line, our dual display graphics adapters for DisplayPort and HDMI (TBT3-DP2X and TBT3-HDMI2X) are affected and are disabled by OS X on the new MacBooks. So we offer these products as Windows-only Thunderbolt 3 devices until a future hardware update. Our Thunderbolt 3 cables do not require this chip, and therefore are compatible. We’ve also made the difficult decision to postpone our TBT3-UD1 Docking Station to update to the TPS65983 chipset and re-certify to make this docking station MacBook-compatible. Our Flagship TBT3-UDV dock with Power Delivery/Charging was already planned to use the next generation controller chip from TI, and will be compatible with the 2016 Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks. We’ll continue to post updates with new Thunderbolt™ 3 product and release information as it becomes available. Unknowns There are a bunch of unknowns, starting with whether or not Apple might change its mind on supporting the first generation chips. Thunderbolt 3 has been a tad fluid in terms of specs—it seems quite likely that Apple decided some aspect of this first generation chip cause more problems than is worth it. So…could Apple change its corporate mind? It would be nifty if the company didn’t alienate early adopters of Thunderbolt 3, not to mention those companies looking to press the boundaries just like Apple is doing. We don’t know yet, and Apple hasn’t yet commented on the issue. If and when Apple does comment, we’ll post.

Nayar California's attorney general Kamala Harris (left) and Washington state Senator Pramila Jayapal Washington, Nov. 3: Next week's legislative elections in America concurrent with choosing a new US President will set a new record which few people are talking about: yet it is very important for India and for Americans of Indian origin. The new US Congress will have a record representation by men and women of Indian origin. Women in America are openly exulting that next Tuesday's voting could take female representation in both chambers of Congress to more than 20 per cent for the first time. Also, depending on whether you are a rich American, not-so-rich or a poor citizen, the millionaire class which will proliferate the next Senate has become a hot potato or a matter of pride in the ongoing election campaign. But the record about to be set in legislative representation is a landmark in the history of Indian immigration to the US. Although Indian American presence on Capitol Hill will go up by record numbers, it will still not be as high as in Canada where Punjabi is the fourth most spoken language in its House of Commons. Not yet. If all goes well for Kamala Harris in Tuesday's voting in California, she will become the first American with Indian roots to become a member of the US Senate. Harris is California's incumbent attorney general. In nearby Washington state, Pramila Jayapal is equally on the way to making history for the Indian American community if she is elected - a virtual certainty going by opinion polls - to the US House of Representatives on Tuesday. The US Congress has never had an Indian American woman in its ranks. Jayapal is an incumbent state Senator in Washington. She will replace a retiring Congressman who has a stellar record of helping India and promoting Indo-US friendship although he is racially white. Jim McDermott, one of the founding members of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, represented Seattle and neighbouring areas in the House for just under 28 years. In a part of Silicon Valley which is home to technology firms Apple, Intel, Yahoo! and eBay, Ro Khanna, a former Stanford University lecturer who is only 40, is likely to replace incumbent fellow Democrat Mike Honda. California's curious election law allows the two top contenders from the same party to contest against each other in the poll. Another near certain win next week contributing to the new record is Raja Krishnamoorthi who is contesting in Illinois for a seat being vacated by incumbent Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, a fellow Democrat. When Louisiana's Bobby Jindal was elected to the House of Representatives in 2004, Indian Americans were over the moon. Since Dalip Singh Saund in 1956, no Indian American had gone to Capitol Hill as an elected representative in the lower chamber of Congress. When Jindal was elected Louisiana's governor five years later Indian Americans once again became unrepresented in the US national legislature although their disappointment was tempered in due course by having him - and later in 2011 - Nikki Haley, South Carolina's incumbent governor in two significant gubernatorial positions in America. Ami Bera filled that gap in 2012 when he was elected to the House from California. He and Tulsi Gabbard - who is not Indian, but Hindu - have since become emblematic of Indian causes on Capitol Hill. Bera faces a tough contest this year and Indian Americans fear he may not be re-elected. Although she has only been in a state-level contest the cynosure of this election season for people with Indian roots in this country has been Kesha Ram, who unsuccessfully ran in the Democratic primaries for Vermont's Lieutenant Governor. She continues to be a member of Vermont's General Assembly. Her popularity among Indian Americans is owed to her success eight years ago in being elected to the state legislature at the age of 22, the youngest member of the community to win any public office in the US. Meanwhile, widespread expectations of a Hillary Clinton victory in the presidential election have prompted Indian Americans to lobby with her campaign for positions in the next US administration, especially in a Clinton cabinet. Among the Indian American front-runners is Neera Tanden, president of a Democratic-leaning think tank, the Centre for American Progress. Speculation is rife that Tanden could be in the next cabinet as the secretary for health and human services. Clinton has promised that if elected, 50 per cent of her cabinet will be made up of women. Since her victory, if it comes through, is significantly owed to African Americans, Hispanics and Asians, Clinton will go out of her way to ensure ethnic diversity in her administration. Tanden's strength is that she worked for the drafting and adoption of Obamacare formally known as the Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama's signature health care reform which Clinton has pledged to uphold. Circles close to John Kerry, the secretary of state who succeeded Clinton when she quit to enter the presidential campaign, indicated that Richard Verma, the incumbent US ambassador to India, could be the next Permanent Representative to the UN, a position with cabinet rank in the American system. Ajay Banga, who headed the US-India Business Council for several years, the president and CEO of Mastercard, is being talked about for a senior economic position in the Clinton administration as is Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general. Other Indian American names doing the rounds are Vivek Murthy, the current US surgeon general, and Raj Shah, whom Obama appointed as head of the US Agency for International Development.  More stories in International Kunis slams sexist Hollywood producer 20 die in Pak mishap    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

Login Search Close Update: S&P 500 and Nasdaq Poised for Eighth Day of Declines as Facebook, Election Jitters Weigh November 03, 2016, 04:28:33 PM EDT By MT Newswires, MT Newswires Shutterstock photo Wall Street extended losses on Thursday, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite marking eight straight days of declines and the Dow Jones Industrial Average in its sixth consecutive retreat as Facebook's ( FB ) warning of slower revenue and jitters about next week's election weighed on investors' sentiment. Polls have shown a tightening race between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump ahead of the Nov. 8 vote. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as the Vix, soared 16% late in the session to the highest since late June, when voters in the UK jolted markets by deciding to leave the European Union. On the S&P 500, most of the 11 sectors were weaker, led by a 1% drop each in information technology and health care. The Dow spent much of the day swinging between gains and losses before settling on a path lower. Blue-chip Pfizer ( PFE ) continued to slide following its earnings miss earlier in the week and Intel ( INTC ) retreated 2% amid the tech sector weakness. Fitbit ( FIT ) cratered 34% after cutting its 2016 outlook and took GoPro ( GPRO ) down 7% in step ahead of its own earnings release due after the close. Garmin (GRMN) was also lower by 1.5%. Energy stocks ended 0.3% higher, defying a slide in US crude futures, which were down 1.5% to $44.66 late in the day. Utilities were up 0.4% and financials added 0.1%. The day's data showed initial jobless claims rose by 7,000 to 265,000 in the final week of October, but the rate of layoffs in the U.S. remained extremely low. The October Institute for Supply Management services Purchasing Managers' Index slipped to 54.8 after a September surge to an 11-month high of 57.1 and missing economists' expectations. Investors will turn their attention Friday morning to the key non-farm payrolls data, which is expected by analysts to show an increase to 178,000 from September's initial outturn of 156,000. Here's where the markets stood by the close: US MARKETS Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 28.97 points (-0.16%) S&P 500 was down 9.28 points (-0.44%) Nasdaq Composite Index was down 47.16 points (-0.92%) GLOBAL SENTIMENT FTSE 100 was down 0.8% Nikkei 225 was closed Hang Seng Index was down 0.56% Shanghai China Composite Index was up 0.84% UPSIDE MOVERS (+) IQNT (+35%) Being bought by GTCR LLC for $23 per share cash (+) LHCG (+14.9%) Raises 2016 guidance after beating Street earnings, revenue estimates (+) KTOS (+10.5%) Fiscal Q3 earnings swing to profit, tops estimates DOWNSIDE MOVERS (-) DPLO (-42.2%) Q3 results miss Street estimates, lowers 2016 guidance (-) FSLR (-15%) Posts Q3 earnings beat, revenue miss, lowers 2016 revenue guidance (-) SFM (-11.3%) Q3 earnings fall 24% and expenditures rise (-) WYNN (-9.3%) Misses Q3 earnings estimates, Stifel cuts PT (-) CS (-8%) Posts steep drop in quarterly profit but tops estimates (-) OZM (-4.6%) Fitch downgrades credit rating The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.

Weapons qualification is a part of the 369th Sustainment Brigade's mobilization requirements for their upcoming deployment to Kuwait this fall. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. Cesar E. Leon) (Photo Credit: Sgt. Cesar Leon) VIEW ORIGINAL During the unit's post-mobilization training at Fort Hood Soldiers took part in a Mission Readiness Exercise that resembled a recent "Warfighter" exercise the brigade headquarters took part in at Fort Carson, Colorado, earlier in the year. The difference? Refinement of their skills to better prepare the unit for how things are done in Kuwait. The purpose of the Warfighter is to train Soldiers how to perform their duties in a combat environment. However, the MRX, conducted by First Army Division West and the United States Army Reserves 75th Training Division at Fort Hood, focuses on skill refinement and what units will encounter while deployed to Kuwait. "They have Soldiers here (Fort Hood) from the current unit that are there (Kuwait) now to give some real world things that are going on there now," said Warrant Officer Claudiann A. Atkinson, 1st Sustainment Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, about the MRX. Atkinson also emphasized the importance of the MRX because of how it gives the unit materials and experiences they need to be familiar with the areas they are going to so when they get there it's a more familiar place. The importance of the training at Fort Carson, Indiantown Gap, and Fort Hood was not lost on the Soldiers of the 369th, especially those new to the ranks. "As a newer Soldier to the unit, and the Army in general, our training was essential," said Spc. Kyle Beckley, an Intelligence Analyst for the 369th Sustainment Brigade. "The training provided life-like simulations in a tactical environment that helped me acclimate both to my duties as an Intel Analyst, and also as a member of the team," Beckley added. When the 369th Sustainment Brigade's MRX kicked off there were some bumps in the road. As with any team or organization each section needed to find their rhythm and get in sync to work towards the end goal of becoming a cohesive team. "I feel as unit you are better at the end of training then at the beginning," said Atkinson. "Initially there were some synchronization issues and some sections didn't really completely understand their roles and responsibilities," she added. "From then until now there has been a drastic change," added Atkinson. "Everyone needs to understand their roles and responsibilities and they need to communicate together if they want to complete the mission effectively." The intent of all the training the unit has conducted over the past year is to help prepare them for the mission ahead. Over the years things like political climate change making it difficult to train for every possible condition or scenario. But that doesn't make training less important. "You need to be prepared because every war is going to be different, you can't train the same way that you did for your first deployment that you are going to do for this deployment. It is not always going to be the same. That is why this training is so important," said Atkinson. At the end of the day readiness is the key to success and the Soldiers of the 369th feel they are ready to take on the challenge and are confident in their abilities to succeed. "Our team proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are ready, willing and able to stand in the wake of real world events and adjust, adapt, and overcome anything that presents itself," said Sgt. 1st Class Charles Tomsella, assistant NCOIC, Current Operations Assistant. Soldiers also completed training they didn't complete during the unit's pre-mobilization training conducted at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, August 8-27. Soldiers qualified on their assigned weapon and also completed counter-IED training.

Intel is taking another step into the worlds of virtual reality and sports technology with plans to buy a small company called Voke that sells immersive sports video equipment. The move comes months after Intel bought Replay Technologies to expand its presence in such areas as 3D video, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), and less than two week after the chip maker announced the creation of the Intel Sports division, which will pursue opportunities in what Intel officials call the "digitization of sports." No financial details were released regarding the purchase of 12-year-old Voke. The deal is also part of Intel's larger strategy to extend its reach in the area of immersive computing, which includes technologies such as VR and AR. The chip maker already has used 360-degree camera technology from Replay for such events as the NBA All-Star Game and the X-Games in Aspen, Colo. Now the company will be able to expand what it can do in the immersive sports market. "Virtual reality (VR), or what Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has stated as 'merged' reality, is an important building block for delivering a truly immersive sports experience, one that uses computing power to deliver virtual-world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before," James Carwana, general manager of the Intel Sports Group, wrote in a post on the company blog. "Imagine being able to witness a slam dunk from the defender's perspective or the defensive rush from the quarterback's perspective. This kind of experience may sound futuristic, but it's closer than you think." Intel is looking to expand into a broad array of emerging growth markets, including VR, drones, autonomous vehicles, the internet of things (IoT), the cloud, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Under Krzanich, the company is moving  beyond its legacy as a PC and server chip supplier, and now sees a role, not only in many of the systems in these emerging markets, but also as the foundational technology supplier for the supporting infrastructure. With VR, the chip maker's efforts include its work on such products as the RealSense 3D camera technology, acquisitions of such companies as Replay, Voke and, in September, Movidius, and investments in others, including Dysonics and InContext Solutions. Voke's TrueVR portfolio includes stereoscopic cameras that can capture 180- to 360-degree views of events, from the NCAA Final Four basketball tournament to the New York Fashion Week shows. Users can view the events through a range of devices, from VR headsets to PCs, tablets and smartphones. In addition, the technology enables events to be live-streamed in VR. Intel could pair the Voke TrueVR products with the freeD technology the chip maker picked up in the deal for Replay. The Replay cameras are placed all around an event—such as a baseball or basketball game—and software in servers then stitches the images together to give users a seamless 360-degree view of the event. The team from Replay that developed the freed technology is now part of Intel's Sports Group, according to Carwana.           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Apple And PayPal Enable Payments Through Siri Voice Commands Revamped Google Play Music to Use Machine Learning to Suggest Songs Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Read More More Other Filters Crafting a Touchable World with Juicy Feedback in VR for Luna November 3, 2016 4:10 PM | Lena LeRay Luna, due out next spring, is a fable about recovering from mistakes. A baby bird gets tricked into eating the last of the waning moon by an owl and is immediately swept away by a storm. When the bird, named Luna, awakes, it's forgotten everything and must populate the terrarium around it with life to regain its memories and find its way home. The game is currently in development for PC and PC-enabled VR, and Funomena's Robin Hunicke shares her thoughts with us about creating a touchable world with juicy feedback that can serve as an ambassador about the magic of VR. "I've been drawing the Luna bird in my notebook for years," says Hunicke. "Initially, when I designed it, it was a side-scrolling musical platformer. Now it's a musical, 3D sculpture-toy creativity game. It was transformed by the technology." Originally, Funomena was developing Luna for Intel's gesture-enabled RealSense cameras, but the introduction of special controllers for VR struck the team as an opportunity to create a touchable world. "The overarching feeling on the team was that being able to look down into the terrarium and rotate it and feel the space the same way that you do when you're building it in, like, Maya, was just such a beautiful way to share the experience with people," says Hunicke. "Always looking at different spots to be able to see the whole thing. Just like a little toy world. We just thought that would be fantastic, so in the end it really won us over." In the interest of creating their touchable world, the Luna team prototypes environments with physical objects. Most of the game takes place in a bowl-shaped terrarium, so they bought a big serving bowl and built a little landscape of sculpted hydrophobic sand, Playmobil toys, and an assortment of odds and ends made from materials like pipe cleaners. "We use them to sort of play the space, and actually we've found that that's been a very instrumental part of the development cycle," Hunicke explains. They build an environment physically first before making a rough version in the engine, testing it, and iterating again on the physical prototype. "It's very fluid compared to working on a more standard process." Sometimes, the developers also use the physical props in discussions of how the individual pieces of the game should act. A pipe cleaner representation of a flower is useful for testing the arrangement of objects in the terrarium space, but flicking it and watching it jiggle can also give the team an idea of how that flower might react to player interaction while they play. "The whole idea with games like Journey or Flow or Flower, for example, that we always talked about at GDC was this idea of juicy feedback," says Hunicke. "Martin [Middleton] and I really believe that that's core to the experience of a really well designed game that has less to do with, like, rules and achievement and more to do with experience and the sense of accomplishment through exploration. So with VR, it's like ten times [as important]. "The best example that we have in the game right now is rocks," she continues. "We made a pile of rocks; you could throw the rocks around and they would sail through the sun and there'd be no sound effect. Or they'd land in the water and there were no ripples or splashes. Right now, you can balance them on a lily pad and the lily pad doesn't sink. You have to start to physically simulate all the interactions between the rocks and every other object in the environment." Hunicke compares the problem of having throwable rocks in VR to that of adding something like rope or a deck of cards to an adventure game. In reality, these objects are very versatile, capable of enabling many solutions to problems. A game designer, however, only has the resources to implement a limited number of possible uses. "People's imaginations will just run wild, and then they'll only feel the edges of the game," she points out. One big issue the Luna team is facing is making the player's in-game hands feel as real as possible. The player's hands can go through everything, but none of the objects react to that happening. There is no audio or sound to go with it. The player's hands in the game look kind of like flowers opening and closing, but there's no feedback for when the player's hand completely closes. "I want to put in a little sound," says Hunicke. "Just a tick to let you know know that it's fully closed. It's like when you're a baby: once you learn to snap, you'll do it. Once you learn to clap, you'll clap, because you're engaging with the idea that this pressure and the sound is you hitting you. It's VR; you're new; that's all new." Another challenge they've faced is in wrestling with the sharp contrast between the power grip that controllers, both VR and traditional, are made for and the delicate grabbing motion Hunicke wants for Luna. "Both the Vive and the Touch controllers are built for a certain engagement," she says. "[It's] kind of like a strong posture. It engages your arm and your hand in a way that makes you feel a certain way and I really want them to be [a grabbing, pinching motion]." Even with the feedback not being as juicy as Hunicke wants yet, PAX attendees who tried the game had no trouble understanding the controls. Funomena had about 500 people per day try the game that weekend, many of them women and children. Many of those players had never used VR before. Nonetheless, the reactions they got were in line with what the team had been hoping for. "We had a girl who said, 'It's the kind of game you want to play when you're having a bad day,' " Hunicke says with a laugh. "A lot of kids would get in the headset and immediately dive in and look all around and put their heads inside of everything, look underwater, and make all these excited remarks. We had one young boy, like a nine year old, who, as soon as the turtle appeared at the end of the demo, dropped the controllers and hugged it. Hunicke was pleased with how the game resounded with women. "A lot of women would just take the headset off and say, 'I didn't think that VR was for me. I wasn't really sure if I was gonna like it. It seems like it's an intense experience. I was expecting it to be intense. I was a little afraid to give it a shot, but it was so relaxing and calming. This is exactly the kind of game I would play!' "I want it to be an expander title that someone can download and share with someone with very little experience and go, 'This is why VR is magical.' It isn't all shooting stuff or things flying at your face. It can be kind of a chill, creative, meditative experience," Hunicke continues. "That's what I wanted to build, and so to hear that, we were just thrilled." The team had been nervous about showing the game at PAX, unsure if it would be as well received as they hoped. Players' reactions gave them a confidence boost, making them feel like they were on the right track in spite of their mistakes along the way. And that, says Hunicke, is really what Luna is about. "A lot of games are about getting revenge or going back in time to fix mistakes, but that's not how it works in the real world," Hunicke says. "In the real world, when you make a mistake, you have to kinda learn to talk about it, share your story with other people, and then by listening to their stories realize that you're not alone. "And that's pretty much what the game is about. It's about the idea that we grow every time we push forward, even if we don't always get the outcomes that we expected, and that that's how you learn," she continutes. "I really want this game to reinforce this idea that by acknowledging and sharing the things that you're not great at or that you didn't do right or that weren't so great that happened to you, you can make real, positive change. The #notokay hashtag would be a perfect example. The more we talk about the challenges that we face, the more likely we are to heal those challenges and to move forward as a society."

(Photos by Todd Burke, left, and Jacqueline Lee / Daily News) By Jacqueline Lee | jlee1@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: November 3, 2016 at 11:31 am | UPDATED: November 3, 2016 at 12:39 pm Related Articles Silicon Valley millionaire Clyde Berg found ‘factually innocent’ sex abuse of wife In the state Assembly District 24 race, where voters are choosing between shades of Democrat, money speaks. There are no major differences on social issues between Palo Alto City Councilman Marc Berman, who won the June primary with 28.2 percent of the vote, and Palo Alto patent attorney Vicki Veenker, who ended up second in the eight-person primary with 22.2 percent. Both support spending more for universal preschool and education, back the countywide Measure B sales tax hike for transportation improvements and advocate legalizing recreational marijuana across the state. Where they differ is reflected by the nature of the special interest groups — from charter school backers to Realtors against rent control to women-in-power advocates — that have lined up behind them. Together, these independent groups have spent more than $3.4 million as of Wednesday for television and online ads, mailers and polling. About 90 percent of the outside funding has benefited Berman. EdVoice, a super political action committee (PAC) that pushes for education reform policies often opposed by teachers unions, spent more than $1.8 million on Berman this year, campaign reports show. EdVoice gets its money from philanthropists and entrepreneurs such as Arthur Rock, an early investor in Intel and Apple, and Carrie Walton Penner, granddaughter of the founder of Walmart and a staunch advocate for charter schools. Bill Lucia, president of EdVoice, previously told The Daily News it views Berman as the best candidate for public education because of his track record as a former development director of the Silicon Valley Education Foundation. Berman said in an interview Tuesday that charter schools are a good option in many parts of the state, including East Palo Alto, where students do not have a traditional high school. “Charter schools have less regulation and do not necessarily have to follow the same rules and regulation as tradition schools, so they have the flexibility to try new things,” Berman said. “Sometimes those things work … and in those instances, they should be shared with other schools in the area.” Veenker, on the other hand, has the endorsement of a traditional Democratic union stronghold: The California Teachers Association/Association for Better Citizenship contributed $16,700 to her campaign. She said charter schools are an important part of the public school system, but appropriate oversight is needed where tax dollars are spent, especially when the money is diverted from traditional schools. “To look at (charter schools) as the solution for solving our educational problems misses the point,” Veenker said. “We need to look at improving all schools for students.” The candidates disagree on how to weed out bad teachers and retain good ones. Berman says one fix is to increase the amount of time it takes for teachers to get tenure from two years to four. The state’s teachers unions have long resisted change to tenure laws, most recently winning a state Supreme Court appeal this summer to uphold job protection for teachers. Berman said giving tenure after two years is bad for good teachers because schools are sometimes hesitant to permanently hire someone after only 18 months of teaching. School districts spend hundreds of thousands of dollars firing bad teachers, Berman said, and many of those cases are settled, resulting in the teacher moving to another district. Veenker said if she’s forced to vote on changing the tenure law, she’d support the change to four years. But her preference is to address the process for teacher layoffs, which she said is based on seniority, takes too long and costs too much. Veenker said she wants teachers to keep getting tenure sooner than later for job security. It’s also one way to attract good teachers in an area hurt by the high cost of housing, she added. The neck-to-neck race has top Democrats choosing sides: Berman has endorsements from Rich Gordon, who terms out of the seat they’re running for, and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. Menlo Park Councilman Peter Ohtaki, a Republican and the third-highest vote-getter in the June primary, also has endorsed him. Veenker is backed by Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Simitian and Palo Alto Mayor Pat Burt. The rest of the money After EdVoice, the California Real Estate Independent Expenditure Committee-California Association of Realtors spent the most on Berman, $358,856. Berman, who does not support rent control, also has the endorsement of the Silicon Valley Association of Realtors. “I’ve been a leading advocate for additional housing in my time on the Palo Alto City Council,” Berman said. “Increasing supply is what we need to focus on. I’m perfectly fine with it existing where it currently exists, but rent control is not the answer.” Veenker said rent control is a tool that should be left on the table. “Many rely on it to stay in their homes,” Veenker said in a statement. “We are in a housing crisis. I support solutions including a state housing bond and tax incentives for affordable housing.” As of Wednesday, the following outside groups, among others, also spent money on ads for Berman: • Californians Allied for Patient Protection Independent Expenditure Account, $287,156; • Building and Protecting a Strong California, a Coalition of Firefighters, Building Trades, Realtors and Correctional Officers Organizations, $126,036; • and the California Dental Association Independent Expenditure PAC, $109,576. Veenker has support from the following committees: • Silicon Valley Progressive Women for Equity and Oportunidad Supporting Vicki Veenker for Assembly 2016, $268,226; • California Chiropractic Association PAC, $65,000; • and the Women in Power PAC, $10,000. The last filing deadline before the election showed that as of Oct. 22, Berman directly raised about $690,008 this year in monetary contributions and Veenker about $559,208. With a personal life experience as a working mother, a 30-year career as a patent attorney with chemical and technical experts and her advocacy work through the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley, Veenker said she would bring her perspective as a woman to the state Capitol. “We don’t have women setting the agenda in many cases,” said Veenker, who plans to focus on improving laws around campus sexual assault, equal pay and better maternity and paternity leave. Veenker’s biggest independent expenditure proponents are women’s groups striving to place more progressive women in Assembly. Women currently hold 19 of 80 seats. Berman says he cares just as much as Veenker does about issues affecting women. One thing he wants to do in his first year in office is to craft a bill of rights so sexual assault survivors know what help they’re guaranteed. Environmental fight Veenker’s campaign has sought to portray her as more passionate about the environment than Berman. It has released a polarizing television ad with images tying Berman to the single-use plastic bag industry and this week questioned the spending from Dart Container Corp., a single-use Styrofoam company, on Berman’s behalf. Berman’s campaign said Wednesday he has not sought Dart’s support and would not have accepted direct contributions from it. The help came in the form of an independent expenditure, like that of EdVoice and others, which are made without candidates’ involvement. “We do not appreciate or condone their involvement in our race, and their actions are completely independent from our campaign,” Berman’s campaign said in a statement. Berman’s campaign also noted he voted last November to expand Palo Alto’s ordinance to prohibit sale of plastic foam products, including those made by Dart, in local stores. Veenker, who has the endorsement of the Sierra Club and California League of Conservation Voters after the groups interviewed both candidates, said she questions whether Berman can fully represent the district on environmental issues since he has a financial interest in his father’s company, which makes reusable plastic bags. As a councilman, Berman had to recuse himself from a vote on single-use plastic bags, so there could be other bills he has to sidestep, Veenker said. Berman said he, like Veenker, supports Proposition 67 to uphold a ban on some plastic bags. “This will be decided before I ever take the oath of office,” Berman said. “There will be no opportunity for a conflict to come up in the future.” Berman said he’s disappointed Veenker chose to run an ad that shows “plastic bags blowing in the wind” to intentionally mislead voters into thinking his family makes those bags. Veenker has said she will pursue a state statute to reduce petroleum use and work on water conservation. She wants to offer tax credits for research on water use technology, like smart grids for water; give subsidies to farmers who adopt such technology; and discourage water use by altering rates. Berman said his environmental priorities are reducing dependence on oil, improving vehicles’ fuel efficiency and protecting natural resources. District 24 encompasses Atherton, East Palo Alto, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Menlo Park, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Portola Valley, Sunnyvale, Woodside and parts of Cupertino and San Mateo County.

The company has announced its fourth-generation 14-nanometer (nm) process and third-generation 10nm process to be implemented in next-generation products across both their mobile and consumer electronics product lines, as well as in data centre and automotive solutions. For those unfamiliar with the terms used above, the two processes will be used in semiconductor device fabrication to create new 14nm and 10nm Systems-on-a-Chip (SoC). The 14nm chip was first commercially shipped by Intel in 2014, while Samsung started mass production on mobile processors that feature 10nm FinFET technology this year. Rumours have the technology potentially debuting in Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 830, and it could also be used in Samsung’s own 2017 flagship Exynos SoC. The company states that its new 14nm process technology delivers improved performance at the same power and according tot the same design rules compared to its previous 14nm process. Meanwhile, the new 10nm process technology will provide area reduction compared to its previous generations. Samsung says it’s expected to be “the most cost-effective cutting-edge process technology in the industry.” The South Korean tech giant also updated 7nm Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) process development status and showcased its 7nm EUV wafer, which is generally expected to hit the market in 2019. Samsung states process design kits for the new technologies will be available in the second quarter of 2017, meaning the resulting new chips may become commercially available in 2018.

Alex yes, with the new state of the art 14nm chip an 10nm chip, we can create bigger explosions, in smaller devices. As consumers want smaller, and slimmer designs, its difficult to get users the power that they want, but with these new chips, we did it. This new chip will definitely blow you away, regardless where you hide it. Cameron Davidson Yawn.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Samsung shows off refinements to 14-nm and 10-nm process nodes by Wayne Manion  12:00 PM on November 3, 2016 As process nodes become smaller and smaller, chip manufacturers have to work harder to squeeze performance and power savings out of each step. To wit, Intel's recently changed from its familiar "tick-tock" cadence of alternating die-shrinks and architecture updates to a three-step "process-architecture-optimaztion" model. Likewise, Samsung's fabrication arm recently presented the latest revisions of its 10-nm and 14-nm process nodes to its manufacturing partners at its Device Solutions America headquarters. Samsung showed off the latest version of its 14-nm process, the company's fourth generation at that node size. The new fabrication technology, dubbed 14LPU, is intended for "high-performance and compute-intensive applications" and will deliver "higher performance at the same power and design rules." The new 10-nm process, which Samsung calls 10LPU, is the company's third go-round with fabrication at that node size. Samsung claims the new process will allow for smaller die sizes compared to its older 10-nm offerings. Samsung goes on to claim that 10LPU could be "the most cost-effective cutting-edge process technology in the industry." Refinements at existing node sizes are great, but smaller sizes are probably more interesting to readers. Samsung took the opportunity to show off 7-nm EUV wafers and provide updates on this process to its partners. Samsung says process design kits for the 14LPU and 10LPU processes will be available in the second quarter of next year. We expect that actual products built with these technologies will appear not too long after that.

Welcome to Wyandotte Daily! Serving Kansas City (Wyandotte County) Kansas for over 45 years! News Weather Sports Sporting KC T-Bones Business About Wyandotte Daily Communities Wyandotte County Kansas City Kansas Piper Bonner Springs Leavenworth Overland Park Kansas City Missouri Opinions Calendar Events Faith Employment NewzAdz KU scientist’s work on antibiotic resistance wins inventor award November 3, 2016 Info Wyandotte News 0 Joanna Slusky, a University of Kansas scientist, is one of five recipients of a fellowship from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for her work on antibiotic resistance. The fellowships were announced this week. (Photo by Sarah Mullinax) by Dan Margolies, Heartland Health Monitor A University of Kansas scientist has been named one of the first recipients of an $825,000 fellowship for her work in developing a protein designed to thwart antibiotic resistance. Joanna Slusky, 37, who heads the Slusky Lab at KU and specializes in outer membrane proteins, is one of five inventors nationwide recognized by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in Palo Alto, Calif. The foundation, established by the co-founder of Intel Corp. and his wife, anticipates awarding a total of $33.75 million to support 50 promising inventors over the next 10 years, according to its website. Slusky is part of the first cohort announced Wednesday. Slusky is an assistant professor of computational biology and molecular biosciences at KU. She was recruited there two years ago after completing postdoctoral work at Stockholm University and the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. She received her doctorate in biochemistry and molecular biophysics from the University of Pennsylvania. Her lab looks at how outer membrane proteins fold. It seeks to develop applications for cancer therapeutics, vaccine development and environmental remediation. The invention for which Slusky is being recognized is a so-called “helper” protein that disables a bacterium’s ability to protect itself from attack by antibiotics. “In order to do that, what one needs to do is disable the resistance mechanism of the bacteria,” Slusky said in a telephone interview. Slusky said the resistance mechanism is a protein pump that pushes antibiotics out of a cell, thwarting their ability to kill it. “So I’m making proteins that disable that resistance and disable it in a particularly interesting way that has never been tried before,” she said. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics have spawned antibiotic-resistant bacteria, one of the world’s most pressing health problems. Illnesses that were once easily treatable with antibiotics now often mutate into dangerous and sometimes life-threatening infections. “More than 700,000 people are dying worldwide every year from antibiotic-resistance infections,” Slusky said. Some studies project that, if current trends continue, by 2050 more people in the United States will die from such infections than from cancer. Slusky’s invention is still a long way from coming to market. It has yet to undergo preclinical studies, let alone clinical trials in humans. “It’s probably a minimum of 15 years off, or something like that,” Slusky said. “And that’s partly related to the fact that it takes so long, once you have something that works, to bring to market.” The Moore Foundation money — $825,000, including $50,000 from KU, over three years — will help accelerate that process. The funds will enable Slusky to do more hiring, plan more long-term experiments and, with any luck, begin pre-clinical trials in three to five years. “We are investing in promising scientist problem solvers with a passion for inventing — like Gordon Moore himself,” said Harvey V. Fineberg, president of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, in a news release. “By providing support to these early-career researchers, we can give them the freedom to try out new ideas that could make a real and positive difference.” The release said that Slusky’s invention “could have a global impact on antibiotic resistance and re-establish the efficacy of antibiotics.” The other recipients of this year’s Moore Foundation awards are Deji Akinwande of the University of Texas, Shane Ardo of the University of California, Irvine, Xingjie Ni of Pennsylvania State University and Mona Jarrahi of the University of California, Los Angeles. The awards are being given on the 50th anniversary of Gordon Moore’s now-famous prediction, known as Moore’s law, that components on integrated circuits would double every 18 months, exponentially increasing computer power.

Canyon Bridge Capital Partners said it will pay $1.3 billion for Lattice, or $8.30 per share. The offer represents a 30 percent premium over Lattice's closing stock price Wednesday. Lattice's shares shot up more than 18 percent on news of the deal, to $7.54. That's well below Canyon Bridge's offer price, though, reflecting skepticism about whether the little-known investment firm will be able to complete the deal. Lattice Semi's history 1983: Lattice Semiconductor founded by veterans of Tektronix and Intel. 1987: Lattice files for bankruptcy and reorganizes. 1988: Cyrus Tsui named chief executive. 1989: Lattice holds an initial public offering. 1993: Revenues surpass $100 million as Lattice buys California-based chip designer QuickLogic Corp. 2000: Lattice shares peak at $41.34, and revenues peak at $568 million. 2001: Sales plunge 48 percent following the dot-com and telecom busts, and the company falls into the red. Lattice is not consistently profitable going forward. 2004: Lattice restates financial results amid an accounting probe. 2005: Tsui and another executive are fired following shareholder allegations of excessive bonuses and lavish corporate spending. Steve Skaggs is named CEO. Lattice lays off 140. 2008: Skaggs is fired and replaced by Bruno Guilmart. 2009: Lattice posts its first profitable quarter in nearly three years. 2010: Guilmart quits unexpectedly, replaced by Intel veteran Darin Billerbeck 2015: Lattice moves from longtime Hillsboro headquarters to The U.S. Bancorp Tower (Big Pink) in downtown Portland, pays $600 million for California-based Silicon Image, and lays off roughly 200 workers in two rounds of job cuts. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland left his price target on Lattice at $7.50 despite the $8.30 offer, writing in a note to clients that he's unsure Thursday's deal will close given the uncertainty about Canyon Bridge's ties to China and the firm's track record. Canyon Bridge did not immediately respond to an inquiry about its background, portfolio or funding. Lattice's sale would not be a surprise — the chip industry is undergoing a massive wave of consolidation — and the Portland company had topped the lists of takeover targets for more than a year. But the decision to sell to a unknown investment firm, instead of another chip company, is unexpected. California-based Canyon Bridge could be looking for opportunities to improve Lattice's results before putting it on the market again. Just last week, Rolland said that Lattice would be an attractive acquisition for Xilinx, Qualcomm, Marvell or even Apple, which apparently is already a Lattice customer. On Thursday, though, Rolland told clients the Canyon Bridge deal faces uncertain prospects because of murky information around the investment firm. He noted that Canyon Bridge identifies its funding as coming from "limited partners in China." In his note, Rolland said he believes the Chinese government is seeking to buy chip companies in other countries to integrate with a Shanghai-based company, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. Lattice would be a neat fit, he wrote, because its chips are made by contractor manufacturers based on older technology of the kind SMIC uses. Additionally, Rolland said, Lattice is small enough, and its technology sufficiently low-tech, that a sale to Chinese investors would probably pass muster with United States regulators who review such deals for national security implications. For its part, Lattice said Thursday it expects business as usual under its new ownership. Historically, the company has had about 200 employees in Oregon, split between its Portland office and its former headquarters in Hillsboro. Lattice employed 1,146 worldwide at the start of the year. "Importantly, we will operate as a standalone subsidiary after the acquisition and do not expect any changes in our operations or our unwavering commitment to continued innovation for our customers," Lattice chief executive Darin Billerbeck said in a written statement. The company told employees that its headquarters will remain in Portland. Lattice is the smallest of three companies that dominate the market for a kind of chip called a field programmable gate array. The programmable chips play supporting roles in everything from telecommunications networking equipment to digital cameras and TVs. Last year, Intel paid $16.7 billion for another programmable chip company, Altera. And Lattice had made deals of its own, paying $600 million last year for a California company called Silicon Image. Lattice reported $406.0 million in revenue last year, up from $366.1 million in 2014, before the Silicon Image deal. Lattice lost $159.5 million in 2015, including $93 million in restructuring, accounting and acquisition-related expenses. Founded in 1983 by alumni of Tektronix and Intel, Lattice literally trademarked the term "Silicon Forest." It has never had an easy path, though. Lattice filed for bankruptcy in 1987, revived the business, then withstood a formidable downturn following the dot-com crash. It endured an accounting scandal in 2004 and fired longtime CEO Cyrus Tsui a year later amid shareholder accusations of lavish corporate spending. The company's business rebounded somewhat in recent years by focusing on the low-end of the programmable chip business, but results were uneven and Lattice laid off workers in 2012 and twice last year. The buyer, Canyon Bridge, has no public track record and its website identifies no other companies in its portfolio. The firm lists a Palo Alto address and two partners, including former Cadence Design Systems CEO Ray Bingham. Lattice's sale is the latest in a long string of deals for Oregon's biggest tech companies. Earlier this year, Beaverton-based Cascade Microtech sold for $352 million and FEI Co. sold for $4.2 billion. Wilsonville-based Mentor Graphics, the state's largest pure tech company, is under pressure from investors and has reportedly hired an investment bank to put itself on the market. All three of those companies serve the chip industry, which is consolidating as maturing businesses look to expand their markets and reduce costs by acquiring peers in related fields. Oregon tech, with no really big companies of its own, tends to be on the selling end of those transactions. Last year, Hillsboro-based Planar Systems agreed to sell itself to a Chinese company, Leyard Optoelectronic Co. That deal encountered skepticism, too, tied to economic turmoil in China, but Planar ultimately completed its sale. The electronic display company continues to operate in Hillsboro. Update: This article has been substantially updated with additional information about Canyon Bridge. Correction: The name of the firm buying Lattice has been corrected, as has the date of Lattice's bankruptcy. -- Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Advertise with us Contact the newsroom Frequently Asked Questions Join our team Our Journalists Contact Subscriber Services Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Clark County Gresham Portland Washington County More Local News Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Forums Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions Desktop PCs Internet Laptops Monitors PC Components Peripherals More Printers Software Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / Opinions / Best MacBook Air Alternatives: 5 thin and light laptops you'll love Best MacBook Air Alternatives: 5 thin and light laptops you'll love by Edward Chester 03 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments Best MacBook Air Alternatives: We pick the best thin and light laptops you should look for as an alternative to the Apple MacBook Air. The MacBook Air has been the go-to thin and light laptop for both Windows and Mac users for years now. However, with Apple not keen on keeping it updated with the latest tech, its crown has begun to slip. If you’re an Apple user happy to try an alternative, or you’ve always just installed Windows on your MacBook Air, then these five alternatives are the best place to start your search for a new laptop. All prices were correct at time of publication but are subject to change. Related: How to run Windows on a Mac 1) Dell XPS 13 Price: £1,099.99 | $1,074 Our Score: 9/10 Our Verdict: "The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best no-nonsense portable laptops around" The first Windows laptop ever to categorically wrestle the crown for best thin and light from the MacBook Air, the Dell XPS 13 is a superb little laptop. It all starts with a fantastic design that’s different but easily the equal of Apple’s laptop. It’s markedly smaller too, with the 13-inch screen fitting in the same footprint as most older 12-inch laptops. The screen itself is also great. Dell offers two versions – a 1,920 x 1,080-pixel non-touch model, and a 3,200 x 1,800-pixel touchscreen model. We’d recommend going for the non-touch version, as it still offers great quality, you get better battery life, and the extra resolution and touch features are of minimal benefit. When the Dell XPS 13 launched in 2015 it was available for just £800, making it a bona fide bargain. However, prices for certain configurations have since risen to more than £1,000 – but even at this level it's still a great option for those happy to pay MacBook Air prices.

This is a great option for those seeking a top-notch lightweight laptop without breaking the bank." Taking over the XPS 13’s title of best-value ultrabook, the Lenovo 710S offers a fantastic combination of performance, screen quality, design and battery life for its (circa) £800 asking price. That said, the design is the main area where you’re compromising a bit. While you get the overall look and feel of a MacBook Air-alike, you’re not getting the same build quality. The Apple machine is made from solid blocks of aluminium milled down to form the various panels of its chassis, while Lenovo uses thin sheets of aluminium pressed into shape and attached to a plastic chassis. As a result it’s a little more flexible and lacks that reassuring heft that the Air possesses. This aside, though, you’re getting a heck of a lot for the money. For a start, the screen is excellent. The 13-inch IPS panel has a 1,920 x 1,080-pixel resolution and looks great – in fact, it absolutely wipes the floor with the Air. Inside you’ve got a nippy Intel Core i7-6560U, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, where most rivals at this price point offer only 128GB of storage. Connectivity is decent too, with plenty of USBs and an SD card slot, and the keyboard is very good. The trackpad lets the side down a little but it’s still perfectly useable, unlike some really cheap and nasty laptops. Battery life can’t quite keep pace with either the Air or the XPS 13, but at comfortably over eight hours it’s enough for most of a working day.

Something a little different, the Acer Chromebook 14 forgoes Windows and instead runs Google’s ChromeOS. This is a stripped-down, simple operating system, but as a result it needs far less processing speed and it sips rather than guzzles power, making for an incredibly cheap and long-lasting laptop. For around £200, you’re getting a laptop that’ll cover all your basic computing needs such as web browsing, email, word processing, basic photo editing, watching video – basically anything that you can do in Google’s Chrome web browser. Inevitably at this price, you’re skimping when it comes to design, with no metal or other premium materials on show. But you still get a smart-looking laptop that’s impressively thin and light, though it is a slightly larger 14-inch machine rather than a 13-incher. One crucial area where you really are missing out is the screen. With only a 1,366 x 768 pixel resolution, the quality just isn't that great. Still, with a perfectly decent keyboard and trackpad, and adequate performance from the Intel Celeron N3060 and 2GB/4GB RAM, you can get all your basic computing done and enjoy a far better typing experience than on a tablet. If you're coming from a MacBook Air, it will be significantly slower, so you should only consider a Chromebook if your needs are very basic, or you're looking for a secondary laptop. Note that you only get 16GB or 32GB of storage – the idea is you store most of your files on Google’s cloud services – and that you need an internet connection to get pretty much anything done on Chromebooks. But with the better part of 10 hours' battery life, this makes for a great laptop for students or those on a really tight budget.

Asus' ZenBook line has produced some of the most consistently good alternatives to the MacBook Air, thanks to eye-catching design, solid performance and competitive pricing. The UX330UA continues this trend, including a 3,200 x 1,800-pixel display and 256GB SSD– all for under £800. Like the Lenovo Ideapad though, the design here is more about aping the look of premium metal, rather than emulating its actual feel. Only the lid is metal – and it looks fab – but the rest of the machine is plastic with embedded metallic particles. Other areas where it can’t quite match the competition are the middling keyboard and below par battery life. You’ll get only around six hours of use from a charge, which is below the 8-10 hours many others will manage. If battery life is less of a concern, though, then the superb screen and good overall performance make this a good option. Best Deals for Asus ZenBook UX330UA 5) New Razer Blade Stealth Price: £999 | $1,649 Our Score: TBC Early Verdict: "You’re getting a great, powerful ultrabook with a bunch of freebies." If gaming’s your thing but you still want a truly thin and light laptop then the Razer Blade Stealth might be just what you’re after. The 12.5-inch laptop is just 0.52-inches thick, weighs only 1.25kg, and can be kitted out with either a 4K or QHD display. In almost every way, it's a typical high-end ultrabook, packing an Intel Core i7-7500U along with 8-16GB of RAM, a 256GB-1TB SSD, and a claimed battery life of up to nine hours. The real trick with this laptop, though, is that it can dock with an external graphics card so that it can transform into a powerful gaming machine. The Razer Core (£499), as it’s called, is a box that contains a power supply and desktop graphics card – which can be upgraded – and it plugs into the Blade Stealth via a Thunderbolt cable. We’ve yet to review the Razer Blade Stealth in full, but it looks set to be a truly exciting laptop for on-the-go gamers.

brings total funding to $28M with round led by Mayfield to expand the science of Nutriomics and "Eating Well Made Simple," empowering Food to rival Drugs as Medicine News provided by Zipongo Nov 03, 2016, 07:30 ET Share this article SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- By making it easy to eat well, Zipongo has been able to help people tastefully sustain healthy eating and outcomes, and formalize Food Benefits Management for health plans, wellness platforms and a range of employers, from tech and financial services giants, to leading retailers and manufacturers.  Now with the closing of their $18 million Series B funding round—bringing total financing to $28 million—Zipongo and partners are further enabling Nutriomics and behavior science to empower health providers and disease management systems to measurably leverage food as medicine. The Series B was led by Silicon Valley pioneer, Mayfield, a key investor in companies ranging from Genentech and Solar City (acquired by Tesla), to Marketo and Lyft.  Mayfield's recent investments in Digital Health include Basis Science (acquired by Intel), HealthTap, Lantern, Brighter, Finrise and a stealth investment in AI applied to healthcare.  Mayfield was joined by existing Zipongo investors, including Series A lead, Boston-based Excel Venture Management, which has been a key backer of companies such as Craig Venter's Synthetic Genomics, Cleveland HeartLab, WellDoc, and ShapeUp (acquired by Virgin Pulse).   Zipongo, founded by Jason Langheier, MD, MPH, has been a pioneer in leveraging behavioral economics, nutrition, personalization data science and well-designed software user experiences to make eating well easy, and the health results sustainable.  Dr. Langheier was inspired to launch Zipongo after helping launch the pediatric obesity clinic at Boston Medical Center, and build it based on science, rooted in training from Harvard's Nutrition Department, Duke University Medical School and the University of California at San Francisco Biostatistics and Pediatrics clinical research teams.   Today, over 150 companies and the majority of national health plans and wellness platforms work with Zipongo to drive engagement, health impact, cost savings and happiness of their people.  Zipongo's comprehensive digital nutrition coaching platform and food utility tools support people from all walks of life, from those that cook and leverage grocery discounts regularly, to those who eat prepared meals from restaurants frequently.  Just as Pharmacy Benefits Management companies help drive adherence to the most cost-effective drugs that lower disease-related costs, Food Benefits Management powered by Zipongo helps people eat the right foods for them—the ultimate personalized generic drug—to lower healthcare costs and deliver a return on investment.  Zipongo's goal is to reduce the burden of chronic disease, reduce risk from the unintended side-effects of taking multiple drugs and in-hospital disease care, and help rein in unsustainable healthcare cost growth.   "Jason is a mission-driven entrepreneur who has made it easy for millions of people to eat foods that they like and are also good for them," said Ursheet Parikh of Mayfield. "Zipongo has also built an amazingly scalable software business in the process that delivers exceptionally high sustained user engagement and better outcomes that employers and insurance companies have found compelling." The new funding empowers Zipongo, its partners and their consenting study participants to expand on research and development begun many years ago driving the burgeoning data science of Nutriomics—the study of personalizing food recommendations based on bodily measures of genetics, metabolomics, immune-response and the microbiome, and a person's nutrition status, food buying, tastes and food environment, to optimize measures of health, emotional and performance outcomes.  Further study will enable health providers and health systems to prescribe Food as Medicine to more sustainably prevent and support care of many disease states—from diabetes to inflammatory bowel disease to cancers, when paired with food utility tools that make it easy to eat well.    Excitement about the growing depth and breadth of Zipongo's existing Food Benefits Management products and services has led to a 120 percent revenue increase, year over year, since third quarter of 2015. As part of this Series B investment, Ursheet Parikh and Tim Chang will join Dr. Langheier, Juan Enriquez (Excel, Synthetic Genomics), Zac Zeitlin (New Ground Ventures) and Todd Hixon (New Atlantic Ventures, former BCG Digital Practice leader) on the board of Zipongo. Says Dr. Langheier, "Humanity needs to feed nearly 10 billion souls by 2050, in a way that both eradicates chronic disease and sustains Earth.  In the face of that daunting challenge, we feel grateful to have so many engaged clients and users, as well as investors with so much experience in Enterprise Software-as-a-Service, Healthcare, Personalized Medicine, Data Science and Consumer Engagement, who are helping us build a company that delivers long-term value.  It takes a large village—and patient persistence—to feed such a big family, well." About Mayfield Mayfield is a global venture capital firm with over $2.7 billion under management.  The Firm has been championing entrepreneurs for more than 47 years.  Mayfield invests primarily in early-stage IT companies in enterprise and consumer sectors.  Mayfield invests in India-based companies through a dedicated fund.  Since its founding in 1969, the Firm has invested in more than 520 companies resulting in 114 IPOs and more than 160 mergers or acquisitions.  Some recent successes include Elastica (acquired by Symantec), Marketo (acquired by Vista Equity Partners), SolarCity, and The Rubicon Project.  About Excel Venture Management Excel Venture Management builds companies that apply transformative technologies to solve problems in healthcare and beyond.

This means that there are a lot of devices out there in the world with many different types of video connections. But what are the differences between them all? Which ones do you need to care about? What’s the bottom line? In this article, we’ll explore the most prominent cable types of today and when you may want to use each one. VGA The Video Graphics Array (VGA) is one of the oldest connection standards which can still be found in large swaths of computing equipment. It was first developed by IBM and introduced in 1987. It was widely used for video cards, TV sets, computer monitors, and laptops Two Monitors for an Extended Desktop: 3 Things You Should Check First Two Monitors for an Extended Desktop: 3 Things You Should Check First You'd think that all you'd have to do is plug any video display into the computer port on your laptop or PC. Well, it's a little more complicated than that. Read More . Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock VGA can support resolutions up to 640 x 480 in 16 colors, although you can increase the colors to 256 by lowering the resolution to 320 x 200. This is known as Mode 13h and is commonly used when booting your computer into Safe Mode. It’s also the mode that was used in computer gaming back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Image Credit: Choksawatdikorn via Shutterstock The VGA cable can carry RGBHV video signals: Red, Green, Blue, Horizontal Sync, and Vertical Sync. The VGA socket is made up of 15 pins in three rows of five pins, and typically colored blue. The cable socket is securely attached to the device using two screws, one on each side of the socket. Ads by Google It is rarely used today and is mostly found on older hardware, having been largely replaced by the digital DVI and HDMI connections, which we explore later in this article. RCA The famous red, white, and yellow setup of the RCA connector was once the most popular and widespread connection type for audio/visual devices. Image Credit: dugwy39 via Shutterstock While they are often referred to as RCA cables, RCA actually refers to the metal connectors at the end of the cables, named after the Radio Corporation of America which popularized the connection type. Image Credit: Vladimir Zhupanenko via Shutterstock The cables themselves are red and white audio cables and yellow for single channel composite video. The three cables together are able to transmit stereo audio along with video up to 480i or 576i resolution — where the i refers to interlaced video Graphic Display Resolutions - What Do The Numbers Mean? [MakeUseOf Explains] Graphic Display Resolutions - What Do The Numbers Mean? [MakeUseOf Explains] Display resolutions can be a rather cryptic business, with multiple standards used to describe the same display resolution in 10 different ways. All of those technical terms tend to change based on the display's purpose... Read More . Just as with VGA, the once-popular RCA connector has been superseded by the digital DVI and HDMI connections. DVI More than a decade after IBM introduced VGA, the Digital Display Working Group launched the digital successor, DVI, in 1999. DVI, which stands for Digital Visual Interface, can transmit uncompressed digital video in one of three different modes: DVI-I (Integrated) combines digital and analog in the same connector. DVI-D (Digital) supports digital signals only. DVI-A (Analog) supports analog only. Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock DVI-I and DVI-D can come in single- or dual-link varieties. Single-link can support 1920 x 1200 at 60 Hz, while adding a second digital transmitter for dual-link means the resolution can be increased to 2560 x 1600 at 60 Hz. In order to prevent forced obsolescence of VGA devices, DVI was developed to support analog connections using the DVI-A mode. This meant that DVI connections and devices could be backwards-compatible with VGA connections. Mini-DVI Apple is infamous for always trying to make their devices thinner and lighter. Most people think of this as a relatively recent development, but they’ve been at it since at least 2006 when they decided to move on from the mini-VGA port. In its place, they developed the mini-DVI connector. Image Credit: Wijit Wongwijit via Shutterstock It was included in the PowerBook G4, Intel-based iMacs and Macbooks, and Xserve. The mini-DVI doesn’t support dual-link connections and so was always limited to resolutions of 1920 x 1200 or less. This, in conjunction with advancing technology, led Apple to discontinue the use of mini-DVI in 2008 and replace it with Mini DisplayPort connections instead. HDMI HDMI, or High Definition Media Input, is a proprietary but wildly successful digital audio and video transfer interface. HDMI was created by a group of electronics manufacturers — including Sony, Sanyo, and Toshiba — to transfer video (uncompressed) and audio (either uncompressed or eight-channel compressed) to computer monitors, digital TVs, and DVD or Blu-ray players. Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock As of HDMI 1.4, it can support 24-bit uncompressed audio at 192 kHz and video resolutions up to 4096 x 2160, which is also known as 4K or Ultra HD What's the Difference Between 4K and Ultra HD? What's the Difference Between 4K and Ultra HD? Thinking of buying a new TV or monitor but feeling lost with all of the terminology like 4K and Ultra HD? Here's everything you need to know about it. Read More . As HDMI uses the same video format standards as DVI, the two are compatible through an adapter. As no signal conversion is necessary, there is no loss of quality either (although unlike HDMI, DVI does not support audio). There are three commonly used HDMI connectors. Type A is the full-sized HDMI connection for use on TVs and home theater equipment. Mini-HDMI (Type C) is commonly used on laptops and tablets, while Micro-HDMI (Type D) is mostly used on mobile devices. DisplayPort DisplayPort is a digital display interface developed by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). DisplayPort can carry digital video and audio, making it functionally similar to HDMI. As of DisplayPort 1.4, there is support for resolutions up to 8K (7680 x 4320) at 60 Hz, which surpasses even HDMI 1.4. Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock However, HDMI and DisplayPort were designed for different markets. While HDMI was made primarily for home entertainment, DisplayPort was designed for connecting computing devices to monitors. Due to their similar functionality, it is possible to connect DisplayPort and HDMI devices together using a Dual-Mode DisplayPort adapter. DisplayPort operates using packet data transmission which is commonly used in Ethernet and USB connections, and that’s what makes it ideal for use in computing as opposed to home entertainment. Mini DisplayPort Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock Apple replaced the mini-DVI connection on their Macbooks and iMacs with their own take on DisplayPort, known as Mini DisplayPort (MDP). Although Apple created MDP, it was incorporated into VESA’s DisplayPort 1.2 specification in 2009. Thunderbolt Thunderbolt is an interface used to connect peripheral devices to a computer. It was originally developed by Intel under the name of Light Peak and used optical cables for data transfer (hence the name Light Peak). After extensive testing, Intel found they could make it cheaper with copper cables without impacting performance. Apple was the first manufacturer to bring Thunderbolt to the market in their MacBook Pro models in 2011. When Thunderbolt debuted, it was able to use the MDP connector that Apple had created, meaning the new connection would be backwards-compatible. One of the biggest advantages of Thunderbolt over DisplayPort is the high speed of data transfer. Versions 1 and 2 of Thunderbolt could transfer at a rate of 20 GB/s using the MDP connector. Thunderbolt 3 will increase this Thunderbolt 3: What It Is & Why You Need to Start Using It Thunderbolt 3: What It Is & Why You Need to Start Using It Thunderbolt 3 may just be the only device cable you need to know about anymore.

Read More  through a technique called daisy-chaining, which reduces the amount of ports needed on a device. Thunderbolt is able to carry audio either using the DisplayPort protocol or by using USB audio cards. As of Thunderbolt 2, there was support for DisplayPort 1.2 specifications, which allowed for 4K streaming to a 4K monitor. The Simplification Factor If you’re still confused, the good news is that the world is moving towards a unified standard. HDMI Licensing recently announced that in order to connect to an HDMI device, all you will need is a compatible USB Type-C to HDMI cable Everything You Need to Know About HDMI Alt Mode and USB Type-C Everything You Need to Know About HDMI Alt Mode and USB Type-C The new HDMI Alt Mode standard will allow phones and tablets to stream directly to monitors and TVs using USB-C-to-HDMI cables. Here's all you need to know about it. Read More which can run in “Alt Mode”. This is one part of the industry’s larger push to simplify cabling. Standardization is possible — remember all of the proprietary mobile device chargers that existed before the micro-USB standard? It’s like that, except this time the industry is pushing USB Type-C as the next all-in-one standard for audio, video, power, and all other connections.

It is just very reliable in most cases. HDMI looks like a weak connector. And DVI though it works well seems to be dying quickly. Unlike VGA it seems to have no staying power...

I've seen this kind of port in many today's boards. Reply Jeremy Collake September 4, 2012 at 2:54 am As MakeUseOf pointed out to *me* on G+, the latest DisplayPort is actually called Thunderbolt now. Fortunately, its rights are owned by INTEL, not Apple. Needless to say, this matters ;). This interface has all the bandwidth to do *everything* we need. "Thunderbolt is interoperable with DisplayPort 1.2 compatible devices. When connected to a DisplayPort compatible device the Thunderbolt port can provide a native DisplayPort signal with 4 lanes of output data at no more than 5.4 Gbit/s per lane. When connected to a Thunderbolt device the per-lane data rate becomes 10 Gbit/s and the 4 lanes are configured as 2 channels with each bidirectional 10 Gbit/s channel comprising one lane of input and one lane of output.[2]". -wikipedia Reply Fer September 4, 2012 at 3:40 am Thank you Jeremy :) Reply subhasish nayak March 22, 2016 at 11:54 am display port is better than HDMI.. Reply Danny Chamorro September 3, 2012 at 6:53 pm Nice and useful article. I just have one question, why not include DisplayPort? Reply Jeremy Collake September 3, 2012 at 5:09 pm I love this idea of educating the masses on these simple things. Us geeks have known for years, and it doesn't take much to look up the differences. However, it is important for Joe Consumer to understand, as the manufacturers *sure don't* explain the differences when buying - especially low-end - monitors and such. It *is* too bad you didn't add DisplayPort though, as *that* may be the future of how we dock our mobile devices to multi-monitor setups with keyboard and mouse all with one cable. Let me add one more thing: Avoid Analog at all costs. You want Digital. Digital Digital Digital. No DVI-A (or analog over DVI-I). .. and, again, DisplayPort - watch for it! Want to future proof your next monitor purchase? Buy one with a DisplayPort (DP) input. Reply Freedom Schultheiss September 17, 2012 at 8:52 am When you mentioned the DisplayPort, is this the same port that is referred to as a "Mini DisplayPort" on my MacBook Pro? Reply GrrGrrr September 3, 2012 at 4:50 pm Thanks, useful article Reply Denis Paley September 3, 2012 at 2:49 pm Nice article which helps clear up the mystery about the different connections for video. I find this to be especially helpful in covering the differences between the various DVI connecters which can be confusing. One thing to remember is that you don't need to spend horrendous amounts of money on the digital cables as the inexpensive ones will carry the digital signal as well as the expensive ones. Reply Kasey Bell September 6, 2012 at 6:40 am I was wondering that ie... Gold plated hdmi $45 as good as the $15? And is there much quality loss with adding adapters Reply Mark Stevens November 8, 2016 at 4:14 am No there is no difference. I have a $60 Monster Cable and there is no difference in the signal whatsoever between that and a $15 one. As far as adapters go, I have seen different qualities between adapters. The most important thing with adapters it that all connections are as secure as possible, and try to avoid having any hanging stress on the cables or connections.

XD Reply illegal3alien September 3, 2012 at 1:45 am Also worth noting is HDMI is compatible with DVI (minus the audio). You can pick up a $1 adapter on Amazon to convert DVI to HDMI (or vice-versa). There are also devices that allow you to hookup DVI and audio out to a HDMI connection. Newer video cards support audio out over HDMI so you can hook your computer up to the TV and hear sound by only plugging in an HDMI cable to your video card. Reply Simon Slangen September 3, 2012 at 12:05 pm You're right, HDMI type A and C are electrically compatible with DVI-D. You need to be careful with what type of DVI, though. Below is a small overview. Possible: DVI-D HDMI (modulo audio) DVI-I --> HDMI (modulo audio) DVI-A VGA DVI-I --> VGA Not possible without a special converter: DVI-A HDMI DVI-D VGA Feel free to correct me if I made a mistake.

Possible: DVI-D (to and from) HDMI (modulo audio) DVI-I (to) HDMI (modulo audio) DVI-A (to and from) VGA DVI-I (to) VGA Not possible without a special converter: DVI-A (either direction) HDMI DVI-D (either direction) VGA Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The Series B was led by Silicon Valley pioneer, Mayfield, a key investor in companies ranging from Genentech and Solar City (acquired by Tesla), to Marketo and Lyft.  Mayfield's recent investments in Digital Health include Basis Science (acquired by Intel), HealthTap, Lantern, Brighter, Finrise and a stealth investment in AI applied to healthcare.  Mayfield was joined by existing Zipongo investors, including Series A lead, Boston-based Excel Venture Management, which has been a key backer of companies such as Craig Venter's Synthetic Genomics, Cleveland HeartLab, WellDoc, and ShapeUp (acquired by Virgin Pulse).   Zipongo, founded by Jason Langheier, MD, MPH, has been a pioneer in leveraging behavioral economics, nutrition, personalization data science and well-designed software user experiences to make eating well easy, and the health results sustainable.  Dr. Langheier was inspired to launch Zipongo after helping launch the pediatric obesity clinic at Boston Medical Center, and build it based on science, rooted in training from Harvard's Nutrition Department, Duke University Medical School and the University of California at San Francisco Biostatistics and Pediatrics clinical research teams.   Today, over 150 companies and the majority of national health plans and wellness platforms work with Zipongo to drive engagement, health impact, cost savings and happiness of their people.  Zipongo's comprehensive digital nutrition coaching platform and food utility tools support people from all walks of life, from those that cook and leverage grocery discounts regularly, to those who eat prepared meals from restaurants frequently.  Just as Pharmacy Benefits Management companies help drive adherence to the most cost-effective drugs that lower disease-related costs, Food Benefits Management powered by Zipongo helps people eat the right foods for them—the ultimate personalized generic drug—to lower healthcare costs and deliver a return on investment.  Zipongo's goal is to reduce the burden of chronic disease, reduce risk from the unintended side-effects of taking multiple drugs and in-hospital disease care, and help rein in unsustainable healthcare cost growth.   "Jason is a mission-driven entrepreneur who has made it easy for millions of people to eat foods that they like and are also good for them," said Ursheet Parikh of Mayfield. "Zipongo has also built an amazingly scalable software business in the process that delivers exceptionally high sustained user engagement and better outcomes that employers and insurance companies have found compelling." The new funding empowers Zipongo, its partners and their consenting study participants to expand on research and development begun many years ago driving the burgeoning data science of Nutriomics—the study of personalizing food recommendations based on bodily measures of genetics, metabolomics, immune-response and the microbiome, and a person's nutrition status, food buying, tastes and food environment, to optimize measures of health, emotional and performance outcomes.  Further study will enable health providers and health systems to prescribe Food as Medicine to more sustainably prevent and support care of many disease states—from diabetes to inflammatory bowel disease to cancers, when paired with food utility tools that make it easy to eat well.    Excitement about the growing depth and breadth of Zipongo's existing Food Benefits Management products and services has led to a 120 percent revenue increase, year over year, since third quarter of 2015. As part of this Series B investment, Ursheet Parikh and Tim Chang will join Dr. Langheier, Juan Enriquez (Excel, Synthetic Genomics), Zac Zeitlin (New Ground Ventures) and Todd Hixon (New Atlantic Ventures, former BCG Digital Practice leader) on the board of Zipongo. Says Dr. Langheier, "Humanity needs to feed nearly 10 billion souls by 2050, in a way that both eradicates chronic disease and sustains Earth.  In the face of that daunting challenge, we feel grateful to have so many engaged clients and users, as well as investors with so much experience in Enterprise Software-as-a-Service, Healthcare, Personalized Medicine, Data Science and Consumer Engagement, who are helping us build a company that delivers long-term value.  It takes a large village—and patient persistence—to feed such a big family, well." About Mayfield Mayfield is a global venture capital firm with over $2.7 billion under management.  The Firm has been championing entrepreneurs for more than 47 years.  Mayfield invests primarily in early-stage IT companies in enterprise and consumer sectors.  Mayfield invests in India-based companies through a dedicated fund.  Since its founding in 1969, the Firm has invested in more than 520 companies resulting in 114 IPOs and more than 160 mergers or acquisitions.  Some recent successes include Elastica (acquired by Symantec), Marketo (acquired by Vista Equity Partners), SolarCity, and The Rubicon Project.  About Excel Venture Management Excel Venture Management builds companies that apply transformative technologies to solve problems in healthcare and beyond. The Excel investment portfolio is balanced across healthcare IT and services, diagnostics, and medical devices, plus life science platforms that address adjacent markets including energy, chemicals, defense and agriculture. Our investments include Tetraphase, Aileron, ClearDATA, Molecular Templates, Cleveland HeartLab, Synthetic Genomics, and Virgin Pulse. More information can be found at www.excelvm.com.

Gerry Smith, the veteran executive who has held several different management roles within Lenovo, was named to a new position as executive vice president and chief operating office of PCs and smart devices. Replacing him as head of the Data Server Group, which is responsible for server sales and related services, is Kirk Skaugen, a former executive at Intel. Lenovo acknowledged that Data Center Group sales fell 8 percent to $1.1 billion year-over-year and the group lost $141 million. "With these changes Gerry Smith, currently EVP of DCG, moves to be EVP and COO PCSD (PCs & Smart Devices) using his knowledge, experience and proven track record to lead Lenovo global operations and operations for our core businesses, PCs and tablets," Lenovo noted. In the mobile business, Xudong Chen is now senior vice president of global services. He had led mobile as co-president and senior vice president. Replacing him is Gina Qiao, who had been senior vice president for human resources. The Lenovo veteran had previously served as chief strategy officer and as head of marketing in China. "In the last 12 months Xudong has stabilized the mobile business in China and will use his experience there to ensure we build a world-class and customer-centric service organization," Lenovo said. Lenovo mobile sales fell 12 percent year-over-year to $2 billion in its most recent quarter but did improve 20 percent from the previous quarter. Since acquiring Google's Motorola Mobility business two years ago, smartphone sales have plunged, dropping Lenovo out of the world;s top five among device servers.Several management changes and reorganizations also have taken place in the group. New faces Other new appointments include: Laura Quatela as Chief Legal Officer. Quatela previouls had served as chief legal officer and executive vice president for intellectual property at Alcatel-Lucent as well as general counsel at Eastman Kodak. Yong Rui as chief technology officer Yong had most recently served as deputy managing director for Microsoft Research Asia. Young succeeds longtime Lenovo and IBM veteran Peter Hortensius, who transferred to the data center group in March. “We have ... added several of the industry’s top minds into Lenovo, and are continuing to strengthen our leadership team," Lenovo Chairman and CEO Yang Yuanqing said in a statement. "We remain confident in our vision, our strategy and our team’s ability to achieve new heights.” MORE COVERAGE: Meet the new leaders WRAL TechWire any time: Twitter, FacebookCopyright 2016 WRAL TechWire.

Now, Dell and Lenovo both are reportedly working on new products that look to take on the newly-announced Surface Studio and the company's popular Surface Pro laptops. Starting with Dell, YouTuber Surface Pro Artist has put up a video of the company teasing its upcoming AIO creative PC. The teaser was shown as part of the Adobe MAX opening keynote, and it shows all the new things that the product is expected to bring. First up, the keyboard is entirely touch-based and comes with a dial to control edit tools etc. This is unlike the Surface Studio which allows you to directly draw on the computer, and has a separate Surface Dial that can be used on the display. The Dell AIO is set to unveil at CES next year.Dell has further told Engadget "At the start of Adobe MAX, Dell energised the audience with a sneak peek of its smart desk concept in action, teasing its innovative functionality and the exciting potential it will bring to creators everywhere. A full-horizontal touch display designed to work across a variety of systems, the device provides an immersive workspace for creators to build and interact with their content more naturally using pen, totem and touch. It's a new category of computing designed specifically for creators and nothing like it exists on the market today. Envisioned originally in 2014, we're excited to officially unveil it and more at CES 2017." Lenovo appears to be looking to expand its Miix series (the company's Surface Pro lookalike product line) as well. After launching a range of Ideapad Miix laptops in India, the company is now reportedly working on the IdeaPad Miix 720. WinFuture reports that the Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 720 will sport a 12-inch (2880x9120 pixels) screen, and be powered by Intel's latest seventh-generation i3, i5, and i7 Kaby Lake processors. It will offer 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD. It will add USB Type-C port alongside two legacy USB ports as well.Microsoft said that the Surface Studio's base model with 1TB storage, Intel Core i5 processor, and 8GB RAM will cost $2,999. And the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 was launched in October last year for a price starting at $899. There is no word on the exact pricing of the Dell and Lenovo products. While Dell confirmed a CES launch date, the Lenovo ideaPad Miix 720 laptop launch date remains unknown.

Written by: Vicky Nanjappa Updated: Thursday, November 3, 2016, 11:41 [IST] Subscribe to Oneindia News Bengaluru, Nov 3: Amidst reports of ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Bhagdadi being surrounded by the Iraqi army an audio clip has surfaced. The ISIS released an audio clip of Bhagdadi in which he is heard saying, " this is what Allah and his messengers promised us." There has also been hectic activity on the social media with pro ISIS handles urging the killing of non-Muslims in the West. On the social media there were poems being posted which speak about the importance of killing non-Muslims in the West. In the audio clip, Bhagdadi has termed this as a Sunni vs Shia war. The SITE Intel Group says that Bhagdadi is trying to rally his fighters in the wake of this offensive by the Iraqi forces. He is also heard calling for attacks on Turkey while saying that the Shias are doing everything in their power to take over the country. Even if I am killed, the fight must go on says Bhagdadi. He tells fighters around the world to continue fighting if he is killed. Many deaths have taken place recently, but that not weakened the ISIS, he also says. The Iraqi forces entered Mosul for the first time in two years. Bhagdadi the supreme commander of the ISIS is beleived to be hiding in Mosul. Several observers say that the end is near for Bhagdadi. The death of Bhagdadi will weaken the ISIS considerably and the outfit would have to immediately declare a new Caliph. The Iraqi forces are confident that they would beat the ISIS down and even kill Bhagdadi. The ISIS is unlikely to overcome this challenge as it has already lost several of its fighters. There are currently around 5,000 ISIS fighters in Mosul and 1,500 on the outskirts. According to reports many would try to make an escape bid, but would find it hard. The death of Bhagdadi will no doubt weaken the outfit a great deal. However there is also a lurking danger of the ISIS taking the fight to the main land. Several pro-ISIS handles have already urged its fighters to carrry out attacks outside of Iraq and Syria. The audio clip released also makes it clear that the fight is far from over and the West would increasingly be targeted.

Reuters/Brendan McDermid Fans were left disappointed when Microsoft did not launch or even announce the Surface Pro 5 in October where other devices such as the Surface Book i7 and the Surface Studio were showcased. Despite a no show, fans still believe that the device will be launched early 2017 with the Intel Kaby Lake chipset. An early 2017 release would mean fierce competition from other tech companies who are expected to reveal a number of next-generation devices during that timeframe. In terms of features and specs, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected to feature a 4K/UHD display with a 3:2 aspect ratio just like Surface Pro 3 and Surface Pro 4. The screen resolution would be of 3869 x 2560 pixels. A highly-advanced Surface Pen may also be included, writes iTech Post. This would be more pressure sensitive than its predecessor. A fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C ports are also expected for added security. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may run on the latest Windows 10 Redstone 2 update, consist of a 16GB RAM and have a longer battery life. When it comes to camera specs, the device may sport a 16MP primary and 8MP front camera. So far none of the rumours have been confirmed. Microsoft has not released any official statement regarding the Surface Pro 5. However, most unconfirmed reports suggest that the device’s release has been shifted to 2017 mainly because of the Intel Kaby Lake chipset and Windows 10 Redstone 2 update. The Kaby Lake chipsets are expected to be launched in December. These chipsets are said to provide some awesome graphics performance in high-end devices, writes Android Origin. They also improve battery life. Rumours suggest that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may sell around the price tag of US$899 (AU$1,170). Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on the Microsoft Surface Pro 5.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Curtiss-Wright Debuts Safety Certifiable 3U VPX Graphics Modules for Avionics <!– a href="/advertise.php" title="Tired of Google arrogant behavior, questionable practices and constant revenue decrease" alt="Tired of Google arrogant behavior, questionable practices and constant revenue decrease" target=_new> –> Curtiss-Wright’s Defense Solutions division announced that it has expanded its portfolio of DO-254/DO-178C safety certifiable COTS products with the introduction of two new rugged 3U VPX high performance graphics processor modules. Based on AMD’s latest embedded Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), the Radeon™ E8860, both of these multi-head graphics cards support the long lifecycle availability required for defense and aerospace programs. Through the use of a suite of CoreAVI® software drivers and supported by the embedded industry’s longest component supply program, availability for VPX3-717 and VPX3-719 module hardware and software is ensured for 15+ years. Designed for use in safety certifiable applications, these size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C)-optimized modules were developed to meet DO-254 DAL C and DO-178C DAL A certification. DO-254 and DO-178C certification artifact kits, available from Curtiss-Wright, ease platform certification, speed time to market, and significantly reduce the cost and risk of developing safety certifiable electronics subsystems for commercial and military aviation platforms. “We are very excited to announce these new safety certifiable rugged graphics cards,” said Lynn Bamford, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Defense Solutions division. “These SWaP optimized 3U VPX graphics engines enable system designers to speed the design of DO-254/DO-178B safety certifiable avionics systems, eliminating the high cost of custom solutions. Even better, they feature unmatched 15+ year availability for hardware and software, a true boon for long lifecycle aerospace and defense programs.” About the VPX3-719: Built-in HD-SDI Video Capture and Output Format Conversion The VPX3-719 is ideal for applications that require video capture and HD-SDI video interfaces. It supports extremely low latency video capture, graphics generation and overlay, and display output conversion. The card’s Radeon GPU is supported with up to six independent and simultaneous graphics outputs selectable from 4x DVI, 2x HD-SDI, and 2x analog RGBHV or STANAG interfaces. The VPX3-719 provides 2 GB of dedicated video memory, and a hardware accelerated video compression encoder and decoder. It features built-in video capture and format conversion and provides two channels of video capture from HD-SDI, analog RGBHV, or STANAG sources. The video data is transferred directly to processor or GPU memory. About the VPX3-717: XMC Expansion Site Delivers System Flexibility The VPX3-717 provides system designers with a higher level of architecture flexibility. Unlike the VPX3-719, it provides an on-module XMC mezzanine expansion site, which can be configured with a wide variety of XMC card types. The card can also be configured with a Power Architecture®, Intel® or ARM®-based processor XMC single board computer (SBC) enabling single-slot graphics plus SBC solutions. I/O support includes six independent DVI outputs, two of which can also be configured to support a dual-link DVI port for higher resolutions. One channel of analog RGBHV is also supported. Software Support Graphics software API support includes OpenGL®1.2 and OpenGL ES 2.0 for embedded applications, and OpenGL SC 1.0.1 and OpenGL SC 2.0 designed for safety critical and certifiable applications. Codec support for MPEG2 and H.264 encode and decode functionality is also offered. Software support for both graphics modules includes RTOS driver support for Power Architecture, Intel, and ARM VPX and XMC processor modules. Operating environment support includes Linux, Wind River® VxWorks®, Green Hills Software INTEGRITY®, Lynx Software Technologies LynxOS® and Microsoft® Windows®.

The Consumer Electronics Show is one of the biggest tech events of the year, similar to Mobile World Congress, and we expect CES 2017 to showcase a lorry load of new gadgets, TVs, cars and initiatives that'll take our breath away. It will also outline what to expect from the year ahead. Here's everything you need to know about CES 2017. What is CES 2017? CES - the Consumer Electronics Show - is a tech conference held in January in Las Vegas, Nevada, where companies hold keynotes and presentations, as well as staff show floor booths, with the purpose of announcing and demoing new tech. It's been an annual event since 2004. CES 2016 was a record-breaking year, with a total attendance of 177,393. The exhibition space spanned 2.47 million net square feet. When is CES 2017? This year's show will be held from 3 January to 8 January 2017, although most of the breaking news will occur within the first day or so. The official press days for CES 2017 are 3 and 4 January, which is when you can expect the major press conferences and big announcements. Which companies will be at CES 2017? Well, on 3 January, aka Media Day of CES 2017, the following companies are scheduled to give keynotes: Qualcomm, LG, Bosch, Panasonic, TCL, HiSense, Casio, Samsung, Hyundai, Intel, ZTE Corporation, and Sony. What will be announced at CES 2017? Virtual reality Microsoft Microsoft recently announced budget VR headsets were coming with support for the Windows 10 Creator Update. We therefore might see Windows 10 VR headsets from HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and Acer - alongside laptops, monitors, and desktops. HTC might even unveil a standalone, wire-free version of the HTC Vive, which is codenamed Oasis, at CES 2017.  Televisions LG Last year, we saw Ultra HD 4K displays from Sony, LG, Philips, Samsung, Panasonic, Hisense, and TCL, so we expect to see these same companies refresh their ranges for 2017. We're also expecting to see more manufacturers jumping being Ultra HD Blu-ray, especially Sony. Automobiles 1. We founded a company. #FaradayFuture 2. We created a concept. #FFZERO1 3.

Faraday Future is already teasing a few concepts it might unveil at CES 2017. Drones Pocket-lint Drones made a big splash at the last show - especially the fixed-wing, autopilot Parrot Disco. We therefore expect to see more drones this year. Smartphones Pocket-lint We saw the reveal of the Huawei Mate 8 at CES 2016, but the Chinese firm has already previewed the Huawei Mate 9. It'll be interesting to see what other companies plan to use CES 2017 to announce new phones, if any. Wearables Samsung and Fitbit could use CES 2017 to update their wrist wearables. We'll know more in the coming weeks. Sections Gadgets Google Wi-Fi now available to buy: How does the mesh router work?
