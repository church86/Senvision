Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 25, 2017 at 5:43PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is known for its industry-leading gross profit margins. Though the company's gross profit margins are down from the peak of 66% seen in 2010, the company has managed to achieve greater-than-60% gross profit margins annually since 2014, after dipping slightly below 60% during 2013. INTC Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts Investors (and companies themselves) like higher gross profit margins for one simple reason: The higher those margins, the more of each dollar of revenue Intel can ultimately convert into profits. Even with this in mind, as investors assess new business opportunities that Intel might go after, it's important that they recognize that there are actions that the company can take to dilute its reported gross profit margin percentage while still delivering increased value to shareholders. I'd like to walk through such an example. A great example -- non-volatile memory One market that Intel executives seem to be extremely excited about is non-volatile memory. Intel's plays in non-volatile memory include NAND-flash-based solid state drives, as well as products based on Intel's and Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) jointly developed 3D XPoint technology. Image source: Intel.  On a recent investor call, Intel executive Stacy Smith made it clear that he thinks that, on its memory products, it will "make good margins" and even "better-than-industry margins" but was quite plain that gross profit margins on non-volatile memory products are "highly unlikely" to be at Intel's current corporate average margins. What this means is that if Intel's revenue from non-volatile memory products grows at a rate faster than the rest of the company's business, Intel's overall gross profit margin percentage should decline. Now, the extent of that decline isn't likely to be all that significant in the near-to-medium term as Intel's non-volatile memory business is quite small, but over time investors may start to notice gross profit margin "dilution" if that business takes off. Isn't a decline in gross profit margin bad? Declines in a company's average gross profit margin percentage aren't always bad -- it really depends on why that figure came down. A gross profit margin decline resulting from fast growth of a lower-margin business relative to the higher-margin businesses isn't necessarily a bad thing. Remember, even if the gross profit margin percentage comes down, the total revenue to which that percentage is applied is much higher. In other words, operating income and net income would increase, ultimately increasing the value of the business, even if the average gross profit margins come down. Indeed, Smith even said on the aforementioned investor call that Intel doesn't want to "truncate growth in certain segments to hit a corporate average" gross profit margin. Now, what investors do need to be mindful of is a gross profit margin decline that's not simply due to dilution caused by a fast-growing-but-low-margin business. So, for example, if Intel had previously been able to command 65% average gross profit margins on, say, its data-center chips, but some combination of competitive pressures and manufacturing cost structure problems (perhaps from lower-than-expected manufacturing yield rates) leads those margins to come down to 62%, then that's a problem. In that case, the total revenue to which the gross profit margin percentage is applied hasn't gone up -- it may have even gone down -- so total operating profit and, ultimately, net profit decline. Those kinds of declines negatively affect earnings per share and, in many cases, the stock price. Investor takeaway At the end of the day, it's important for investors to avoid looking at financial figures without keeping a close eye on the bigger picture. Gross profit margin percentage is a critical figure to Intel investors, as it has historically been a measure of the company's competitive positioning in the markets that it serves. Nevertheless, company starts to diversify into new, potentially more competitive markets like non-volatile memory, it will be important to focus on the operating margins of each individual Intel business rather than on the consolidated gross profit margin figure.  As Smith put it, Intel wants to make sure that "every business is growing, every business is expanding its operating margin."  If Intel can consistently achieve this goal, then it should be able to generate additional value for its stockholders through increased profits and thus earnings per share. We'll see how the company does over the next several years.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

James Martin/CNET Bring it on, Apple -- at least, that's what Qualcomm's top executives seemed to be saying Wednesday. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Derek Aberle, head of the wireless chipmakers's licensing business, fired back at lawsuits filed over the past week by Apple in the US and China. Those suits, they said, are all about the money, an effort by Apple to squeeze as much money as possible from its supplier. "Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions, but in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property," Mollenkopf said during a call with analysts about its quarterly earnings report. "They want to pay less for the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology." While the value of Qualcomm's patents have "tangibly and meaningfully increased over time," it has never raised its royalty rates, Mollenkopf added. "If you peel apart all of the arguments Apple's making, we believe firmly they're all without merit," Aberle said. "At the end of the day, they essentially want to pay less for the technology they're using. It's pretty simple." Qualcomm plans to keep supplying chips to Apple even as they battle in the courts. "I'm confident we'll address and get through the legal challenges underway, as we have done many times in the past," Mollenkopf said. See also Apple expands Qualcomm legal spat to China Apple sues Qualcomm over unfair licensing terms Qualcomm forced Apple into exclusive chip deal, FTC says The legal challenges he's referring to included one filed last week by Apple in the US and two others filed this week by the iPhone maker in China. The US Federal Trade Commission also has accused Qualcomm of forcing Apple to use its chips exclusively in exchange for lower licensing fees. Qualcomm spent the first 20 minutes of its hourlong call talking about Apple's litigation. Many of the questions from analysts also focused on the lawsuits. Apple referred CNET back to its comments and lawsuit from Friday. Its statement said, in part, that "Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts." Apple v. Qualcomm Qualcomm is the world's biggest provider of mobile chips, and it created some of the essential standards for connecting phones to cellular networks. The company derives a significant portion of its revenue from licensing that technology to handset manufacturers and others. Apple designs the processors in its iPhones and iPads, but it buys chips from Qualcomm to connect to 4G LTE and other cellular networks. Under Qualcomm's licensing structure, Apple, through its manufacturers, pays it a fee for its chips and another fee for the intellectual property utilized in the chips and mobile phones. Most components suppliers bundle the IP cost in with the chip sales price. For the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus introduced this year, Apple also started buying 4G LTE chips from another supplier, Intel. Because Intel's chips use some of Qualcomm's essential technology, Apple pays Qualcomm a licensing fee for those processors, as well, which is based on the total value of the iPhone ($650) versus the value of the Intel chip (closer to $20). (Like most licensing terms, this gets complicated pretty quickly, but essentially, Apple bears a cost for using Qualcomm technology in its phones, whether or not the chips it includes are directly from Qualcomm.) Apple's lawsuit filed in the US on Friday alleges the wireless chipmaker didn't give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. Apple also said Qualcomm sought to punish it for cooperating in a South Korean investigation into Qualcomm's licensing practices by withholding a $1 billion rebate. Apple's iPhone 7 wants you to cut the cord With the launch of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple has removed the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack. To listen to music, you need a wireless set of earbuds or a separate adapter to connect corded headphones. by Lexy Savvides 1:49 Close Drag Apple wants a US court to lower the amount it pays Qualcomm in licensing fees, as well as order the return of the $1 billion. The company said in its suit that Qualcomm should be paid royalties based on the value of its particular contribution, not for contributions from other patent holders. Currently, Qualcomm's royalties are based off the selling price of a phone, rather than what portion Qualcomm's technology enabled. In one lawsuit filed in China, Apple alleges that Qualcomm "abused its clout in the chip industry," a violation of China's anti-monopoly law. Apple seeks 1 billion yuan ($145.32 million) in damages. A second accuses Qualcomm of not making its cellular standard essential patents available broadly and cheaply. It asks the court to determine the terms of a patent license between Qualcomm and Apple. Aberle said Qualcomm has been collecting royalties based on a phone's selling price for decades and said there's no legal precedent to suggest royalties should be collected based on a chip. "This is well understood, a well laid out concept," Aberle said. "It's consistent with the way not only Qualcomm has licensed in our own industry for decades but virtually every other patent holder seeking to collect royalties on their intellectual property." He added that Qualcomm offered Apple the same terms as its other licensees in China. It refused, he said. Qualcomm has come under scrutiny in recent years for alleged monopolistic practices. Two years ago, it paid China nearly $1 billion to end a 14-month antitrust investigation in that country. Then, in December, South Korea hit Qualcomm with a $850 million fine following a three-year investigation. The South Korean Fair Trade Commission accused the chipset maker of having an "unfair business model" and creating a monopoly with its practices. The US FTC also has accused Qualcomm of illegally dominating the cellular chip market. Aberle said Qualcomm plans to appeal the KFTC ruling. And he accused Apple of making "false and misleading" statements to regulatory bodies around the globe. "Apple has been actively driving regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in jurisdictions around the world," he said during a call with analysts. Lots of chips On Wednesday, Qualcomm reported its fiscal first-quarter net income attributable to shareholders dropped to $682 million, or 46 cents a share, from $1.5 billion, or 99 cents a share. (That $850 million fine was a factor in the loss.) Excluding acquisition costs and other expenses for the quarter ended December 25, per-share earnings jumped to $1.19 from 97 cents. Analysts polled by Yahoo Finance projected earnings of $1.18 a share. 14 ODG's Qualcomm-powered glasses tout AR, VR Revenue climbed 3.9 percent to $6 billion, slightly below Wall Street's forecast for $6.12 billion. Revenue from Qualcomm's licensing business increased 10 percent to $1.86 billion. J.P. Morgan analyst Rod Hall estimates about a third of Qualcomm's earnings are tied to Apple's royalty payments. If Apple stops paying royalties, Qualcomm's full-year earnings are at "material risk," he said. Qualcomm said during its call with analysts that about 40 percent of its revenue comes from selling chips and licensing its technology to Apple and Samsung, the two leaders in the phone market. For the second quarter, Qualcomm expects per-share earnings of $1.15 to $1.25 on revenue of $5.5 billion to $6.3 billion. Analysts polled by Yahoo Finance projected earnings of $1.20 a share on sales of $5.9 billion. Aberle said Qualcomm doesn't expect a financial impact from the litigation in the second quarter. Qualcomm shares slid 3.2 percent to $55.09 in after-hours trading. The company's stock has lost about 14 percent of its value since Apple filed its lawsuit in the US.

Roston - Jan 25, 2017 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 9/10 Pros Incredible multi-day battery life Exceptional durability Small, lightweight ultrabook design Great keyboard for typists Multiple hardware configurations offered Cons No touchscreen option If you liked Lenovo‘s X250 laptop, you’ll love its newer X260 model. All the best things about the X250 are back in Lenovo’s X260, including the crazy long battery life that can, in some cases, get users through a full day of work with charge to spare. As you’d expect, though, these two models aren’t entirely alike, and those who pick up the X260 are getting a newer beast. Is it worth the upgrade? Read our review to find out! Hardware If you’ve ever held the X250, you’ll find the X260 looks and feels very, very similar. The somewhat small 12-inch laptop’s frame is black with that iconic business-chic ThinkPad look, the texture vaguely soft, and the keyboard is exactly what we’ve come to expect from a ThinkPad. The trackpad boasts a trio of physical buttons, and as always, there’s the small red TrackPoint nub included for those who simply refuse to love to learn the trackpad. A generous array of ports line both sides of the ThinkPad X260, including a trio of USB 3.0 ports (there’s no USB-C on this model), Ethernet, a mini DisplayPort, and more. There’s a webcam nestled in the bezel above the display, a power button positioned to the side of the keyboard, and, depending on which secondary offering you use, a battery jutting out of the bottom of the machine. The X260 is described as an ultrabook by Lenovo, though it should be noted that it doesn’t have the common ultrabook tapering at the front edge like the X1 Carbon or MacBook Air. Rather, this ThinkPad is completely square in shape, with flat sides and slightly rounded edges. Overall, the laptop’s profile is only 0.8-inches at its thicket point, and the weight starts at 2.9lbs. While it’s not the thinnest or lightest laptop on the market, it is no way heavy or cumbersome. The small size is welcomed for travelers and others who frequently slip their laptop into a bag and under a plane seat. This ThinkPad, like most of them, have a love-it-or-hate-it design; personally I find it endearing. It’s definitely a no-nonsense design, quite unlike the Yoga 910 and other more luxurious, flashy models. That’s perfectly fine, though, if you simply care about getting down to work and all of the things that aid you in working. Notably, the ThinkPad X260 includes MIL-SPEC durability, and was tested across many different categories, including pressure, salt fog, vibration, sudden temperature changes, high temps, low temps, dust, and even fungus. Needless to say, the laptop can probably hold its own through many overhead bins and trunks if you travel frequently for work. The keyboard is the same variety found in the X250 and most other ThinkPad models — the keys are reasonably low-profile with a soft report and moderate amount of resistance. The trackpad is high-quality, and doesn’t skip or have any tracking issues. This is all joined by the 12.5-inch display, of which three options are offered: a disappointing 1366 x 768 TN display at 200 nits brightness, an IPS display with the same resolution at 300 nits brightness, and a Full HD 1920 x 1080 300 nits IPS display.

The processor offerings are joined by Intel Integrated Graphics with up to 16GB of DDR4 memory and either a 500GB/1TB 5400rpm hard drive or up to a 512GB SATA SSD. Performance will depend on which configuration you get, of course, but in general the laptop ran very well during testing, and didn’t present any troubles. I used it throughout a normal workday, which involved a lot of Web browsing, downloading and uploading, toggling between more than a dozen tabs, moderate photo editing, all while music was streaming. The laptop didn’t have any trouble handling this, and got me through the entire day with battery life to spare. (Review unit features a Core i5-6300U, 8GB RAM, Windows 10 Pro) That’s because the ThinkPad X260, like the X250 before it, has excellent battery life. This is thanks to the external hot-swappable battery that joins the laptop’s internal battery. The smaller of the two swappable batteries sits flush with the back of the laptop so that you can’t tell it is there until you’re looking for it; the larger external battery option protrudes from the bottom of the laptop somewhat, though it doesn’t interfere with usage or add any readily noticeable weight. It’s important to stress here that the battery life isn’t merely long, but is in fact beyond what you’d find on the vast majority of laptops, putting the X260 into a category nearly entirely it’s own. With a full charge and the larger of the two hot-swappable batteries, you can go days without charging the laptop under moderate use scenarios. Even using the laptop non-stop during the day, there’s a good chance you’ll make it to the next morning. Assuming you have both external batteries, the larger and the smaller one, you can swap in the charged spare after the in-use batteries run low, boosting your run time by another few hours. Wrap-up Lenovo has long had a winner with this particular X lineup model, and that truth remains for the X260. There’s nothing to dislike about this iteration unless you want a touchscreen display. Laptops are, at their foundation, meant to be portable, and portability depends on two things: a lightweight design and ample battery life. This laptop gets positive marks in both those categories, but especially the latter. Road warriors will find it hard to adjust to lesser laptops after basking in the X260’s 20+ hour run time, and that’s not a bad thing. The ThinkPad X260 (2016) model is available from Lenovo starting at $818.10 USD.

Mobile by Shara Tibken January 25, 2017 1:17 PM PST @sharatibken Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Qualcomm CEO Stephen Mollenkopf shows off the company's new Snapdragon 835 chip at CES 2017. James Martin/CNET Bring it on, Apple -- at least, that's what Qualcomm's top executives seemed to be saying Wednesday. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Derek Aberle, head of the wireless chipmakers's licensing business, fired back at lawsuits filed over the past week by Apple in the US and China. Those suits, they said, are all about the money, an effort by Apple to squeeze as much money as possible from its supplier. "Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions, but in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property," Mollenkopf said during a call with analysts about its quarterly earnings report. "They want to pay less for the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology." While the value of Qualcomm's patents have "tangibly and meaningfully increased over time," it has never raised its royalty rates, Mollenkopf added. "If you peel apart all of the arguments Apple's making, we believe firmly they're all without merit," Aberle said. "At the end of the day, they essentially want to pay less for the technology they're using. It's pretty simple." Qualcomm plans to keep supplying chips to Apple even as they battle in the courts. "I'm confident we'll address and get through the legal challenges underway, as we have done many times in the past," Mollenkopf said. See also Apple expands Qualcomm legal spat to China Apple sues Qualcomm over unfair licensing terms Qualcomm forced Apple into exclusive chip deal, FTC says The legal challenges he's referring to included one filed last week by Apple in the US and two others filed this week by the iPhone maker in China. The US Federal Trade Commission also has accused Qualcomm of forcing Apple to use its chips exclusively in exchange for lower licensing fees. Qualcomm spent the first 20 minutes of its hourlong call talking about Apple's litigation. Many of the questions from analysts also focused on the lawsuits. Apple referred CNET back to its comments and lawsuit from Friday. Its statement said, in part, that "Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts." Apple v. Qualcomm Qualcomm is the world's biggest provider of mobile chips, and it created some of the essential standards for connecting phones to cellular networks. The company derives a significant portion of its revenue from licensing that technology to handset manufacturers and others. Apple designs the processors in its iPhones and iPads, but it buys chips from Qualcomm to connect to 4G LTE and other cellular networks. Under Qualcomm's licensing structure, Apple, through its manufacturers, pays it a fee for its chips and another fee for the intellectual property utilized in the chips and mobile phones. Most components suppliers bundle the IP cost in with the chip sales price. For the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus introduced this year, Apple also started buying 4G LTE chips from another supplier, Intel. Because Intel's chips use some of Qualcomm's essential technology, Apple pays Qualcomm a licensing fee for those processors, as well, which is based on the total value of the iPhone ($650) versus the value of the Intel chip (closer to $20). (Like most licensing terms, this gets complicated pretty quickly, but essentially, Apple bears a cost for using Qualcomm technology in its phones, whether or not the chips it includes are directly from Qualcomm.) Apple's lawsuit filed in the US on Friday alleges the wireless chipmaker didn't give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. Apple also said Qualcomm sought to punish it for cooperating in a South Korean investigation into Qualcomm's licensing practices by withholding a $1 billion rebate. Apple's iPhone 7 wants you to cut the cord With the launch of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple has removed the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack. To listen to music, you need a wireless set of earbuds or a separate adapter to connect corded headphones. by Lexy Savvides 1:49 Close Drag Apple wants a US court to lower the amount it pays Qualcomm in licensing fees, as well as order the return of the $1 billion. The company said in its suit that Qualcomm should be paid royalties based on the value of its particular contribution, not for contributions from other patent holders. Currently, Qualcomm's royalties are based off the selling price of a phone, rather than what portion Qualcomm's technology enabled. In one lawsuit filed in China, Apple alleges that Qualcomm "abused its clout in the chip industry," a violation of China's anti-monopoly law. Apple seeks 1 billion yuan ($145.32 million) in damages. A second accuses Qualcomm of not making its cellular standard essential patents available broadly and cheaply. It asks the court to determine the terms of a patent license between Qualcomm and Apple. Aberle said Qualcomm has been collecting royalties based on a phone's selling price for decades and said there's no legal precedent to suggest royalties should be collected based on a chip. "This is well understood, a well laid out concept," Aberle said. "It's consistent with the way not only Qualcomm has licensed in our own industry for decades but virtually every other patent holder seeking to collect royalties on their intellectual property." He added that Qualcomm offered Apple the same terms as its other licensees in China. It refused, he said. Qualcomm has come under scrutiny in recent years for alleged monopolistic practices. Two years ago, it paid China nearly $1 billion to end a 14-month antitrust investigation in that country. Then, in December, South Korea hit Qualcomm with a $850 million fine following a three-year investigation. The South Korean Fair Trade Commission accused the chipset maker of having an "unfair business model" and creating a monopoly with its practices. The US FTC also has accused Qualcomm of illegally dominating the cellular chip market. Aberle said Qualcomm plans to appeal the KFTC ruling. And he accused Apple of making "false and misleading" statements to regulatory bodies around the globe. "Apple has been actively driving regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in jurisdictions around the world," he said during a call with analysts. Lots of chips On Wednesday, Qualcomm reported its fiscal first-quarter net income attributable to shareholders dropped to $682 million, or 46 cents a share, from $1.5 billion, or 99 cents a share. (That $850 million fine was a factor in the loss.) Excluding acquisition costs and other expenses for the quarter ended December 25, per-share earnings jumped to $1.19 from 97 cents. Analysts polled by Yahoo Finance projected earnings of $1.18 a share. 14 ODG's Qualcomm-powered glasses tout AR, VR Revenue climbed 3.9 percent to $6 billion, slightly below Wall Street's forecast for $6.12 billion. Revenue from Qualcomm's licensing business increased 10 percent to $1.86 billion. J.P. Morgan analyst Rod Hall estimates about a third of Qualcomm's earnings are tied to Apple's royalty payments. If Apple stops paying royalties, Qualcomm's full-year earnings are at "material risk," he said. Qualcomm said during its call with analysts that about 40 percent of its revenue comes from selling chips and licensing its technology to Apple and Samsung, the two leaders in the phone market. For the second quarter, Qualcomm expects per-share earnings of $1.15 to $1.25 on revenue of $5.5 billion to $6.3 billion. Analysts polled by Yahoo Finance projected earnings of $1.20 a share on sales of $5.9 billion. Aberle said Qualcomm doesn't expect a financial impact from the litigation in the second quarter. Qualcomm shares slid 3.2 percent to $55.09 in after-hours trading. The company's stock has lost about 14 percent of its value since Apple filed its lawsuit in the US.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Linux > Open Source Software FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! Mesa 12.0 Gets an Extra Release, Mesa 17.0.0 and 13.0.4 Receive New RC Builds GO Mesa 17.0.0-rc2, 13.0.4-rc1 and 12.0.6 available for testing Jan 25, 2017 22:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Collabora's Emil Velikov has announced today the availability of three Mesa builds, one stable for the Mesa 12.0 series, and two development releases for the upcoming Mesa 17 branch, as well as the fourth maintenance update to Mesa 13. We'll start with Mesa 12.0.6, which appears to be an extra, but also the last point release to the 12.0 stable branch, patching a CSO (Combined Sewer Overflow) issue that could lead to lockups of the graphics processing unit (GPU), as well as other unforeseen performance of the Gallium graphics drivers. From the release announcement, it would appear that Mesa 12.0.6 fixes a total of 43 bugs discovered lately in the RadeonSI, Intel i965, and Nouveau open-source graphics drivers, along with the Intel (ANV) Vulkan driver, the GLX DRI3 GPU offloading support, and NIR, the new IR (internal representation) for the Mesa shader compiler. "This is an extra release for the 12.0 stable branch, as per developers' feedback. There are no plans to have further 12.0.x releases. Users are encouraged to migrate to the 13.0 series in order to obtain future fixes," said Emil Velikov, Software Release Engineer at Collabora, in the mailing list announcement. Mesa 17 RC2 fixes 34 bugs, Mesa 13.0.4 RC1 adds many fixes for RadeonSI The development of the highly anticipated Mesa 17 series is on track, and today we're seeing the availability of the second Release Candidate, which attempts to address a total of 34 bugs since last week's RC1 build, improving the Freedreno Gallium3D driver, as well as the Intel i965, r600, RadeonSI, Radeon (RADV) and Intel (ANV) Vulkan drivers. Also today, the fourth maintenance update for the Mesa 13.0 series got its first Release Candidate, which should go stable in two days from the moment of writing this article, on January 27, 2017. Mesa 13.0.4 promises multiple fixes for the RadeonSI and Intel i965 open-source graphics drivers. It also attempts to patch an unusual glitch in the Freedreno Gallium3D driver and the popular glxgears OpenGL test tool. However, it looks like the star of the Mesa 13.0.4 point release will be the Intel (ANV) Vulkan driver, which will gain compatibility improvements with newer Vulkan loaders, some compliance and rendering fixes, and smoketesting. With Mesa 12.0.6 being the latest stable release for the Mesa 12 branch, it is recommended that you immediately migrate to the stable Mesa 13 series, at least until Mesa 17 is hitting the stable channels in early February. In the meantime, you can test the new RCs by downloading them from our website. #Mesa 17.0.0-rc2#Mesa 13.0.4-rc1#Mesa 12.0.6#Mesa 3D Graphics Library#Linux graphics subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Mozilla Firefox 51 Is the First Web Browser to Support the New WebGL 2 Standard Tails 2.10 Amnesic Live System Adds OnionShare Tool for Anonymous File Sharing Official Arch Linux ISO Image to Drop 32-bit (i686) Support Starting March 2017 NetworkManager 1.6 to Support PKCS#11 Tokens with 802.1x Authentication, More Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast Let’s Chat: With or Without an Antivirus in Windows 10?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 25, 2017 at 2:58PM The launch of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7-series smartphones market what was, arguably, the most significant design win that microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had ever scored in smartphones. Image source: Intel.  A large portion of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones include Intel's XMM 7360 cellular modem, and the chipmaker seems to be working hard to ensure that it builds compelling enough products to continue to win future iPhone business. At a recent investor conference, the head of Intel's Client Computing Group, Navin Shenoy, spent some time talking about the company's investments in and strategies related to cellular modems. In this column, I'd like to go over the salient points of that discussion. A "strategic investment" Shenoy began by saying that cellular modems represent a "strategic investment" for the chipmaker. "We do think that as the world gets more smart and connected, you're going to need modems -- it's going to be a core intellectual property, much like graphics was 10 years, 15 years ago," for Intel, he explained. Autonomous vehicles stand to benefit from cellular connectivity. Image source: Intel.  Shenoy went on to say that modems are going to be important in many of the key areas that Intel wants to participate in, including personal computers, cars, smartphones, and "other [Internet of things] applications." One modem a year keeps Apple interested The executive reiterated a commitment that other Intel executives have made in the past -- Intel intends to release new cellular modems each year. He also said that the company's next generation cellular modem, branded the XMM 7480, is scheduled to go into "high-volume manufacturing" during 2017. The 7360 entered mass production in 2016. Image source: Apple.  Considering that Apple is pretty much the only major buyer of Intel's cellular modems, it's clear that Intel is aiming to deliver new modems on this schedule so that its chips are ready to go for when Apple launches new smartphones each fall. Modem manufacturing strategy It's well known that all the modems that Intel has released thus far haven't been manufactured by Intel -- they're designed by Intel and manufactured by third parties. Shenoy declined to comment on where Intel will be manufacturing the next-generation XMM 7480 -- or, as he was quick to point out, future modems -- but made it clear that Intel's manufacturing choices would be made on a "pragmatic basis" and that the company is evaluating both in-house manufacturing as well as external options for future modems. Catching up with the market leader Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is known for being the leading manufacturer of cellular modems, but Shenoy did take the opportunity to brag a little bit about the company's recently announced 5G modem, referring to it as the "world's first global 5G modem." Image source: Qualcomm.  "All I can tell you is the investment in the modem portfolio -- and the commitment to invest in the modem portfolio -- is very strong and we think that over time we can be in an absolute equivalent position to our competitors," Shenoy asserted. The executive conceded that the company is "coming from a position of being behind and so it's going to take us a few generations to catch up." Catching up with the market leaders, particularly Qualcomm, is going to be a tall order, but if the company can pull it off, I'm sure that Apple -- which likes to have multiple sources for critical components -- will be extremely happy.

With identical performance to Skylake, Intel brings desktop performance to a standstill. Mark Walton (UK) - Jan 3, 2017 5:35 pm UTC Enlarge Mark Walton reader comments 450 Share this story Specs at a glance: Intel Core i7-7700K Architecture Kaby Lake Cores/Threads 4/8 Core Clock 4.2GHz Boost Clock 4.5GHz L3 Cache 8MB Memory Controller Two channel DDR4 TDP 91W Price £330/$350 Intel's Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K is what happens when a chip company stops trying. The top-end Kaby Lake part is the first desktop chip in a brave new post-"tick-tock" world—which means that instead of major improvements to architecture, process, and instructions per clock (IPC), we get slightly higher clock speeds and a way to decode DRM-laden 4K streaming video. Huzzah. For the average consumer building or buying a new performance-focused PC, a desktop chip based on 14nm Kaby Lake remains the chip of choice—a total lack of competition at this level makes sure of that. But for the enthusiast—where the latest and greatest should perform better than what came before—Kaby Lake desktop chips are a disappointment, a stopgap solution that does little more than give OEMs something new to stick on a label in a 2017 product stack. What's new? Further ReadingIntel pushes out the rest of its Kaby Lake processor lineup for 2017Which is not to say that the whole of the Kaby Lake lineup is a bust. There are some performance gains to be had further down the product stack, particularly in the graphics department. 15W U-series processors for thin-and-light laptops feature new Intel Iris Plus graphics, which promise as much as a 65 percent performance boost over older Intel HD graphics, while the more mature 14nm manufacturing process (dubbed 14nm+) promises better battery life. 45W H-series chips for laptops are unlocked for overclocking, and there's the new Core i3-7350K, an unlocked dual-core processor with hyperthreading for overclocking on the cheap. Know your codenames Codename and year Process Prominent consumer CPU branding Tick/tock Westmere (2010) 32nm Core i3/i5/i7 Tick (new process) Sandy Bridge (2011) 32nm Second-generation Core i3/i5/i7 Tock (new architecture) Ivy Bridge (2012) 22nm Third-generation Core i3/i5/i7 Tick Haswell (2013) 22nm Fourth-generation Core i3/i5/i7 Tock Broadwell (2014-15) 14nm Fifth-generation Core i3/i5/i7, Core M Tick/"Process" Skylake (2015-16) 14nm Sixth-generation Core i3/i5/i7, Core m3/m5/m7 Tock/"Architecture" Kaby Lake (2016-17) "14nm+" Seventh-generation Core i3/i5/i7, Core m3 "Optimization" Cannonlake (2017?) 10nm TBA "Process" The quad-core i7-7700K, which sits at the very top of the Kaby Lake lineup, is less interesting. Compared to the sixth-gen i7-6700K Skylake processor that preceded it, the i7-7700K gains a small bump in base and boost clocks to 4.2GHz and 4.5GHz respectively, as well as the deceptively named Intel HD Graphics 630. The latter, while new in name, is largely identical to the Intel HD Graphics 530 found in the i7-6700K. There are no major architectural changes, and it runs at the same 1150MHz clock speed. What you do get is support for 4K media decoding inside Windows 10's PlayReady 3.0 DRM, which makes 4K Netflix possible on PC. Further ReadingNetflix 4K streaming comes to the PC—but it needs Kaby Lake CPUKaby Lake motherboards are much like Kaby Lake processors: there's little of the way of actual performance improvements. Useful for storage fans, however, is the addition of four extra PCIe lanes to the top-end Z270 and Q270 chipsets, for a total of 24. With high performance storage having moved to the PCIe interface over SATA (see the NVMe-based Samsung 950 Pro), PCIe lanes are quickly becoming scarce. Combined with the 16 PCIe lanes on the processor, a Kaby Lake system now sports a total of 40 PCIe lanes. Up to six SATA 3.0 ports are supported by the Intel chipset, along with a total of 14 USB ports (2.0 and 3.0), three PCIe 3.0 storage slots, and three independent displays when using integrated graphics. Any other features are manufacturer specific. Mark Walton Mark Walton Mark Walton The spectacularly l33t gamer ASUS ROG Maximus IX Code, for instance (as used to benchmark the i7-7700K for this review), features an extra pair of USB 3.1 ports (one Type-A one Type-C) on the rear via an additional Asmedia controller. Interestingly, Asus has also placed a USB 3.1 header on the board itself for use with front panel Type-C connectors. Unfortunately, since this header is non-standard, only a handful of cases from Lian-Li and In-Win actually support it. Elsewhere, there are the usual array of Asus enhancements, including its excellent 2X2 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac MU-MIMO Wi-Fi, SupremeFX Audio S1220 solution (featuring a ESS Hi-Fi Sabre DAC), Intel I219-V Gigabit Ethernet chip, dual M.2 SSD slots, and enthusiast-friendly features like dedicated water pump headers, PMW/DC support across all five fan headers, and SLI support. Naturally, since it's now apparently a prerequisite for all enthusiast PC hardware, there's built-in RGB lighting tucked underneath the Code's hardy plastic cladding. It's worth noting that the Code is but a small part of what is a huge, horribly confusing line-up of Z270 motherboards from Asus, each of which has an ever so slightly different price point and set of features. The Code sits near the top of the pile with a £307 price tag (the most expensive being the £554 Maximums IX Extreme), but prices go as low as £117 for the Prime 270-P. I've said it before and I'll say it again: the motherboard market is needlessly intimidating to new PC builders. How anyone is supposed to know whether to buy a Deluxe, a Code, or whatever without some serious research is a mystery. What's wrong with good, better, best?

Ars Staff - Jan 6, 2017 12:30 pm UTC reader comments 68 Share this story What happens at CES, ends up in a video montage. Jennifer Hahn LAS VEGAS—The annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas tries to get consumers (and the media) excited for the new year with a treasure trove of new devices. Most of the big names in computing, gaming, fitness tech, smart home, and more show off some of their newest products that will come out later in the year. And until they hit shelves (if they hit the shelves), CES is the only way to get a glimpse of them. While the show's vastness results in a lot of seemingly useless hardware and even some vaporware—Ars UK has intel on the smart hairbrush, LG wants to make sure no one ever has to open a fridge manually again—there are always a few products that stick out and manage to get us genuinely excited for the year ahead. You can find all our coverage from the ground here if you want to wade through both the crazy and cool, but these are our picks for the best technology coming out of CES 2017. Best laptop or convertible: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Enlarge Valentina Palladino Traditionally when buying a laptop, one has to compromise. You’ll find a system that has almost everything you want, but there’s always something missing. We wrote about some of the basic features that we're going to insist on for laptops in 2017, and one machine shown at CES stood out as doing all the things we want. With Thunderbolt 3, NVMe storage, Precision Touchpads, biometric authentication, touch screens, and so much more, we're ready to lay hands on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga. The Yoga nails the basics. It also includes the 360-degree hinge that's invaluable on a plane or in a kitchen, a stylus that docks within the unit for safekeeping, built-in LTE connectivity, 802.11ad/WiGig, and (unusual these days) wired gigabit Ethernet. That's a compelling start, but it's the range of options that takes the Yoga to the next level: you can add an OLED screen, Iris Plus graphics, both a fingerprint reader and an IR camera supporting facial recognition, and NFC. The result is a machine that sets a new standard for connectivity and capabilities, showcasing some of the latest technology—and doing so without compromises. Best desktop or all-in-one: Intel Kaby Lake NUCs Enlarge Intel Further ReadingIntel’s new mini PCs have new chips, an updated design, and Thunderbolt 3 We've seen some interesting-looking all-in-one desktops at the show this year, including Dell's XPS 27 and HP's Pavilion Edge All-in-One with Micro-Edge Display. But in terms of sheer versatility and appeal, we've got to give the moniker of best to Intel's new NUC mini desktops. We've been fans of these PCs for years. Like the older NUCs, the new ones put decent Ultrabook-level performance suitable for productivity tasks and light gaming into a little box that will fit just about anywhere. The new models get an attractive makeover, the latest Kaby Lake CPUs and GPUs, HDMI 2.0 and HDMI-CEC support that will be sure to interest home theater enthusiasts, and a Thunderbolt 3 port that will allow for fast external storage, external GPUs, and all kinds of other possibilities. Best PC peripheral: Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ 27-inch gaming monitor Enlarge Asus Simply being first to something in the tech world isn’t necessarily a guarantee for quality or excellence. But when someone can lay claim to launching the consumer market's first monitor to combine 4K resolution, 144Hz refresh, HDR-10 compatibility, and Nvidia G-Sync support, they're bound to get our attention. Just finding three of those four in a PC monitor is tough these days. (The best we've seen, up until now, is Dell's UP3017Q, which maxes its 4K resolution at a 120Hz refresh without G-Sync.) Adding the wider color gamut and luminance differential of HDR to that package is a nice, brightly rendered cherry on top. You'll need quite the powerful computer to render such crisp, colorful, and smooth content, of course, but if you're already spending so much on a gaming powerhouse, what's another pricey monitor to you? Best gaming hardware: HTC Vive's TPCast Enlarge While the HTC Vive's room-scale VR experience is unquestionably amazing, it's also unquestionably annoying to deal with a thick, three-piece wire that tethers you to a nearby PC tower, tugging on the back of the headset and creating a tripping hazard while you walk around. That's why we're excited about the TPCast, which promises to make the Vive a truly wireless experience by streaming video and audio to the headset from a PC over the air (though there is still a wire running to a pocketable battery pack). There have been other untethered VR experiences, of course, but so far they tend to rely on underpowered mobile technology and have trouble with full head-tracking through space. TPCast promises the best of both worlds—high-end VR graphics and tracking without the annoying tether. If you can afford the $250 cost and can tolerate the reported two-hour battery life, this could greatly increase the quality of your virtual life.

By Ryan Fuhrmann, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 25, 2017, 2:01 pm EST     View All   Popular Posts: Intel Corporation (INTC) Q4 Earnings Preview Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Is No Moonshot 3 3D Printing Stocks That Could Catch Fire Again Recent Posts: Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Is Still Your Best Big-Energy Bet Intel Corporation (INTC) Q4 Earnings Preview 3 3D Printing Stocks That Could Catch Fire Again View All Posts Semiconductor giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is set to announce its fourth-quarter earnings results after the bell Thursday, Jan. 26. At 5 p.m., it will hold its conference call to provide details on sales, profit and cash flow trends to INTC stock holders and analysts. Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr Intel is the undisputed leader in semiconductors. By a fairly wide margin, it is the largest chip maker in the world. Its dominance came from rapid growth in personal computers in the 1990s, and it still controls the market; 8 out of 10 PCs are powered by Intel’s chips. But as PC sales have slowed in recent years, Intel has had to reboot its growth strategy. Thanks to its dominance, which results in billions of dollars of free cash flow annually and an unmatched R&D budget that is one of the largest of any company in the world, it has a firm plan in place. INTC stock holders are looking forward to hearing the current state of Intel’s business tomorrow. Here are some details on what to expect. Analyst Expectations for Intel Earnings The 30 analysts covering Intel expect fourth-quarter earnings of 75 cents per share. The estimate has bounced within a penny of that figure over the past 90 days, so looks to have been relatively steady. That is also within a penny of the 74 cents that INTC posted in last year’s fourth quarter. Back when it released third-quarter results in October, Intel provided Q4 estimates of its own. It said to expect quarterly sales of $15.7 billion, a gross margin of around 61% and a tax rate of 22%. Companies generally provide these estimates so analysts can build out their own financial projections, which in turn results in consensus estimates for investors to follow. For the full year (so including the three quarters already reported and coming fourth-quarter earnings), 35 analysts have an estimate and expect EPS of $2.67. Again, that figure has been pretty steady over the past three months. Analysts collectively expect sales growth just north of 6% and total annual sales of $58.8 billion. The Bigger Picture for INTC Stock For decades now, Intel’s bread and butter has been selling semiconductors for personal computers and related devices. It literally dominates rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and boasts a total market share of 80%. But of course, PCs aren’t growing like they used to, and Intel has been working hard to diversify into other lines of business. In Intel’s corporate speak, it says its strategy is to use “core assets to move into profitable, complementary markets.” An important market is to get more chips into mobile devices such as tablets and mobile phones. Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) currently dominates the smartphone chip market. Chips that power data centers, which help store and retrieve digital information in the cloud, is another huge growth focus. This area has generally been called the internet of things.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) and QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM), according to a note from Benchmark. Qualcomm Vs. Intel: Thin Modems The Apple-Qualcomm litigation suggests souring relations between the two companies, and the iPhone maker could procure more thin modems from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC). This potential move would benefit CEVA, as Intel’s thin modems utilize CEVA’s DSP (digital signal processor), while Qualcomm’s thin modems do not. Intel and Qualcomm are the two primary thin cellular modem suppliers for Apple’s various iPhone 7 models. Qualcomm’s modems power CDMA versions, while Intel’s modems are used in GSM/non-CDMA networks. CEVA To Maintain, Gain Market Share “With the suit pitting Qualcomm and Apple against one another, and as validated with AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T)’s October certification of Intel’s 4th generation modem, it is likely CEVA will maintain or gain market share when Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone is launched next fall,” analyst Gary Mobley wrote in a note. Mobley pointed out that the fourth-generation Intel XMM7480 modem now supports CDMA networks, accomplished via the acquisition of VIA Telecom. The analyst believes Intel could gain share at Apple despite delivering only about half the downlink speed versus comparable Qualcomm modems. “While the Intel modems has about half the downlink speeds as the comparable generation Qualcomm modem, speed are sufficient for Apple’s needs, and the 4th -gen Intel modem handles 33 LTE bands as well as the necessary envelop tracking,” Mobley explained. Analyst's Estimates Mobley estimates that Apple most likely bought $500 million–$800 million worth of Intel thin modems in 2016, which would translate into $5 million–$8 million in royalties for CEVA. This in turn could bring about $0.25 in non-GAAP EPS for CEVA, based on the midpoint. In fact, CEVA could more than double its royalties generated from Intel if Qualcomm loses all share at Apple for the iPhone 8 (10th anniversary). At last check, shares of CEVA had risen 3.42 percent to $36.30, close to its 52-week high of $36.81. Mobley has a Buy rating on the stock, with price target of $40.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 25, 2017 at 11:59AM Right now, one of the hottest trends in the semiconductor industry is the emerging market for autonomous vehicles. It is generally accepted that to do proper autonomous vehicles, a lot of computing power is going to be needed inside of the cars to give them the required "intelligence." Image source: NVIDIA.  Two companies that have made public their intentions to aggressively pursue the market for the "brains" inside of self-driving cars are microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Both companies have announced major partnerships and deals with automotive makers and suppliers. Intel, for instance, announced last year that it would be collaborating with Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) and Delphi Automotive to build platforms for use by automotive manufacturers. Intel has also said that, in 2016, it booked self-driving car deals collectively worth more than $1 billion in lifetime revenue. Last year, NVIDIA and Audi announced that they would, together, try to bring self-driving cars to market by 2020. NVIDIA's components are also found inside of Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ:TSLA) new vehicles, as well. So, both NVIDIA and Intel both look well-positioned to capitalize on a potential self-driving car boom. Which stock is the better way to play it? These are adjacent businesses for both It's important to understand that self-driving car platforms aren't either of these companies' core revenue drivers today -- they're adjacent businesses. Intel's core business is microprocessors and related components for personal computers and data centers, and NVIDIA's core businesses are graphics processors designed for gaming, workstations, and data centers. An Intel chip designed specifically for automotive use. Image source: Intel.  For Intel, autonomous vehicles are just one (potentially significant) part of the company's Internet of Things business (though the company did recently announce that it'd be forming an autonomous driving group within its Internet of Things group). NVIDIA specifically calls out automotive as a key long-term growth segment.  The reason that both companies look well-positioned to play in the self-driving car market is because the technology that they've developed for other markets (high-performance computing technologies) look to be applicable to self-driving cars. However, there is additional technical and sales/marketing work required to succeed in self-driving cars, and both companies appear to be making the required incremental investments to capitalize on these opportunities. Automotive could be a bigger deal for NVIDIA than for Intel Here's the thing: Both NVIDIA and Intel have an opportunity to make some real money from the self-driving market. Furthermore, the market for significant computing capabilities inside of self-driving cars could be quite substantial, especially if many (if not most) cars over the long term are endowed with such computing capabilities. However, I think that the self-driving car market could be much more interesting for NVIDIA than for Intel by Intel's sheer size relative to NVIDIA. If Intel manages to grow its Internet of Things business from about $3 billion in annual revenue to $5 billion in annual revenue, then that'd certainly be nice, but not a game changer for Intel, which is expected to have generated more than $58 billion in revenue during 2016. However, if NVIDIA -- which has generated about $6.1 billion in revenue over the last 12 months -- generates an incremental $2 billion in automotive-related revenue from self-driving cars over time, then that's not only going to significantly boost the company's top line, but its bottom line as well. Answering the titular question Although I wouldn't recommend buying either Intel or NVIDIA solely based on the potential for self-driving cars (these are complex businesses that generate most of their revenue from outside of the automotive market to begin with), NVIDIA's business does appear to be more likely to benefit from growth in self-driving cars than Intel's because it's a smaller one to begin with.

X Intel and DCU agree deal on research collaboration Research planned on health, water quality management and Stem education initiatives Wed, Jan 25, 2017, 16:27 Ciara O'Brien The Dublin City University campus. Intel has teamed with DCU to collaborate on research into connected health, water-quality management and Stem education innovation.         Intel has teamed up with Dublin City University to collaborate on research into connected health, water-quality management and Stem education innovation, to help develop technologies that could change how we live, learn and work in the future. The agreement pinpoints joint areas of interest, using developments in the internet of things and data analytics. It will also look at how creative arts and design can be used alongside technology. The two organisations have worked together in the past, but this is the first time there has been a formal agreement to join forces on research and innovation. Among previous collaborations, Intel and DCU have worked on the development of plasma diagnostics to improve computer chip manufacturing processes and the identification of new materials for use with future device fabrication protocol. Platform It also yielded a project that used Intel’s internet-of-things platform for DCU’s Smart Stadium at Croke Park to provide data on player metrics, queue times for refreshments and even traffic information on the stadium routes. “At Intel we have been proactively developing our advanced manufacturing capability, together with a design, research and innovation footprint in Ireland over the last 27 years,” said Intel Ireland general manager Eamonn Sinnott. “This development has been underpinned by the strong relationships we have built with academic institutions and the innovation community across Ireland. The signing of this memorandum today signals a new strategic approach to our engagement with DCU which will consolidate and build on our existing relationship and pave the way for exciting new collaborations.” Learning DCU and Intel will also work to influence policy on sustainability, education and ageing, using technology to enhance learning and living. The two organisations will also host an annual science, technology, engineering, arts and maths student hackathon, with Intel backing 16 master’s student bursaries each year. ADVERTISEMENT “Both organisations are committed to fostering the development of creative talent and our respective research interests intersect and overlap in areas that have the potential to transform lives and societies. We are excited that the formalisation of our relationship today will allow for further opportunities to embrace the creative arts as drivers of the next wave of economic growth in this country.”       Topics: Eamonn Sinnott Dublin City University Intel Ireland Read More The Netflix of software is about to disrupt the disruptors US court refuses to reconsider decision in Microsoft email case Messaging service Line sees quarterly profit and sales fall short New health Bill creates ‘insurmountable conflict’ for data watchdog Are you a specialist?

Recent Posts: Samsung (SSNLF) Expected to Launch Galaxy S8 on March 29 Facebook Inc (FB) Hires Former Google Exec to Lead Oculus Is Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)? View All Posts For decades, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was at the heart of the technology industry. As the company whose CPUs dominated the PC era, it was second to none. But Intel missed out on the mobile revolution and with PCs losing relevance every year, its leadership position has weakened. Nudging itself into Intel’s place? Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Click to Enlarge Source: NVIDIA Nvidia started as a PC graphics card manufacturer, but now, NVDA stock is riding a wave of virtual reality gaming, artificial intelligence, deep data analysis, cloud computing and self-driving cars. As its GPU-accelerated products take over processor-intensive computing, is Nvidia set to dethrone Intel? GPUs Make the Leap From Graphics to Raw Processing Power In the old days of computing, graphics processing units (GPUs) played second fiddle to central processing units (CPUs). Intel’s processors were literally at the heart of almost every computer sold. The CPU was responsible for running the computer, including its operating system. When a GPU was installed, the CPU was still primary, but it farmed off graphics-intensive tasks to the GPU. Most PCs used integrated graphics that were built into their Intel CPU. Graphics cards from companies like Nvidia — with a standalone GPU — were primarily used in specialized gaming PCs. It helps to think of the CPU as a generalist, while the GPU does one thing over and over. This difference began really turning to the advantage of NVDA about a decade ago. Desktop PC CPUs from Intel might have four cores, letting the CPU manage a handful of different tasks simultaneously. GPUs were equipped with hundreds of cores, and software developers realized they could take advantage of this raw parallel processing power for much more than just graphics. The GPU could be used to greatly accelerate software performance when repetitive tasks are being performed — encoding video, for example, or data analysis. GPU acceleration can make some tasks 100 times faster than a CPU alone. Because the GPU is designed for one primary purpose — everything including computer graphics boils down to crunching numbers — NVDA is able to produce them at far lower cost than a CPU at an equivalent performance level, while producing less heat and using less power. Why GPUs Are in Higher Demand Than CPUs Why the demand for GPUs? Think of how the demand for processor-intensive computing power has increased over the past decade. One early example was Bitcoin. The virtual currency could be purchased, but it could also be “mined” by using a PC to run a complex algorithm in search of Bitcoins. Miners soon discovered that a GPU — with its parallel number-crunching capability — was far more effective than a CPU at mining Bitcoins. Anywhere from 50 to 100 times faster. Soon miners were running rigs consisting of multiple GPUs connected together. Meantime, GPUs have rapidly become more powerful, with more cores and faster clock rates, even as CPU development has become relatively incremental. Intel’s new seventh-generation Kaby Lake Core i7 CPU for desktop computers still has four cores. In comparison, Nvidia’s latest Titan X graphics card has 3,584 processing cores on tap. The Intel CPU costs less than a third of the Titan X’s $1200 MSRP, but when used in number-crunching applications, the Nvidia card’s price is a steal.

This week during the BETT 2017 convention in London, Dell introduced a new portfolio of laptops and monitors for the educational system. Overall, the company revealed three Windows 10 laptops and three Chromebooks for the K-12 student crowd across the globe, aimed at making the learning environment an easier, more fun experience. The two new monitors aim to do the same, offering huge screens and multi-touch input for better interactions between teachers and their students. Dell Latitude 11 Education Series 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop This model boasts a rubberized LCD and base trim to help absorb shock from bumps and devices drops. It also includes a fully sealed keyboard and clickpad just in case snack time turns into an accidental disaster. The convertible also promises all-day battery life thanks to the power-sipping Celeron and Pentium processors from Intel. One thing to note is that the Windows 10 Latitude model supports input from Dell’s Productivity Active Pen peripheral. It also includes a rear-facing camera when the device is positioned into tablet mode. The screen is capable of rotating 360 degrees, offering Clamshell, Tablet, and Tent positions. The Windows 10 unit relies on 7th-generation Intel Celeron and Pentium processors whereas the Chromebook uses 6th-generation Celeron CPUs. Latitude 3189 Chromebook 3189 Operating system: Windows 10 Home (64-bit) Windows 10 Pro (64-bit) Chrome OS Display size: 11.6 inches with Touch 11.6 inches with Touch Resolution: 1,366 x 768 1,366 x 768 Processor: Intel Celeron (7th Gen) Intel Pentium (7th Gen) Intel Celeron (6th Gen) Graphics: Intel Integrated Intel Integrated Memory: 4GB LPDDR3 @ 1,600MHz 4GB LPDDR3 @ 1,600MHz Storage: 128GB SSD 16GB eMMC 32GB eMMC 64GB eMMC Connectivity: Wireless AC Bluetooth 4.2 Wireless AC Bluetooth 4.2 Cameras: 1x Webcam 1x Rear Camera 1x Webcam Battery: 42 Watt hour 42 Watt hour Ports: 2x USB 3.0 (one charges) 1x HDMI 1x Micro SD card reader 1x Headphone / Microphone jack 2x USB 3.0 1x HDMI 1x Micro SD card reader 1x Headphone / Microphone jack Size: 11.96 x 8.18 x 0.82 inches 11.96 x 8.18 x 0.82 inches Weight: Starting at 3.25 pounds Starting at 3.22 pounds Availability: February 7 February 7 Pricing: Starting at $579 Starting at $349 Dell Latitude 11 Education Series Laptop With these units, Dell had mobility in mind as students move the laptops from desk to table for group assignments. They’re similar to the convertible models, only the screens are capable of opening a full 180 degrees so that they lay flat against the desktop surface for situations such as student collaborations around a single unit. They also promise all-day battery life due to the Intel processors combined with the 42-Watt-hour batteries. Dell’s new Latitude 11 Education Series include features like a network activity light so that teachers know when students connect to the network (Chromebooks only), a full-size webcam, and a rubberized base trim to lessen shocks from accidental drops and bumps. As with the convertible models, the Windows 10 laptops rely on 7th-generation Intel processors while the Chromebooks use 6th-generation chips.

With the Dell Latitude 13 Education series, the company offers Windows 10 Home, Windows 10 Pro, Windows 7, Ubuntu, NeoKylin, and Chrome OS. The larger size enables more processor and connectivity options such as optional 4G LTE and an Ethernet port. The Windows 10, Ubuntu, and NeoKylin units are based on 6th-generation and 7th-generation Intel processors whereas the Chromebooks only use 6th-generation chips. The non-touch units have an anti-glare component and the touch-capable models are protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass. These notebooks have a network light, too, for alerting teachers when students access the network.

For starters, we have the mammoth 86-inch model based on In-Plane Switching panel technology that’s known for its wide viewing angles and superb color depth. This interactive monitor has a huge brightness of 400 nits and an even larger resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 so that the students caught cutting up at the back of the class can’t blame it on their inability to see the lesson or presentation. Screen size: 86 inches Resolution: 3,840 x 2,160 Aspect ratio: 16:9 Panel type: IPS Response time: 8 milliseconds Max brightness: 400 nits Contrast ratio: 1,000:1 Viewing angles: 178 degrees (H) 178 degrees (V) Color gamut: 72 percent CIE 1931 Color depth: 1.07 billion Touch details: Up to 20 points finger touch Up to 4 points pen touch Audio: 2x 20-watt speakers Ports: 4x HDMI 2.0 1x DisplayPort 1.2 1x VGA 4x USB 3.0 (one charges) 1x Audio input 1x Audio output Availability: March 30 Pricing: Below $11,000 Dell Interactive Touch Monitor C5518QT Finally, this interactive touch monitor is a smaller version of the 86-inch unit, sporting a 55-inch screen and a lower brightness of 350 nits. Outside the obvious physical aspect, the big difference with this unit is that it has one less HDMI port and smaller, 10-watt speakers. However, both have anti-glare and anti-smudge coatings to keep all those fingerprints from clouding up the lesson or presentation. Screen size: 55 inches Resolution: 3,840 x 2,160 Aspect ratio: 16:9 Panel type: IPS Response time: 8 milliseconds Max brightness: 350 nits Contrast ratio: 1,000:1 Viewing angles: 178 degrees (H) 178 degrees (V) Color gamut: 72 percent CIE 1931 Color depth: 1.07 billion Touch details: Up to 20 points finger touch Up to 4 points pen touch Audio: 2x 10-watt speakers Ports: 3x HDMI 2.0 1x DisplayPort 1.2 1x VGA 4x USB 3.0 (one charges) 1x Audio input 1x Audio output Availability: March 30 Pricing: Below $5,000 Also watch: Share

The refreshed line includes new 2-in-1 and standard notebooks under the Latitude series as well as Chromebook. The Dell Latitude 11 Convertible and Chromebook 11 Convertible are the latest and one of the first 2-in-1 notebooks offered by the company (it just launched the XPS 13 2-in-1). Featuring a reversible screen that can flip over both the laptops can be used in tablet mode. It is said to be suitable for kids as it comes with toughened, scratch-resistant glass and the Latitude offers support for a stylus as well.

Image: Connor McKenna The long-term collaboration between Intel and Dublin City University has been strengthened, after plans to foster talent and develop advanced technologies have emerged. Now more than two decades old, Intel’s ties with Dublin City University (DCU) are already extensive. There’s a Croke Park Smart Stadium project, plasma diagnostics, materials science and chip manufacturing collaboration all ongoing. Now isn’t the time to ease up, seemingly, as the duo reveals plans to build on its partnership in the coming years. Key areas of research activity will leverage advances in internet of things and data analytics for application in areas such as connected health, water quality management and STEM education innovations. The agreement will also seek to combine the creative arts and design with technology in the next wave of Irish innovation. Claiming to be “proactively developing our advanced manufacturing capability”, Eamonn Sinnott, GM of Intel Ireland, said the news is evidence of his company consolidating and building on its academic relationships. In a move to secure talent for these future developments, Intel will support a new programme offering 16 MA student bursaries each year. As part of the partnership, the duo will collaborate on efforts to shape public policy in relation to sustainability, ageing and education. A STEAM hackathon will be hosted each year, too. “Both organisations are committed to fostering the development of creative talent and our respective research interests intersect and overlap in areas that have the potential to transform lives and societies,” said Prof Brian MacCraith, president of DCU. Interestingly, news of the partnership comes on the same day that outgoing University College of Cork president Michael Murphy claims business has too much influence on the Irish research agenda. In the Irish Examiner, Murphy said industry should have a say in university paths, keeping the latter relevant with the needs of today. “But we also have to be very careful about the extent to which we permit the business sector to influence the overall agenda,” he said. “I have a concern at the extent to which the business community has become the dominant voice in the research agenda.” In-Depth: More on Dublin City University Related: Intel, Dublin City University, Ireland, internet of things, education, research Gordon Hunt is a journalist at Siliconrepublic.com editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Innovation DCU researcher applies maths to the human behaviour of investing 2 hours ago1 Share Hiring Now Join us to create the technology of tomorrow Helping the world be well.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Features Reviews Search Subscribe Laptops Dell's latest laptops are built to survive the classroom David Nield 7 pictures Dell has three new laptops to show off, with a choice of Windows or Chrome OS on eachView gallery - 7 images Dell has launched three new laptops made with kids (and their parents and teachers) in mind. Capable of running Windows or Chrome OS, the laptops are all built to survive the rigors of the classroom and beyond, with rugged designs and all-day battery life. The Dell Latitude 11 Convertible and Chromebook 11 Convertible are the latest in a long line of 2-in-1 notebooks with reversible screens you can flip over and use in tablet mode. With toughened, scratch-resistant glass they should be able to go anywhere that kids do, and the Latitude (Windows) model includes support for a stylus, too. The Latitude 11 also comes with a front-facing camera for Skype calls and video recording, and is fitted with 7th-gen Kaby Lake Celeron or Pentium processors from Intel. The Chromebook sticks with 6th-gen Skylake Intel Celeron CPUs. The more conventional laptops are the Latitude 11/Chromebook 11 and the Latitude 13/Chromebook 13, fitted with either 11-inch or 13-inch screens. All four models have a 180-degree hinge on the display, so keyboard and screen can be laid flat – perfect for groups of kids huddled around a desk. Again you get the same choice of processors as with the convertible models, while the 13-inch versions up the specs a little, with the Windows model topping out at a 7th-gen Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 CPU. The 13-inch Chromebooks are fitted with 6th-gen Skylake Intel Core i3 CPUs instead. Most significantly, and in line with education-focused Chromebooks we've seen from Dell in the past, all three models follow the MIL-STD-810g military standard for design, which covers environmental pressures like temperature, shock, humidity and water exposure. Although there are no fixed ratings for the laptops in terms of exactly what they can stand up to, they've been built to be carried and knocked around in the classroom all day. All these models have sealed keyboards and trackpads to guard against spills, for example, plus rubberized, ergonomic keys for hard-hitting little fingers. Dell is claiming an "all-day" battery life on all the new laptops too, and the low-power Intel processors and relatively low-res 1,366 x 768 pixel displays across the board should help in that department. Finally, there are a bunch of built-in connectivity options available, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, HDMI and USB. All these models are available from February 7 in the US. The 11-inch Convertible laptops are priced at US$579 for the Windows model and $349 for the Chrome OS version, while the standard versions can be had for even cheaper: $349 for the Latitude 11, $219 for the Chromebook 11, $519 for the Latitude 13 and $299 for the Chromebook 13.

Now that Intel has unleashed its seventh-generation Kaby Lake desktop processors to the masses, the company is gearing up to release processors for the professional workstation market under the Xeon E3-1200 v6 brand in the first quarter of 2017. Like their desktop-class counterparts, these chips will be compatible with single-socket LGA1151 motherboards and support Intel’s older 100 Series motherboard chipsets as well as the new 200 Series launched in early January. That leads us to a leak of specifications provided by support documentation for Micro-Star International motherboards used in workstations. Eight unannounced Xeon processors were discovered sporting four cores, 8MB of L3 cache, and maximum power draws of 72 and 73 watts, depending on the chip. The flagship model in this group supposedly has a base clock speed of 3.9GHz, but no integrated graphics component. Here they are: Cores Threads Base Speed L3 Cache Integrated Graphics GPU Speed TDP Xeon E3-1280 v6 4 8 3.9GHz 8MB No N/A 72 watts Xeon E3-1275 v6 4 8 3.8GHz 8MB Intel HD P630 Up to 1,150MHz 73 watts Xeon E3-1270 v6 4 8 3.8GHz 8MB No N/A 72 watts Xeon E3-1245 v6 4 8 3.7GHz 8MB Intel HD P630 Up to 1,150MHz 73 watts Xeon E3-1240 v6 4 8 3.7GHz 8MB No N/A 72 watts Xeon E3-1230 v6 4 8 3.5GHz 8MB No N/A 72 watts Xeon E3-1225 v6 4 4 3.3GHz 8MB Intel HD P630 Up to 1,150MHz 73 watts Xeon E3-1220 v6 4 4 3.0GHz 8MB No N/A 72 watts As the chart shows, the processors with integrated graphics have a maximum power draw of 73 watts (or 78 watts, depending on the source) while the GPU-free chips sip 72 watts of power. The previous v5 generation consumed around 80 watts of power, so users will see a performance boost at a reduced power cost with these upcoming v6 chips. The listed processors packed with integrated graphics are using the “professional” version of the Intel HD Graphics 630 component used in Intel’s new desktop processors for the mass market, hence the ‘P’ in the name. It is based on Intel’s Gen9 graphics architecture supporting a maximum resolution of 4,096 x 2,304 at 60Hz via DisplayPort, H.265 encode and decode, and more. The base graphics speed may be around 350MHz as seen with the Core i7-7700K for desktops. More: Intel’s Project Alloy chases perfect immersion, but comes up short Right now, the CPU turbo speeds of the upcoming E3-1200 v6 series are unknown, but here is a comparison between the v5 and v6 models related to their base speeds and maximum power draw: Base Speed v5 Base Speed v6 TDP v5 TDP v6 Xeon E3-1280 3.7GHz 3.9GHz 80 watts 72 watts Xeon E3-1275 3.6GHz 3.8GHz 80 watts 73 watts Xeon E3-1270 3.6GHz 3.8GHz 80 watts 72 watts Xeon E3-1245 3.5GHz 3.7GHz 80 watts 73 watts Xeon E3-1240 3.5GHz 3.7GHz 80 watts 72 watts Xeon E3-1230 3.4GHz 3.5GHz 80 watts 72 watts Xeon E3-1225 3.3GHz 3.3GHz 80 watts 73 watts Xeon E3-1220 3.0GHz 3.0GHz 80 watts 72 watts Comparing the two generations together, five of the new v6 models are 200MHz faster than the previous v5 models while reducing the maximum power draw in the process. These new chips are based on Intel’s 14nm Plus process technology, which is an optimized version of 14nm-based manufacturing enabling higher frequencies and a better power efficiency. On a more detailed level, 14nm Plus provides a higher fin height and a larger pitch so the transistors aren’t quite so packed together. Intel has not stated exactly when the new Xeon E3-1200 v6 processors will arrive, or for how much.

The technology is what many companies in Internet search and artificial intelligence are trying to advance, and includes picture search and matching, as one example. “Perception, such as recognizing a face in an image, is one of the essential goals of the ZTE 5G System,” said Duan Xiangyang, vice president of ZTE Wireless Institute. “Deep learning technology is very important as it can enable such perception in mobile edge computing systems, thus making ZTE’s 5G System smarter.” The test took place in Nanjing City, China, where ZTE’s engineers used Intel’s midrange Arria® 10 FPGA for a cloud inferencing application using a CNN algorithm. ZTE has achieved a new record – beyond a thousand images per second in facial recognition – with what is known as “theoretical high accuracy” achieved for its custom topology. Intel’s Arria 10 FPGA accelerated the raw design performance more than 10 times while maintaining the accuracy. The Arria 10 FPGA provides up to 1.5 teraflops (TFLOPs) single precision floating-point processing performance, 1.15 million logic elements and more than a terabit-per-second high-speed connectivity. Such deep learning designs can be seamlessly migrated from the Arria 10 FPGA family to the high-end Intel Stratix® 10 FPGA family, and users can expect up to nine times performance boost. Besides the impressive increase in performance, the team at ZTE Wireless Institute sped design time with the use of the OpenCL programming language. “With the Intel reference design, and using the Intel SDK for OpenCL to program the FPGA, our development time was greatly shortened,” said Xiong Tiankui, chief engineer at ZTE Wireless Institute. “We are pleased with the benchmark achieved and thank the Intel Programmable Solutions Group for supporting our project.” Resources: Computer and Storage Solutions Intel Arria 10 FPGAs Machine Learning with FPGAs Configuration: The benchmark was achieved on a server holding 4S Intel Xeon E5-2670v3 processors running at 2.30GHz, 128GB DDR4; Intel PSG Arria 10 FPGA Development Kit with one 10AGX115 FPGA, 4GB DDR4 SODIMM, Intel Quartus Prime and OpenCL SDK v16.1.     Contact Altera Corp.

Sarah Tew/CNET Mobile by Shara Tibken January 20, 2017 1:05 PM PST @sharatibken Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Apple's latest lawsuit target? Qualcomm. The iPhone maker on Friday filed suit against Qualcomm, alleging the wireless chipmaker didn't give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. Apple also said Qualcomm sought to punish it for cooperating in a South Korean investigation into Qualcomm's licensing practices by withholding a $1 billion rebate. Apple wants a court to lower the amount it pays Qualcomm in licensing fees, as well as order the return of the $1 billion. The company said in its suit that Qualcomm should be paid royalties based on the value of its particular contribution, not for contributions from other patent holders. Currently, Qualcomm's royalties are based off the selling price of a phone, rather than what portion Qualcomm's technology enabled. "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," Apple said in a statement. "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations." Qualcomm, meanwhile, fired back at Apple's allegations, calling them "baseless." Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement: Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent [South Korean Fair Trade Commission] decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits. Qualcomm is the world's biggest provider of mobile chips, and it created some of the essential standards for connecting phones to cellular networks. The company derives a significant portion of its revenue from licensing that technology to other chipmakers. Apple designs the processors in its iPhones and iPads, but it buys chips from Qualcomm to connect to 4G LTE and other cellular networks. Under Qualcomm's licensing structure, Apple pays it a fee for its chips and another fee for the intellectual property included in those chips. Most components suppliers bundle the IP cost in with the chip sales price. See also Qualcomm forced Apple into exclusive chip deal, FTC says Qualcomm hit with $850M fine in South Korea antitrust probe Why your AT&T iPhone 7 won't work well on Verizon's network For the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus introduced this year, Apple also started buying 4G LTE chips from another supplier, Intel. Because Intel's chips use some of Qualcomm's essential technology, Apple pays Qualcomm a licensing fee for those processors, as well, which is based off the total value of the iPhone ($650) versus the value of the Intel chip (closer to $20). Apple says Qualcomm's practices are unfair, as are the clauses in Qualcomm's licensing terms that prevent Apple from seeking out other suppliers or participating in government inquiries into Qualcomm's practices. "This will likely be troublesome for Qualcomm who, by virtue of being so far ahead technologically with so much market share, has a painted target on its back," Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead said. Monopoly? Qualcomm has come under scrutiny in recent years for alleged monopolistic practices. Two years ago, it paid China nearly $1 billion to end a 14-month antitrust investigation in that country. Then, in December, South Korea hit Qualcomm with a $850 million fine following a three-year investigation. The South Korean Fair Trade Commission accused the chipset maker of having an "unfair business model" and creating a monopoly with its practices. Master the bokeh effect on the iPhone 7 Plus The dual-lens camera on Apple's iPhone 7 Plus is finally showing off its full potential with the update to iOS 10.1. We'll show you what the new portrait mode looks like and how to use it. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 2:09 Close Drag Earlier this week, the US jumped into the fray, with the US Federal Trade Commission filing a lawsuit that accused Qualcomm of forcing Apple to use its chips exclusively in exchange for lower licensing fees, excluding competitors and harming competition. In its heavily redacted complaint (PDF), the FTC said the patents Qualcomm held are standard-essential patents -- technology that is essential to the industry and must be licensed to competitors under fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms (FRAND). But the complaint alleges that Qualcomm consistently refused to license some standard-essential patents to rival chipmakers, in violation of its FRAND commitments. Qualcomm said in response to the FTC complaint earlier this week that it "has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms." 10 10 tips every iPhone 7 owner should know Apple, meanwhile, has been involved in plenty of litigation of its own. The company faced off against Samsung at the Supreme Court in October over a design patent case. Ironically, at issue in that suit was whether Samsung had to pay damages based on the entire value of its infringing phones or only on the portion that infringed. The Supreme Court ultimately decided that damages don't have to be based on an entire device and sent the case back to the lower court. Apple on Friday said Qualcomm charges it "at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined." The company added that Qualcomm recently withheld nearly $1 billion in payments from Apple "as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them." "Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use," the company said in its statement. "We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts." Apple filed the lawsuit in federal district court in the Southern District of California, Qualcomm's backyard instead of Apple's home in Northern California. The company has asked for a jury trial.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Exclusive  ⋮  Hardware  ⋮  Video i7-7700K vs A10-7700K: IGP Gaming Performance Showdown By Keith May Jan 23, 2017 164Shares Share Tweet Submit When you think of comparing the new Kaby Lake i7-7700K to another CPU the A10-7700K isn’t likely your first thought.  Okay, they share the same model number within their family but that’s about it.  The i7 is the latest top dog in the Intel mainstream Core Series while the A10 isn’t even the highest performing APU from AMD.  Sure, the i7 has double the threading capabilities and is just simply a more modern and capable platform.  But what about their IGP gaming performance?     Intel HD Graphics have been ever improving but always fell short of AMDs IGP offerings of their R series found on their APU line.  Admittedly Intel’s Broadwell i5-5675C and i7-5775C with Iris Pro Graphics 6200 brought the pain, but was very limited.  That is why this was done, to see how far Intel’s HD Graphics have come and how well AMD’s R series on die graphics have held up.  Just as a disclaimer the A10-7700K was picked for it’s name alone, unfortunately it is the only A10 series APU to feature the smaller 384 Stream Processors IGP rather than the 512 Stream Processors of its bigger A10 brethren.   Advertisement   IGP Platforms CPU Intel Core i7 7700k AMD A10 7700k IGP Intel HD 630 Radeon R7 (384) Motherboard ASUS Z270 Maximus IX Hero ASUS A88X Crossblade Ranger Memory 16GB (2x8GB) G.Skill Trident Z DDR4 3200MHz 16GB (4x4GB) Corsair Vengeance LP DDR3 2133MHz Storage OCZ Trion 150 480GB SSD OCZ Trion 150 480GB SSD PSU Thermaltake TR2 430w Thermaltake TR2 430w Intel Kaby Lake Desktop CPU Lineup Leaked - Core i7-7700K Leads the Pack, Boosts Up to 4.5 GHz   *UPDATE* After taking in some feedback the idea of memory speed should have been looked into more in depth.  So I took some time to go back and see how the i7 7700k with the HD 630 would have performed if I had used DDR4 2400.  The video below is the result of those tests.   Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

By John Kimelman Biography Jan. 24, 2017 6:20 p.m. ET Getty Images Unfortunately for financial journalists, the speed of markets vastly exceeds the time it takes for journalists to cover those markets. Anyone needing a reminder of that only had to see how quickly stocks moved once it was clear on election night that Donald Trump would be the next president. Stocks in sectors ranging from financial services to Big Pharma rose on the expectation that Trump, who favors a lower corporate tax and less industry regulation, will help usher policies favorable to corporate bottom lines. In the days and weeks that followed, financial writers had to play catch-up in writing about stocks and other investments that would be both helped and hurt by the GOP controlling both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Some of this catch-up journalism has its place. Still, it can’t be forgotten that stocks absorb all available information fairly quickly in hours, if not minutes. They certainly don’t wait around for writers on a daily, weekly or monthly deadline to weigh in. That fact hasn’t stopped Fortune veteran writer Shawn Tully from writing about the likely investment impact arising from GOP plans to create a tax break on the foreign profits of U.S. corporations that would repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars.

Tully attempts to quantify how much capital could potentially infuse the bottom lines of U.S. companies should President Trump and Congress agree to tax foreign profits at a low level – say 10%. The odds of such a tax holiday are quite high since both political parties favor it. “According to data assembled by Jack Ciesielski, author of the Analyst’s Accounting Observer, S&P 500 companies held $2.2 trillion in untaxed foreign earnings, or UFE, at the close of 2015,” adds Tully. “Add non-S&P 500 companies and 2016 profits, and today’s total is most likely closer to $2.6 trillion.” Tully writes that investing pros estimate that about 40% of the untaxed foreign profits – or roughly $1 trillion, will come back to the U.S. – and that companies would net at least $850 billion after they pay their modest tax bills on it. He points out that two stock sectors account for much of that money: technology and health care, chiefly pharmaceuticals. Moreover, neither industry is likely to use much of the money for research and development or new plants. “Instead, they will channel their windfalls toward goals that could be a boon for investors,” Tully adds, namely dividends and share buybacks. “For now there’s no guarantee that a repatriation bonus will help investors in the long run,” concludes Tully. “If the world’s Apples and Pfizers buy back shares at too high a price or overpay for acquisitions, their shareholders could suffer later. Still, in the short term, stocks will do a lot better if $1 trillion in foreign profits flows to U.S. shores.” It’s hard to argue with such a restrained assessment. While Fortune’s Tully focuses on stocks that can benefit from a Trump proposal, MarketWatch columnist Nigam Arora wonders whether the new president’s protectionist ideas could, if enacted, do damage to the overseas earnings of blue-chip companies. Trump has threatened countries like China and Mexico with tariffs, leading free-market advocates including Barron’s to openly worry about a potential trade war that could hurt U.S. exporters and lead to a global recession. Along those lines, Arora has tried to identified U.S. exporters that could be victims of retaliation by trade rivals. He is particularly concerned about U.S. chip makers because the Chinese and Americans compete head-on in this industry. No. 1 on Arora’s list is Nvidia NVDA 1.9334245326037391% NVIDIA Corp.

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is known for graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market as well as technology for self-driving cars and machine learning. “As protectionism heats up, Nvidia’s products could be dropped in favor of those of local companies, damaging earnings of this expensive stock,” he writes. In recent weeks, Nvidia’s stock has been under pressure in part because of concerns about a potential semiconductor trade war. Indeed as a piece on Seeking Alpha recently pointed out, “if a semiconductor trade war between the U.S. and China materializes, the onset of Nvidia’s retracement may be markedly sooner, and the low may be significantly lower. The prospect of a semiconductor trade war is not presently reflected in the stock’s price.” Email: editors@barrons.com Follow @johnkimelman Like Barron’s on Facebook Follow Barron’s on Twitter Email Print 0 Comments Order Reprints Facebook Share Twitter Google+ smaller Larger Latest in Read This, Spike That 1.

Anyone needing a reminder of that only had to see how quickly stocks moved once it was clear on election night that Donald Trump would be the next president. Stocks in sectors ranging from financial services to Big Pharma rose on the expectation that Trump, who favors a lower corporate tax and less industry regulation, will help usher policies favorable to corporate bottom lines. In the days and weeks that followed, financial writers had to play catch-up in writing about stocks and other investments that would be both helped and hurt by the GOP controlling both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Some of this catch-up journalism has its place. Still, it can’t be forgotten that stocks absorb all available information fairly quickly in hours, if not minutes. They certainly don’t wait around for writers on a daily, weekly or monthly deadline to weigh in. That fact hasn’t stopped Fortune veteran writer Shawn Tully from writing about the likely investment impact arising from GOP plans to create a tax break on the foreign profits of U.S. corporations that would repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars.

Tully attempts to quantify how much capital could potentially infuse the bottom lines of U.S. companies should President Trump and Congress agree to tax foreign profits at a low level – say 10%. The odds of such a tax holiday are quite high since both political parties favor it. “According to data assembled by Jack Ciesielski, author of the Analyst’s Accounting Observer, S&P 500 companies held $2.2 trillion in untaxed foreign earnings, or UFE, at the close of 2015,” adds Tully. “Add non-S&P 500 companies and 2016 profits, and today’s total is most likely closer to $2.6 trillion.” Tully writes that investing pros estimate that about 40% of the untaxed foreign profits – or roughly $1 trillion, will come back to the U.S. – and that companies would net at least $850 billion after they pay their modest tax bills on it. He points out that two stock sectors account for much of that money: technology and health care, chiefly pharmaceuticals. Moreover, neither industry is likely to use much of the money for research and development or new plants. “Instead, they will channel their windfalls toward goals that could be a boon for investors,” Tully adds, namely dividends and share buybacks. “For now there’s no guarantee that a repatriation bonus will help investors in the long run,” concludes Tully. “If the world’s Apples and Pfizers buy back shares at too high a price or overpay for acquisitions, their shareholders could suffer later. Still, in the short term, stocks will do a lot better if $1 trillion in foreign profits flows to U.S. shores.” It’s hard to argue with such a restrained assessment. While Fortune’s Tully focuses on stocks that can benefit from a Trump proposal, MarketWatch columnist Nigam Arora wonders whether the new president’s protectionist ideas could, if enacted, do damage to the overseas earnings of blue-chip companies. Trump has threatened countries like China and Mexico with tariffs, leading free-market advocates including Barron’s to openly worry about a potential trade war that could hurt U.S. exporters and lead to a global recession. Along those lines, Arora has tried to identified U.S. exporters that could be victims of retaliation by trade rivals. He is particularly concerned about U.S. chip makers because the Chinese and Americans compete head-on in this industry. No. 1 on Arora’s list is Nvidia NVDA 1.9334245326037391% NVIDIA Corp.

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is known for graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market as well as technology for self-driving cars and machine learning. “As protectionism heats up, Nvidia’s products could be dropped in favor of those of local companies, damaging earnings of this expensive stock,” he writes. In recent weeks, Nvidia’s stock has been under pressure in part because of concerns about a potential semiconductor trade war. Indeed as a piece on Seeking Alpha recently pointed out, “if a semiconductor trade war between the U.S. and China materializes, the onset of Nvidia’s retracement may be markedly sooner, and the low may be significantly lower. The prospect of a semiconductor trade war is not presently reflected in the stock’s price.” Email: editors@barrons.com Follow @johnkimelman Like Barron’s on Facebook Follow Barron’s on Twitter Email Print 0 Comments Order Reprints Facebook Share Twitter Google+ smaller Larger Latest in Read This, Spike That 1.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter . Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a "pipeline problem," meaning a shortage of women and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there's a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. "The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified," says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don't fit techie stereotypes aren't "Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough." Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. ___ THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress , Intel acknowledges there is "a great deal of work to be done." Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can't control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It's not enough to release diversity reports and say, "Oh, not a lot has changed, but it's the world, not us that's the problem," she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. ___ WHY IT MATTERS Diversity isn't just about fairness. It's about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products "will not appeal to a large population," says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: — Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface . One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other "expired," and the company said it won't put it back into circulation. — Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. — Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise "we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future." ___ INTO THE PIPELINE Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google's 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they're doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. ___ WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN'T FIT Silicon Valley startups like to talk about "culture fit" — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate's attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they "hire what they know," says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of "fit," although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like "competitive," ''dominant" and "leader," can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on "unconscious bias" to combat the problem. But they don't make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can't help wondering if they would be taken "more seriously" if they were whiter and male, Williams says. ___ MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a "wake-up call" for the company. "We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create," she says. "We firmly believe that good ideas don't come out of echo chambers." Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be "demoralizing" to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. "We want to solve this for the long haul," she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can't understand why diversifying the industry's workforce "seems to be such an intractable problem." "I wonder if it is coming up against...the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special," he says. "In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged." ___ Reach Barbara Ortutay on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BarbaraOrtutay .

Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don’t fit techie stereotypes aren’t “Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.” Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. ___ THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress , Intel acknowledges there is “a great deal of work to be done.” Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. In this Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2017, photo, Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of Tinsel, poses at the offices of Galvanize in San Francisco. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can’t control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It’s not enough to release diversity reports and say, “Oh, not a lot has changed, but it’s the world, not us that’s the problem,” she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. ___ WHY IT MATTERS Diversity isn’t just about fairness. It’s about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products “will not appeal to a large population,” says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified Black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: — Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface . One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other “expired,” and the company said it won’t put it back into circulation. — Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were Black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. — Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise “we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.”   In this Wednesday, Dec. 9, 2015, file photo, Jaysean Erby raises his hands as he solves a coding problem as Apple CEO Tim Cook watches from behind at an Apple Store, in New York, as Apple hosted Hour of Code events around the world as part of Computer Science Education Week. Despite loudly touted efforts, the tech industry is making very little progress in diversifying its workforce, especially in technical and leadership positions. Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity, from outreach at high schools and historically Black colleges to internship and mentoring programs to sponsorships for coding boot camps to bias training and support groups. So far, to little avail. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) INTO THE PIPELINE Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were Black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google’s 2015 hires were Black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were Black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they’re doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. ___ WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN’T FIT Silicon Valley startups like to talk about “culture fit” — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate’s attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are White and male, they “hire what they know,” says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of “fit,” although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like “competitive,” ”dominant” and “leader,” can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on “unconscious bias” to combat the problem. But they don’t make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can’t help wondering if they would be taken “more seriously” if they were whiter and male, Williams says. ___ MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a “wake-up call” for the company. “We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create,” she says. “We firmly believe that good ideas don’t come out of echo chambers.” Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be “demoralizing” to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. “We want to solve this for the long haul,” she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can’t understand why diversifying the industry’s workforce “seems to be such an intractable problem.” “I wonder if it is coming up against…the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special,” he says. “In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged.” ___ Reach Barbara Ortutay on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BarbaraOrtutay .

For a flagship motherboard, you expect it to have a wide range of support, which the Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium doesn’t disappoint.  Take a look at the storage options, three M.2, eight SATA 6Gb/s, and a single U.2 port; there are no SATA Express ports (which is good in my opinion).  You want lots of USB connections?  There are two internal USB 3.1 Gen 1 headers, and two USB 2.0 headers; on the back MSI provides four USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A, a Gen 2 Type-A, and Gen 2 Type-C.  Dedicated GPU support isn’t a slouch either, 2-Way SLI, and 4-Way CrossFire is supported.  To cool all of the equipment there are five fan headers, and a dedicated Liquid Cooling Pump header. One of the recent trends is to integrate RGB LED’s onto the motherboard, for those that don’t care for that MSI has kept that to a minimum with just a few RGB LED’s on the back of the motherboard, while the LED’s on the front of the motherboard are used for status indicators only.  Of course that doesn’t mean you can’t add RGB LED lighting, MSI has included one header to add RGB LED strips to the motherboard. MSI Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium Game Boost Knob One feature that separates the MSI Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium from all of the other Z270 motherboards is their Game Boost overclocking feature.  In the far lower corner, there is a large red button, that enables the instant overclocking feature of the motherboard.  In addition, there is a dial here that works as a hardware controller for the Game Boost function.  You have to enable the Hardware Control for Game Boost in the UEFI first, but then you can use the dial to overclock with the Game Boost profiles.  In addition, MSI has included their OC Dashboard, making it so you never have to enter the UEFI again to change the overclock. Let’s take a quick look at what MSI tells us about the Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium before looking at the retail packaging and accessories, then we’ll take a closer look at the flagship Z270 motherboard from MSI. Features and Specifications OC DASHBOARD: The ultimate overclocking tool to experience easier on-the-fly overclocking Mystic Light Sync: Synchronize other RGB solutions with your gaming rig and control all LEDs in one click Triple Turbo M.2, Steel Armor, M.2 Shield. Intel Optane Memory Ready, Turbo U.2, Lightning USB 3.1 Gen2 VR Ready & VR Boost: Ensures a clean and strong signal to a VR optimized USB port located on the back to reduce motion sickness caused by a bad signal.  VR Ready gets your system primed for VR use in just a single click.

Credit: Lenovo More like this Battle lines drawn as Chromebooks, Windows PCs renew rivalry at CES Lenovo tunes N23 Yoga Chromebook for Android apps ARM PCs with Windows 10 get a new start with the Snapdragon 835 chip Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana ARM tried to break into the PC market but had a disastrous outing starting with Linux-based smartbooks and then tablets with Windows RT. But ARM is launching a comeback in PCs, and the third time could be a charm. ARM chips could emerge as a threat to Intel's x86 as super thin laptops get smartphone-like usability with cellular connectivity and long battery life. The comeback for ARM is starting with Chromebooks, with more models hosting the chip architecture. Lenovo's new N23 Yoga Chromebook -- a 2-in-1 with an 11.6-screen -- has MediaTek's quad-core MT8173c chip, based on ARM. At CES, Samsung announced Chromebook Plus, which uses an ARM-based Exynos chip. Acer last year shipped the Chromebook R13 with the MediaTek MT8173c chip. The ARM-based Chromebooks have flexible designs and can be used as laptops or tablets. All Chromebooks due for release this year will be compatible with Android mobile apps in the Play Store. That's where ARM holds an advantage over x86 -- most Android apps are designed for ARM, which dominates in mobile devices. Most Android smartphones and tablets have ARM chips, so it's common sense to put them in Chromebooks, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Later this year, ARM will appear in Windows 10 laptops powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835. The laptops are being called "cellular PCs," which will include smartphone-like capabilities of cellular connectivity and long battery life. ARM has ruled the mobile market but has failed to make a dent in laptops and desktops, despite multiple attempts by PC makers to introduce products. The most notable failures are around the tablets with Microsoft's Windows RT OS, which found no adopters. But as more data moves into the cloud, the time is ripe for ARM to make a comeback to Windows PCs and Chromebooks, McGregor said. Application compatibility was a big reason Windows RT devices failed, McGregor said. At the time, ARM could not support most of the legacy Windows applications, but that won't be an issue anymore. The ARM-based Windows 10 PCs coming later this year will have an emulator to run legacy Windows apps. Any application that runs on x86 chips will also run on ARM chips, said Cisco Cheng, a Snapdragon evangelist at Qualcomm. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chip will also bring new features to laptops. The chip has a superfast cellular modem that can download data at speeds of up to 1Gbps (bits per second). It also has quick charging features, Bluetooth 5, and 4K graphics. Laptops will be thin and offer long battery life. But PC makers are cautious and don't want to commit to releasing an ARM-based Windows 10 PC quite yet. But PC makers are showing enthusiasm for the idea of superthin laptops with long battery life that can remain connected to mobile networks all day. Dell is waiting to test the hardware before committing to releasing an ARM-based Windows 10 laptop, said Raza Haider, vice president for commercial client products at Dell. But the idea of an ARM-based cellular PC is attractive, and Dell wants to offer all kinds of laptop options to its clients, Haider said. HP declined to comment on whether it wants to release an ARM-based Windows 10 PC. However, the company already offers the Elite X3, a Windows 10 Mobile smartphone with an ARM chip that can double as a PC in a pinch. That could open the door for an ARM-based Windows 10  laptop in the future. Lenovo declined to comment on its plans for an ARM-based Windows 10 PC. Lenovo has been shy about adopting ARM-based chips for its laptops and desktops, but the N23 Yoga is its first Chromebook with a non-x86 chip. Microsoft today is mostly reliant on x86 for the Windows OS, and is turning to ARM because it wants to compete in the mobile world, Jack Gold, principal analyst at J. Gold Associates, said in a research note. It's in Microsoft's best interests to make Windows 10 compatible with ARM, and cellular PCs may be just the way to break the long-standing Wintel alliance, Gold said. It will also give Microsoft more flexibility to deploy the Windows OS. For device makers, competition between ARM chips and x86 is a good scenario. It gives PC makers more choices to add to their product mix and gives them more leverage in negotiations with Intel. In the end, the adoption of ARM boils down to the price of laptops. Lenovo's N23 Yoga Chromebook is aggressively priced starting at $279, but the ARM-based Windows 10 cellular laptops may be much more expensive. The Snapdragon 835 is an expensive, top-line chip that will appear in smartphones priced above $500, and there's no way laptops including the chip will cost less than that, Gold said. Intel will still offer x86 PC chips for low-cost PCs and continue to dominate that market. Another threat for Intel is coming from AMD's Ryzen chips in the high-performance x86 PC market. The failure of Windows RT on ARM-based tablets is also fresh on the minds of PC makers. If PC makers find a considerable amount of application compatibility issues on ARM-based Windows 10 PCs, that could affect the adoption. Microsoft has demonstrated applications on ARM-based Windows PCs, but extensive independent tests haven't yet been conducted. ARM licenses chip designs but isn't aggressively chasing the PC market. It's the chip and device makers licensing ARM designs that want to put the chips in as many devices as possible. But the opportunity to strike a blow to x86 in Chromebooks and Windows PCs is real this time round, and PC makers will investigate it, McGregor said.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) NEW YORK (AP) — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. This March 23, 2010, file photo, shows the Google logo at the Google headquarters in Brussels. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were Black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter . Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. In this Friday, March 15, 2013, file photo, a Facebook employee walks past a sign at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.  \(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a “pipeline problem,” meaning a shortage of woman and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there’s a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. “The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified,” says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don’t fit techie stereotypes aren’t “Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.” Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. ___ THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress , Intel acknowledges there is “a great deal of work to be done.” Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. In this Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2017, photo, Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of Tinsel, poses at the offices of Galvanize in San Francisco. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can’t control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It’s not enough to release diversity reports and say, “Oh, not a lot has changed, but it’s the world, not us that’s the problem,” she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. ___ WHY IT MATTERS Diversity isn’t just about fairness. It’s about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products “will not appeal to a large population,” says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified Black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: — Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface . One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other “expired,” and the company said it won’t put it back into circulation. — Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were Black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. — Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise “we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.”   In this Wednesday, Dec. 9, 2015, file photo, Jaysean Erby raises his hands as he solves a coding problem as Apple CEO Tim Cook watches from behind at an Apple Store, in New York, as Apple hosted Hour of Code events around the world as part of Computer Science Education Week. Despite loudly touted efforts, the tech industry is making very little progress in diversifying its workforce, especially in technical and leadership positions. Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity, from outreach at high schools and historically Black colleges to internship and mentoring programs to sponsorships for coding boot camps to bias training and support groups. So far, to little avail. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) INTO THE PIPELINE Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were Black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google’s 2015 hires were Black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were Black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they’re doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. ___ WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN’T FIT Silicon Valley startups like to talk about “culture fit” — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate’s attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are White and male, they “hire what they know,” says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of “fit,” although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like “competitive,” ”dominant” and “leader,” can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on “unconscious bias” to combat the problem. But they don’t make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can’t help wondering if they would be taken “more seriously” if they were whiter and male, Williams says. ___ MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a “wake-up call” for the company. “We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create,” she says. “We firmly believe that good ideas don’t come out of echo chambers.” Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be “demoralizing” to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. “We want to solve this for the long haul,” she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can’t understand why diversifying the industry’s workforce “seems to be such an intractable problem.” “I wonder if it is coming up against…the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special,” he says. “In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged.” ___ Reach Barbara Ortutay on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BarbaraOrtutay .

Credit: Lenovo More like this ARM to battle Intel in Chromebooks and Windows 10 Acer's Chromebook 11 N7 is tough as nails, but runs on old tech Battle lines drawn as Chromebooks, Windows PCs renew rivalry at CES Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Some Chromebooks released this year will be able to run Android apps from the Google Play Store. Lenovo has tuned its new N23 Yoga Chromebook 2-in-1 to effectively run Android mobile apps. PC makers are taking a page from smartphones and tablets and adding touchscreens to Chromebooks. Many new models can be interchangeably used as laptops or tablets. More Chromebooks are also getting ARM processors -- which dominate in smartphones and tablets -- to effectively run Android apps. Most Chromebooks today have Intel x86 chips, which dominate in PCs, but Android apps best run on ARM processors. Lenovo, for the first time, is using an ARM chip in the N23 Yoga Chromebook 2-in-1, breaking its long-time reliance on x86 chips. The device has an 11.6-inch touchscreen, and it can be used as a tablet or laptop thanks to a hybrid design. The N23 Yoga is "optimized to run the Google Play Store apps," Lenovo said in a blog entry. The device will start shipping in April, with the price starting at US$279. It will first ship in the U.S. and then worldwide. In addition to Lenovo, Samsung and Acer have also plugged ARM chips into 2-in-1 Chromebooks designed to support Android apps. Samsung at CES announced new Chromebook Plus, which uses an ARM-based homegrown six-core Exynos chip, and Acer last year announced its Chromebook R13, which uses another ARM chip, the MediaTek's MT8173c chip. Chromebooks can deliver a better mobile experience with Android application compatibility, so using ARM processors makes sense, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Chromebooks with Intel chips will be able to run Android apps, but they come from a PC background. ARM chips have a mobile heritage, and that is why Lenovo may have put the MediaTek chip in the N23 Yoga, McGregor said. The N23 Yoga has serious horsepower with the MediaTek chip, which is based on ARM's latest Cortex-A72 core. The MT8173c chip was originally designed for smartphones and tablets, and it has an integrated PowerVR graphics core, which can handle 3D gaming and high-definition video. The device offers 10 hours of battery life, weighs 1.35 kilograms and has up to 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The screen displays images at a 1366 x 768-pixel resolution. It also has HDMI, USB Type-C, and USB 3.0 ports. But Lenovo hasn't entirely ignored Intel. It separately announced an N23 Chromebook with Intel's "next-generation" Celeron chip, which may be the processor code-named Apollo Lake. It's a standard laptop with an 11.6-inch 720p screen. It also has two USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI port, and a 2-in-1 card reader. It will be available next month starting at $199. The PC maker also announced the rugged ThinkPad Chromebook 11e family of rugged laptops with Intel's latest quad-core Celeron chip. The Chromebook Yoga 11e has a 2-in-1 hybrid design, while the ThinkPad Chromebook 11e has a standard laptop design. The devices have up to 32GB of storage and up to 8GB of RAM. The devices have USB-C ports, one USB 3.0 slot, and offer 10 hours of battery life. The ThinkPad 11e Chromebook will start at $369, while the ThinkPad 11e Yoga Chromebook will start at $449, and both will ship in May.

Add A Comment One day after The Khronos Group revealed Vulkan 1.0.39 with various new extensions, the Intel "ANV" Vulkan driver within mainline Mesa adds support for VK_KHR_maintenance1. The VK_KHR_maintenance1 extension marks the presence of "maintenance" changes that didn't make it for the original Vulkan 1.0 specific. VK_KHR_maintenance1 refines various features like allowing 2D and 2D array image views to be created from 3D images, let drivers to do transfers/clears of image formats they don't otherwise support, a new command to release any unused command pool memory back to the system, and other minor features. NVIDIA already issued a new Vulkan 1.0.39 Linux beta driver and now Intel's Mesa Vulkan driver is the second Linux driver option beginning to land support for the new extensions. Right now in Git there's just the necessary changes for VK_KHR_maintenance1 extension but hopefully it won't be much longer before seeing the few other extensions supported by ANV as well as RADV. The changes for supporting VK_KHR_maintenance1 just ended up being about two dozen lines of code changes leading to it being flipped on for Mesa 17.1.

ASUS PRIME Z270-P Kabylake Motherboard Works Fine On Linux Written by Michael Larabel in Motherboards on 24 January 2017. Page 1 of 2. 9 Comments For those looking to purchase a newer Intel Z270 motherboard for use with the new Kabylake processors, the ASUS PRIME Z270-P is what I've been using the past two weeks for my initial Kabylake benchmarking. So far it's been working out great and haven't run into any issues. The ASUS PRIME Z270-P is a modestly-priced Z270 motherboard at around $130 USD, it's not on the cheap end but also not close to being one of the more expensive Z270 series boards. The PRIME Z270-P I picked up for its combination of price and features, including dual M.2 slots, plenty of USB 3.0 connectivity, ready for Intel's forthcoming Optane Memory, and all of the other essentials for being a solid Kabylake motherboard.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... NEW YORK — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter . Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Advertisement Continue reading Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a “pipeline problem,” meaning a shortage of women and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there’s a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. “The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified,” says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don’t fit techie stereotypes aren’t “Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.” Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. ___ THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress , Intel acknowledges there is “a great deal of work to be done.” Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Advertisement Continue reading Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can’t control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It’s not enough to release diversity reports and say, “Oh, not a lot has changed, but it’s the world, not us that’s the problem,” she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. ___ WHY IT MATTERS Diversity isn’t just about fairness. It’s about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products “will not appeal to a large population,” says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: Advertisement Continue reading — Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface . One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other “expired,” and the company said it won’t put it back into circulation. — Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. — Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise “we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.” ___ INTO THE PIPELINE Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google’s 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they’re doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. Advertisement Continue reading The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. ___ WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN’T FIT Silicon Valley startups like to talk about “culture fit” — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate’s attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they “hire what they know,” says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of “fit,” although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like “competitive,” “dominant” and “leader,” can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on “unconscious bias” to combat the problem. But they don’t make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can’t help wondering if they would be taken “more seriously” if they were whiter and male, Williams says. Advertisement Continue reading ___ MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a “wake-up call” for the company. “We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create,” she says. “We firmly believe that good ideas don’t come out of echo chambers.” Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be “demoralizing” to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. “We want to solve this for the long haul,” she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can’t understand why diversifying the industry’s workforce “seems to be such an intractable problem.” “I wonder if it is coming up against…the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special,” he says. “In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged.” ___ Reach Barbara Ortutay on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BarbaraOrtutay .

[op-ed] Published by Sia, in Internet — January 24, 2017January 24, 2017 Last year was not really kind to many working in the tech industry. Behind the launches of new products and services, many tech companies were busy with layoffs, downsizing and restructuring exercises, indicating that the tech scene’s boom period may have finally come to an end. How It All Started – 40 Classic Photos of Tech Companies You’ve Got To See How It All Started – 40 Classic Photos of Tech Companies You’ve Got To See Many of the giants that dictate the way tech-at-large rolls today had modest starts during their early days.…Read more Small startups are not the only ones affected by layoffs, some of the companies that were forced to downsize include titans in the tech industry. Intel One of the biggest layoffs that happened during the year comes from Intel. During April 2016, Intel announced its intentions to layoff up to 12,000 employees, by the second quarter of 2017, which is roughly 11% of the company’s total workforce. This huge layoff is attributed mainly to the continued decline in PC sales for the second year in a row. On top of that, there are rumors that Intel will also be cutting out its wearables division as said division did not do to well on its launch. Alphabet Just in case you think that Intel is a unique case, Google’s parent company Alphabet has also been busy conducting layoffs, particularly with the Google Fiber division. According to reports, Alphabet is looking to layoff 9% of Google Fibre’s staff, which translates to roughly 100 employees from the division. Besides Google Fibre, Alphabet has also decided to sell off its robotics division Boston Dynamics as the company pulls out of the robotics industry. Microsoft Microsoft isn’t immune to the layoff bug either, as the company’s failure in the smartphone market has led to the company laying off around 4,700 of its employees from its Microsoft Mobile division. Cisco Things aren’t any better on the enterprise side either as Cisco can attest to it. In an attempt to transition from its networking hardware roots to a software-driven business, the company announced in August 2016 that it will be laying off around 5,500 employees, which is 7% of its workforce. IBM IBM isn’t doing any better either as the company could potentially layoff up to 14,000 people thanks to falling profits as the company continues to struggle with the rise of cloud computing. These are just some of the bigger companies that conducted layoffs throughout 2016. Suffice to say that smaller companies were hit with their own layoffs as well. In some cases, some companies were bought by others as their financials weren’t exactly positive (eg: Pebble). Is the layoff trend expected to continue into 2017? Analysts like Trip Chowdhry from Global Equities Research seems to believe so. According to Chowdhry, 2017 is expected to get worse as he predicts that the tech bubble will burst this year, and it may happen as early as March. Should that tech bubble bursts, the impact will affect everyone working in the industry, ranging from established multinational corporations to plucky startups. Tech bubbles aren’t the only thing that may affect the industry as a whole as 2017 will also see Donald Trump become the President of the United States of America. On top of that, the United Kingdom may also decide to invoke Article 50 to begin its exit from the European Union. In short, 2017 is going to be a really bumpy year for the tech industry as a whole.

March 2017 now looks most likely, although Tim Cook has been dropping some worrying hints... We round up all the rumours of a new Mac Pro for 2017: the new Mac Pro's release date, price, tech specs, design changes and new features by Karen Haslam | 24 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Launch date Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Tech specs Buying guide for current Mac Pro models When will Apple release a new Mac Pro for 2017? And what tech specs, new features and design changes should we expect when Apple updates the Mac Pro line for 2017? Is there any chance Apple will discontinue the Mac Pro instead of updating it? We've had a long wait for the new Mac Pro. The current Mac Pro model was announced at WWDC in June 2013 and, for a top-of-the range system, the Mac Pro is looking pretty long in the tooth. But when will Apple announce a new Mac Pro? And what hardware improvements, design changes, tech specs and new features will we see in the new Mac Pro for 2017? There's some good news for expectant Mac Pro fans: code in Mac OS X El Capitan hints that a new Mac Pro (one with 10 USB 3 ports) could arrive soon. But nothing is certain at this point, and some pundits believe the Mac Pro should simply be discontinued. Some Apple appreciators are even working on concept images and videos of what an updated Mac Pro could look like. A concept video by a French designer sees the Mac Pro take the route of looking like an iMac while borrowing a lot of ideas from the Microsoft Surface Studio. Take a look for yourself here. Whatever the future holds for the Mac Pro, in this article we will be looking at all the rumours surrounding the next update of the Mac Pro line: the new Mac Pro's UK release date and pricing, its expected design, and the new features and specs we hope to see in the next version of the Mac Pro. For more discussion of upcoming Apple launches, take a look at our New iMac rumours and our big roundup of Apple predictions for 2017. And if you're considering buying one of the current Mac Pro models, read Where to buy Mac Pro in the UK and our Mac buying guide. See also: New MacBook Pro rumours | New MacBook Air rumours | New MacBook rumours | New iMac rumours | New Mac mini rumours New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Launch date We expect the new Mac Pro to be launched in March 2017. The present Mac Pro was unveiled at WWDC 2013, and it's been more than three years since it went on sale. It's about time, then, for an update to the Mac Pro for 2017. Of course, Apple hasn't announced an official launch date for the next generation of Mac Pro systems - the company is known for its code of silence when it comes to upcoming product launches. We had entertained hopes of a Mac Pro update at Apple's 27 October press event, but no such luck. In the event Apple unveiled a new MacBook Pro instead: a rather lovely new laptop with a customisable touch bar above the keyboard. (You can read more about that device here - New MacBook Pro 2016 review - and here: New MacBook Pro on Apple Store.) Despite the lack of news about the new Mac Pro in October, we remain optimistic that Apple will refresh the line in the near future. A few months back a source at one of Apple's partner companies confidently told us to expect this by the end of November, which was evidently wishful thinking; but it seems likely that March 2017 will see the Mac Pro updated alongside other Apple products. (However, we suspect the update will only involve spec/component bumps rather than a full-blown redesign of the Mac Pro.) Read more: iPhone 7 release date | iPhone 7 Plus release date New iMac 2017 release date: Apple CEO hints at future of the iMac In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop - the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important. What about the Mac Pro? A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell. If so, this would signify the end of the Mac Pro line, a line that was once the pride of Apple, but has now been neglected for three years.  New Mac Pro 2017 release date: El Capitan code hint Code discovered in Mac OS X El Capitan offers a hint that a new Mac Pro may be on its way soon. There's a reference to a new Mac that's codenamed "AAPLJ95,1" within El Capitan, according to Pike's Universum. The current Mac Pro is similarly codenamed AAPLJ90,1 so it's plausible that the code refers to a new version of the professional-level workstation. Another clue that this is the Mac Pro: the code hints that there are 10 USB 3.0 ports on the new machine, and only the Mac Pro has anywhere near that many ports. (Currently there are 4 USB ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports on the Mac Pro, while the iMacs have 4 USB and 2 Thunderbolt.) We think adopting Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro may make more sense as it brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at 40Gbps for the best of both worlds. More on that below. It's been well over a year since El Capitan was launched, and many Apple fans have now moved on to macOS Sierra. We'll update this if any smoking guns are discovered in the Sierra code. New Mac Pro 2017 release date: Delays in 2013/2014 When Apple launches the new Mac Pro there may well be delays in availability, as there were in 2013-2014. Apple first unveiled the Intel Xeon (Ivy Bridge-E) Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, but the unit didn't actually start shipping until December that year. In fact, for most shoppers the supply of Mac Pro was so constrained that they didn't receive their new Mac until 2014 - in some cases not until February, or March, or in a few cases April. Having previewed the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, the company promised availability before the end of 2013, but it wasn't until 19 December that the Mac Pro became available. Then, following the launch, stocks were so limited that only a lucky few, US-based, customers were able to purchase the new professional Mac workstation before the end of 2013. Customers in the UK who ordered their new Mac on 19 December 2014 found that they would have to wait until January 2015 for the new Mac Pro. Some lucky UK customers finally received their Mac Pro around 12 January. This was almost a year after the old version of the Mac Pro was banned in Europe because it didn't comply with EU safety laws. One reason for the delays back in 2013 was thought to be the fact that Apple was building the new-look Mac Pro in the US: Apple had a new design which was being produced at an entirely new factory in the States, so the delays were understandable, although maybe not excusable. New Mac Pro 2017 release date: New delays We had hoped to hear new developments about a new Mac Pro, so we're growing impatient and are hoping for an update soon. Could updates to the current model face the same issues that slowed the production lines back in 2013? We think probably not. If you check Apple's website, you'll see that the wait for the current Mac Pro has come down to 24 hours (although if you want a build-to-order version the wait will be about 5-7 business days). The fact that Apple is no longer struggling to meet demand would suggest that when it launches the next Mac Pro there will not be the significant delays in getting units out to customers that there were at the end of 2013. Instead, the reason for the long wait for an update to the Mac Pro could be simple lack of interest in this workstation-style Mac. Apple may be focusing attention on other projects such as the Retina iMac, which was updated in October 2015. It's possible that Apple doesn't intend to update the Mac Pro at all. The company has launched several other new Macs since the launch of the Mac Pro, including impressively powerful iMacs that can sometimes perform better than the current entry-level Mac Pro can. Video editor Max Yuryev tested Final Cut and Premiere Pro rendering on both the 5K Retina iMac and 6 Core Mac Pro and found that the iMac performed better in some cases, although did suffer from heating issues that the Mac Pro avoids thanks to its design. Yet we don't think Apple is trying to phase out the Mac Pro in favour of a more powerful iMac line-up. It's more likely that it's just spending a long time getting the new Mac Pro right before it launches, after the issues it experiences with the previous launch. There is still a market for the more powerful Mac Pro, we think. But not everyone agrees with us, as we'll see in the next section. New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Maybe the Mac Pro will never be updated. MacObserver argues that the current Mac Pro is a failure, and compares it to the ill-fated Cube, which was available for less than a year in 2000/2001. (We look at more interesting failures and controversies in our roundup of the worst Apple products.) It's possible, indeed, that Apple will update its iMac line to the point where it satisfies the needs of pro users, rendering the actual Pro line irrelevant. As a thought experiment, TechRadar has imagined the specs of an 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling.  Many professional Mac users are still using old Mac Pros from pre-2012 mainly because they are easily upgradable, with options for larger-capacity drives (2TB, 4TB or even more). You can even get a 12-core 3.46GHz processor in the older model that could give the newer, 2.7GHz 12-core processor in the 2013 Mac Pro a run for its money. As for video card options, the old Mac Pro has many more. Those who did upgrade to the 'new' trashcan-like Mac Pro are also finding that the need for multiple expansion cards and external drives are cluttering up their desks, where previously these extras could be neatly concealed inside the Mac Pro chassis. For all Apple's claims about it being a powerful machine, it appears that the Mac Pro is just not considered a professional workstation by the intended market - which does raise uncomfortable questions about its future as a product line. But with its status as Apple's flagship Mac, and the hoopla surrounding its reinvention in 2013, the US assembly plants and so on, we'd be surprised if Apple threw in the towel just yet. New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Tech specs Currently, there are two standard Mac Pro models available along with various build-to-order options: Quad-Core and Dual GPU: 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each; and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. 6-Core and Dual GPU: 3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 16GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each; 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. It seems likely that Apple will update the Mac Pro with the next-generation Intel Xeon E5 processor described above, we may also see more RAM in the entry-level version, now that the 15-inch MacBook Pro range ship with 16GB as standard. We'll go into more detail below. New Mac Pro specs: Ports The current Mac Pro sports six Thunderbolt 2 ports, which means this Mac can be connected to up to three 4K displays. There's also 4 USB 3 ports; Dual Gigabit Ethernet; and an HDMI 1.4 UltraHD, as well as a combined optical digital audio output/analog line out mini-jack; headphone mini-jack with headset support; HDMI port supports multi-channel audio output and a built-in speaker. Code in the El Capitan beta actually suggests that the next generation Mac Pro will offer 10 USB 3.0 ports. Currently there are 4 USB 3 ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports on the Mac Pro. We think that it would make more sense if Apple adopts Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro - this standard of Thunderbolt supports USB Type-C and offers 40Gbps transfer speeds, so Mac Pro users would get the best of both worlds. Thunderbolt 3 offers double the speed of USB 3.1, which is only 10Gbps.   Another thing Apple could add is a Lightning port as seen on the iPhone. Yes really. There are rumours that the lightning port will be used on Macs for plugging in headphones which could allow for high-res audio. However, many traditional Mac Pro users are still calling out for PCI slots, which would allow users to add faster SSDs and better video cards. Some even ask for internal drive bays, with Mac Observer noting that a 3.5in hard drive bay would allow for archival space to be added. New Mac Pro specs: Current processor The 2013 Mac Pro features Intel's Xeon E5 V2 processors (code-named Romley) offering up to 12 cores (as a build-to-order option). Back in September 2014 new Xeon E5 V3 chips (code-named Grantley) started shipping - bringing the Haswell architecture to pro workstations. At the time we thought the processor would soon make their way to the Mac Pro, but no upgrade emerged. Those Intel Xeon E5 V3 chips were being used in Dell's new Xeon Precision Tower (5810, 7810 and 7910) - find out more on Dell's website. These Dell workstations use the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor series featuring either 14 or 18 cores per processor. The processors in the current Mac Pros are configurable up to 3.5GHz for a six-core option, 3.0GHz for an 8-core option, and 2.7GHz for a 12-core option. We may see a slight boost in these numbers, but we could equally see the same clock speeds, with the processors themselves being faster. It is possible that the new Mac Pro will, like the Dell above, offer an option of 14 or 18 cores. New Mac Pro specs: New Xeon E3-1205 v6 or Xeon E3-1585 v5 processor It is likely that we see brand new Xeon processors in the Mac Pro. It's expected that we see a late Skylake (Xeon E3-1585 v5) or the new Kaby Lake ( Xeon E3-1205 v6) processors included. The Intel Skylake processor features a base clock of 3.5GHz, four cores and eight threads - it has 8MB of cache and features the Iris Pro Graphics P580 - a powerful in-built GPU that will help low-profile renders. However, with Kaby Lake already being shipped to OEMs and manufacturers, we are more likely to see these new processors shipped with the new Mac Pro. The rumoured Xeon E3-1205 v6 is a base model - featuring 3GHz of processing power - we expect more powerful and optimised CPUs to be included within the Mac Pro. Read next: i5 or i7? What is turbo boost? Here's how to choose the best processor for your Mac New Mac Pro specs: Graphics The 2013 Mac Pro features dual workstation-class GPUs. The Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the Quad-Core version, and Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the 6-Core model. There’s also a build-to-order option of the Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each (an extra £540).  AMD showcased new its new FirePro W-series at Siggraph in August 2014. The FirePro W7100, W5100 may find their way into the new Mac Pro. Alternatively there are significantly faster graphics based on AMD's Fury platform that may be destined for the new Mac Pro. Update (08/03/2016): After a thread on the Apple Support Communities website amassed a huge response when complaining about faulty graphics cards in the Late 2013 Mac Pro, Apple admitted that a number of Mac Pro's have faulty cards and that affected customers could have the issue fixed free of charge. To be legible for a free repair, you must have encountered "distorted video, no video, system instability, freezing, restarts, shutdowns" or system startup failure.  It's not all Mac Pro's though, only those manufactured between February 8 and April 11 2015, and the issue can be fixed by taking your damaged Mac Pro to an Apple Store. Interestingly, MacRumours notes that the issues are known to exist with the AMD FirePro D500 and D700 GPUs, with the AMD FirePro D300 being completely unaffected. Will these issues force Apple into choosing another graphic card manufacturer for the next Mac Pro? While there are no rumours online that suggest so, we think a change could be on the cards for the Mac Pro GPU.

We'd like to see more storage as standard on the Mac Pro, as the target audience tend to be working with very large files. An option for 2TB flash storage would be nice. New Mac Pro specs: RAM The new Xeon E5 V3 Grantley chips are said to have DDR4 memory controllers, so you can expect even faster memory in this year's new Mac Pro. The current models offer 12GB RAM in the Quad-Core model, and 16GB in the 6-Code model as standard. You can add 32GB RAM at point of purchase for £360, or a massive 64GB RAM for £1,080. As we mention above, the 15-inch MacBook Pro now comes with 16GB RAM as standard, so we would hope that the updated entry-level Mac Pro would match that. 64GB RAM might sound like a lot to you, but some of these Dell workstations can accommodate up to 1TB of DDR4 RAM. We hope that the next generation of Mac Pros will be configurable to more than 64GB (four slots of 16GB). New Mac Pro specs: Internal design Here's one last titbit that may offer clues about the Mac Pro of the future. Apple has been granted a patent for the Mac Pro, specifically for the structure and organisation of internal components and external interfaces for a compact computing system, according to a report on Patently Apple.

The most obvious place to buy a Mac Pro is from the Apple Store. Other than directly from Apple, you can buy the Mac Pro from Apple Premium Resellers such as Stormfront, Square Group, Solutions Inc, iStore, Western Computer, MR Systems, KRCS, HardSoft, and PC World. You can find an Apple Premium Reseller near you by searching on Apple's site. UK pricing for the Mac Pro Currently the Mac Pro starts at £2,999 in the UK for a quad-core 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor with 10 MB L3 cache and Turbo Boost up to 3.9 GHz, 12GB RAM, Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB of VRAM and 256GB of flash storage.  There is also a 6-core model with 3.5GHz Xeon E5, 16GB RAM, two AMD FirePro D500 cards with 3GB of VRAM, and 256GB flash storage for £3,899. We expect that prices won't change significantly when Apple updates the range, although we could see a drop in the old model and a rise in the base 2017 model - as we've seen through other Apple products. See: Apple price increases UK. Current pricing for Mac Pro build-to-order options  The build-to-order options will push the price higher. The following specifications are available for the 2013 Mac Pro: Build-to-order options on the 3.7GHz Quad-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.5GHz 6-core option (add £450), 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,800), or 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £3,150); 16GB (add £90), 32GB (add £450) or 64GB (add £1,170) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D500 (add £360), or or dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £900); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540) Build-to-order options on the 3.5GHz 6-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,350), 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £2,700); 32GB (add £360) or 64GB (£add £1,080) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £540); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540).

Here's what you need to know about Kaby Lake release date, features, plus specs, models and prices, including the new Pentium chips which now have Hyper-threading. Kaby Lake is 'optimised' Skylake with a few new features By Jim Martin | 24 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Back at Computex 2016, Intel confirmed in its keynote that the 7th generation Core processors will launch later in the year. While that was true for laptops, enthusiasts have been kept waiting for the desktop chips. But Intel has now revealed more details on the desktop Kaby Lake release date and specs, including the new sub-£100 Pentium chips which, for the first time, get Hyper-threading. Intel Kaby Lake 7th gen Core processor release date The new Kaby Lake desktop processors are on sale now from Overclockers UK, Scan and other retailers. Rumour has it, via Benchlife, that Intel will launch Kaby Lake X (and Skylake X) chips in August at Gamescom 2017. There will reportedly be 10-, 8 -, 6- and 4 core models. Kaby Lake X will supposedly be the quad-core chip and will have a TDP of 112W and all chips will be marketed as the Core i7-7000 series processors. Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake specs and prices Here are the main specs of the new desktop Core i7 chips. Just three have been announced so far. They are all quad-core with Hyper-Threading. Model Core i7-7700K Core i7-7700 Core i7-7700T Price £339 £309 £309 TDP 91W 65W 35W Cores/Threads 4/8 4/8 4/8 Base Frequency 4.2GHz 3.6GHz 2.9GHz Boost Frequency 4.5GHz 4.2GHz 3.8GHz Unlocked Yes No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 8MB 8MB 8MB   Intel Core i5 Kaby Lake specs and prices Four seventh-gen Core i5 models have been announced (see table below), plus a further three chips with a ‘T’ suffix which denotes they use less power – they all have a 35W TDP. As the table shows, they’re all quad-core parts, but with no Hyper-Threading. Model Core i5-7600K Core i5-7600 Core i5-7500 Core i5-7400 Price £239 £219 £199 £189 TDP 91W 65W 65W 65W Cores/Threads 4/4 4/4 4/4 4/4 Base Frequency 3.8GHz 3.5GHz 3.4GHz 3.0GHz Boost Frequency 4.2GHz 4.1GHz 3.8GHz 3.5GHz Unlocked Yes No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 6MB 6MB 6MB 6MB These are the 35W 'T' models: Model Core i5-7600T Core i5-7500T Core i5-7400T Price £219 £199 £179 TDP 35W 35W 35W Cores/Threads 4/4 4/4 4/4 Base Frequency 2.8GHz 2.7GHz 2.4GHz Boost Frequency 3.7GHz 3.3GHz 3.0GHz Unlocked No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 6MB 6MB 6MB Intel Core i3 Kaby Lake specs and prices As with the Core i5 models, the Core i3 is also available as a ‘T’ model which has a 35W TDP. The Core i3 chips have no boost capability, so rely on high base frequency. They’re dual-core chips with Hyper-Threading. Note that the flagship model is unlocked, so Intel is catering to enthusiasts who want to overclock a more affordable chip. Unlike the Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition processor from 2014, the i3-7350K supports Hyper-Threading. Model Core i3-7350K Core i3-7320 Core i3-7300 Core i3-7100 Price £185 £159 £149 £119 TDP 60W 51W 51W 51W Cores/Threads 2/4 2/4 2/4 2/4 Base Frequency 4.2GHz 4.1GHz 4.0GHz 3.9GHz Boost Frequency N/A N/A N/A N/A Unlocked Yes No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 4MB 4MB 4MB 3MB Overall, there is a similar lineup of Kaby Lake processors to Skylake, so you’ll have a choice of an entry-level Core i3, right up to a 10-core Extreme Edition Core i7 (this hasn't launched yet). Prices are unlikely to vary much from the Skylake range, so there will be something to suit every budget. There are of course be laptop and mobile versions of the Kaby Lake desktop chips for everything from ultraportables to all-in-one PCs.   Intel Kaby Lake Pentium specs There are three new Pentium models, each also available in a low-power 'T' model. They support the new Kaby Lake features such as Intel Optane, 4K video and have DDR4 memory controllers. The big news is that they're the first Pentiums to get Hyper-threading, so while they're not true quad-core parts, they do get the performance advantage of being able to process four threads. Model Pentium G4620 Pentium G4600 Pentium G4560 Price £94.99 £83.99 £64.99 TDP 51W 51W 54W Cores/Threads 2/4 2/4 2/4 Base Frequency 3.7GHz 3.6GHz 3.5GHz Boost Frequency N/A N/A N/A Unlocked No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 610 Cache 3MB 3MB 3MB What is Kaby Lake? The 7th-gen Core processors are based on the same 14nm process as Skylake and its predecessor, Broadwell. Intel won’t make the move down to 10nm until the 8th-gen Cannonlake CPUs which are due to launch later in 2017. The original plan was to switch to 10nm back in 2015 but, because of manufacturing problems, it’s sticking with 14nm for Kaby Lake. This disrupts Intel’s Tick-Tock roadmap, since Kaby Lake should be a Tick – a new manufacturing process – but will instead be an ‘optimised’ version of Skylake (which is already an improved version of Broadwell). And that’s now Intel’s plan for the future: no more Tick-Tock, it’s now Process-Architecture-Optimisation. So when we finally get ‘Canonlake’, there will be two more generations based on the 10mm manufacturing process before a move to an even smaller one. Intel Kaby Lake 7th gen Core processor features Optane Memory So what’s new? Well, there’s the obvious performance improvement, but the new 200-series chipset supports Intel’s new Optane memory. This isn’t to be confused with Optane SSDs – it’s a brand new memory module which is designed to make a PC with a traditional mechanical hard drive feel more like one equipped with an SSD. Few details are yet known about Optane Memory, other than it uses 3D Crosspoint memory. Intel hasn’t yet said anything about capacities or prices. It has confirmed that Optane Memory modules won’t work in older Z170 boards, or with Skylake chips, though. These should be available to buy within the next six months. Better overclocking Kaby Lake chips have a 300MHz base frequency boost over the equivalent Skylake chips, but are also better for overclocking. For example, they will automatically adjust voltage to make a given base clock more stable. The second improvement is better control over Turbo Boost. When the chip has to process an AVX instruction it will downclock, then return to a higher clock for normal instructions. With faster clock speeds than Skylake at a given TDP, Kaby Lake is already around 25 percent quicker, but it remains to be see just how fast they will go. Early benchmarks show they are no faster than Skylake (when compared at the same clock speeds). The performance boost comes from using higher clock speeds than the equivalent Skylake chips. If you already have a PC with a 6th-gen Skylake chip, you won't see any better performance simply by upgrading to the equivalent Kaby Lake chip. But if you're still on a third, fourth or fifth-gen Core processor, it could well be a good time to upgrade. Better graphics Certain new U-series processors (which will appear in 2-in-1 laptop/tablet devices) have Iris Plus Graphics 640 GPUs integrated. Intel says this GPU is 65 percent faster than the equivalent Intel HD graphics system. It’s 40 percent faster for quick sync video, and is also capable of 4K video playback. Backwards compatible with 100-series chipsets Desktop Kaby Lake chips are compatible with the existing 100-series chipsets, so it’ll be an easy upgrade from Skylake, assuming manufacturers provide BIOS updates for the new chips. However, you will miss out on Optane Memory support (which we’re assured won’t be added to any 100-series boards) and possibly certain overclocking features.

Here are six of the most exciting hybrids expected this year. Sarah K. White (CIO (US)) 24 January, 2017 21:00 - - - - print email Comments One trend at CES 2017 came in the form of 2-in-1 devices. These hybrid tablet-notebooks were everywhere -- Dell alone announced three hybrid devices, and companies like HP, Toshiba and ASUS also unveiled new tablet hardware. Hybrids offer the flexibility of a tablet, with the functionality and performance of a notebook. After an initial lukewarm reception, they're finally taking off. These six devices unveiled at CES 2017 will lead the pack in the continuing shift to hybrid devices for both consumers and the enterprise. Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Dell The Dell XPS 13 wowed consumers and business users alike with its barely there bezel. And this year, the company unveiled a convertible version of the 13-inch notebook. The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 features the same thin bezel of its predecessor, and boasts a resolution of 3200 x 1800 pixels. According to Dell, the battery life on the new XPS 13 clocks in at 15 hours and the display fits into the same real-estate as a typical 11.6-inch display with a bezel. It's not a detachable hybrid, instead the display can rotate 360 degrees to lie flat against the back of the keyboard -- similar to the Lenovo Yoga series or HP Spectre x360. What's impressive about this device is the fact that the thin bezel makes this one of the smallest 13-inch hybrid devices on the market; it's just shy of one-inch thick and weighs 2.7 pounds. All configurations include 7th generation Intel Core processors -- the entry level model includes an Intel Core i5 processor, 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD for $999. At its highest configuration, the device includes an i7 Intel Core processor, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,400. [ Related story: 10 most popular hybrid tablet stories of 2016 ] Dell's Latitude 5285 Dell Dell brought some heat to the 2-in-1 market with its XPS 13 convertible, but the Dell Latitude 5285 is a clear hit at Microsoft's Surface Pro 4. The 12.3-inch tablet features the familiar kick-stand design of the Surface Pro, as well as a soft, detachable keyboard cover with trackpad and a proprietary stylus. It not only matches the Surface Pro on a design-level, it also closely matches in available configurations. Just like the Surface, you can get the Latitude 5285 with up to 1TB storage, 16GB of RAM and the latest 7th generation Intel Core processors. To be fair, the Surface Pro 4 currently only offers the last generation of Intel processors, but if the Surface Pro 5 rumors hold any weight, that might not be true for long. The device features unique options like a high-capacity battery with "ExpressCharge," which lets you charge the device as quickly and efficiently as possible. With keyboard, the device weighs 2.7 pounds -- which is the same as the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 device -- but without keyboard, it weighs just 2 pounds. Pricing for the Dell Latitude 5285 will start at $900, and the device is slated to start shipping on February 7. Dell 2-in-1 Latitude 7285 Dell Dell is clearly invested in the future of hybrids for both consumers and businesses -- and where the Latitude 5285 resembled the Surface Pro, the Latitude 7285 is more like the Microsoft Surface Book. Instead of soft, magnetic keyboard, the tablet-display docks into a solid keyboard base, offering a more traditional notebook experience. However, the Latitude 7285 brings some unique features to the table that the Surface Book doesn't -- one in particular is wireless charging. The device can be configured with an optional keyboard base that has Airfuel Alliance certified wireless charging technology built in. When paired with the compatible wireless charging pad -- you can say goodbye to unsightly cables. The Latitude 7285 also features the latest Kaby Lake processor chips from Intel and a display with up to 3k resolution. Dell also announced that there will be a number of different keyboard options, but no word yet on what they will include -- pricing isn't available yet, but Dell expects to ship the device by May or June. [ Related story: Comparing 7 top enterprise tablets ] ASUS Transformer 3 Pro ASUS The ASUS Transformer 3 Pro runs Windows 10 and features a design that is a dead-ringer for the Surface Pro 4 -- right down to the kickstand, 12.6-inch tablet display and soft keyboard cover. The device also looks enterprise-ready with a full size USB 3.0 port, an HDMI port, a USB-C port and the ASUS Pen. Asus did not skimp on performance either, the device features a 7th generation Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. The 3k tablet display offers a resolution of 2880 x 1920, and the Thunderbolt port supports 4k external displays. The Transformer 3 Pro also ships with the keyboard dock included -- unlike the Surface Pro 4 -- and the 512GB model is currently priced at $1,499. Where ASUS really one-ups Microsoft with the compatible ROG XG Station 2, an external graphics dock that connects to the Thunderbolt 3 port to give you desktop-level gaming performance. The docking station can be configured with up to an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, which can support gaming and VR apps, so you can have that level of performance when you need it. The graphics dock isn't exactly portable, but it offers a unique option for consumers and business users. You can keep your device lightweight and portable for work and travel, but still get a desktop gaming experience at home. The ROG X2 dock was announced at CES 2017 alongside the latest ASUS hybrid, but there is no word yet on pricing and availability. Toshiba Portege X20W Toshiba Toshiba specifically designed its newest 2-in-1 for the workplace, with a 7th generation Intel Core processor, Windows 10 Pro and sturdy design. While not the sleekest or most attractive hybrid announced at CES, the Toshiba Portege X20W is one of the few that took direct aim at the enterprise. It's not a detachable display, but it does rotate 360-degrees to lie flat against the keyboard. The Portege X20W features a 12.5-inch multi-touch display with a Full HD touch screen display, a USB 3.0 port and a USB Type-C port that can also support Thunderbolt 3 connections -- but like the iPad Pro, you will need an adapter to charge the device and connect to an external display at the same time. However, since this is an enterprise focused device, Toshiba also announced two "advanced docking solutions." The Toshiba WiGig Dock and the Thunderbolt 3 Dock, which will be available by the end of this quarter and will extend the connectivity of the device; no word yet on pricing for the tablet or docking stations, but both will be available through Microsoft's online and retail stores. HP EliteBook x360 HP HP's Spectre x360 was such a success that HP not only introduced a 15-inch model, it brought the same design to the EliteBook -- which is the company's business-focused notebook category. The HP EliteBook x360 took the familiar EliteBook and introduced the hinge of the x360, allowing the display to rest against the back of the keyboard. HP also announced the device will feature an optional 4K UHD display and claims the device is the "thinnest and most secure business convertible." The EliteBook x360 features a 13.3-inch multi-touch display, 2 USB 3.0 ports, a USB Type-C port, an HDMI port and Micro SD port. The notebook with enterprise security features built right in, like multi-factor authentication using a finger print scanner, IR camera or smart card reader. It also includes HP Sure View mode, which tints your screen with the touch of a button so it appears dark to anyone around -- similar to a privacy screen, but built right into the display. There is no word on pricing yet, but the device should be available later this month.

As it to be expected, these are incremental updates from Skylake-based Xeons using the newer 14nm Plus node from Intel. In our consumer Kaby Lake reviews, our results showed that the new design offers a better voltage/frequency profile than previous generations, affording more frequency at the same voltage. Another big change from the previous generation is the TDP: what used to be 80W is now listed as 73W if it has integrated graphics, or 72W if it does not. The list from CPU-World, who in turn discovered a QVL (qualified vendor list, or ‘CPUs which we confirm work in this board’) posting from a motherboard manufacturer whom accidentally included the new Xeons. The posted list features eight Xeon processors altogether. The two at the bottom of the stack are quad core parts without hyperthreading, and the others do have hyperthreading. The main differences between the processors will be frequencies and the presence of integrated graphics. Intel E3-1200 v6 CPUs (Kaby Lake)   C/T Base Freq L3 Cache IGP IGP Freq TDP E3-1280 v6 4/8 3.9 GHz 8 MB - - 72 W E3-1275 v6 4/8 3.8 GHz 8 MB P630 1150 MHz 73 W E3-1270 v6 4/8 3.8 GHz 8 MB - - 72 W E3-1245 v6 4/8 3.7 GHz 8 MB P630 1150 MHz 73 W E3-1240 v6 4/8 3.7 GHz 8 MB - - 72 W E3-1230 v6 4/8 3.5 GHz 8 MB - - 72 W E3-1225 v6 4/4 3.3 GHz 8 MB P630 1150 MHz 73 W E3-1220 v6 4/4 3.0 GHz 8 MB - - 72 W Most of these numbers come direct from the motherboard validation lists, with some such as core count being derived from L2 cache listings. All the parts listed have a full 8MB of L3 cache, indicating they run closer to the Core i7 design rather than a Core i5 (even those that have hyperthreading disabled). On the integrated graphics models, i.e. those ending in '5', are all running Intel HD P630 graphics and run up to 1150 MHz. This is the ‘professional’ version of the HD630 we see on the consumer parts, using Intel’s latest Gen9 graphics architecture and supporting H.265 encode/decode. Our Kaby Lake review piece goes into more detail. Not listed are the turbo frequencies of the CPUs, as these are currently unknown. Neither is the pricing, however given previous launches we would expect the tray price (OEM batches of a thousand CPUs) to have parity compared to previous generations. Intel E3-1200 v6 and v5 CPUs IGP v6 Model v5 IGP - 3.9, 72W E3-1280 3.7/4.0, 80W - + 3.8, 73W E3-1275 3.6/4.0, 80W + - 3.8, 72W E3-1270 3.6/4.0, 80W - - - E3-1260L 2.9/3.9, 45W - + 3.7, 73W E3-1245 3.5/3.9, 80W + - 3.7, 72W E3-1240 3.5/3.9, 80W - - - E3-1240L 2.1/3.2, 25W - - - E3-1235L 2.0/3.0, 25W + - 3.5, 72W E3-1230 3.4/3.8, 80W - + 3.3, 73W E3-1225 3.3/3.7, 80W + - 3.0, 72W E3-1220 3.0/3.5, 80W - For the most part, the new processors are ~200 MHz faster than the v5 parts while still being rated at the lower TDP. Memory support is expected to be the same as the consumer parts (DDR4-2400), and it is not yet confirmed if the v6 processors will support Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) given issues in previous revisions, so we will wait on future Intel announcements on this front. It is still worth noting that for LGA1151 based Xeons, Intel adjusted the requirements such that Xeon processors require a server grade chipset on the motherboard. For Skylake E3 v5 parts, this was either a C232 or C236 chipset – we reviewed a few motherboards with these on (ASRock E3V5 Gaming, GIGABYTE Z170X-Extreme ECC). With a BIOS update, these C232/C236 motherboards should support the new v6 processors. However, we currently do not know if there will be a second generation of chipsets for these CPUs in line with the consumer updates. On the consumer side the new chipset has additional PCIe lanes and Optane Memory support, so we stand in wait for a new desktop chipset to support these. There is a new mobile chipset, CM238, for mobile E3 v6 Xeons, but no equivalent in the desktop space yet. We currently have all the Skylake E3 v5 Xeons in for testing on our new benchmark suite soon, and we’ll make similar moves to acquire the Kaby Lake E3 v6 models when they are released. Currently there is no word on release date or pricing, however we typically see the E3 Xeons release very shortly after the consumer processor release.

POST A COMMENT 30 Comments View All Comments Harry Lloyd - Tuesday, January 24, 2017 - link The 1230 has always been a very good choice if you want a cheap 8-threaded CPU. I do some video encoding, so I chose the 1230 v3 back in 2013 hoping it would also do well in games (multi-core CPUs in consoles). And while it is sufficient, an overclocked i5 is still a better gaming choice even today, at least if you are targeting 60+ FPS. I hate that server chipset requirement, that change was very uncool. Reply MTEK - Tuesday, January 24, 2017 - link I never understood why Intel plays feature Hokey Pokey with its single socket Xeons. This is a professional's CPU. Just throw in hyperthreading across the board. Reply nevertell - Tuesday, January 24, 2017 - link Because money. Reply bill.rookard - Tuesday, January 24, 2017 - link I have an original Xeon E3-1230 and it's a pretty powerful CPU (even with no overclock). Reply Samus - Tuesday, January 24, 2017 - link What's always been great about Xeon is they don't hold their value like i5 and i7 cpu's. You can get E3 1230 v3's for $150 and 1280's for $200, both significantly cheaper than i7's while being virtually the same thing, just not overclockable. They also benefit from ECC if you have a compatible board. Reply azrael- - Tuesday, January 24, 2017 - link For the regular "Kaby Lake" processors Intel apparently only plans Windows 10 driver support. Considering most businesses aren't particularly busy upgrading to any flavor of Windows 10 in the foreseeable future, what will Intel do driver-wise? Reply eSyr - Tuesday, January 24, 2017 - link It is not Intel's decision but rather Microsoft's one — to provide and certify those drivers.

Image Credit: Intel Security The internet lifestyle is causing stress for families. One example: 76 of parents allow their children to take an internet-connected device to bed, but only 23 percent of parents admit they use software to monitor their children’s activity on the internet. That’s one of the findings from New Family Dynamics in a Connected World, a global survey of 13,000 people conducted by OnePoll for Intel Security, the security division of Intel that is spinning out as McAfee. Another finding: About 36 percent of parents have been called out by children for being on their devices during family time. This study underscores the need for simple ways for parents to manage internet connectivity in their homes — from blocking inappropriate sites to controlling the amount of time users spend on their devices to disconnecting from the internet entirely from time to time. The survey comes at a time when the smart home and its connected devices are seeing a rise in popularity. In fact, in April 2016 Gartner forecasted that “there will be more than 10.5 billion ‘things’ in homes by 2020.” Intel Security believes that those devices will create a larger potential risk for personal data being compromised. On top of that, it believes internet-connected devices can be harmful to family relationships. “While there is tremendous excitement for the conveniences that today’s technology brings, we know the weakest link in those devices within a connected home put consumers at risk,” said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security, in a statement. “We must empower parents to actively manage how their families interact with those devices. When the correct security and privacy measures are taken, consumers will feel more protected enabling them to fully enjoy all the benefits of living in a smart home.” Despite their concern of online risks and living a digitally led lifestyle, parents tend to use older methods to monitor their children’s device usage. 35 percent percent of parents admitted to monitoring their child’s device usage by keeping the device in their possession and only giving it to them when they were around, while only 23 percent admit to using software to monitor activity. Above: Intel Security found that parents are worried about predators and that kids challenge parents about their own device time. Image Credit: Intel Security Eighty percent of parents are concerned about their child potentially interacting with a social predator or cybercriminal online. Meanwhile, bedtime habits have changed a lot since the introduction of smartphones and tablets: 76 percent of parents allow their child to bring an internet-connected device to bed. Not only are parents concerned about who their children are interacting with online, they are also monitoring how much time they spend in front of a screen. Forty-eight percent of parents allow their child to have one to two hours of screen time per day, and 20 percent allow their child less than one hour a day. Unfortunately, parents can’t be there all the time to monitor the device usage. In fact, 34 percent of parents claim they have discovered that their child visited an inappropriate website on their device. Thirty-two percent of survey participants stated that they have argued with their child about bringing a device to bed. But kids aren’t the only ones who are using devices when they shouldn’t: About 36 percent of parents surveyed also claimed that their child has called them out for being on their device during family time. But there’s some good news in the report. Parents understand the importance of talking to their children about the potential dangers on the internet, with roughly 85 percent having addressed the risks with their children at some point. Intel Security has the following tips for parents. It says you should start conversations early. If you start talking about online safety early, it will make your job that much easier when your children get older. If your kids are young, start with simple rules like “don’t open emails from people you don’t know.” You want online safety to be part of normal behavior. It also pays to set a good example. It’s easy to get caught up spending a lot of time on devices, and kids pick up our habits — both good and bad. Set a positive example by limiting your time on social networks when at home and putting your phone away during dinner and family time. Intel Security said you should also keep strangers out. Most children have been using devices from an early age, desensitizing them to the potential risks of online behavior. A false sense of security can set in for children, and they could be unknowingly interacting with a social predator or dangerous person posing as a teen (catfishing). This isn’t just on social media networks — it applies to common services such as Uber, Lyft, and Craigslist. Remind kids that anyone can create a profile and to decline friend requests from strangers. And you should also take control of your home network. The home network is the hub for all of your connected devices. New solutions, such as McAfee Secure Home Platform, help you easily manage and protect devices connected to this network while providing parental controls with permissions that can be tailored to the entire household. In December 2016, Intel Security commissioned OnePoll to conduct a survey of 13,000 adults (aged 18-55+). Respondents were individuals who use an internet-connected device on a daily basis and are based in the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, U.K., and U.S. Above: Intel Security found that people aren’t spending enough face-to-face time with each other.

Reports Fourth-Quarter Earnings The semiconductor titan is expecting solid growth in the data center and Internet of Things operations. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Jan 23, 2017 at 5:12PM Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is gearing up for another earnings report. The semiconductor giant is slated to post fourth-quarter results after the closing bell on Thursday, Jan. 26. Here's what investors should look for in this update.  Intel by the numbers Intel's official guidance for the fourth quarter points to revenue rising approximately 5% year over year, stopping at $15.7 billion. GAAP earnings are expected to fall 8% to $0.68 per diluted share. In the third quarter, sales growth was spearheaded by double-digit annual percentage boosts in the Internet of Things and data center groups. Both of these divisions are enjoying solid long-term growth, setting the stage for another round of big growth numbers on Thursday. In particular, the rise in data center revenue rests on cloud computing solutions. IoT growth stems from Intel's efforts in selling embedded video, retail, and transportation products. Taking a longer view of Intel's financial performance, the company's earnings and cash flows have held relatively steady over the last three years. Sales have been ticking upward in recent quarters. INTC data by YCharts. Digging deeper Beyond the raw numbers, Intel is in the middle of a large-scale strategy transition. Ten years ago, Intel lived and died by the market for PC systems. Now, roughly half of the company's sales come from data center and Internet of Things products. That ratio is likely to tip even further, here and in future reports. In the third-quarter earnings call and recent presentations, Intel executives repeatedly hammered this point home. "Ten years ago, we were almost entirely dependent on the PC market for a growth in our profitability," said Stacy Smith, former CFO and now EVP of Intel's manufacturing and sales, at the Credit Suisse conference in November. "Today, more than half of our profits come from the Internet of Things, and the data center and the memory business and things like that. So it's a very different company from what it was 10 years ago and it will be a very different company 10 years from now." Image source: Intel. The latest news Intel has not been sitting on its hands. These are some of the company's most interesting recent moves, likely to be discussed in Thursday's earnings release and conference call: On Monday, Intel declared a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share. That's the same payout as the last four quarters, breaking a two-year streak of dividend boosts in January's announcements. Two weeks ago, the company announced a new platform for retail analytics and a robotic retail assistant. Intel plans to invest $100 million into retail-related IoT solutions over the next five years, and this was a taste of things to come. In early January, Intel acquired a 15% stake in the HERE self-driving car platform, managed by a coalition of German automakers. There was no word on the investment's size in dollars or euros, but the move dovetails neatly into Intel's recently announced plans to invest $250 million into autonomous vehicle tech over the next two years.

Dakota has $4 billion saved from oil and gas taxes; Colorado has almost none Trump adviser calling for overhaul of “junk science” at EPA Colorado considers ending longtime switchblade knife ban By Barbara Ortutay, The Associated Press NEW YORK — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter . Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a “pipeline problem,” meaning a shortage of woman and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there’s a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. “The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified,” says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don’t fit techie stereotypes aren’t “Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.” Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress , Intel acknowledges there is “a great deal of work to be done.” Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can’t control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It’s not enough to release diversity reports and say, “Oh, not a lot has changed, but it’s the world, not us that’s the problem,” she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. WHY IT MATTERS Diversity isn’t just about fairness. It’s about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products “will not appeal to a large population,” says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: + Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface. One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other “expired,” and the company said it won’t put it back into circulation. + Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. + Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise “we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.” INTO THE PIPELINE Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google’s 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they’re doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN’T FIT Silicon Valley startups like to talk about “culture fit” — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate’s attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they “hire what they know,” says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of “fit,” although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like “competitive,” ”dominant” and “leader,” can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on “unconscious bias” to combat the problem. But they don’t make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can’t help wondering if they would be taken “more seriously” if they were whiter and male, Williams says. MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a “wake-up call” for the company. “We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create,” she says. “We firmly believe that good ideas don’t come out of echo chambers.” Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be “demoralizing” to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. “We want to solve this for the long haul,” she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can’t understand why diversifying the industry’s workforce “seems to be such an intractable problem.” “I wonder if it is coming up against…the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special,” he says. “In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged.” Tags:  diversity gender equality tech Click for Digital & Home Delivery - 50% blog comments powered by Disqus More in Technology Technology back in driver’s seat in metro Denver January 27, 2017, 6:12 pm Jobs in information technology and software (IT-Software) increased 9.4 percent last year, the best showing out of 13 industries key to the northern Front Range economy, according to the 11th annual cluster study from the Metro Denver Economic Development Corp.

The investigation will also cover leaks of classified information held by the intelligence community, according to a joint statement from Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and ranking member Adam Schiff, D-Calif. President Donald Trump said he planned to ask congressional intelligence committees to investigate those leaks in a tweet prior to his inauguration. » Get the best federal technology news and ideas delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., previously pledged to investigate possible links between Russian officials and the Trump campaign, which were alleged in an unverified report created by a former British spy. Nunes had not previously made that commitment. House investigators also want to review documentation from intelligence agencies’ investigations at the committee’s Capitol Hill offices rather than at the agencies, according to the joint statement from Schiff and Nunes, a demand that could cause friction with intelligence leaders. “This issue is not about party, but about country,” the statement reads. “The committee will continue to follow the facts wherever they may lead.” Schiff renewed a call earlier Wednesday for a 9/11 Commission-style independent review into Russian government-backed election meddling at an event sponsored by the Center for American Progress. Congressional Republicans, who have declined to endorse such a commission so far, will come around eventually, Schiff argued. “My GOP colleagues are not at the point, apart from [Sens. John] McCain and [Lindsey] Graham, of willingness to confront the president,” Schiff said. “That will only last so long … I think, after a suitable honeymoon period, there will be some Republicans who will find their voice and express alarm at our playing any kind of a supporting role to the Russian propagation of autocracy around the world.” Schiff and other Democrats, including Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., have been ramping up pressure on Republican colleagues to break with Trump on the election hacking since he took office. Trump denied for many months that Russia was responsible for breaches at the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign that later leaked at WikiLeaks and elsewhere. Trump acknowledged the Russian attribution in a press conference after his election but conflated the breach with other nation-state-backed hacks, especially the allegedly China-linked breach of sensitive security clearance documents about more than 20 million current and former federal employees and their families at the Office of Personnel Management. Schiff criticized that conflation Wednesday, saying it plays into the hands of adversary nations that wish to conflate different types of malicious cyber activity. U.S. intelligence officials have long argued traditional spying for national security reasons such as the OPM breach—and which the U.S. also engages in—should be separated from influence operations such as the DNC email releases or commercial espionage such as Chinese theft of companies’ intellectual property and trade secrets. Schiff also criticized Trump for making numerous allegations without evidence since his election, including unverified allegations that millions voted illegally during the 2016 election. Such allegations will severely damage the president’s credibility if and when he needs to make a case to the American people and allies based on classified intelligence, he said. “Our new president is doing deep damage to himself and to our country,” Schiff said. “He’s doing it in his willingness to make up facts as he goes along.” Also on Wednesday, Sens. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Chris Coons, D-Del., introduced legislation establishing a Senate Select Committee on Cybersecurity whose jurisdiction would extend far beyond the Russian election hacking investigation. The committee would oversee all cybersecurity and cyberspace issues, which are currently split among numerous committees and subcommittees, especially the Senate Intelligence, Homeland Security, Armed Services and Commerce committees. The committee would be composed of the chairs and ranking members of those committees plus the Senate Appropriations, Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees along with five additional members chosen by Senate leadership, Gardner and Coons said. recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Software vulnerability A Single Message Can Make Some Samsung Galaxy Phones Reboot Forever See threatwatch report ADD A COMMENT Remove Cloud IT “Blind Spots” with Application Visibility Data Analytics Bring Transportation Infrastructure into the Future Agile, OSS and Cloud Strengthen Government’s Mission This Database Can Help Government Transition FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jan 25, 2017 at 3:41PM Image source: Apple. "Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands. And your plan is to blackmail this person?" -- Lucius Fox, The Dark Knight In Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008), an accountant discovers Batman's true identity by uncovering some accounting irregularities at Wayne Enterprises, but imaginary CEO Lucius Fox quickly puts an end to the blackmailer's plan by pointing out how absurd it is. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) may not have been blackmailing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) all these years, but Apple thinks Qualcomm is guilty of a similar crime: extortion. In its U.S. lawsuit filed last week, Apple alleges that Qualcomm "attempted to extort Apple" into changing how it responded to a regulatory antitrust investigation in South Korea. The iPhone maker also argues that it has been paying "extortion-level royalties" for years, due to Qualcomm's "no license, no chips" policy where Qualcomm would only sell chips to customers that agreed to onerous licensing terms. It seems as if Qualcomm has been getting away with this for years, which is why its market power has grown so dramatically as rivals fell by the wayside and exited the baseband processor market. Most customers lack the operating scale, legal resources, and financial incentive to effectively stand up to Qualcomm through protracted litigation. Apple doesn't. Apple bites back So let me get this straight, Qualcomm: You think that your biggest customer, one of the wealthiest, most powerful corporations in the world that also has a reputation for squeezing its suppliers would quietly accept your oppressive contract terms and never fight back. And your plan is to extort this company? In no uncertain terms, it worked for many years, and Qualcomm's revenue skyrocketed over the past decade. QCOM Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Broader smartphone adoption was the main factor, but the iPhone pulled an awful lot of that weight, too -- both directly and indirectly (Android was created largely in response to the iPhone). More specifically, from 2011 to late 2016, Qualcomm had extracted both exclusivity in supplying Apple with cellular baseband modems as well as its silence. You may note in the chart above how much sales increased during this time period. Apple was restricted from actively complaining to law enforcement and regulators, although it was allowed to respond if asked. So long as Qualcomm maintained its lock on baseband chipsets, it had incredible leverage and there wasn't a whole lot Apple could do. Enter Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel had been trying to crack the baseband market for years with little to no success. Even today, Intel's modems are technologically inferior to Qualcomm's, but they're good enough and much cheaper, and Intel expects to catch up within a few generations. The combination of Qualcomm's exclusivity ending combined with Intel's ability to supply a sufficiently competitive modem is the perfect storm for Apple to unleash its pent-up discontent in court. The $1 billion that Qualcomm is withholding was just the final straw. Now that Apple has a path to an alternative supplier (even though the majority of its basebands still come from Qualcomm) and is no longer contractually obligated to keep quiet, Apple is bringing a brutal suit against Qualcomm that threatens Qualcomm's very business model. You know it's serious when Apple is litigating, given CEO Tim Cook's hatred of litigation. Did Qualcomm really think that Apple would never retaliate? The moral of the story: Don't extort Apple, and don't blackmail Batman. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Qualcomm.

"The United States is the shining light of freedom, liberty, and prosperity to the world. We welcome all who are willing to work hard to achieve their American dream,” Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) said in a statement. “A wall is the exact opposite of what America stands for." ADVERTISEMENT Trump signed two executive orders on immigration Wednesday, one calling for immediate construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and increased immigration enforcement, and the other for cooperation between local law enforcement officials and immigration authorities. "Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders, gets back its borders," Trump said at the Department of Homeland Security. The second order also called for withholding federal funds from "sanctuary" cities, municipalities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities on immigration enforcement. Thomas Saenz, the president of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund warned that Trump’s orders would "undermine public safety" by alienating local law enforcement from immigrant communities. He also warned that the increased threat of deportation could force immigrants into hiding, disrupting the labor market. "Economic disruption to industries such as agriculture render these orders a threat to U.S. national security," Saenz said. “Stripping funding from cities like Las Vegas endangers the health and safety of all Nevadans and is a wrong-headed approach to a nuanced issue. Not all undocumented immigrants are ‘rapists’ and ‘criminals.’ I was once undocumented – now, I’m a member of Congress,” said freshman Rep. Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.). House Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said cutting funding for sanctuary cities could damage local law enforcement, and he questioned how the Trump administration would choose which cities to target. "There is no legal definition of a sanctuary city," Hoyer pointed out. Democrats and activists lamented the appropriation of funds for the wall. The border wall would cost an estimated $8 billion to $25 billion. The executive order asked for the Department of Homeland Security to use any available funds to start construction, although Trump vowed that Mexico would reimburse the cost per his campaign promise. Mexican officials could not be reached for comment. “There's no indication whatsoever that the moderate Republicans would go along with the cost of the wall," said Rep. Tony Cardenas (D-Calif.). Democrats also railed against the effectiveness of a border wall, saying it would do little to limit immigration and would be prohibitively expensive to build. "As far as the wall is concerned, I suspect that a lot of Trump supporters would be just as happy with a big statue of a middle finger pointed south, because both are about equally effective as national security strategies," said Rep. Luis GutierrezLuis GutierrezDems: Wall is 'opposite of what America stands for' Dem boycotts of inauguration grow Puerto Rico's representative makes renewed push for statehood MORE (D-Ill.). The feasibility of the orders was also questioned, as Trump will need congressional approval to fully fund the announced actions. "It’s clear that many elements of what was announced today overreach the limits of executive authority and will require acquiescence from Congress," said Saenz. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said in an interview on MSNBC Wednesday that Republican leaders in Congress should be prepared to challenge Trump on construction of the wall, though he was not optimistic they would. "If [Speaker] Paul RyanPaul RyanDemocrats denounce Trump's actions barring refugees Ryan: Building border wall 'urgent' House panel sets infrastructure hearing MORE [R-Wis.] and [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnellMitch McConnellMcConnell: Trump should replace IRS commissioner McConnell wants to finish work on ObamaCare quickly McConnell warns Trump: Don’t lift Russia sanctions MORE [R-Ky.] are not willing to stand up to a guy who has imagined that 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally, then I don't know what they're going to stand up to him on. And that should give many people in this country, both Republicans and Democrats, and all Americans of good conscience, real pause," Castro added. On a call with reporters, Castro also warned that the wall could drive top trading partner Mexico away from the American sphere of influence. "President Trump's actions represent a hostility towards Mexico, one of our best friends and trading partners," he said. "He is driving Mexico into China’s hands." Hispanic leaders vowed to confront the policies through litigation and political action. "Remember, this is a bully and he will continue to bully us if we just continue to put down our heads and walk home," said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.). "The executive actions on immigration announced by President Trump today are simply un-American,” said César J.

Chris Foresman - Jul 3, 2012 9:10 pm UTC Sumitomo's distinctive black Thunderbolt cables aren't being sold directly in the US. Chris Foresman reader comments Share this story Intel's Thunderbolt high-speed interconnect has been shipping for over a year now, and new vendors have been announcing products compatible with the standard ever since. One sticking point, however, has been that Thunderbolt devices require an expensive $50 cable—only available from Apple until recently. And unfortunately, prices aren't coming down any time soon. While other vendors are now offering their own Thunderbolt cables, prices have mostly stayed the same—in fact, some have gone up. We found this surprising; typically more vendors offering competing products leads to lower prices. And as the high cable price represents a fairly high barrier to entry for Thunderbolt devices, it relegates the standard to niche, early-adopter territory. This isn't likely to change in the near future. Our research shows that for the rest of 2012, Thunderbolt cables are going to remain in the $45-60 price range. Prices aren't likely to drop noticeably until early 2013, when second-generation silicon for Thunderbolt's active cabling becomes available in production quantities. The current landscape Belkin, Elgato, and Kanex are some of the latest vendors offering Thunderbolt cables to work with a growing number of drives, docks, and other devices coming to market. But in many cases, the cables are more expensive than Apple's $50 cable. Kanex offers its own 2m cable for $60. Elgato, which recently released a portable Thunderbolt SSD, sells a 0.5m cable to go along with it, also $60. The only "cheaper" cable out there is a 1m branded one Belkin offers to go along with its upcoming Thunderbolt Express Dock for $45. Besides Apple, the only volume supplier of Thunderbolt cables currently seems to be Japanese electrical cable manufacturer Sumitomo. Intel has been using the distinctive black version of the cables in demonstrations throughout the year, including at CES and Computex. We found Sumitomo's cables available from Amazon Japan in sizes from 0.3m to 3m, for the equivalent of $48-$62. Its 2m cable, available in white or black, costs $56 (plus shipping from Japan). A Sumitomo representative told Ars that the company has no plans to retail its cables in the US; instead, it is partnering with local vendors to brand and distribute the cables. The Elgato and Belkin cables appear to be made by Sumitomo, though neither company would confirm that to us. Kanex's cable appears to be manufactured by another OEM. Change in motion All these cables have one thing in common, according to John Mitchell, marketing manager for signal processing chip maker Intersil. "All of them are based on the Gennum transceiver, what we call first-gen cable," Mitchell explained. That transceiver—now manufactured by Semtech, which acquired Gennum in March—is the same one used in Apple's cable. The Semtech (née Gennum) Thunderbolt transceiver used in Apple's Thunderbolt cable iFixit The chip is built using silicon germanium, "an expensive semiconductor process typically used for telecom applications," Mitchell told Ars. It's likely that Intel and Apple chose the Semtech part because it was either an already existing part that fit the requirements for Thunderbolt's high 10Gbps bi-directional data rate, or Semtech had something similar that was easily adaptable. In addition to the transceiver, the current reference design also requires a separate microcontroller, as well as power management and voltage regulation chips to deliver the 3V data signals and 15V optional power supply for bus-powered devices. Essentially, there are four integrated circuits (IC) at either end of a Thunderbolt cable. "Active cables need clock and data recovery chips on either end, even for optical cables," Mitchell said. "This makes Thunderbolt very robust—signal is cleaned up by the cable, even if a device is 'noisy.'" Combined with relatively high-quality copper cable, Thunderbolt quickly becomes rather expensive equipment. For comparison, passive cables (such as those used for HDMI or USB) cost under $10 for a 2m cable. But Mitchell said that his company has a solution to the problem currently in the pipeline and set to ship in volume in the latter part of this year. What Intersil calls an "Active Cable IC Solution for Thunderbolt Technology" appears to be the only complete turnkey solution we could find among manufacturers selling ICs for Thunderbolt. It combines the microcontroller and transceiver into a single signal processing chip, and combines power management and voltage regulators into a single power management chip. This cuts the number of required ICs from four to two. Enlarge / Intersil's active Thunderbolt cable solution reduces the number of necessary ICs from four to two. Intersil The chips are manufactured on a lower cost, 40nm CMOS process, improving yields and lowering costs significantly. The 40nm process also dissipates less heat, reducing the need for bulky heat sinking within the cable plug. The chipset also uses Intersil's patented "cable compensation" techniques, which account for signal skew and dispersion within the copper conductors. "We've been designing around these problems for data center applications, by using advanced equalization and cable impairment correction," Mitchell said. Bringing the technology to Thunderbolt will allow cable manufacturers to use a lower-grade cable while still maintaining 10Gbps throughput. In addition to these improvements, Intersil's chipset includes features like integrated error-rate testers and switching loopbacks, all designed to aid in automated testing. "These features help cable assemblers test the cables during the manufacturing process, streamlining the workflow," Mitchell said. "Our solution is half the chips, half the size, uses half the power, and cheaper conductors can be used. By the end of the year, cables will be less expensive." That news bodes well for the Thunderbolt ecosystem, which will begin expanding this year as a new wave of Thunderbolt-equipped Macs and PCs work their way into consumers' hands. "It's pretty much been an Apple thing with a few drives," Mitchell told Ars of the current landscape. "But with Ivy Bridge and Intel's new Thunderbolt controllers, the rest of this year is going be very interesting."

(I mostly blame Apple for this, as they released their first TB Macs around the same time everybody else introduced USB 3.) Thunderbolt is basically an external PCIe bus, it's needlessly overkill for many uses that USB 3 will do just fine (and with plain inexpensive cables!), but very useful for others, like external docks or GPUs, where USB 3 is not low-level enough. 547 posts | registered Nov 17, 2009 dlux | Ars Tribunus Angusticlavius jump to post For anyone wondering why these higher-speed interfaces seem needlessly complex, look through this pictorial and read the captions (also zoom the images for a higher-res version): http://www.tomshardware.com/picturestor ... 10gbe.html Now that's for 10G Ethernet, not Thunderbolt, but a lot of the electrical challenges still apply when transmitting data outside of the device in a sometimes-hostile environment. (Also, that article also addresses some of the work needed to refine successive generations of a given interconnect. The original single-port 10G card consumed 25 watts, and that was just at one end of the cable. A single 10G Ethernet channel meant 50W of power end-to-end, and if you have multiple hundreds of those in a data center you can do the math...)

Digital Realty Signals the Gloves are Coming Off in 2017 Previous Article Microsoft Backs Away from Manager’s Comment on Post-Brexit Data Center Plans Next Article Encryption Key to Compliance Requirements as Companies Move to Cloud SPONSORED Sponsored: Overcoming Key Data Center Challenges with Converged Infrastructure by Bill Kleyman  on January 25, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet Sponsored by: Dell and Intel   Converged systems are powerful platforms with their built-in automation, high-density architecture, and high-performance chassis. They enable organizations to architect a very robust cloud and storage environment with the goal of creating unparalleled density and allowing for resources to be delivered as effectively as possible. The big benefits behind converged infrastructure (CI) are huge driving factors around the adoption boom that we’re already experiencing. According to the IDC Worldwide Quarterly Converged Systems Tracker, the global revenue in this category grew 8.5% year over year to $3.1 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015 (4Q15). The market generated 1,547 petabytes of new storage capacity shipments during the quarter, an increase of 26.9% from the same time last year. For the full year 2015, the revenue jumped 8.3% to $10.6 billion when compared to 2014. “We are seeing some of the market demand move into deals with lower average selling prices (ASPs), which is driving a shift from traditional converged systems to hyperconverged systems,” said Kevin M. Permenter, IDC’s senior research analyst, in a press statement. “Right now, most of the growth is coming from the mid-market, which is heavily skewed toward hyperconverged systems. We are expecting to see this trend continue into the near term.” To get the complete picture, add the findings of a recent Data Center Trends Survey sponsored by Dell EMC and Intel, which indicates some of the biggest challenges facing organizations as they into 2017. They include: Security: 67% Centralizing Resources and Improved Efficiency: 43% Supporting Cloud: 40% To overcome these challenges and concerns, converged infrastructure solutions aim to revolutionize the way organizations deploy data center solutions. In working with converged infrastructure (CI), it’s important to see exactly where this type of platform can help your business. Consider the following: Ease of Deployment. Modern converged infrastructure systems are pre-validated environments deployed as building blocks into a data center. This means no more guessing or spending more than required on data center solutions. Furthermore, there is a direct reduction of risk in deployed validated designs. Today’s CI architectures allow organizations to size their workloads around specific validated converged infrastructure deployments. For example, you can size around big data, virtualization, VDI, databases, and even disaster recovery. Disaster Recovery Strategies. A big challenge in creating a good DR strategy was the architecture of secondary systems. In working with converged infrastructure, you can size the right type of data center based on your specific SLA requirements. You can design a platform capable of handling 100% of the primary, or, as much as the business requires. The good part here is that direct integration with the management and virtualization layer allows for even easier failover capabilities. This allows organizations to plan their disaster recovery strategies and size them out appropriately. Furthermore, this will help organizations control costs when deploying DR strategy. Improved Management. Traditionally, data center admins would rely on third party systems or other kinds of controls to manage a heterogenous infrastructure. Now, with CI, you have all core resources under one engine; and management is simplified dramatically. This means administrators have better ways to control how resources are allocated to virtual machines, how specific user groups can be optimized, and even where compliance and regulation-bound workloads are being housed. Furthermore, there is better integration with the underlying hypervisor via management plugins for even further control capabilities. Using Converged Infrastructure to Improve Security. Your ability to segment traffic, virtual workloads, and entire network using CI is pretty powerful. The centralization of core resources creates fewer management points and simplifies the control of data. You can create powerful resource silos around pieces of data that can’t leave specific servers or even storage repositories. Or, you can enforce access policies around very specific network segments all living on the CI architecture.  Converged infrastructure aims to simplify the way you manage critical resources, deliver key applications, and support an evolving user. To create powerful business benefits and strategic IT economics, it’s absolutely important to ensure that your deployment technology has a strong use-case. In the case of converged infrastructure – there are numerous ways that this platform can support growing business demands. This revolves around supporting new kinds of users, greater levels of virtualization, and even new technologies like containers. Most of all – a good CI deployment will give the business an easy way to scale and evolve with new market demands.

Friday’s Vital Data: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 2 Ways to Play Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Q4 Earnings View All Posts U.S. stock futures are in rally mode this morning, as corporate earnings continue to bolster sentiment on Wall Street. What’s more, the Dow Jones Industrial Average could be poised to challenge the 20,000 level today, especially if earnings from blue-chip members United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) and Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) come in strong this morning. Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have added 0.33%, with S&P 500 futures up 0.32% and Nasdaq-100 futures rallying 0.43%. On the options front, Tuesday’s volume came back strong from Monday’s lackluster performance. Overall, the roughly 17.5 million calls and 14.8 million puts traded put a bullish spin on the day’s activity. Bullish activity wasn’t quite as pronounced on the CBOE, however, as the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dipped slightly to 0.65. The 10-day moving average banked its fifth session in a row at 0.65. Turning to Tuesday’s volume leaders, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remained pinned to the $120 region after Barclays downgraded the shares on excessive hype surrounding the iPhone 8 “supercycle.” Meanwhile, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) continues to see call volume come in light heading into next week’s earnings report, and Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) and other miners attracted a sizable bullish bid after President Trump signed several executive orders to help increase infrastructure spending. Apple Inc. (AAPL) In a note to clients on Tuesday, Barclays said that it does not see any “meaningful upside potential” for AAPL stock. The brokerage firm also downgraded Apple to “overweight” from “equal weight” and cut its price target to $117 from $119. Barclays noted that the so-called “supercycle” — where iPhone 6 and 7 users upgrade to the supposedly much improved iPhone 8 — has been overplayed and will not deliver the results many investors are hoping for as customers increasingly mix down to the iPhone 6S and 7S models. AAPL options activity took a noticeable hit on Tuesday following the downgrade. Call option volume had been trending in the 66th to 67th percentile of daily total volume, but managed to only garner 60% of the more than 498,000 contracts traded yesterday. Still, this one blip hasn’t been enough to shake overall sentiment on AAPL, with the 3 Feb put/call open interest ratio falling over the past couple of weeks to rest at 0.76. The current upside earnings target in the 3 Feb series remains $120 with 19,000 contracts, though the $125 has amassed more than 10,000 contracts, and OI is rising.

Enclustra’s SODIMM-style Mars XU3 and larger Mercury+ XU1 computer-on-modules run Linux on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. They follow Enclustra’s announcement earlier this month of a Linux-friendly Mercury+ AA1 COM running on an Intel/Altera Arria 10 ARM/FPGA hybrid. Enclustra offers several SODIMM-style Mars and larger Mercury COMs equipped with Altera and Xilinx FPGAs or FPGA/ARM hybrid SoCs, including the Altera Cyclone V based Mercury SA1. Mars XU3 (left) and Mercury+ XU1 (click images to enlarge) Xilinx announced the quad-core Cortex-A53 Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC EG hybrid ARM/FPGA SoC in early 2015 as a follow-on to its popular Zynq-7000 line of Cortex-A9/FPGA SoCs. The UltraScale+ EG reached production shortly before the company’s June announcement of a dual-core CG version. The Mars XU3 and Mercury+ XU1 modules follow two other recently released Zynq UltraScale+ EG COMs. In 2016, Trenz launched a 76 x 52mm TE0808 UltraSOM+ COM, and Iveia launched an 85.7 x 54.0mm Atlas-II-Z8, both of which support Linux. Iveia is also prepping an Atlas-III-Z8 model, which offers two additional banks of I/O. Trenz TE0808 UltraSOM+ (left) and Iveia Atlas-II-Z8 (click images to enlarge) Like the Arria 10-based Mercury+ AA1, the new Mars XU3 and Mercury+ XU1 are available in commercial and industrial (-40 to 85°C) temperature versions, and can be purchased with baseboards. They are similarly available with Linux BSPs from Ant Micro, while the Mars XU3 also offers Android and eCos BSPs from the same source. VxWorks is also supported. Like the Mercury+ AA1, the UltraScale+ modules are aimed at embedded computing, data acquisition, high-speed communications, digital signal processing, image processing, and drive/motion control. They are similarly available with an optional Universal Drive Controller IP Core that avoids the “need for an extra drive controller chip that would consume precious PCB space and unnecessarily extend the project BOM,” says Enclustra. The Swiss manufacturer is also working on a 56 × 54mm Mercury XU5 module equipped with the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC, but it appears to be farther away from production. The feature set is fairly similar to that of the other two modules. Xilinx’s 16nm FinFET fabricated Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC competes directly with the Intel/Altera Stratix 10. It features a faster, 1.5GHz quad-core CPU, and more powerful Mali-400 MP2 GPU and FPGA compared to the Zynq-7000. Depending on the FPGA level chosen, the UltraScale+ EG ranges from 103K to 1,143K logic cells, 94 to 1,045 flip-flops, and 47 to 523 LUTs. There are also non-MPSoC versions without the ARM block. Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC block diagram (click image to enlarge) The UltraScale+ adds two 600MHz Cortex-R5 MCUs with vector FPUs and memory protection units for improved real-time processing. Options include an H.265/264 video codec and a DSP.   Mars XU3 Enclustra’s SODIMM-style, 67.6 × 30.0mm Mars XU3 module is available in four SKUS that mix and match 1GB and 2GB DDR4 RAM with 0 to 70°C and -40 to 85°C support. Users can load up to 4GB of DDR4 on their own, and 64MB QSPI and 4GB eMMC flash are standard. The 3.3V module has an onboard GbE controller. Mars XU3 block diagram (click image to enlarge) The block diagram shows dual USB 2.0 PHYs, but the product page also mentions USB 3.0 support. Interfaces include 108x user I/Os, including 52x 1.8V system, 18x 3.3V system, and 24x FPGA interfaces. Other features include a PCIe Gen x4 (4 MGTs) interface, JTAG, I2C, 4x LEDs, and an RTC.   Mercury+ XU1 The Mercury+ XU1 is available with more extensive documentation than the Mars XU3. The 74 × 54mm module backs up its Zynq Ultrascale+ with up to 8GB DDR4 with 19.2 GByte/sec memory bandwidth. SKUs include two -40 to 85°C versions with 2GB RAM, and a 0 to 85°C model with 4GB RAM. The modules also offer set allotments of 64MB QSPI flash and 8GB eMMC flash. Mercury+ XU1, front and back (click images to enlarge) The Mercury+ XU1 embeds 2x GbE controllers and an RTC, and offers a variety of ARM- and FPGA-linked I/O via 3x 168-pin Hirose FX10 connectors. The module supports 2x USB 3.0, as well as USB 2.0 host and OTG ports. Mercury+ XU1 block diagram (click image to enlarge) A PCIe Gen2 x4 interface is onboard, along with 16x 6/8/12.5Gbps MGTs. A total of 294x user I/Os include 14x ARM peripherals, 80x MGTs, and 200x FPGA interfaces. The Mercury+ XU1 runs on 5-15V power, and is touted for low power consumption due to its high-efficiency DC/DC converters.   Enclustra carrier boards Each of the Enclustra COMs supports different carrier boards. The Mars XU3 offers a choice of two 120 × 80mm Pico-ITX boards: a basic Mars EB1 and a more FPGA-oriented Mars PM3. Both boards are available in commercial or extended (-25 to 85°C) models, and start at $268 in single units. Mars EB1 (left) and block diagram (click images to enlarge) The Mars EB1 baseboard is equipped with a microSD slot, Ethernet port, a USB 2.0 port, and 4x micro-USB 2.0 device ports. There’s also an HDMI 1.3 port and dual “mini camera links,” says Enclustra. Other features include a 40-pin expansion header, and other headers, buttons, and LEDs. You can power up via a 5-15V input or micro-USB. Mars PM3 (left) and block diagram (click images to enlarge) The Mars PM3 Pico-ITX carrier advances to a GbE port and a USB 3.0 Cypress EZ-USB FX3 device controller with Slave-FIFO interface. There are also USB 2.0 host. micro-USB 2.0, mini-HDMI, and SD connections. The board offers more connectors for FPGA interfaces, including 72-pin FMC low pin count connector and optional 40-pin I/O header. Mercury+ PE1 (left) and block diagram (click images to enlarge) The Mercury+ XU1 module is available with a larger, 160 × 111.2mm Mercury+ PE1-300/400 carrier board. The board is equipped with dual GbE ports, USB 3.0 device, micro-USB 2.0 device, and 4x USB 2.0 host ports. A microSD slot and an option for additional eMMC flash are also available. The Mercury+ PE1 board features a PCIe Gen2 x4 interface with miniPCIe and mSATA slots and an optional SIM card holder. The PEI-400 model has 2× FMC LPC connectors while the PEI-300 instead has a single FMC HPC connector. Dual 40-pin and dual 12-pin Pmod headers are also available. The board has a 5-12V supply.   Further information The Mars XU3 module will be available starting at $157, tiering down to $112 in 10K+ volume for the 1GB commercial range SKU. The Mercury+ XU3 will start at $800 with 2GB RAM, dropping down to $520 at 10K. No availability dates were listed.

(ROK) Zacks Investment Research Lowers Symantec Corporation (SYMC) to Sell January 25th, 2017 - 0 comments - Filed Under - by Tyrone Williams Filed Under: Analyst Articles - US - Finance Tweet Zacks Investment Research lowered shares of Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC) from a buy rating to a sell rating in a report released on Friday. According to Zacks, “Cybersecurity firm Symantec faces increased competition from the likes of Intel and Microsoft. Also, smaller companies like Kaspersky are consistently launching comparable products. These, along with uncertainty over PC sales remain headwinds. Moreover, changing customer spending behavior makes us pretty skeptical about Symantec’s near-term performance. However, the sale of the Veritas business provided Symantec with the financial flexibility to take the acquisition route to transform its struggling business. We believe that the acquisitions will enable Symantec to strengthen its position in the enterprise security market. Notably, the company has outperformed the broader market over a period of one year.” SYMC has been the subject of several other reports. Bank of America Corporation set a $18.00 price objective on shares of Symantec Corporation and gave the company a sell rating in a report on Sunday, November 6th.

Despite loudly touted efforts, the tech industry is making very little progress in diversifying its workforce, especially in technical and leadership positions. NEW YORK — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, though it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a "pipeline problem," meaning a shortage of woman and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of experts and employees say there's a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. "The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified," says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don't fit techie stereotypes aren't "Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough." Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making early progress, Intel admits there is "a great deal of work to be done." Similar programs are in place elsewhere, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top jobs. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, which makes tech jewelry for women, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming factors they can't control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It's not enough to release diversity reports and say, "Oh, not a lot has changed, but it's the world, not us that's the problem," she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. WHY IT MATTERS Diversity isn't just about fairness. It's about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products "will not appeal to a large population," says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: — Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface. One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other "expired," and the company said it won't put it back into circulation. — Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. — Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise "we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future." INTO THE PIPELINE Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google's 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they're doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN'T FIT Silicon Valley startups like to talk about "culture fit" — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate's attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they "hire what they know," says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of "fit," although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like "competitive," "dominant" and "leader," can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on "unconscious bias" to combat the problem. But they don't make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can't help wondering if they would be taken "more seriously" if they were whiter and male, Williams says. MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a "wake-up call" for the company. "We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create," she says. "We firmly believe that good ideas don't come out of echo chambers." Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be "demoralizing" to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. "We want to solve this for the long haul," she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can't understand why diversifying the industry's workforce "seems to be such an intractable problem." "I wonder if it is coming up against...the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special," he says. "In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged."

Can RBC change that? Jan 25, 2017 Adrian Lee   0 (Eduardo Lima/ Canadian Press) This story originally appeared at Maclean’s. These days, deep learning is all the rage. Tech’s biggest players, from Intel to Amazon, are betting big on the artificial intelligence technique modelled after the instincts of the human brain, with its ability to read patterns, sense rules, and make the best decision accordingly. Not long ago, Google spent more than $400 million to buy industry-leading startup DeepMind, and scored a major tech and marketing coup when the computer AlphaGo defeated grandmaster Lee Sedol at the possibility-lush game of Go—an achievement hundreds of times more complex than when Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess. Deep learning is being touted as a way forward for climate science, medicine and genomics; it’s already embedded in the way you search for something online, when you Google image search for, say, “cat,” and feline photos come up as a result of AI learning of what “cat” means. But it wasn’t always the popular kid in the block. In its early days in the 1980s, deep learning’s mostly Canadian pioneers—in particular, the trio of Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun, who worked largely out of an institute in Toronto—were dismissed as foolish apostates. “At the time, it didn’t solve big practical AI problems, it didn’t replace the existing technology,” said Hinton, considered the godfather of deep learning, in a 2016 interview with Maclean’s. But when computing power started to advance at an incredible rate, deep learning’s potential for AI was unlocked, turning huge piles of data into artificial intelligence that could, effectively, learn like our brain. Five Canadian tech leaders on what they're most excited for in 2017 Canada, though, hasn’t enjoyed much benefit for being an early adopter on the forefront of this technology. American companies have mostly picked the cupboard clean: Hinton now works with Google, LeCun leads Facebook’s AI research lab, and Bengio is an adviser with IBM, whose work out of the University of Montreal has earned significant funding from Google and beyond. Even Hinton has acknowledged this is cause for concern, in a recent Globe and Mail commentary written with other leading deep-learning experts: “There is one solution that will help keep the best minds in Canada, solve the current and future talent gap for domestic businesses, lure investment from foreign data-rich companies, and ensure Canada leads future AI breakthroughs: We must build a world-leading AI Institute in Toronto.” So it’s not insignificant that the Royal Bank of Canada’s Research in Deep Learning division—still shiny from its launch just seven months ago—has acquired the services of a big name in the field, adding Richard Sutton to its roster. Sutton wrote the book on the field of reinforcement learning, a technique which allows AI to teach itself what the best actions are using a reward-punishment system of its own, an area of deep learning that played a role in the success of DeepMind’s AlphaGo project. He will advise the group, currently based out of the University of Toronto, and also collaborate with RBC’s second AI research lab, which will be in Edmonton. “A lot of the development in deep learning came out of Canadian universities, yet the industry wasn’t positioned well enough to capitalize on that innovation, so we’ve lost a lot of people to south of the border,” said Foteini Agrafioti, who leads RBC’s deep-learning division. “That’s something we feel, as the biggest company in the country, we have the responsibility to invest in.” Venture capital funding is rushing into machine learning startups While Sutton is certainly not a household name, he is a major figure in deep learning, and a significant addition for a Canadian company nonetheless. Without a central hub for academics to branch out on their work in Canada, deep learning’s southbound pioneers served as pied pipers, bringing their students with them, creating a brain drain. Banking, too, seems to have plenty to offer deep-learning experts—in particular, rich historical data sets from decades of business. “The backbone of machine learning is data sets, and without that you’re really handcuffed. The bank has really interesting data sets from decades of market data that can be used to solve open problems right now,” says Agrafioti. Banking also offers some tantalizing practical applications for deep-learning innovators, too; of the three possibilities listed by Agrafioti—personalized AI-driven customer service, real-time fraud prevention and risk management—it’s the last one that might appeal most to those interested in industry disruption. Deep learning’s use of patterns to predict future activity appears to have tremendous potential for stock brokers, investment bankers, and asset managers—to assist them, at least for now. (For the record, Agrafioti demurs about the potential automation of those positions, rightly noting that there is no industry consensus on whether AI can ever truly become as or more powerful than the human brain.) It is, however, unclear if Canada’s banks—collectively the country’s largest companies—could reverse the tide of expertise migrating southward on their own. While the price tag of RBC’s investment in this lab is unclear, beyond Agrafioti’s cited cost of “tens of millions of dollars over the coming years,” Canada’s banks are unlikely to be able to match the dollar figures splashed around by companies like Tesla, which invested US$1 billion into Open AI in 2015. Canada’s Big Six banks themselves are less likely to feel the need to innovate, insulated as they are against the competitive agitation of fintech companies by their market position and regulatory balustrade, and cognizant that Canada’s venture capitalism industry—usually the fuel for fintech—is far less fulsome than America’s. For these comfortable behemoth banks, the innovation stakes aren’t as high, a fact that Agrafioti acknowledges: “Our rate of adoption is, of course, not as fast as some tech companies.” Robots will mostly take over the jobs humans hate doing anyway Still, RBC deserves credit for at least pushing to develop more homegrown research. Scotiabank, CIBC, TD Canada Trust and Bank of Montreal were not able to respond at press time to requests for details about their own research into deep learning. (Scotiabank did, however, start a “digital factory” in 2015, which professed to partner with fintech startups to develop new technologies, and gifted the University of Toronto with $1.75 million to study “disruptive technologies,” while several big-bank CEOs acknowledged that AI needed to be harnessed within the industry at a recent conference.) But will it be enough to reverse the AI brain drain on its own? Surely not. The lure of money, vast data sets, and powerful computing in Silicon Valley remains a powerful pull for those at the peak of their profession. But if Canadian companies can learn anything from deep learning, it’s to take lessons from the patterns of the past—struggles to innovate, and an inability to keep our best talent here—and project the right way forward in the future. And where better to start, than with the large data sets at the fingertips of our powerful banks?

But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter . Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a “pipeline problem,” meaning a shortage of woman and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there’s a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. “The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified,” says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don’t fit techie stereotypes aren’t “Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.” Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. The industry is trying Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress , Intel acknowledges there is “a great deal of work to be done.” Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can’t control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It’s not enough to release diversity reports and say, “Oh, not a lot has changed, but it’s the world, not us that’s the problem,” she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. Why it matters Diversity isn’t just about fairness. It’s about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products “will not appeal to a large population,” says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: — Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface. One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other “expired,” and the company said it won’t put it back into circulation. — Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. — Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise “we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.” Into the pipeline Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google’s 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they’re doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. When the culture doesn’t fit Silicon Valley startups like to talk about “culture fit” — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate’s attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they “hire what they know,” says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of “fit,” although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like “competitive,” ”dominant” and “leader,” can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on “unconscious bias” to combat the problem. But they don’t make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can’t help wondering if they would be taken “more seriously” if they were whiter and male, Williams says. Making change happen Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a “wake-up call” for the company. “We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create,” she says. “We firmly believe that good ideas don’t come out of echo chambers.” Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be “demoralizing” to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. “We want to solve this for the long haul,” she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can’t understand why diversifying the industry’s workforce “seems to be such an intractable problem.” “I wonder if it is coming up against…the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special,” he says. “In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged.” The Associated Press Story Archive LEAVE A COMMENT Leave a Reply Cancel reply Discussion | 1 comment The Daily Republic does not necessarily condone the comments here, nor does it review every post.

In addition to major external design changes on the phone, there are rumors that internal features of the phone will also get overhauled. Now, a new report seems to suggest that the iPhone 8 will be sporting 5G wireless modules as well. According to Digitimes, wireless module vendors are set to start production of 5G wireless modules before the second half of 2017. At the moment, Intel and Qualcomm are one of the biggest producers of wireless modems for mobile applications. The two companies are also the ones responsible for supplying Apple with the wireless modules found on the iPhone. There is a chance that these 5G wireless modules will coincide with the release of the new flagship from Apple. According to the same report, Intel and Qualcomm will start releasing 5G wireless chips by the second half of 2017. If this happens, Apple might consider using the said chips on the iPhone 8 as tests on the system are already in place. Current iPhone 7 Plus line up (via apple.com) Although the business side of 5G networks will not start until 2018, AT&T has already started conducting 5G tests in its Austin offices. Last month, the telecom company announced that it has commenced the installation and testing of 5G wireless networks in Texas. At the moment, the test location is limited to its Austin offices. The new 5G wireless network boasts data transfer speeds of up to 14 Gbps. At this rate, 4K video streaming will be possible on mobile devices such as the iPhone or iPad. In fact, this is the main selling point the of G5 wireless technology. It may be that the practical applications of the 5G chips will not be realized until early 2018. However, knowing Apple, there is a very strong chance that a 5G option will be available on the iPhone 8. Apple is quite known in implementing up and coming technologies like it did for the MacBook Pro. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Eurocom Tornado F5 SE mobile server can eat desktops for lunch by Wayne Manion  11:30 AM on January 20, 2017 Eurocom's Tornado F5 SE looks like a standard desktop replacement-style laptop that you might find on a shelf in a big box electronics store. However, its unassuming all-black chassis hides hardware that's fairly unique in portable systems, and the company believes these bits give it the leeway to call the F5 a "mobile server." The eye of the Tornado is a choice among three Intel Xeon E3 v5 four-core, eight-thread Skylake-based CPUs. The processor communicates with the system's parts through an Intel C236 server chipset, which is certainly uncommon in laptops. Eurocom offers nine different Nvidia GeForce and Quadro graphics options, from the base Quadro M1000M up to a Pascal-based M5000M with 8GB of VRAM. The machine has four SODIMM slots for taking in up to 64GB of DDR4. While Xeon E3 CPUs offer support for ECC memory, Eurocom doesn't appear to show it as on option for the Tornado. Storage configurations include a host of devices for populating the machine's pair of M.2 slots and single 2.5" drive bay. The Tornado may appear compact when compared to a 1U server chasis, but the 15.6" x 10.7" x 1.6" (39 cm x 27 cm x 4 cm) dimensions and 6.5 lb (2.92 kg) weight are fairly substantial compared to many other laptops. That bulk is necessary to pack all the desktop-class parts and the 15.6" screen, which is available in 1920x1080 and 3840x2160 flavors. The F5 is not left wanting for connectivity options. The machine can drive up to four displays including the integrated panel. Gigabit Ethernet comes by way of a Qualcomm solution, and buyers get to choose between five different Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules. The laptop has a single Thunderbolt 3 port and three USB 3.0 Type-A connectors. While the CPU, chipset, and graphics options certainly make the Tornado sound like a server-class system, the lack of ECC support in the memory options chips away at Eurocom's "mobile server" claim a bit—as does the company's description of the laptop's battery as an "integrated UPS." The Eurocom Tornado F5 SE can be custom-configured right away. Prices start at $2,000 without an operating system. Virtually every aspect of the machine can be customized to the buyer's performance requirements, so the upper bound on pricing is sky-high.   Tags: Systems Mobile computing Servers Workstations User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

(Jeff Scheid/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @jeffscheid By NICOLE RAZ LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL Innovation has been and will continue to be the Governor’s Office of Economic Development’s top priority, Steve Hill told a crowd in Las Vegas on Tuesday. “Building an economy based on innovation is now critical,” Hill said to a crowd of about 1,900 at Cox Pavilion. Hill, who spearheads the governor’s economic development efforts, said it seems the speed of innovation is getting faster and faster. Hill moderated a panel devoted to innovation at Preview Las Vegas, the Metro Chamber of Commerce’s annual networking and forecasting event, with Brian Gaumer, director of test and development engineering at Hyperloop One, and Marcelina Ford, general manager of global programs and alliances at Intel Corp.’s Worldwide Corporate Affairs Group.   Gaumer said Hyperloop One is still on track to run a full test within the next few months at Apex in North Las Vegas, but he did not give a firm date. The test will be the first time the company will prove its technology and combine an autonomous vehicle with a linear motor, passive magnetic levitation and somewhat of an air vacuum using a tube. “Some of the technologies that we’re building into the DevLoop (development hyperloop) have been used in one way or another, but we are re-engineering them,” he said. “I wouldn’t be sitting here today if I didn’t believe it’s going to work.” Gaumer said speed is the name of the game, not just for the promise of the Hyperloop — which is slated to have cargo and passengers travel over 700 mph — but for running as a startup. Luckily, he joked that he is in the right city to get things done. “Contractors here are used to building unusual things very quickly,” he said. The exterior of the 500-kilometer tube that will be used in the full test is three-quarters completed, he said. “We’re starting to put hardware into the tube itself.” Ford spoke of the Internet of Things and how Intel is working to be a solutions provider for Smart Cities — cities that digitize things, like street lamps, in order to improve day-to-day operations like access to services or efficiency of transportation. Hill said the concept of smart cities is a “growing conversation here in Southern Nevada.” Ford said innovation of any kind is always deeply intertwined with workforce development and workforce participation. He said Intel is working to forge relationships with organizations and cities to further workforce training programs. “We’ll look forward to some of those partnerships here in Southern Nevada,” Ford also said. Hill emphasized that Southern Nevada needs to continue to advance and promote Nevada’s business and innovation-friendly environment to ensure that the state doesn’t fall behind. “Ccertainly if companies and industries don’t continue to innovate … they risk decline,” Hill said. “That is also true for regions and communities. We have been working over the past five or six years in order to drive the innovation in Southern Nevada.” Contact Nicole Raz at nraz@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4512.

Over one third (35 per cent) of the 13,000 parents that took part in the “New Family Dynamics in a Connected World” study now take physical steps to control and monitor how their children use tablets, smartphone and computers. This usually entails taking overall charge of a device and only giving their child access to it at set times during the day. Nearly one in four parents (23 per cent) said that they use software to help monitor how their children are using devices. However, the majority of parents are also ensuring that digital devices don’t become the only entertainment or distraction in the children’s lives. Some 48 per cent of respondents across the 14 countries and four continents included in the study say that they limit screen time to one-to-two hours a day, and a further 20 per cent cap exposure at less than one hour a day. However, even with attempting to put rules in place, devices are already changing household habits and 76 per cent of parents now allow their children to take an internet-connected device to bed. And because the smartphone and the tablet have become so ingrained in daily life, parents admit that they’re struggling to lead by example. Over one third (36 per cent) said that their children have “called them out” because they’re using a device when they should be engaged with the family. And while parents are for the most part getting proactive when it comes to when devices are used, respondents are still very much concerned about how children use them. Four in five parents (80 per cent) are understandably concerned about their kids unintentionally interacting with digital predators or cybercriminals, and 85 per cent say that they have already had a structured discussion with their children about online risks and sensible digital behaviour. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Battle of the digital butlers: Alexa takes on Siri (VIDEO) Apple joins group devoted to keeping AI nice In move to Facebook, Barra leaves unfinished expansion at Xiaomi How fat do cameras make you look?

(AAPL) Will Hike App Store Prices … Because Brexit? Facebook Inc (FB), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Shouldn’t Fear European Ruling View All Posts Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has been around for a very long time and it has been a mainstay in the technology industry, as well as one of the most recognized household names in consumer electronics since the late 1970s. INTC didn’t invent the computer, but it did develop a superior processor that was designed to be functional in almost any computer, regardless of who manufactured it. Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr With that, over nearly four decades, Intel has grown into a $173 billion company, giving early INTC stock investors returns in excess of 30,000%. The company went on to manufacture a growing number of microprocessors and other types of computer chips, which today are found in countless pieces of electronic hardware. It would seem that Intel stock has dusted off the old playbook, unveiling the Compute Card two weeks ago at CES 2017. The Compute Card, according to an INTC Newsroom press release, is intended to “transform the way compute and connectivity can be integrated and used in future devices.” If things turn out as planned for Intel, the Compute Card has the potential to become another virtually universal component that can be integrated into a gigantic — and constantly expanding — selection of consumer electronics. The Next Web believes that the Compute Card may have the potential to “revolutionize consumer technology by making your old — but still functional — tech feel ‘new’ again.” The 10 Biggest Companies You’ve Never Heard Of INTC describes the Compute Card as “a full computer, including Intel SOC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity.” It is being designed as a modular component to be a universal fit for all future smart tech containing a standard slot. The concept is surprisingly simple, yet extremely powerful. Manufacturers of smart devices will be able to stave off obsolescence and extend the lifespan of devices by making key components (i.e., processors, RAM and storage) upgradable via a new Compute Card from Intel. So, rather than compete in the Internet of Things race by attempting to design competitive end-user consumer products, INTC management is maintaining its B2B approach with the Compute Card, leveraging Intel’s formidable silicon development resources and facilities. What Does This Mean for Intel Stock Investors? Even before the unveiling of the Intel Compute Card, INTC stock has always been a relatively safe bet for the technology portion of your investment portfolio. Over the last year, Intel stock is up more than 15%, and over the past five years, it’s up more than 40%. The fact that INTC stock pays a dividend that currently yields more than 2.8%, and has a 20-year CAGR of nearly 22%, makes it a logical choice. For years, we’ve been hearing about the Internet of Things, and how today’s technology behemoths have been preparing for a worldwide battle for digital dominance and “smart” devices. However, the battle has already begun, whether you realize it or not; it has just been more of a slow evolution than a catastrophic explosion in the tech industry. Intel’s major advantage over possible competitors in the machine-to-machine arena is it long list of global partners such as Dell, HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ), Lenovo Group Limited (ADR) (OTCMKTS:LNVGY), and Sharp Corporation (ADR) (OTCMKTS:SHCAY). In addition, Intel is working with a range of regional partners like Seneca Data, InFocus Corporation, Contec DTx, TabletKiosk and Pasuntech.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Intel said to launch Skylake X and X299 in August Intel said to launch Skylake X and X299 in August Matthew Wilson 3 days ago CPU It looks like Intel’s next batch of enthusiast grade high-end processors will be heading our way this Summer as fresh rumours this week claim that Intel will be launching the X299 chipset and Skylake X processors in August. This particular rumour comes from sources speaking with BenchLife, which has been accurate with information about upcoming Intel CPUs in the past. However, this particular report suggests that the Skylake X launch could take place at Gamescom, which seems like an odd choice given how much Intel’s extreme edition CPUs cost. It seems more likely that Intel would launch Skylake X at Computex in June, or even at the Intel Developer Forum, which takes place between the 15th and 17th of August this year, which is pretty close to Gamescom. In terms of what to expect, Skylake X will likely retain the same lineup of CPUs as Broadwell-E, with a 10 core and 20 thread SKU sitting at the top of the pile, though hopefully without the current $1700 price tag. The eight core chip should also make an appearance, alongside two more affordable six core processors. KitGuru Says: This is going to be an interesting year for CPUs, with Kaby Lake, Skylake X and AMD’s Ryzen chips all hitting the market. Are any of you planning on upgrading your system this year?

In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that haven‚Äôt changed since. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) (File/Virginia Mayo/The Associated Press) Related Stories Calgary girl inspires with robotics after starting her own company The iPhone turns 10: How it revolutionized smartphones Why are all virtual assistants women?: Opinion The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. Want to increase workplace diversity? Go in 'blind,' says entrepreneur In 2014, two per cent of Googlers were black and three per cent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. 'The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified.' - Leslie Miley, Slack Tech companies themselves tend to blame a "pipeline problem," meaning a shortage of woman and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there's a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. "The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified," says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don't fit techie stereotypes aren't "Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough." Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. The industry is trying Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress, Intel acknowledges there is "a great deal of work to be done." Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Facebook offers training on "unconscious bias." (CBC) Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can't control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It's not enough to release diversity reports and say, "Oh, not a lot has changed, but it's the world, not us that's the problem," she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. Why it matters Diversity isn't just about fairness. It's about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products "will not appeal to a large population," says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface. One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other "expired," and the company said it won't put it back into circulation. Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece, Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise "we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future." Into the pipeline Some 11 per cent of computer science graduates were black and nine per cent were Hispanic in the 2013–14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only four per cent of Google's 2015 hires were black, and three per cent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than five per cent of hires were black and eight per cent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable.

Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs. (File/Mark Lennihan/The Associated Press) Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they're doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. When the culture doesn't fit Silicon Valley startups like to talk about "culture fit" — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate's attitude and behaviour meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they "hire what they know," says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. 'We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create.' - Nancy Lee, Google Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of "fit," although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like "competitive," "dominant" and "leader" can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on "unconscious bias" to combat the problem. But they don't make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can't help wondering if they would be taken "more seriously" if they were whiter and male, Williams says. Making change happen Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a "wake-up call" for the company. "We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create," she says. "We firmly believe that good ideas don't come out of echo chambers." Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be "demoralizing" to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. "We want to solve this for the long haul," she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can't understand why diversifying the industry's workforce "seems to be such an intractable problem." "I wonder if it is coming up against…the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special," he says. "In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged." © The Associated Press, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Top News Headlines 'I don't know how we can protect the victims': Domestic violence penalties rolled back in Russia 'Closing the door': Trump bars all Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. Do you recognize this Canadian WWII soldier?

They can’t help wondering if they would be taken “more seriously” if they were whiter and male, Williams says. ___ MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a “wake-up call” for the company. “We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create,” she says. “We firmly believe that good ideas don’t come out of echo chambers.” Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be “demoralizing” to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. “We want to solve this for the long haul,” she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can’t understand why diversifying the industry’s workforce “seems to be such an intractable problem.” “I wonder if it is coming up against…the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special,” he says. “In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged.” Like Us Follow @cdnbiz Subscribe with Texture Get our daily briefing on innovation, leadership, technology & the economy.

But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 per cent of Googlers were black and 3 per cent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter . Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies -- even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a "pipeline problem," meaning a shortage of woman and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there's a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. "The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified," says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don't fit techie stereotypes aren't "Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough." Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. ------ THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress, Intel acknowledges there is "a great deal of work to be done." Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can't control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It's not enough to release diversity reports and say, "Oh, not a lot has changed, but it's the world, not us that's the problem," she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. ------ WHY IT MATTERS Diversity isn't just about fairness. It's about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products "will not appeal to a large population," says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors -- such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: -- Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface . One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other "expired," and the company said it won't put it back into circulation. -- Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. -- Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise "we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future." ------ INTO THE PIPELINE Some 11 per cent of computer science graduates were black and 9 per cent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 per cent of Google's 2015 hires were black, and 3 per cent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 per cent of hires were black and 8 per cent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities -- and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they're doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead -- places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. ------ WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN'T FIT Silicon Valley startups like to talk about "culture fit" -- in theory, the question of whether a job candidate's attitude and behaviour meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they "hire what they know," says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of "fit," although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like "competitive," "dominant" and "leader," can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on "unconscious bias" to combat the problem. But they don't make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks -- and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can't help wondering if they would be taken "more seriously" if they were whiter and male, Williams says. ------ MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a "wake-up call" for the company. "We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create," she says. "We firmly believe that good ideas don't come out of echo chambers." Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be "demoralizing" to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. "We want to solve this for the long haul," she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can't understand why diversifying the industry's workforce "seems to be such an intractable problem." "I wonder if it is coming up against...the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special," he says. "In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged."

More than ever, companies from around the world are heavily investing in the future of self-driving automobiles. While … 2017 is the year of autonomous driving. More than ever, companies from around the world are heavily investing in the future of self-driving automobiles. While some automakers are at Level 1 or 2 on the scale of autonomous systems, others like Tesla have already deployed Level 3 systems on the road. BMW is currently delivering Level 2 driving-assistance systems which are rapidly seeing an improvement from one car to the next one. The G11/G12 7 Series is already 18 months behind the G30 5 Series which we’ve recently tested. But, as previewed at the 2017 CES, the next generation self-driving systems is just around the corner. This year, BMW will push forward with their autonomous driving plans by dispatching a fleet of autonomous vehicles to U.S. and European cities in this year’s second half, the next step in its partnership with Mobileye NV and Intel Corp. to introduce fully self-driving vehicles by 2021. The German automaker will put 40 of its 7 Series sedans on the road and train them to drive in urban areas, Klaus Froehlich, BMW’s head of development, said in an interview. The goal is to apply the gathered data toward producing the iNext, which will supplant the 7 Series as the BMW brand’s flagship model and be capable of full autonomy four years from now. This news follows the partnership that was announced between the BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye in July of last year. The companies have since developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to pursue state of the art designs and create differentiated brands. The offerings scale from individual key integrated modules to a complete end-to-end solution providing a wide range of differentiated consumer experiences. BMW will be following Uber Technologies Inc. and Volvo Cars in putting autonomous cars on the road, with the latter two companies partnering on test vehicles in Pittsburgh and Arizona. Other carmakers have been reluctant so far to heed BMW’s call for adopting its platform. Rival Daimler AG has said it prefers to develop its own technology.   “If everybody would use the same network, it will be best,” Froehlich said. “At the beginning, I think only premium cars will be able to afford such technology.”   Autonomous DrivingMobileyeself-driving cars Previous post Sparta Evolution presents their new lineup of GP-1 rotors for BMW cars Next post Ultra-fast charging network will challenge Tesla Superchargers RECOMMENDED FOR YOU BMW Board Member Ian Robertson talks about SUVs, diesels and Trump At the 2017 Detroit Auto Show, BMW board member Ian Robertson tackled head-on some of the most pressing issues in the cylinder building in Munich. … BMW’s Approach to Autonomous Driving is Refreshingly Prudent At this year’s CES, BMW showed off quite a few new technologies, including some freaky visions of the future of cabin technology.

Yet only 4 percent of Google's 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they're doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. ___ WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN'T FIT Silicon Valley startups like to talk about "culture fit" — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate's attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they "hire what they know," says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of "fit," although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like "competitive," ''dominant" and "leader," can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on "unconscious bias" to combat the problem. But they don't make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can't help wondering if they would be taken "more seriously" if they were whiter and male, Williams says. ___ MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a "wake-up call" for the company. "We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create," she says. "We firmly believe that good ideas don't come out of echo chambers." Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be "demoralizing" to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. "We want to solve this for the long haul," she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can't understand why diversifying the industry's workforce "seems to be such an intractable problem." "I wonder if it is coming up against...the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special," he says. "In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged." ___ Reach Barbara Ortutay on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BarbaraOrtutay .

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter . Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a "pipeline problem," meaning a shortage of women and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there's a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. "The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified," says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don't fit techie stereotypes aren't "Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough." Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. ___ THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress , Intel acknowledges there is "a great deal of work to be done." Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can't control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It's not enough to release diversity reports and say, "Oh, not a lot has changed, but it's the world, not us that's the problem," she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. ___ WHY IT MATTERS Diversity isn't just about fairness. It's about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products "will not appeal to a large population," says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: — Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface . One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other "expired," and the company said it won't put it back into circulation. — Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. — Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise "we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future." ___ INTO THE PIPELINE Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education.

Padoka or Oibaf PPA for Ubuntu Gaming? Tell Us Which One You Prefer and Why GO Ubuntu is the recommended Linux OS on Steam Jan 24, 2017 14:46 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Ubuntu gamers with older AMD Radeon or Intel graphics cards know by now that they have to install a third-party PPA (Personal Package Archive) that contains the latest open-source graphics drivers to enjoy a much better gaming experience. You know it! The best PPAs for Ubuntu gaming right now are Padoka and Oibaf, created and maintained by Paulo Miguel Dias and Fabio Pedretti, respectively. They offer us bleeding-edge Mesa 3D Graphics Library from Git, compiled against the latest development versions of LLVM 5.0 (Padoka) and LLVM 4.0 (Oibaf) compilers. Both of them are currently available for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) and Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) operating systems, they are updated two or three times per week, and provide us with some special features and optimized graphics drivers for our Ubuntu gaming needs, including OpenCL and AMDGCN/R600 support, and OpenGL 4.5 support for Intel Haswell. Which one do you use, with what GPU, and why? Padoka PPA also provides Vulkan support for both Radeon (RADV) and Intel (ANV) drivers (needed for some games), but while the Oibaf PPA tends to offer us a more stable experience, it would appear that many are using Padoka for its bleeding-edge features. After all, they both are considered "unstable." We are currently experimenting with the Padoka PPA on our Ubuntu machines, but we'd like to know which one you are using. Which games do you play on your Ubuntu computers with either of these advanced PPAs, and why do you prefer Oibaf over Padoka, or vice versa? We would also love if you could tell us which AMD Radeon or Intel graphics cards you're using right now for Ubuntu gaming and if you prefer to stay on the stable channel using the latest Mesa 13.0.3 3D Graphics Library (coming soon to Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10) from the Padoka Stable PPA. #Ubuntu#Linux#gaming#Padoka PPA#Oibaf PPA subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Qt 5.8 Massive Release Lets You Create Devices with Multiple UI Processes, More New Fedora 25 Linux ISO Respins Bring Linux Kernel 4.9.4, Latest Security Fixes HandBrake 1.0.2 Open-Source Video Transcoder Released for Linux, Mac and Windows Wine Staging Devs Add Direct3D 11 Graphics Enhancements in the Last RC Build Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast Let’s Chat: With or Without an Antivirus in Windows 10?

Hire a celebrity. At this year's Super Bowl on February 5, viewers will be treated to ads featuring movie stars, pop icons and sportsmen. And if last year's ad spend is anything to go by, it could cost brands almost $380 million. CNBC takes a look at the marketing efforts associating their brands with famous faces. Justin Timberlake and Bai Brands Getty Images Justin Timberlake Drinks company Bai Brands announced last week that pop star Justin Timberlake, its "chief flavor officer," would star in its 30-second Super Bowl ad to air during the first half of the game. The company won't be revealing the ad before the event, but Ben Weiss, founder and chief executive of Bai said in an emailed statement: "Justin has been working closely with our team on several new projects and we are excited to see them all come to life in 2017. This is just the beginning." The ad was developed by an in-house team led by chief creative officer Chad Portas. In November 2016, the Dr Pepper Snapple Group agreed to buy Bai Brands for $1.7 billion. Minnie Driver and Lexus Lexus unveiled its 60-second "Man and Machine" Super Bowl commercial on Monday, which features street dancer Lil Buck in a spot that "recognizes the parallels between the shapes and movements of the human form and the power and athleticism of Lexus' most premium models," according to an online statement. It also revealed a new global tagline, "Experience Amazing," voiced by actor Minnie Driver. John Malkovich and Squarespace Squarespace continues its partnership with actor John Malkovich, who launched his fashion website on the platform, in a 60-second pre-game commercial as well as a 30-second spot within the game itself, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC.com via email. Previously, Squarespace has featured comedians Key and Peele (2016) and actor Jeff Bridges (2015), and ran its first commercial in the big game in 2014, which it made in-house. Squarespace worked with creative collective John x Hannes on this year's commercial. Melissa McCarthy and Kia "Ghostbusters" actor Melissa McCarthy is set to star in a 60-second spot for its new hybrid, the Kia Niro, airing in the third quarter of the Super Bowl, it said in an online statement. Two 15-second ads by agency David&Goliath launched last week, narrated by the actor, and a short big game teaser ad showing her being chased by something out of shot launched Monday. Last year, Kia featured Christopher Walken and a sock puppet in its 60-second ad during the Super Bowl. Adam Driver and Snickers The "Girls" and "Star Wars" star will feature in the Mars-owned chocolate brand's Super Bowl ad, continuing its "You're not you when you're hungry" theme, it said in an online statement. This is the fifth time NFL sponsor Snickers has advertised during the big game, following its 2010 debut with the then 88 year-old actor Betty White. This year's spot is by agency BBDO New York. Tom Brady and Intel Intel launched its 30-second Super Bowl ad on January 12, starring quarterback Tom Brady. The "Brady Everyday" spot highlights Intel's 360 replay technology, which will also be used during the game, the company said in an online statement. The technology lets broadcasters "pause" parts of the game and view it from different angles, and viewers will also be able to get a view from the field with Intel's "Be the player" technology. George Takei and Pizza Hut Noam Galai | Getty Images Actor George Takei at the Star Trek: The Star Fleet Academy Experience in 2016 The pizza brand has been a pre-game sponsor for more than 10 years, and this year's campaign will feature George Takei, best known for his role as "Star Trek's" Hikaru Sulu, in a spot by Droga5 New York, the agency told CNBC.com via email. Last year, Pizza Hut sold nearly $12 million in food ordered online or via mobile on Super Bowl Sunday. Take-out is big business during the game, with around 48 million Americans ordering it for each Super Bowl, according to the National Restaurant Association. Lady Gaga and Pepsi This year, Pepsi will promote its zero sugar variant during the Super Bowl's halftime show, which Lady Gaga will headline, according to an article on NFL's website. The soft drinks brand has launched a competition for fans to be guests at the performance, Lady Gaga's second at the event. More than 116.5 million viewers watched the halftime show in 2016, according to the NFL. Jason Statham, Gal Gadot and Wix Website-builder Wix launched its 60-second big game commercial on YouTube last week, starring "The Expendables" actor Jason Statham and "Wonder Woman" star Gal Gadot, who fend off various attackers in a restaurant, as unwitting chef Felix dons headphones and works on his new website.

Over one third (35%) of the 13,000 parents that took part in the "New Family Dynamics in a Connected World" study now take physical steps to control and monitor how their children use tablets, smartphone and computers. This usually entails taking overall charge of a device and only giving their child access to it at set times during the day. Nearly one in four parents (23%) said that they use software to help monitor how their children are using devices. However, the majority of parents are also ensuring that digital devices don't become the only entertainment or distraction in the children's lives. Some 48% of respondents across the 14 countries and four continents included in the study say that they limit screen time to one-to-two hours a day, and a further 20% cap exposure at less than one hour a day. However, even with attempting to put rules in place, devices are already changing household habits and 76% of parents now allow their children to take an internet-connected device to bed. And because the smartphone and the tablet have become so ingrained in daily life, parents admit that they're struggling to lead by example. Over one third (36%) said that their children have "called them out" because they're using a device when they should be engaged with the family. And while parents are for the most part getting proactive when it comes to when devices are used, respondents are still very much concerned about how children use them. Four in five parents (80%) are understandably concerned about their kids unintentionally interacting with digital predators or cybercriminals, and 85% say that they have already had a structured discussion with their children about online risks and sensible digital behavior.

Image Credit: Reuters / Mike Blake For every basic iPhone 7 it sells for $649, Apple pays about $15 to Qualcomm in royalties for using the mobile chip maker’s patented wireless technology, according to analysts. Apple pays slightly more in royalties for the higher-end $749 and even more on $849 iPhones, based on their higher prices. According to its lawsuit against Qualcomm last week and from other recent regulatory cases, Apple may even pay the same royalty rates—or more—for iPhones that don’t use Qualcomm chips. After a five-year exclusivity agreement with Qualcomm expired last year, Apple began using competing wireless modem chips from Intel in about half of its newest iPhones. But Qualcomm seeks royalties under the assumption that any wireless modem chip is relying on many of its related patents. The somewhat convoluted Qualcomm licensing scheme, in practice, used calculations and discounts related to the cost of making the iPhone along with payments to and from Apple manufacturers like Foxconn (see graphic below). They also involved Qualcomm giving back what Apple characterizes as quarterly rebates tied to other contractual restrictions. Part of why Apple sued now appears to be that Qualcomm started withholding those rebates last fall that add up about $1 billion. Whatever the case, the royalty arrangement has been incredibly lucrative for Qualcomm. Last year its royalty licensing division reported $6.5 billion of pretax profit on $7.6 billion of revenue. Meanwhile, the company’s chip business itself only made $1.8 billion in pretax profit on $15.4 billion of sales. Now, with lawsuits filed last week by the Federal Trade Commission and Apple along with a nearly $1 billion fine from the Korea Fair Trade Commission last month, that royalty strategy is under attack. Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon called it “a direct assault on the basic structure of Qualcomm’s licensing business model.” Though the legal battles are just now topping the headlines, Apple and other large smart phone makers like Samsung appear to have seen an opening to hit the Qualcomm model after China cracked down on the chipmaker’s allegedly monopolistic practices two years ago, imposing a $975 million fine and forcing new negotiations with device makers. The core of the new attack from Apple and the FTC is aimed at Qualcomm’s practice of charging royalties based on a device’s total value, as opposed to just the value of the mobile chips inside the device. That means whenever a smart phone maker adds more to a phone, whether for additional storage, an improved camera or a new hardware feature, Qualcomm gets a higher royalty. Qualcomm has also strengthened its bargaining position by seeking royalties from smart phone makers instead of the companies that make the component mobile chipsets that go in phones. Typically, companies that make other parts inside smart phones unrelated to Qualcomm’s patents, such as graphics chips or audio decoders, license any relevant patents themselves and pay the royalties directly to the patent owners. The cost of the licensing is based on the price of the particular component, not the overall phone price. By refusing to make deals directly with mobile chipmakers and forcing smartphone makers to engage, Qualcomm gained the ability to impose other conditions, conditions that Apple and regulators say thwarted competition—like Apple’s now expired agreement to use only Qualcomm chips in the iPhone for five years. Qualcomm rejected Intel, Samsung and others when they sought patent licenses directly to cover mobile chipsets they planned to manufacture, the FTC said in its complaint. And Qualcomm also can make it financially difficult for competing chipmakers to displace its chips, because smart phone makers apparently have to pay patent royalties to Qualcomm regardless of which company makes the chips. That’s the move that the Federal Trade Commission dubbed a “tax” by Qualcomm on all cellphones. Above: In its lawsuit against Qualcomm, Apple included a diagram of the complex web of payments around the mobile patent royalties it pays. Source: Apple lawsuit Qualcomm says that its practices have been misrepresented by Apple and others that are merely seeking to pay less for its valuable technology. “Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program,” Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement that went on to accuse Apple of instigating regulatory investigations worldwide. And any chipmaker can choose to incorporate Qualcomm’s patented technologies as long as the phone maker who buys the chips has a licensing agreement, the company argues. Apple did not respond to a request for comment beyond its lawsuit. Intel declined to comment. The various disputes may come down to how the courts decide to interpret the rules for patents that become part of essential technological standards. Qualcomm says it has thousands of patents that underlie the basic wireless network standards adopted by mobile carriers, telecom equipment makers, and smartphone manufacturers. As part of the standards process, companies that contribute patented technologies are supposed to agree to license those rights on “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory” terms. Apple and the regulators argue that Qualcomm’s device-level royalties in effect constitute discrimination, because the makers of cheaper smartphones pay far less for access to the same rights as the maker of a high-end device. But after finding Qualcomm in violation of its antitrust rules, China’s regulators have since allowed the company to go forward with a 3.5% to 5% per device fee, after certain discounts. To the chipmaker, that’s a vindication of the general approach even for patents involved in industry standards. Apple says Qualcomm offered it the Chinese solution but it rejected the deal as still unfair. Qualcomm’s stock, which had largely weathered the recent regulatory attacks, plummeted 12% on Monday after Rasgon and other analysts highlighted the seriousness of Apple’s lawsuit. Now it will be up to the courts to decide whether the company’s highly profitable–and controversial–licensing model can live on. This story originally appeared on Fortune.com.

Once again, this year, we'll be heading to Computex to catch up on all the latest hardware from the PC industry - however, we already know of a couple of products that won't be making that release window. Intel's Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processors are going to miss the show, and are now likely to be released in August, at least. Tech site Guru3D had the news, and reports that the delay could be linked to Intel working on increased performance of the CPUs' cache.  Skylake-X comes in ten, eight, and six-core flavours, while Kaby Lake-X is a quad-core part.

Qualcomm and Intel are expected to launch chipset solutions for 5G equipment supporting 28GHz frequency band in the second half of 2017, while Samsung Electronics is also likely to release comparable chips during the same period, said the sources. Intel, Qualcomm, Samsung and HiSilicon Technologies are also expected to release chips for 3.5GHz frequency band, added the sources, noting that the 28GHz and 3.5GHz are the two frequency bands to be available for 5G services. Meanwhile, Qualcomm, MediaTek and Spreadtrum Communications will compete for the 5G chipset solution orders for smartphones, as Apple, Samsung and Huawei will also roll out their own smartphone-use 5G chips. Smartphone solution vendors may also begin to use 14-16 nm process nodes to fabricate their chips for the entry-level and mid-range smartphones later in 2017, instead of the 28nm process being used currently, said the sources. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung are expected to start producing high-end smartphone chips using an advanced 7nm process in 2018, but it remains to be seen how big the high-end solution market would be in the future.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 26 January 2017 | MYT 6:00 AM An eBook at bedtime: families and connected devices Ingrained in them: Over three quarters of parents let their children take a device to bed. — AFP Relaxnews New Intel research shows that parents are finally waking up to the risks of leaving their children to navigate the digital world unsupervised and are taking their kids' mobile device use in hand. Over one third (35%) of the 13,000 parents that took part in the "New Family Dynamics in a Connected World" study now take physical steps to control and monitor how their children use tablets, smartphone and computers. This usually entails taking overall charge of a device and only giving their child access to it at set times during the day. Nearly one in four parents (23%) said that they use software to help monitor how their children are using devices. However, the majority of parents are also ensuring that digital devices don't become the only entertainment or distraction in the children's lives. Some 48% of respondents across the 14 countries and four continents included in the study say that they limit screen time to one-to-two hours a day, and a further 20% cap exposure at less than one hour a day. However, even with attempting to put rules in place, devices are already changing household habits and 76% of parents now allow their children to take an Internet-connected device to bed. And because the smartphone and the tablet have become so ingrained in daily life, parents admit that they're struggling to lead by example. Over one third (36%) said that their children have "called them out" because they're using a device when they should be engaged with the family. And while parents are for the most part getting proactive when it comes to when devices are used, respondents are still very much concerned about how children use them. Four in five parents (80%) are understandably concerned about their kids unintentionally interacting with digital predators or cybercriminals, and 85% say that they have already had a structured discussion with their children about online risks and sensible digital behaviour. — AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Chinese Lunar New Year ticket snatching apps raise hackles Facebook Stories takes a hint from Snapchat Twitter adds 'explore' to make finding tweets easier Bring cheer to the underprivileged this festive season Go purple this CNY if you want to get lucky in love Six simple steps to feng shui your home Others Also Read Ponkan oranges choice of the season Singing out strong for a night out Pacesetting Rose blooms as Woods fades at Torrey Pines advertisement Latest News China turns to blockchain to make markets clearer and cleaner Coming soon: Robot DoorDash deliveries PayPal outlook muted on mobile competition, currency trends Alphabet posts strong revenue growth, higher taxes hit earnings Russian security service says hackers attacked major banks in 2016 Most Viewed in Tech China turns to blockchain to make markets clearer and cleaner Chinese Lunar New Year ticket snatching apps raise hackles Coming soon: Robot DoorDash deliveries China girlfriend rental app gets leg up from Lunar New Year demand STMicro to supply iPhone 8 parts?

A look back at Dow’s monthly performance since its inception in 1896. By Ramon Padilla, Jim Sergent, Adam Shell USA TODAY Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed over the 20,000 mark for the first time after at the opening bell. (Photo: Andrew Gombert, EPA) 197 CONNECTTWEET 9 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO — Silicon Valley may shudder at the prospect of a Trump Administration, but so far it's prospering since he was elected president. In the Dow's rocket ride to a record 20,000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq rallied to a record, too: It topped 5,656, closing up 1% at a record. USA TODAY Dow hits all-time high, cracks 20,000 for the first time ever Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, IBM and Netflix have helped propel the record-setting surge for tech stocks. Their stocks are up between 5% and 15% since the Nov. 8 election, with several trading near 52-week highs. On the price-weighted Dow, where stocks with higher per-share prices do more of the heavy lifting and the tech sector leans toward older, hardware-oriented companies, components Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, IBM, Apple had a mixed showing. While IBM and Apple had double-digit runs, Cisco is slightly lower than it was on Election Day. IBM, whose CEO Ginni Rometty was named as an early business adviser to Pres. Trump's transition team, is responsible for 9% of the Dow’s run of more than 1,700 points since Nov. 8.  iPhone maker Apple has contributed 4% of the recent surge and Microsoft 1.3%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. Tech investors so far have bought into Trump's aggressive agenda to goose the economy with a lower corporate tax rate and in anticipation of repatriation, which would let companies bring back cash held overseas at lower rates. The market is also benefiting from expectations for forthcoming earnings results during what is traditionally the tech industry's strongest quarter. Alphabet and Microsoft are scheduled to report quarterly sales on Thursday. Apple is scheduled to announce its results on Jan. 31, and Facebook on Feb. 1. Early results are promising. Shares of Yahoo rose 3.5% Tuesday, a day after it reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue and said the sale of its core internet business to Verizon for $4.8 billion should be completed in the second quarter. Netflix shares hit a record after strong international subscriber growth. FindTheCompany | Graphiq The market momentum comes with a healthy dose of irony: The tech industry is heavily at odds with Trump's "America First" economic policies for restrictive immigration and a push for more manufacturing jobs in the U.S. On Monday, he threatened a "major" border tax for non-U.S. based manufactured good imports in a meeting with a dozen top executives, including Michael Dell, founder of PC giant Dell, and Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Trump also has vowed to help business with a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 15% from 35% and deregulation of "at least 75%." Tech analysts expect the wild ride to continue for several quarters, but may not be sustainable. "There are near-term positives, but there is a danger of a long-term crash once some of the policies that tech objects to are in place," says Matt Eastwood, an analyst for market researcher IDC.

Trump reportedly plans on limiting U.S. entry for refugees and others from several Middle Eastern countries, and is expected to sign an executive order as soon as Thursday. “Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump to speak with Putin, other world leaders Saturday Trump orders publication of stats on terror-linked crime by foreign nationals Warren goes on tweetstorm over refugee ban MORE’s race to violate constitutional principles and fundamental American values by targeting Muslims and immigrants is of tremendous concern,” Khan said in a statement Wednesday. "His expected executive orders on refugees and visas are a disturbing first step toward banning Muslims from entering our country." ADVERTISEMENT “Trump didn’t just threaten a Muslim ban, he promised this on the campaign trail, and it is incumbent on every single American to speak out against Trump’s actions today and every further step he and his administration may take to discriminate against Muslims.” Trump is purportedly planning an executive order that will halt and then shrink refugee admissions, place a short-term ban on allowing foreigners to enter the U.S. from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, and pause the issuance of visas to certain countries. Reuters reported Tuesday the refugee ban will remain intact until the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security can improve and intensify the refugee vetting process. Trump promised “extreme vetting” of immigrants from countries associated with terrorism during his 2016 presidential campaign in an effort to prevent terrorist attacks.  The then-GOP nominee also suggested a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S. early on in his campaign — which he later toned down — and previously floated implementing a national registry of Muslims. His team has said that he has never proposed tracking people based on their religion.  Khan garnered national attention after a passionate speech during last summer’s Democratic National Convention about his son, Humayun Khan, a U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq in 2004. Khan waved his pocket copy of the Constitution and fiercely denounced Trump’s rhetoric about Muslims. Tags Donald Trump, Immigration, refugees, Muslims, Politics   View the discussion thread.

ADATA XPG SX8000 M.2 2280 256GB PCI-Express 3.0 x4 MLC Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) ASX8000NP-256GM-C Ships from United States. Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A XPG SX8000 PCIe Gen3x4 M.2 2280 Solid State Drive Supercharge into new SSD frontiers Packing impressive performance, enhanced data security, high durability and great reliability into an ultra-compact M.2 2280 form factor, the ADATA XPG SX8000 internal solid state drive is the ultimate choice for gaming notebooks and high-end desktops. Utilizing the super-fast PCIe Gen3x4 interface, the SX8000 reaches extremely high speeds of up to 2500/1100MB per second (read/write)*, which outperforms SATA 6Gb/s by a huge margin – several times over, in fact! NVMe 1.2 qualified, the SX8000 delivers superior random read/write performance and multi-tasking capabilities. With support for SLC Caching, DRAM Cache Buffer and LDPC ECC technologies, the SX8000 maintains optimized performance and data integrity during even the most intense gaming, rendering, overclocking, or other high-demand applications. Plus, the high-quality SX8000 implements 3D NAND Flash, providing higher storage density and reliability compared to 2D NAND. It’s available in 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB. Blazing Fast PCIe Gen3x4 Designed for gaming, overclocking, and graphics rendering, the SX8000 is perfect for applications that rely on superior storage performance. It is an ideal solution for high-end systems, leveraging the super-fast PCIe Gen3x4 interface to provide stunning read/write speeds up to 2500/1100MB per second*. This is nearly four times faster than SATA 6Gb/s for read and over twice faster for write. The compact M.2 2280 form factor means users can easily install the SX8000 in gaming notebooks and desktop PCs with no messy cables or dedicated power leads. The SX8000 supports the latest Intel platforms, helping gamers and overclockers get the most out of their systems. NVMe 1.2 Certified Meeting NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory express) revision 1.2 requirements, the SX8000 goes beyond high sequential throughput to excellent random performance and multi-tasking. Whether gaming, rendering, or overclocking, the SX8000 helps maintain system stability even under the most data-hungry conditions. 3D NAND Flash - Higher Capacity and Reliability Thanks to the flexibility of 3D NAND, the SX8000 M.2 2280 SSD comes in available in diverse capacities, ranging from 128GB to 1TB while keeping its compact form factor. Moreover, 3D NAND outperforms 2D NAND and offers higher efficiency and reliability. All SX8000 models provide high TBW (Total Bytes Written), meaning the number of times an SSD can write its entire capacity in one lifespan. The SX8000 has a TBW rating that outranks comparable models, indicating a longer-lasting SSD. Intelligent SLC Caching and DRAM Cache Buffer Intelligent SLC Caching allows NAND Flash memory to operate in single-level cell mode and boosts read/write performance. In addition, with support for DRAM Cache Buffer, read/write performance can be as much as double that of solid state drives that lack a DRAM cache, or in other words that can't use system memory as an SSD buffer for high intensity tasks. LDPC ECC Engine for High Durability LDPC (low density parity check) error correcting code has been implemented on the SX8000, leading to a massive reduction in data errors and an equal increase in data integrity. It protects your valuable content against corruption to a much greater extent than non-ECC SSDs or even SSDs that use basic BCH error correction. In addition, the SX8000 has a program/erase cycle three times longer than standard SSDs due to incorporating native hard and soft decode. Together, these ensure improved durability and a longer SSD lifespan. RAID Engine and Data Shaping for Enhanced Protection By supporting RAID Engine and Data Shaping, the SX8000 ensures data integrity and delivers extended SSD lifespan for better, longer-lasting stability and return on investment. You get an SSD able to fine-tune workload and stress balancing while easily integrating in storage arrays with a high degree of protection and privacy assurance. Great Reliability The SX8000 is made using the finest 3D NAND Flash and custom ADATA circuitry and boards. Every component passes meticulous screening, testing, and certification, ensuring maximum reliability. Choose from Two Versions The SX8000 SSD is available in two unique flavors. The original release and a just-added version with a custom heatsink bearing the cool XPG logo and distinctive design. Both deliver breathtaking performance via PCIe Gen 3 x4 in M.2 2280, and together allow more creativity for your desktop or notebook builds. Note: *Performance may vary based on SSD capacity, host hardware and software, operating system, and other system variables.

Collins, opinion contributor - 01/25/17 05:00 PM EST 32   © Getty As President Trump welcomes UK Prime Minister Theresa May to the White House this Friday, his speechwriters should take note. Just last week, May delivered what may be one of the best economic policy speeches of this decade. It was widely lauded in the financial press and the currency markets pushed the pound up 3 percent relative to the dollar. ADVERTISEMENT May’s peroration had the type of moving, even brilliant, rhetoric that May’s forerunner, Winston Churchill, used to move the people of Britain to seemingly impossible tasks.   May’s speech, for example, contained this gem: “(History) will … judge us not only by the decision that we made, but by what we made of that decision.” President Trump’s speech writers have yet to manifest that kind of skill at their craft. But it’s not just the president’s writing staff who should look to May. He should look to borrow some of the prime minister’s policy and political skills, too, particularly her skill at confronting adversaries without being petulant. Theresa May to meet Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump to speak with Putin, other world leaders Saturday Trump orders publication of stats on terror-linked crime by foreign nationals Warren goes on tweetstorm over refugee ban MORE on Friday - White House - BBC News https://t.co/spmSkNglR4 #BreakingNews pic.twitter.com/VomIkRaVvi— Sky News Feed ⓥ (@SkyNewsFeed) January 22, 2017 Prime Minister May’s speech, delivered on January 17, delineated twelve principles she will pursue in negotiating Brexit under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, and made clear that certain positions are "non- negotiable". EU “hard liners” were cautioned that if they succeeded in the talks, the UK could respond with “beggar thy neighbor” tax and industrial policies “that would attract the world's best companies and biggest investors”, at the expense of Britain’s EU counterparts. Any agreed negotiation, May said, would be brought for vote for approval by Parliament, so that it was assured widespread national political support. Brexit wasn’t to be a retrenchment or an exit from the global economy, the prime minister assured the markets. To the contrary, she hopes to renew and expand the UK’s globalist and trading tradition that dates to the 16th Century. May made clear that, while closing a window to the EU, she will open a door to the world: "I want to remove as many barriers to trade as possible. "And I want Britain to be free to establish our own tariff schedules at the World Trade Organization, meaning we can reach new trade agreements, not just with the European Union, but with old friends and new allies from outside Europe too.” Speaking to education and immigration, May said she would “will go further to reform our schools to ensure every child has the knowledge and the skills they need to thrive in post-Brexit Britain.” I want this United Kingdom to emerge from this period of change stronger, fairer, more united and more outward-looking than ever before. pic.twitter.com/WDR48wLzBF— Theresa May (@theresa_may) January 17, 2017 Most importantly for Britain, May promised the EU and UK stability and certainty by continuing to abide EU law as though it was UK law, as I predicted shortly after the Brexit vote. President Trump can take some lessons from Prime Minister May. First, Trump should clarify that his protectionism is a tactic to advance fair trade, not an end in itself. May moved to assure the markets that she would continue EU rules while warning Brussels that a hard line on Brexit would have consequences.   Trump’s aversion that “protection (of jobs, products and companies) will lead to great prosperity and strength” and that “we will follow two simple rules: buy American and hire American” should be clarified so it echoes Peter Navarro, Trump’s leading trade advisor, who has written that protectionist tariffs are only a tactic in pursuit of global free trade, not an effort to close America off from the world. Second, ensure that the Trump administration trade policy is supported by Congress by passing a “model” trade treaty to serve as a baseline of US trade treaty negotiations. Just as Prime Minister May will submit her Brexit deal for Parliamentary support, President Trump should move to have Congress adopt a “model” trade treaty setting forth our principles on trade to restore the voice it has mostly lost with trade promotion authority – or “fast track”. Fair trading nations will welcome the clarity of our position while mercantilist countries will know we’re closed to their exploitation and come to heel. Moreover, it will give the president a baseline for what Congress “is” and “is not” likely to support.   Third, President Trump should emphasize that his trade policy is about protecting workers, not “jobs.” Like May, President Trump should ensure that American youngsters – particularly in the inner cities and rural areas – obtain a sound, rigorous, high school education on par with the best of our global competitors to ensure they can adopt to a lifetime of changing skill sets instead of just “a job.” He should support employer training and apprenticeships – common in Europe – among workers of every age, along with worker mobility (largely discouraged by delays in benefits coverage, costly non-deductible expenses for moving, and over-broad non-compete agreements), remote work and dependent contractors so that workers can more easily escape the limits of their wage and geography and even work for themselves. Oscar Wilde wrote that Britain had “everything in common with America, … except, of course, language.” With Britain at the precipice of Brexit negotiations, and the United States with the first populist president in living memory, we are more closely tied than we have been in decades, in both our policies and our politics. Britain’s prime minister can provide lessons in both. J.G. Collins is the Managing Director of the Stuyvesant Square Consultancy in New York.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jan 25, 2017 at 3:41PM Image source: Apple. "Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands. And your plan is to blackmail this person?" -- Lucius Fox, The Dark Knight In Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008), an accountant discovers Batman's true identity by uncovering some accounting irregularities at Wayne Enterprises, but imaginary CEO Lucius Fox quickly puts an end to the blackmailer's plan by pointing out how absurd it is. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) may not have been blackmailing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) all these years, but Apple thinks Qualcomm is guilty of a similar crime: extortion. In its U.S. lawsuit filed last week, Apple alleges that Qualcomm "attempted to extort Apple" into changing how it responded to a regulatory antitrust investigation in South Korea. The iPhone maker also argues that it has been paying "extortion-level royalties" for years, due to Qualcomm's "no license, no chips" policy where Qualcomm would only sell chips to customers that agreed to onerous licensing terms. It seems as if Qualcomm has been getting away with this for years, which is why its market power has grown so dramatically as rivals fell by the wayside and exited the baseband processor market. Most customers lack the operating scale, legal resources, and financial incentive to effectively stand up to Qualcomm through protracted litigation. Apple doesn't. Apple bites back So let me get this straight, Qualcomm: You think that your biggest customer, one of the wealthiest, most powerful corporations in the world that also has a reputation for squeezing its suppliers would quietly accept your oppressive contract terms and never fight back. And your plan is to extort this company? In no uncertain terms, it worked for many years, and Qualcomm's revenue skyrocketed over the past decade. QCOM Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Broader smartphone adoption was the main factor, but the iPhone pulled an awful lot of that weight, too -- both directly and indirectly (Android was created largely in response to the iPhone). More specifically, from 2011 to late 2016, Qualcomm had extracted both exclusivity in supplying Apple with cellular baseband modems as well as its silence. You may note in the chart above how much sales increased during this time period. Apple was restricted from actively complaining to law enforcement and regulators, although it was allowed to respond if asked. So long as Qualcomm maintained its lock on baseband chipsets, it had incredible leverage and there wasn't a whole lot Apple could do. Enter Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel had been trying to crack the baseband market for years with little to no success. Even today, Intel's modems are technologically inferior to Qualcomm's, but they're good enough and much cheaper, and Intel expects to catch up within a few generations. The combination of Qualcomm's exclusivity ending combined with Intel's ability to supply a sufficiently competitive modem is the perfect storm for Apple to unleash its pent-up discontent in court. The $1 billion that Qualcomm is withholding was just the final straw. Now that Apple has a path to an alternative supplier (even though the majority of its basebands still come from Qualcomm) and is no longer contractually obligated to keep quiet, Apple is bringing a brutal suit against Qualcomm that threatens Qualcomm's very business model. You know it's serious when Apple is litigating, given CEO Tim Cook's hatred of litigation. Did Qualcomm really think that Apple would never retaliate? The moral of the story: Don't extort Apple, and don't blackmail Batman. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Qualcomm.

Whether it is at some level of government, or in the commercial or residential sectors, this country depends on the men and women that make up the legions of field service personnel that repair and maintain the nation's infrastructure. Rugged computers, whether notebooks or tablets, make it possible for these individuals to successfully work outside – literally and figuratively – away from an office. They provide versatility and mobility. And most importantly, they are designed and built to operate in environments that commercial computers would never survive. GammaTech provides the field service industry with one of the best lines of rugged computers – the DURABOOK. DURABOOK has long been a trusted name, resource, and partner within the industry. Its well-known reliability and ruggedness make it the ideal choice for field service applications. Further setting DURABOOK apart from its competitors is its ability to provide more advanced configurations and offer a more complete solution through its famed customization program.  "DURABOOK rugged computers come survival tested to withstand the daily doses of drops, bumps, moisture, dust and other aspects of working in the field," stated Tom Wang, GammaTech president. "They easily handle those bumpy rides over tortuous roads and paths that pass as roads. They work effortlessly in challenging harsh environments. They don't sweat the heat or turn numb in the bitter cold. They are an indispensable necessity for any field services job that requires working in inhospitable environments." Wang specifically mentioned three DURABOOK models that are ideal for the field services industry: the rugged R11 tablet, and the rugged SA14 and S15AB notebooks. Each, he said, offers the functionality, durability, capability, and mobility necessary for field service workers to do their jobs. Functionality The R11 features a dual RFID option that provides a wider user scenario as well as more productivity and flexibility. A special reader board offers a feature set that supports both low and high frequency technologies simultaneously. Its native CCID (Circuit Card Interface Device) implementation supports Windows®, LINUX®, and Mac® operating systems, eliminating the need to install special drivers. The R11 also has the ability to support 1D/2D barcode scanning with higher resolution and reading ability, immensely increasing productivity. It has a class-leading motion tolerance of 400 in/s that delivers a distinct performance advantage, resulting in snappier scans and less hassle. Its highly visible and safe LED-based aimer is ideal for customer-facing applications. Backlit keyboards and sunlight-readable displays, found on R11 and SA14, are especially welcomed by field services workers operating in bright sunlight or under glaring-lighting indoors. Durability All three models meet MIL-STD-810G rating, which assures shock, drop and vibration protection, as well as the ability to withstand use in a wide range of temperatures. They also have various IP ratings to ensure there is no water and dust intrusion. The R11 also carries an ANSI ISA Standard 12.12.01 certification, meaning it is fit for use in hazardous locations. In other words, they all come survival tested and ready for action. Capability The advanced Intel CPU included in SA14 ensures top-notch field performance by providing 10% more CPU performance and a huge 22% increase in memory performance as well as 1.5 hours longer battery life. It also includes Intel® HD Graphics 520 that features ultra-low-voltage power consumption, a significant improvement compared to Intel HD 4000. The unit's Advanced DDR4 represents more efficiency and more speed than DDR3, using up to 20% less power while being twice as fast. Mobility Mobility is a key ingredient in a rugged computer. After all, if the unit cannot be easily taken to the worksite and be able to function as a computer in an office setting does, it isn't much good. The SA14 offers the latest Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chip and dedicated GPS software, and support LTE high-speed wireless communications to provide real-time information exchange between the worker in the field and other locations. Both R11 and SA14 also offer vehicle and dock options that support RF pass through for seamless work as it happens. Weight is also a prime consideration when selecting rugged computers for field services endeavors. Both the R11 and S15AB are the lightest models in their respective categories: R11 is just 2.7 pounds, and the S15AB is only 5.7 pounds, despite having a large 15.6" display. Availability GammaTech's DURABOOK rugged computers for the field services industry are available through authorized resellers nationwide and at www.GammaTechUSA.com. All three models are covered by the DURABOOK Peace of Mind (POM) three-year warranty. As with all GammaTech products, these also may be customized to customer specifications.

Pioneer has announced the first drives to be made available for PCs, which are due out in Japan at the end of next month. The BDR-S11J-BK and higher-end BDR-S11J-X have been confirmed for release outside of Japan yet. The drives are likely to carry a premium pricing, but users will also need a pretty jacked-up PC to facilitate them. PC owners will need a Windows 10 machine running the Intel Kaby Lake i5/i7 processors and at least 6GB RAM (via Myce). There’s also the need for a 4K monitor (preferably with HDR support) with HDMI 2.0a and HDCP 2.2 support. Related: Ultra HD Blu-ray - Complete guide to 4K movies Anyone wishing to use these drives will also need to install the CyberLink PowerDVD, which will ship with the drive. While there are some standalone 4K Blu-ray players, such as Sony’s X800 machine, the most high profile machine to date is the Xbox One S console. Microsoft included the drive in its reasonably-priced console which has enticed many AV fans to choose it over the PlayStation 4 Pro. Given Sony’s crossover interests in 4K video, it remains a huge surprise Sony excluded this from its high-end console offering.

However the copy protection prevents them from doing so. So we're expected to pay through the nose for a BD player because it has copy protection built in? Seriously?

A look back at Dow’s monthly performance since its inception in 1896. By Ramon Padilla, Jim Sergent, Adam Shell USA TODAY Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed over the 20,000 mark for the first time after at the opening bell. (Photo: Andrew Gombert, EPA) 197 CONNECTTWEET 9 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO — Silicon Valley may shudder at the prospect of a Trump Administration, but so far it's prospering since he was elected president. In the Dow's rocket ride to a record 20,000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq rallied to a record, too: It topped 5,656, closing up 1% at a record. USA TODAY Dow hits all-time high, cracks 20,000 for the first time ever Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, IBM and Netflix have helped propel the record-setting surge for tech stocks. Their stocks are up between 5% and 15% since the Nov. 8 election, with several trading near 52-week highs. On the price-weighted Dow, where stocks with higher per-share prices do more of the heavy lifting and the tech sector leans toward older, hardware-oriented companies, components Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, IBM, Apple had a mixed showing. While IBM and Apple had double-digit runs, Cisco is slightly lower than it was on Election Day. IBM, whose CEO Ginni Rometty was named as an early business adviser to Pres. Trump's transition team, is responsible for 9% of the Dow’s run of more than 1,700 points since Nov. 8.  iPhone maker Apple has contributed 4% of the recent surge and Microsoft 1.3%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. Tech investors so far have bought into Trump's aggressive agenda to goose the economy with a lower corporate tax rate and in anticipation of repatriation, which would let companies bring back cash held overseas at lower rates. The market is also benefiting from expectations for forthcoming earnings results during what is traditionally the tech industry's strongest quarter. Alphabet and Microsoft are scheduled to report quarterly sales on Thursday. Apple is scheduled to announce its results on Jan. 31, and Facebook on Feb. 1. Early results are promising. Shares of Yahoo rose 3.5% Tuesday, a day after it reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue and said the sale of its core internet business to Verizon for $4.8 billion should be completed in the second quarter. Netflix shares hit a record after strong international subscriber growth. FindTheCompany | Graphiq The market momentum comes with a healthy dose of irony: The tech industry is heavily at odds with Trump's "America First" economic policies for restrictive immigration and a push for more manufacturing jobs in the U.S. On Monday, he threatened a "major" border tax for non-U.S. based manufactured good imports in a meeting with a dozen top executives, including Michael Dell, founder of PC giant Dell, and Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Trump also has vowed to help business with a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 15% from 35% and deregulation of "at least 75%." Tech analysts expect the wild ride to continue for several quarters, but may not be sustainable. "There are near-term positives, but there is a danger of a long-term crash once some of the policies that tech objects to are in place," says Matt Eastwood, an analyst for market researcher IDC.

The SecuFirm2 mounting-kits are backwards compatible with most Noctua CPU coolers manufactured since 2005 and will be available via resellers and free of charge via Noctua's website after uploading a proof of purchase.     "We were the first heat sink manufacturer to provide its customers with free mounting upgrades in 2006 when AMD introduced the AM2 socket and we've continued this policy with several generations of Intel sockets. Now we're glad to offer free mounting upgrades for the new AM4 platform," says Roland Mossig (Noctua CEO).   "It makes us proud that so many customers who bought their Noctua cooler five or even ten years ago, and used it on several platform generations, are still so satisfied with it that they want to keep running it on the latest CPUs. Keep enjoying your Noctua coolers on AM4!"   Noctua will offer two different SecuFirm2 mounting upgrade kits for AM4: the NM-AM4-UxS kit for NH-U14S, NH-U12S and NH-U9S, and the NM-AM4 kit that supports most other retail cooler models manufactured since 2005 (NH-C12P, NH-C12P SE14, NH-C14, NH-C14S, NH-D14, NH-D14 SE2011, NH-D15, NH-D15S, NH-D9L, NH-L12, NH-L9x65, NH-U12, NH-U12F, NH-U12P, NH-U12P, SE1366, NH-U12P SE2, NH-U9, NH-U9B, NH-U9B SE2, NH-U9F) except for the NH-L9i/NH-L9a series low-profile coolers. In addition to the NM-AM4 and NM-AM4-UxS, Noctua also aims to offer an upgrade-kit for the NH-L9a later this year.     The SecuFirm2 mounting system for AM4 has been tailor-designed for the new socket in order to ensure optimal compatibility, perfect contact pressure and easy, straightforward installation. Both the NM-AM4 and the NM-AM4-UxS kit include two different sets of mounting bars, which allows the users to choose the orientation of the cooler according to their preferences in order to ensure an optimal alignment with the airflow path inside the case.   In order to obtain the kits free of charge via Noctua's website, users are required to upload a proof of purchase (electronic version, scan or photo of the invoice) of an AM4 motherboard or AM4 CPU as well as an eligible Noctua retail CPU cooler (server and workstation coolers of the DX and DO line are excluded from the free offer). Users who have lost the invoice for their Noctua cooler may write their full name and the current date on a piece of paper, take a photo of the paper next to their cooler and upload it as proof of purchase. Depending on the user's location, shipping will usually take 1-4 weeks.   For users who need the kit urgently or do not yet have a proof of purchase of an AM4 CPU or motherboard, the NM-AM4 and NM-AM4-UxS kits will also be available via selected retailers and e-tailers such as Amazon at a suggested retail price of EUR 7.90/USD 7.90.   Links   Press release: http://noctua.at/en/noctua-offers-upgrade-kits-for-amd-s-ryzen-platform-free-of-charge NM-AM4: http://noctua.at/en/nm-am4-mounting-kit NM-AM4-UxS: http://noctua.at/en/nm-am4-uxs-mounting-kit Detailed compatibility information: http://noctua.at/en/which-noctua-cpu-coolers-are-compatible-with-amd-am4-ryzen   About Noctua   Designed in Austria, Noctua's premium cooling components are internationally renowned for their superb quietness, exceptional performance and thoroughgoing quality.

Peter Bright - Jan 16, 2017 10:30 pm UTC reader comments 328 Share this story Windows 7's extended support ends on January 14, 2020. The operating system left mainstream support in 2014, meaning that for the last two years—and next three—it only receives security fixes. But Microsoft is telling corporate customers that even with those security updates, the 2009 operating system isn't really cut out for the world of today. According to Redmond, enterprises should plan to move to Windows 10 sooner, rather than later. The reason, according to Markus Nitschke, head of Windows at Microsoft Germany, is that Windows 7 "does not meet the requirements of modern systems, nor the security requirements of IT departments." There are two elements to this. Companies buying new hardware using Intel's Skylake or Kaby Lake processors have little choice but to use Windows 10. Installation and driver support for Windows 7 and 8.1 is limited to certain systems since changes in the Skylake platform, such as the integrated USB 3 controllers and processor-controlled power management, aren't supported in Windows 7. PC OEMs can still make the older operating system work, but it requires extra effort on their part. AMD's new Ryzen processors and Windows machines built using the Qualcomm 835 processor will similarly need Windows 10. With so many companies holding onto their PCs for so long, that may not be a big reason to drop the older operating system. This is where security comes in. Windows 10 includes a wide range of security improvements that aren't found in Windows 7: stronger built-in biometrics with Windows Hello, cloud-based threat analytics with Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, built-in sandboxing with AppContainer (used for Store apps, the Edge browser, and certain aspects of font-handling), virtualization-based security to protect against certain kinds of credential theft, and much more. The value of these improvements is not that they address individual security flaws, rather they make whole classes of flaw harder to exploit, protecting the operating system against both known and unknown threats. Microsoft argues that it is these systemic, architectural protections that mean corporations should adopt Windows 10 over Windows 7. This was demonstrated in a write-up of two zero-day exploits published by Microsoft last week. The Strontium group (aka "Fancy Bear," aka "APT28") is believed to be involved in the hacks of the Democratic National Committee, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and others. They're believed also to be tied to Russian intelligence. In a spear-phishing campaign conducted in October, the group used then unknown vulnerabilities—one in Windows' windowing subsystem, one in Windows' font management, and one in Adobe Flash—to attack think tanks and non-governmental organizations in the US. The two Windows flaws that were targeted, however, wouldn't be exploitable in Windows 10 with the Anniversary Update. Windows 10 includes additional validation of internal structures, and it performs certain aspects of font handling in an unprivileged, sandboxed process. The result is that even though Windows 10 had the same underlying bugs, its defense in depth made those bugs harder or impossible to successfully exploit. This kind of protection isn't going to be retrofitted to Windows 7; organizations that want the best available protection against both known and unknown flaws will have to upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft has, of course, made this same pitch to corporations before. Windows 7 may be looking long in the tooth today, but it represented a substantial improvement, especially with regard to security, over Windows XP. Windows 8.1 introduced further structural security improvements. In spite of this, many companies stuck with Windows XP for years past its prime. Often, compatibility with legacy browsers or legacy applications made migrating to newer versions of Windows expensive. Nitschke says, "As we saw with Windows XP, companies should take early steps [to move to Windows 10] to avoid future risks or costs" from being trapped on the older operating system. The longer organizations wait, the argument goes, the more institutional knowledge and expertise about those problematic applications leaves the company, and the harder it becomes to upgrade them to work on the new operating system. Migrating away from Windows 7 should be less problematic than dropping Windows XP was, because Windows 7 applications are less ill-behaved than many Windows XP ones were. Still, Microsoft is clearly keen that customers heed the lessons learned from that migration and not leave upgrades until the last minute. Peter Bright / Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

The Chromebook 11 Convertible is specifically designed for the education market. The device features a sturdy design with rubberized shock protection for falls. Its keyboard and trackpad are fully sealed to protect against spills. The laptop, much like most convertibles, can be used in a traditional mode or the screen flipped around to use it like a tablet. The Chromebook 11 can be configured to include a camera built into the keyboard that’s meant to be used when flipped into tablet mode. The device also comes with stylus support and works with the “Dell Productivity Active Pen.” It is powered by Intel’s sixth generation Celeron processor series and run the Chrome OS. Another Windows 10 model powered by a newer generation processor will be called the Latitude 11 Convertible. Both the devices sport the same basic design but will come at different prices. The Chrome OS model will sell for $349 and the Windows model for $579. Dell has also redesigned its existing 11-inch and 13-inch Latitude and Chromebook laptops with slimmer and more minimalist looks. The devices come with ability to withstand falls and spills and feature processor upgrades. The Windows versions get more CPU options with 7th gen Pentium and Celeron chips. The Chromebook variants, meanwhile, are stuck with the sixth-generation Celerons, though a Chromebook 13 does come with a Core i3 option. The Chromebook 11 and the Chromebook 13 will cost $219 and $299, respectively. The Latitude 11 goes for $349 while the Latitude 13 is available for $519. All the newer laptop variants will launch February 7. Android Support In related news, Google announced that every single Chromebook launched in 2017 will come with pre-installed access to the Android Play Store. In a post on the Chromium project site, Google stated that “All Chromebooks launching in 2017 and after as well as the Chromebooks listed below will work with Android apps in the coming future.” At least 60 other laptops are on the list. This means that the latest Dell, Acer and Asus devices will support all Android apps on the Play Store. The lack of apps in the Chrome OS was one of the biggest drawbacks of the Chromebooks. With this step, the platform will become more vibrant and directly benefit the Chromebook users. Stay tuned to TheBitBag for more latest Chromebook and Windows 10 laptop launches.

Scott Gilbertson - Jan 8, 2017 2:00 pm UTC Enlarge / Behold, Dell's seventh edition of the XPS 13 DE. Scott Gilbertson reader comments 125 Share this story Over the course of its four-year lifespan, Dell's extremely popular XPS 13 Developer Edition line has become known for one thing—bringing a "just works" Linux experience to the company's Ultrabooks. Of course, today Dell is just one of many manufacturers producing great Linux machines. System76 makes the Oryx Pro (still my top pick for anyone who needs massive power), and companies like Purism and ZaReason produce solid offerings that also work with Linux out of the box. Even hardware not explicitly made for Linux tends to work out of the box these days. I recently installed Fedora on a Sony Vaio and was shocked that the only problem I encountered was that the default trackpad configuration was terribly slow. Further ReadingThe XPS 13 DE: Dell continues to build a reliable Linux lineage Admittedly, the Vaio is a few years old, which means there has been time for hardware issues to be addressed. Getting Linux to run on bleeding edge hardware in 2017 remains tricky—or it requires running a bleeding edge distro like Arch. That's where efforts like Dell's Project Sputnik, led by developer Barton George, come in handy. With the XPS 13 Developers Edition, the hardware is already vetted. Drivers are pre-installed and configured for a great out-of-the-box experience. The latest Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, released in late 2016 and tested in the home office last month, is an exceptionally well-built, great-looking piece of hardware. Yet again, if you want your Linux rig to "just work," this is for you. But if you also want a powerful, svelte package that weighs under 3lbs, this is the XPS 13 you've been waiting for. Dell's most recent Linux laptop even features Intel's new Kaby Lake chip, which bumps the clock speed by about 10 percent. The more impressive side of the chipset upgrade is the graphics architecture, which is supposed to improve performance in 3D graphics and 4K video. Playback, especially 4K video, is incredibly smooth and not nearly as battery-draining as previous models. The specs Outwardly there's nothing new to see here. The 7th generation Dell XPS 13 DE uses the same wonderful InfinityEdge display that manages to pack a 13-inch screen into a body that looks and feels like an 11-inch laptop. The model I tested came with the 3200x1800 IPS touch panel. There's also a version with a 1920x1080 IPS non-touch panel, but I think the higher res display is worth the extra money. The new XPS 13 has simply the best-looking display I've seen in a laptop. Naturally the HiDPI model suffers a little in battery life compared to the lower res model. I've never used the lower res version, so I can't compare battery life times, but more pixels always takes more power. If battery life is your top priority, don't go with the HiDPI model. That said, I find the brightest setting (400 nit brightness) to be a bit much indoors. It's great for working outside and goes a long way to compensate for the inevitable glare on glossy screens. But I rarely push the brightness past 60 percent when I'm inside, which improves battery life considerably. The model Dell sent me featured an i7-7500U Kaby Lake chip with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid state drive. As configured, the whole enchilada would set you back $1,799. The lowest model—which has the 1920x1080 display, an i5 chip, 128GB SSD, and only 8GB of RAM—can be had for $975. For an extra $375, you can step up to the higher res screen and a 256GB SSD. There's also a new option for what Dell calls a "Rose Gold" exterior. The laptop I tested had the same full aluminum exterior as previous models. Underneath it is an aluminum frame, which makes the XPS line feel solid even at its minimal weight. As has been my experience with most Dell machines, the construction is excellent. I used the previous model for over six months, shoving it in and out of my bag several times a day, every day. It doesn't have a scratch on it. I can see no reason to think the latest model would be any different. The ports remain unchanged on this version of the XPS 13 DE... You'll get: 2 x USB 3.0 (one with PowerShare), one Thunderbolt port that supports charging, 3-in-1 Card Reader, Native DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA, and HDMI. Sold separately: Ethernet and USB-A via the Dell Adapter. Also unchanged in this release are the ports and layout. There are still two USB 3.0 ports, one with PowerShare for charging your devices (note that USB charging generally requires a trip into the BIOS settings to enable; see Dell's support site for more info). There's also a Thunderbolt port that supports charging, a 3-in-1 card reader, DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA, and HDMI. As with any laptop this thin, Ethernet requires an adapter (sold separately). The 720p webcam is the same one that has been in the last couple of models, and it's still at the bottom of the lid. Yes, it still sucks that it's down there, although in fairness to Dell, there is nowhere else to put it. The InfinityEdge display comes within 1/8-inch of the edge of the lid. Nevertheless, like fellow Ars reviewer Peter Bright, I find this decision irritating. Why not just move the display panel down an 1/8 inch and put the camera at the top so it's usable? Or, why not stop pretending that the bottom camera is useful and just ditch the camera altogether? The palm rests are made of a carbon fiber composite that I found very comfortable. The keyboard also appears to be the same as previous models. It's a very thin chiclet-style keyboard that works just fine, although coming from the ThinkPad world I still find these keyboards disappointing. What's more disappointing for some Linux fans is the fact Dell still uses the Windows logo on the super key. The touchpad is reportedly the same, although using the testing model next to the previous edition I felt a noticeable difference with the newer model being somewhat "stickier." That doesn't sound good, but I found my movements were actually more precise with the new trackpad. This was particularly noticeable in Darktable, a photo editing app with some of the tiniest imaginable control elements. Usually that can be a real pain to adjust, especially on such a HiDPI screen like the one the XPS 13 uses. The problem I experienced previously, where the trackpad would unaccountably freeze at times, appears to have been related to something in Ubuntu 14.04, because the new XPS, which comes with Ubuntu 16.04, did nothing of the sort. Another common complaint about the XPS 13 is a high-pitched coil whine that plagues some models, according to some Reddit threads. In the three models I've used, I've never encountered this issue. It's possible that the whine comes from something related to Windows drivers (some people report fixing the problem by reinstalling drivers), although I have seen reports of the whine being present on the Ubuntu-based models as well.

Sign up to comment and more Sign up Ars Technica UK OP is OP — From sprinklers to battlestations: Ars staffers’ crazy home lab experiments When we're not writing, we're tinkering on things ranging from cool to crazy. Ars Staff - Nov 24, 2016 12:30 pm UTC Enlarge / Ron is good at computer. Ron Amadeo reader comments 100 Share this story Perhaps you know someone, dear reader, who is what they call a "car person." This "car person" perhaps has many cars in various states of repair, or perhaps there is one "special" car the "car person" lovingly works on without ever actually driving it—changing out the "engine" or the "pistons," endlessly replacing the "tie rods," constantly benchmarking new "oil sumps," or...OK, I'm not actually a "car person" myself and so what that species does with cars is a mystery, but you get the idea: perhaps you know someone who tinkers on automobiles. Well, many of us Ars Technica staffers are like that—except, perhaps unsurprisingly, instead of cars we tinker on computers. And usually not just with any one computer—the lure of getting your hands dirty and building something functional and performant and cool transcends any one personality or interest type, be it cars or computers. Much like the car person with the Datsun Fairlady Z-car small block V8 conversion perpetually under work in the garage, we geeks tend to have our own perpetually in-work projects—improving our workstations, building tools, or even crafting our own mad science laboratories in our homes. That those labs are most often used for things like "deploying a hundred virtual machines and then simulating multiple states of degraded network performance between each of them" and not "creating an undead monster" doesn't lessen the craziness of what we're doing—after all, much like Doctor Frankenstein, our motivations for tinkering at home are rarely monetary and often instead based on curiosity and a drive to create. Not everyone on staff has a needlessly complex IT setup, of course—Andrew Cunningham responded to our request for input on this staffsource with an eye-roll so loud that I could actually hear it through email, and I'm pretty sure Jon Brodkin actually thinks "cat 5" refers to the fifth such animal in a group of felines. But the true nutters on staff stood tall and provided us some quality descriptions of their creations. So, while you Americans relax on your couch in post-turkey bliss or hide in the bathroom so you don't have to talk about politics with your family—and while the rest of the world goes about its normal Thursday business—we present to you five crazier-than-they-need-to-be Ars Technica staffer home IT setups. Cyrus Farivar: Singing in the rain Unlike my esteemed colleagues, I don’t have much in the way of crazy home IT setups. I mean, sure, I have a few basic hard drives attached to my Apple Airport Extremes that serve as largely unused NASes, but the most interesting is my OpenSprinkler. Enlarge / A Raspberry Pi OpenSprinkler, tucked away on some water pipes, for now. Cyrus Farivar It’s been nearly two years since I set up my Raspberry Pi to act as the engine behind our family’s drip system for our modest garden. (I detailed the saga back in February 2015.) This past summer, when we began a major cull of our garden (and my wife single-handedly tore out a mess over some overgrown plants), I was tasked with mapping our existing in-ground drips, re-laying new drips where necessary, and giving our Pi some love. The Pi was doing just fine, doing its thing. To that end, I ended up re-installing the PiOS on it in the name of spring/summer cleaning. As we’ve been doing some remodeling in our house in recent months, I’ve had to sort of precarious position it on some overhead pipes, which has meant that the tiny little power cord pops out sometimes—but I’ll mount it back on the wall before the end of the year. I’m still trying to figure out if there’s anything else that’s both fun and useful that I can get my Pi do to in its current configuration. Eric Bangeman: My office, my life If I had contributed to this article a decade ago, I would’ve written about how I hardwired my 1929-vintage house with Cat-5e cable and used a gigabit switch for all of my devices (three or four desktop PCs and a console). But in 2008, we moved to a newer house, and advances in wireless networking dampened any enthusiasm I had for running cable through my walls, then patching and repainting over the mess. Some people have a server rack. I have a server bookshelf. Functioning hardware from left to right, top to bottom: Synology DS416 NAS with 11TB of HDDs installed, Amplifi HD router, HP Color LaserJet Pro 476dw multifunction printer, UPS, Motorola cable modem (owned, not leased), and Ooma VoIP box. The G4 Cube up top used to function as a home server until it crapped out. A side view of the desk showing my Apple Cinema Display, 13" Retina MacBook Pro, iMac, and associated cabling. Eric Bangeman Conduit keeps unsightly Cat-6 cabling hidden from view. Eric Bangeman I own a Motorola cable modem through which my ISP, Wide Open West, happily pumps 100mbps/10mbps service. Hooked up to the modem is my Ubiquiti Amplifi HD router. That in turn has four Ethernet ports in back to which I have connected my office iMac, my SIP phone, my NAS, and my Ooma VoIP box for home phone service hooked up. Everything else in the house uses Wi-Fi, which propagates through our home thanks to the Amplifi HD’s mesh antennas. On the wired network: Synology DS416 NAS. This is my most recent hardware purchase. I’m using it for backing up all of the laptops as well as for syncing files between my wife’s iMac and laptop. The drives are a combination of 3TB Western Digital Red HDDs and a couple of used WD Black drives I had lying around. Ooma VoIP device. Not everyone in the Bangeman household likes carrying a smartphone around all of the time, and at $5 per month, Ooma offers what we need for residential phone service. Of course, we are down to one or two non-robocalls per week... Polycom SIP phone. All Ars staffers have a SIP phone with a three-digit extension on their desks. 2015 Retina 5K iMac with a 4GHz Intel Core i7 CPU and 24GB of DDR3 RAM. To avoid unsightly cable runs, the Ethernet cable for the phone and iMac are routed through conduit installed just above the baseboards in my office. On the wireless network: Two Apple TVs One Roku HD HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP M476dw. This is a multifunction (print/scan/fax) color laser printer from HD. If you need to print stuff regularly (and we do) and don’t like paying thousands of dollars per gallon of printer ink (and we don't), this is a fine piece of hardware. Ignore the low-toner warnings (seriously, ignore them until you see missing colors on your printouts), and you’ve got a sweet multifunction device that scans, copies, and prints extremely fast. Six laptops (including two Chromebooks and a Surface Pro) DirecTV HD DVR Various and sundry iPads and Kindles Samsung Smart TV (used for Netflix and Amazon Prime Video) If I had written this blurb three months ago, I would’ve whined about poor wireless signal in some parts of the house and vacillated over whether I should have done an Ethernet cable run after all. But since I replaced my Apple Time Capsule and Airport Express with the Ubiquiti gear, I am perfectly happy with my setup. Next on the horizon are some IoT devices like cameras and maybe a thermostat. But I don’t want my devices incorporated into a botnet, so I’m going to hold off on diving into the Internet of Things for the time being. Annalee Newitz: A fount of Largesse and a wellspring of terabytes In my home there is a very special media server named Largesse. You see, I have a rather large collection of extremely strange VHS, CD, DVD, and Blu-Ray media. If one were feeling generous, one might say that they are disorganized. Which is why my beloved housemate helped me to create a special data palace to hold them all. Here's how we did it (with mad props to Gregor Menasian, who taught us almost everything we know about extremely large and cheap data storage boxes). I never promised you that my server closet would be perfectly organized. Hey, there are shelves. Isn't that enough? You can see Largesse, the media server, in the lower right. In the upper left you can glimpse our backup server. Please do not comment on dust or clutter or other stupid human concerns. Now you're getting down on your knees to see the good stuff. About this time you're saying something like, "So, Ubuntu and ZFS. Tell me about your ZFS feelings." Here it is, baby. Look at that. Fifteen four-terabyte hard drives. Blinky lights. Really loud fans that you can hear in the next room. BUT IT'S ALL WORTH IT. It's our backup server! Eighteen two-terabyte drives. Here's an important corner of our 4K display, with streamer to the right. Right now we're using an Nvidia Shield as our Android player. Also there is my original VHS copy of Star Wars. No CGI added! This is part of my movie and TV collection. It might be considered large and disorganized by people who haven't passed through the Singularity. A closer look at my superlative organization system. It took about a month to digitize everything, though that was just working on and off when I had time. I just wanted you to understand that each of those shelves is actually TWO LAYERS of DVDs. So when you look at that shelf, you are only scratching the surface. This is why I needed a media server. First, allow me to introduce you to Largesse. It's a beautiful machine with a slightly older Intel E3 CPU that supports ECC memory. Currently it has fifteen HGST 3.5 inch 4TB hard drives formatted with ZFS, full of digital backups of all our movies, TV, music, books, home software projects, and other sundry items. It has 32GB of ECC RAM, which I'll explain in a minute. Largesse runs Ubuntu, and we access it remotely with SSH and use Samba to share its contents across various Android players around the house, which play video using Archos or Kodi. That's the executive summary. To run all those disks, we got two very cheap, hackable controller cards: IBM ServerRaid M1015s, which plug into PCI eXpress 2.0 x8 slots on the motherboard. We needed a controller that gave us enough SATA interfaces, and the M1015 was the ticket. Normally when you plug in one of these cards, you have the controller take care of the disks' RAID configuration, but that wouldn't have worked with our goal of using ZFS. So we configured the controllers to function in JBOD mode—which literally stands for "just a bunch of disks." This exposes all of the disks directly to the operating system instead of trying to present them as a RAID volume. We decided to use ZFS because if you have 15 disks with one file system, you need a lot of flexibility about your storage pool. Also, as beloved housemate puts it, "ZFS is badass." With that many drives, cabling is a nightmare. The great thing about M1015s is that they also have two SFF-8087 multi-lane connectors, which can each be expanded to provide four SATA connectors for disks. So you can technically run 16 disks through two M1015s. We have eight on one, and seven on the other. It's beautiful and makes us happy. A quick word about our hard drives: We chose the HGST drives because they offered the highest density at a low failure rate. We run them in a Z2 configuration, which means we won't lose any data unless three drives fail. We have yet to see any drives fail in over two years. Also, we have those 32 gigs of RAM because ZFS likes RAM. Plus, when you get a large amount of memory the likelihood of some kind of bit-flip event increases, so error-correcting memory goes a long way toward helping keep data loss to a minimum—it will resist random corruptions better than other memory. Obviously we run open source software. We migrated to Ubuntu from NAS4Free a while ago, and the migration was ridiculously easy. Ubuntu has a good ZFS implementation and gives us more flexibility about the software we run. We have a few ways of accessing the data on the server, via our two home networks (both gigabit Ethernet NICs). We run a Plex server that lets us stream stuff easily from tablets and phones. As I mentioned earlier, we do remote administration via SSH. We also use SSH for file transfers after we've created a digital backup from a new DVD or Blu-Ray or whatever. We use Samba to share files to Android players. And we play video with either Kodi or Archos—whichever one isn't being annoying and crashing that day. The nice thing is that we can also use Chromecast with the Android players if we want to stream something to our TV. Currently we're using an Nvidia Shield for our 4K display. We also have a system for casting from Largesse through a phone app to a projector in beloved housemate's bedroom. Explaining that would take another article, though, so let's not go there. One of the questions people always ask is how we back up our exceedingly large collection of media. Luckily, Largesse has a predecessor. It's an 8-disk QNAP box that has two five-disk DAS connected by eSATA. Once its eighteen 2TB disks were enough for us—but now it lives on only as a backup for Largesse.

Military Military: The Intel Mattis: New game plan on ISIS? Mattis: New game plan on ISIS? New Defense Secretary James Mattis will have to deliver a plan, in the next 30 days, to defeat ISIS. New Defense Secretary James Mattis will have to deliver a plan, in the next 30 days, to defeat ISIS. Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter Remember candidate Donald Trump’s promise to, in his first 30 days, get a new plan out of America’s generals to beat the Islamic State? It appears that new Defense Secretary James Mattis is preparing to start as early as Friday, when Trump is scheduled to visit the Pentagon. Some options that could be quickly forwarded: two ideas that former President Barack Obama’s administration developed but never approved, according to CNN. They include arming Kurdish fighters for the battle to retake Raqqa, the ISIS capital in Syria. Obama didn’t like that idea due to concerns it would alienate Turkey, where the United States needs airbase access. Another option: sending more U.S. troops into Syria for combat against ISIS fighters. Under Obama, American service members are technically in an adviser role in Iraq and Syria. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day New leadership at the Pentagon comes just as Iraq announced this week a somewhat tenuous victory in eastern Mosul, in what’s been a bloody, months-long onslaught to eliminate ISIS in its Iraqi stronghold. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Tuesday announced the liberation of eastern Mosul on state television, but his administration had to back off that claim later as fighting continued.  Still, what’s ahead is perhaps an even tougher battle for western Mosul, with its densely populated neighborhoods. The top U.S. military leader in Iraq called the Iraqis’ progress in Mosul a “monumental achievement” that would have been a “difficult task for any army in the world.” “There is still a long way to go before ISIL is completely eliminated from Iraq, and the fight for Western Mosul is likely to be even tougher than the Eastern side,” said Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the commanding general of Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve. The coalition has tried to keep ISIS fighters from fleeing Mosul for Raqqa. Meanwhile, Trump’s team has said the new president may be willing to work with Russia in Syria against ISIS. That’s a departure from the past administration, which saw Russia as mostly helping Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad by bombing the forces fighting him, not ISIS. “The president has been very clear that he’s going to work with any country that shares our interest in defeating ISIS,” Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said Monday. “I think that if there’s a way that we can combat ISIS with any country, whether it’s Russia or anyone else, and we have a shared national interest in that, sure, we’ll take it.” Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, the situation is deteriorating with the Taliban launching more attacks.  Trump told the Afghan president in December that he would consider sending more American troops, according to the Wall Street Journal this week. Currently, a little over 8,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan as a stabilizing force.

Name: Subject: Message: Dell announces three new Chromebooks, including a 2-in-1 convertible Newsby John Callaham3 days ago 3 312 1 This post originally appeared on our sister site, TabTimes. Earlier this week, Google announced that Acer and ASUS were planning on launching two new convertible Chromebooks this spring for the education market. Today, Dell also revealed plans to launch three new Chromebooks targeting schools, and one of them will also be a 2-in-1 convertible. See also: How to run Android apps on your Chromebook July 14, 2016 The Dell Chromebook 11 Convertible will have a 6th-Generation Intel Celeron processor, but unlike the Acer and ASUS products, Dell’s 2-in-1 Chromebook will not have a stylus included, nor will it have a “world facing” camera when the display is moved into tablet mode. If you want those features, you will have to get the Windows 10 version of this Chromebook, the Latitude 11 Convertible. The Chromebook 11 Convertible model will be released on February 7 for $349, while the Windows 10-based Latitude 11 Convertible will be priced much higher at $579. Dell’s other two upcoming Chromebooks will also launch on February 7. The Chromebook 11, which has a display that can be laid flat 180 degrees on a table, will be priced starting at $219. The Chromebook 13, which will have a normal notebook display, will be priced starting at $299. All three Chromebooks, along with their Windows 10 counterparts, are supposed to be made up to MIL-STD 810G specifications so they can be rugged enough to take a ton of abuse from students. All of them will have fully sealed keyboards and touchpads, so they can resist spills from a kid’s drink at lunch time. Dell’s press release on these new products does not mention any support for running Android apps with these Chromebooks, although Google did recently say that all Chromebooks launching in 2017 would be able to support running Android apps via the Google Play Store. Hopefully, that will be the case for these new Dell models, although it is possible that support won’t be included out of the box but will be added later in an update.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Bada and Tizen sitting in a tree: Samsung, Intel to merge mobile OS projects 01/14/2012 at 4:09 PM by Brad Linder Update: It looks like the merger of Tizen and Bada might not be a done deal yet. A Samsung official has told AllThingsD that while the company is considering the possibility, the decision hasn’t been made. Samsung plans to merge its Bada mobile phone operating system with the open source Tizen project backed by Intel. Forbes reports that this means existing Bada apps will be able to run on Tizen handsets — and developers that know how to code for Bada will be able to use the same tools to develop for Tizen. That might not sound like a big deal in the US, where not a single Bada smartphone is available. But Forbes says that Bada already has a larger share of the global smartphone market than Windows Phone 7… which is admittedly not much, at just around 2 percent. Tizen is an open source Linux-based operating system that rose out of the ashes of MeeGo (which in turn was formed when the Moblin and Maemo products merged). Tizen places a heavier emphasis on web technologies than MeeGo, but like it’s predecessor it isn’t just designed as a smartphone OS. Tizen could also run on tablets, netbooks, and other connected devices including in-car entertainment or information systems. It’s not entirely clear if Samsung will kill its standalone Bada platform anytime soon. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Samsung keep the name and use it for future devices running a customized version of Tizen. Instead of getting an Android phone with Samsung’s TouchWiz user interface, for instance, you’d just get a Bada device… that can run Bada and Tizen apps. By taking an active role in the development of Tizen, Samsung is hedging its bets in the operating system space. Tizen will give the company much more control over the features and customization of the OS for upcoming products — and in some ways Tizen could offer a better experience for developers and possibly users. Most Android apps run in a Dalvik virtual machine, while Tizen apps are native apps that don’t need Dalvik or any other software to run. But there are already hundreds of thousands of Android apps available and customers are comfortable with the smartphone operating system (although Android tablet sales are still relatively minor). So while Samsung reportedly plans to offer a Tizen device or two this year, I doubt we’ll see the company abandoning Android anytime soon… unless Bada/Tizen devices prove wildly popular right away. via The Verge Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Latest News Windows 10 gets new gaming features with Insider Preview Build 15019 The latest preview of Windows 10 for members of the Windows Insider Preview … [Read More...] Reports: Samsung Galaxy S8 launching March 29th, featuring brand new design Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 smartphone may have been a bit of a disaster, but the … [Read More...] In a perfect world Satechi’s new USB Type-C Power Meter wouldn’t be necessary… ... but we don't live in a perfect world.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Artificial Intelligence Market: Strongly Influencing the Present and Future of Businesses and Humankind Artificial Intelligence Market: Strongly Influencing the Present and Future of Businesses and Humankind Posted on January 25, 2017 by ReleaseWire - Latest Press Releases in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Artificial Intelligence Market by Technology (Deep Learning, Robotics, Digital Personal Assistant, Querying Method, Natural Language Processing, Context Aware Processing), Offering, End-User Industry, and Geography – Global Forecast to 2022 Seattle, United States — (SBWIRE) — 01/25/2017 — Artificial intelligence (AI) can be understood as a science, engineering and deployment of machines, which perform tasks with intelligence as similar to humans. Since its inception 60 years ago, AI has observed significant growth in recent years. Initially, AI was considered as topic for academicians, though in recent years with development of various technologies, AI has turned into reality and is influencing many lives and businesses. Additionally, evolution of various other supplementary technologies such as cloud computing, machine learning and cognitive computing are collectively paving the growth of the market for AI. "In 2015, the AI chipset market was valued for USD 589.8 million and is expected to reach USD 16,059.3 million in 2022, at a CAGR of 62.9% from 2016 to 2022", says Sachin Garg who tracks global market for semiconductor at research firm MarketsandMarkets. Many IT giants and start-ups are investing heavily in development of AI software solutions and hardware products. Some the prominent players in AI market in the recent times are Intel Corporation (U.S.), Google Inc. (U.S.), Microsoft Corporation (U.S.), Amazon.com, Inc. (U.S.), Baidu, Inc. (China), and NVIDIA Corporation (U.S.). Computer vision technology has become a part of high definition video games, while deep learning; which is a subset of machine learning is now implemented in speech recognition, drug discovery, health monitoring and various others applications. Robotics has evolved as one of the most promising AI technology in recent times. With wide range of applications, AI enabled robots are nowadays applied in welding, cutting, color coating and polishing purposes in automotive industry; carrying out several clinical tests and performing surgeries in healthcare industry. Furthermore, robotics and AI are likely to benefit the industries which are lacking the skilled and young workforce such as agriculture, factories, food processing and fulfillment centers. Moreover, AI is likely to gain traction with amalgamation of various technologies such as deep learning, robotics, digital personal assistance, querying, natural language processing, and context-aware processing to develop an AI-featured product. In near future, AI is expected to make a crucial impact in multiple end-use applications such as driverless cars, healthcare diagnostics, and physical assistance in elder care. AI is likely to disrupt every business segment across the world. The end-use industries of AI featured in this AI market study includes, agriculture, BFSI, manufacturing, healthcare, oil & gas, media & advertising, transportation and automotive, retail, among others. Among these verticals, transportation and automotive sector was the largest contributor to the AI market in 2015. This was resultant of significant investment made by federal governments and venture capitalists in development of connected and autonomous vehicles. These funding consequently resulted in some of the tangible recent development in autonomous projects. For instance, in October 2016, Otto (U.S.) (now acquired by Uber Technologies, Inc. (U.S.)) shipped its first consignment from Denver, Colorado, U.S. to Denver Springs, U.S. using driverless truck. The autonomous driving was carried for 120 mile journey. However, healthcare industry is estimated to exhibit highest growth in near term. The growing penetration of AI in health care assistance and medical management are the two key factors driving the market for the healthcare industry. Moreover, AI technologies are also used in the healthcare industry for decision-making processes, extracting information from the data collected from patients, and processing it further for testing and simulation of new treatments, scenarios, and devices. The increasing large and complex datasets even called as big data, and the adoption of AI-enabled products and services to improve consumer-centric services are the two major growth drivers of the AI market. However, the scarcity of low cost and energy efficient hardware, and the lack of skilled workforce for development of AI algorithms and tools is curbing the growth of the AI market. In essence, AI offers significant growth opportunities to all the stakeholders involved in its ecosystem. Development of human-aware AI systems and widening scope of AI technologies in niche markets are prominent market opportunities existing today. In addition to this, deploying AI at the edge of the network is likely to become a massive industry trend in coming years. From new product launches to mergers & acquisitions, AI industry has witnessed some tremendous and crucial developments in recent years. Many companies are relying on their in-house developments, while some are growing with inorganic growth practices. Google, one of the frontrunners in AI had launched industry's first AI-enabled smartphone "Pixel" in October 2016, which signifies that AI is now turning into a reality. On the other hand, IBM acquired Truven Health Analytics (U.S.) in April 2016, with this IBM intent to derive insights from Truven's health data using Watson Health's cognitive capabilities. On similar lines, in January 2016, IBM acquired The Weather Company, based in Atlanta, Georgia (U.S.) to introduce a new platform for IBM Watson Internet of Things. Alongside this, leading graphics processing unit (GPU) providers, NVIDIA Corporation launched the industry's first deep learning system, "NVIDIA DGX- 1", in April 2016. This tool is a completely integrated system with deep learning hardware and software, and development tool kit. Thus, AI technologies are the future for many industries which are striving for efficient, low-cost operations and high profitability in their markets.

Like the company's other computers destined for schools, the Dell Latitude and Chromebook 11 Convertibles are built to withstand classrooms and student abuse. They both sport the same basic design -- rubberized shock protection for falls, sealed keyboards to handle spills and lots of rounded corners -- but one runs Windows 10 and the other is powered by Chrome OS (we'll let you guess which is which). As with most convertibles -- including Dell's recent XPS 13 2-in-1 -- the new 11-inch laptops can be used in a traditional mode, folded in a tent formation, or have their screen wrapped all the way around like a tablet. Stylus-wise, they support Dell's optional Productivity Active Pen. The Latitude 11 Convertible will be powered by Intel's seventh-generation Pentium and Celeron chips, while the Chromebook model runs sixth-generation Celerons. Dell also redesigned its 11-inch and 13-inch Latitude and Chromebook laptops with a slimmer, more minimalist look. They're also built to withstand falls and spills, and they've received the requisite processor upgrades over the last generation. Once again, the Windows versions will get more CPU options, with seventh-generation Intel Pentium and Celeron chips for the Inspiron 11 and newer Core i5 processors for the Inspiron 13. The Chromebook variants, meanwhile, are stuck with sixth-gen Celerons (the Chromebook 13 also has a Core i3 option). All of the company's new education laptops will be available on February 7th, and we're still awaiting pricing details. In other news, Dell also announced two new Interactive Touch 4K displays, a 55-inch and 86-inch model. They follow in the footsteps of the company's 70-inch 1080p touch display, and they're meant to offer more options for educators who want to have a large collaborative screen for their classes and meetings. They pack in DisplayPort and VGA connections for plugging in computers, as well as the expected HDMI ports (three for the 55-inch and four for the 86-inch). They'll be available on March 30th for $5,000 and $11,000, respectively. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

There's certainly no shortage of choice now that every manufacturer is looking to expand their gaming portfolio, and Asus, as you might expect, covers the entire spectrum. Toward the lower-end of the firm's Republic of Gamers range is the Strix GL702VM, priced at £1,200. That is, in today's world, considered a conservative fee for a gaming laptop. Yet Asus has high hopes for this 17.3in model, which it claims is "compact," "potent" and able to deliver smooth G-Sync gameplay as well as an immersive virtual-reality experience. Can it deliver on those promises at the £1,200 price point? Perhaps, but expect a few provisos along the way. The first potential stumbling block is the aesthetic design, which in keeping with many a gaming laptop is going to elicit a love-it-or-loathe-it reaction. For me, personally, the ROG Strix GL702VM isn't a particularly attractive machine, and the orange-on-black colour scheme is without a doubt an acquired taste. It's too garish for my liking and attracts fingerprints en masse, which is a shame as the overall profile is quite likeable. Asus's chassis measures 415mm x 280mm x 25mm in size, making it reasonably svelte for a system with a large, 17.3in screen, the display bezel is suitably slim, and the 2.7kg weight is about right for a machine of this ilk. Don't, however, expect premium build quality; this is, after all, a relatively affordable gaming PC. That means a liberal use of plastic materials throughout, so while the lid and palm rest is made to look like a brushed metal, it's not as rigid as it appears and both the top and bottom sections exhibit a fair amount of flex. It's important on a 17.3in frame to provide a generous selection of I/O ports and the GL702VM doesn't disappoint. The laptop's left side is home to an audio jack, USB 3.0, USB 3.1 Type-C with Thunderbolt, HDMI, mini DisplayPort, Gigabit Ethernet and a connector for the bundled 180W power supply. Over on the right there's an SD card reader, two further USB 3.0 ports and a Kensington lock. It's under the hood that a gaming laptop earns its keep, so what can you expect for £1,200? Asus starts with a Core i5-6300HQ processor from Intel's last-gen Skylake stable paired to 8GB of DDR4 memory and a GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with a 6GB frame buffer. Add to that a 128GB SSD and a 1TB hard disk, and you have the foundations of a nippy machine that ought to cope well with both work and play. Reckon 8GB of DDR4 memory is cutting it tight? There is a £1,350 model that offers double the RAM and swaps the Core i5 chip in favour of a Core i7-6700HQ. And if you're willing to push the budget up to £1,600, the range-topping variation touts a current-gen Core i7-7700HQ, 16GB of memory as well as a larger 256GB SSD. Decent variety, though we do reckon Asus has cut a few corners on the base specification. 8GB of memory in a single-channel configuration is basic by today's standards and a 128GB SSD can be considered miniscule for a gaming build. While we're nitpicking, there's also a fair amount of bloatware to contend with and incessant prompts from the likes of Asus web storage, Asus app giftbox, Asus product registration and McAfee LiveSafe become annoying. On the flip side, every GL702VM model comes equipped as standard with a matte 17.3in IPS display touting a full-HD resolution and support for Nvidia G-Sync at up to 75Hz, resulting in silky-smooth gameplay at the native resolution. A 1080p display with G-Sync is, in our estimation, an ideal fit for a GTX 1060-powered laptop, but do be aware that G-Sync and Nvidia Optimus remain mutually exclusive. As such, the GL702VM can't revert to the Intel IGP in order to save power - the GTX 1060 is always in use and that doesn't bode well for the 76Wh battery. Audio output from the stereo speakers, meanwhile, is surprisingly punchy, and we like the fact that the laptop's innards can be accessed by undoing a few simple screws on the underside, making it easy to manually upgrade storage and memory, or clean the trio of internal fans. Elsewhere, the backlit keyboard and trackpad are in line with our expectations of a gaming laptop. The latter is large and responsive, while the former offers a good amount of key travel and an integrated numpad. We aren't keen on the fact that the Num Lock key has been moved to make way for a dedicated shortcut to Asus's Gaming Center app, and if we're being ultra-critical we'd have preferred the keyboard with a white backlight as opposed to red.

It’s Richard from Zeus Comics. It’s our mid-season finale and we’ve got a Traitor revealed! A Villain revealed! The Death of a Hero! And a Heroes Return? Times Two? The trail to follow in this episode is a little muddy. Via flashbacks we discover Arrow killed pharmaceutical CEO Justin Clayborn four years ago after Clayborn was working with the mysterious “AK Desmond Group” to not only weaponize Tuberculous but provide it’s cure through a price hiked vaccine provided by Clayborn pharmaceutical company. In the ensuing battles Evelyn is revealed as the traitor providing information to Prometheus! And during an investigation and search by officer Billy Malone possibly discovers that Prometheus is Clayborn’s son. This leads to Billy’s capture by Prometheus but not before sending the intel to Felicity. Now keep in mind Prometheus has been calculating and playing Team Arrow this entire time. I’m not certain yet that Prometheus’ reveal as Justin Clayborn’s son is for real, real. This intel leads Arrow to Prometheus' location and in a heartbreaking moment, Arrow mistakenly kills a drugged and disguised officer Billy Malone. As difficult as it was to watch Ollie tell Felicity, it was with some satisfaction that Felicity and the rest of Team Arrow knew where to place blame for Billy’s death. I’m hopeful we’re not going to linger with blame on Oliver for Billy’s death in future episodes like we have in other shows (I’m talking to you Cisco). And for our finale we get Thea as Speedy! Is Speedy jumping back in the game now that Evelyn/Artemis is revealed as the traitor. Plus this bombshell… the return of Laurel Lance? It can’t be that simple right? Let’s find out  in the next Arrow “Who Are You?” Video: Director Rueben Gonzales, Editor Chris Williams. Richard is the owner of the Eisner award-winning Zeus Comics in Dallas, Texas and co-creator of The Variants, a webseries about life in the comic shop.

Investors and analysts see the record-setting day as a positive indicator that the dormant market for initial public offerings is ready to stir again this year. “It’s yet another sign that the public markets are open and eager for growth stories again,” said Byron Deeter of Bessemer Venture Partners. Some critics see the Dow’s index of 30 major companies as a poor mirror for measuring the state of the nation’s economy compared with other broader indexes. Yet Deeter said that the positive sentiment around the Dow’s milestone will inevitably seep into conversations in Silicon Valley boardrooms, as will Cisco’s $3.7 billion purchase of AppDynamics on Tuesday, just ahead of the San Francisco software company’s planned initial public offering.

As the Dow recovered, tech companies including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon.com became some of the world’s most valuable companies.

From left to right: Dr. Oleksandr Smorodin, Dr. Alexander Badrutdinov, Professor Denis Konstantinov, and OIST Ph.D. student Jui-Yin Lin.... view more Credit: Sarah Wong The future of quantum computing is a hot topic not only for experts but also in many commercial and governmental agencies. Rather than processing and storing information as bits in transistors or memories, which limit information to the binary '1' or '0', quantum computers would instead use quantum systems, such as atoms, ions, or electrons, as 'qubits' to process and store "quantum information" in, which can be in an infinite number of combinations of '1 and 0'. Large technology corporations, such as Google, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM are investing heavily in related projects that may lead to realize the quantum computer and technologies. At the same time, universities and research institutes around the world are researching novel quantum systems, adoptable for quantum computing. The Quantum Dynamics Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), has recently made novel findings about electrons floating on the surface of liquid helium, a quantum system which may be a new candidate for quantum computing into reality. These results were published in Physical Review B. One of the common problems in quantum computing research using solids is that it is very difficult to make perfectly identical qubits because intrinsic defects or impurities in the materials used randomly affect each individual qubit performance. "Our motivation for pursuing a liquid helium system is that it is intrinsically pure and free of defects, which theoretically allows for the creation of perfectly identical qubits. Additionally, we can move electrons in this liquid helium system, which is difficult or nearly impossible in other quantum systems," explained Prof. Denis Konstantinov, head of the Quantum Dynamics Unit. Therefore, it is believed that adopting this system for quantum computing might bring the whole field to the next level. Utilizing electrons on a liquid helium surface for quantum computing requires isolating individual electrons on a helium surface and controlling their quantum degrees of freedom, either motional or spin. It may also require the movement of electrons to different locations, thus it is also important to understand the physics of the interaction between electrons and the helium surface. It was previously discovered that electrons on helium can form a two-dimensional crystal, and some unique phenomena occur when this crystal moves along the helium surface, due to the interaction between electrons and surface waves. The OIST scientists, however, are the first to probe how these phenomena depend on the size of the electron crystal. To test this, Dr. Alexander Badrutdinov, Dr. Oleksandr Smorodin and OIST PhD student Jui-Yin Lin, built a microscopic channel device that contained an electron trap within to isolate a crystal of a relatively small number of electrons. This crystal would then be moved across the liquid helium surface by altering electrostatic potential of one of the device electrodes. This motion would be detected by measuring image charges, which are induced by the moving electrons, flowing through another electrode using a commercially available current amplifier and lock-in detector. "This research gave us some insights into the physics of the interaction between electrons and the helium surface, as well as expanded our micro-engineering capabilities" states Dr. Alexander Badrutdinov, a former member of the Quantum Dynamics Unit and the first author of the paper. "We successfully adopted a technology to confine electrons into microscopic devices, on the scale of few microns. With this technology we studied the motion of microscopic two-dimensional electron crystals along a liquid helium surface and saw no difference between the movement of large electron crystals, on the scale of millions to billions of electrons, and crystals as small as a few thousands of electrons, when theoretically, differences should exist". This research is the first step at OIST in the prospect of using this system for quantum computing. According to Konstantinov, "the next step in this research is to isolate an even smaller electron crystal, and ultimately, a single electron, and to move them in this system. Unlike other systems, this system has the potential to be a pure, scalable system with mobile qubits." In theory, this type of system would have the potential to revolutionize the quantum computing research field. ### Disclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.

It won't matter: These jobs are going to robots In the near future, where goods are made will have no real bearing on where the jobs are. ByJason Perlow for Tech Broiler | January 25, 2017 -- 13:10 GMT (05:10 PST) | Topic: Tech Industry Image: ZDNet On Monday, following through on his campaign promise, newly-inaugurated President Trump signed an executive order that terminated US participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP was a free trade agreement between 12 signatory nations (not including China) in which the United States was the dominant player and which included countries accounting for more than 40 percent of the value of goods and services produced worldwide. read this Forget Apple vs. Samsung. There's no stopping China in the smartphone war The problem comes down to industry commoditization. Read More In the words of the prior administration, the objectives of the TPP were to "promote economic growth; support the creation and retention of jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards; reduce poverty in the signatories' countries; and promote transparency, good governance, and enhanced labor and environmental protections." Four Asian signatories -- Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam -- joined in this partnership with the US and Canada. The goal: To establish a strong US presence in the region so that, in essence, the Asian signatories would not "be left alone on a dark street with China" and there would be collective bargaining power, among other benefits, including lowering tariffs and non-tariff barriers for imported goods among the signatory nations. But reducing tariffs was not really the driving point of the TPP, since the economic benefit would have been minimal for the US -- it was about putting our country in the position of establishing trade rules in Asia and getting member states to comply with them, specifically as it related to intellectual property and patents of American corporations. Also: Turnbull pushes TPP as Japan calls it 'meaningless' without the US | Robots need rights, and kill switches too, warn politicians | Plug car security holes before self-driving vehicles arrive | Intel, ARM forge foundry partnership in bet on manufacturing prowess Pulling out of the TPP will almost certainly have the opposite effect on China than what President Trump intends -- which presumably is to stem the flow of jobs and manufacturing and money to foreign nations. Instead of punishing China, it now puts them firmly in the driver's seat in the Asia-Pacific region when it comes to trade. Pulling out of the TPP is just the first step in what will likely be more aggressive steps by the Trump administration to make importation of foreign-made goods unattractive. Almost certainly, larger tariffs are going to be in store for China. Trump wants iPhones made in the United States, not in Shenzen and Chengdu. At a fundamental level that's not a bad thing. We all want to increase skilled labor jobs in this country. Unfortunately, while we might realize some domestic production of the kind of sophisticated manufactured goods that line the aisles of CES every year, it may have a negligible impact on the job market. You see, the goods are likely to be made by robots. special feature AI, Automation, and Tech Jobs There are some things that machines are simply better at doing than humans, but humans still have plenty going for them. Here's a look at how the two are going to work in concert to deliver a more powerful future for IT, and the human race. Read More While China has a lower cost of labor than the US, and has tremendous government subsidies in various industries, costs in that country for manufacturing are increasing substantially. Rising costs have prompted companies like Foxconn, the primary contract manufacturer of the iPhone, to deploy fully automated manufacturing methods. As of December 2016, the Taipei-based manufacturer -- with major plants in Shenzen, in Guangdong province in southern China; Chengdu in Sichuan province in Western China; and Zhengzhou in Henan province in Northern China -- has deployed over 40,000 homegrown "Foxbots" and it intends to replace most of its human workforce with them. Foxconn is considering opening a plant in the United States specifically to make displays, as it now owns Japanese electronics firm Sharp, following completion of a $3.5 billion acquisition in August of 2016. At an estimated cost of $7 billion, the display manufacturing facility would employ as many as 50,000 people. On paper that is -- at least according to the company's CEO, Terry Gou. Given the company's accelerated trend towards automation in China, I am under no illusion that Foxconn will not do the same thing in the US. That 30,000-50,000 job figure is almost certain to fall dramatically. Perhaps the robotic factories that Foxconn wants to build will need skilled technicians to keep the coffee break-free automated workers running smoothly. But how many does each factory need? A few thousand at most, if that. Certainly with the advancement of 3D printing and rapid prototyping, the most skilled people don't actually have to be based in the US, and there are a lot of economies of scale that come into play. Where stuff is made will have no real bearing on where the jobs are. But surely they need people to run the distribution and transportation side, right? Warehouses and domestic shipping? The best tech inventions of all time: Manufacturing... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 11 NEXT PREV Well, if what Amazon is doing is any indication, that's a no. The company already has mostly automated warehouses that use human beings primarily for the packing stages of the fulfillment process, as it purchased the Massachusetts-based robotics firm Kiva Systems in 2012 and now uses over 45,000 robots in its numerous warehouses across the country. And of course, there are the drones that Amazon is experimenting with, which will one day drop small packages at your front door. But before that happens, we will probably see autonomous trucks drive goods from distributors, factories and port facilities to Amazon shipping centers, and from those shipping centers to parcel carriers in your neighborhood, where the last mile may be one of the few places that will continue to involve human beings. Right now that's good old UPS, USPS and FedEx, which use flesh and blood. But that is likely to change, and Amazon and other large companies selling durable goods (like Wal-Mart) will probably cut out that part of the equation with their own intra-facility shipping services and local delivery soon enough. And if they can pull humans out of any part of that process, they will. So yes, America will get manufacturing of durable goods to return to this country. And perhaps there are high-end, specialized products that can be made entirely by American firms. But in the not-so-distant future, the workers producing them and bringing them to your front door won't need lunch hours, health insurance, or 401Ks.

INNOVATE Why ESPN, the NBA, and Big Brands All Want a Piece of the $900-Million E-Sports Industry That's right--video games are now a sport.

If anything, admitting that you were a hardcore gamer either got you shoved into a locker or scolded by your parents to turn off your computer and get back to studying. I would know. I was part of the era of online gamers that helped pioneer today's legendary world of e-sports. Today? The world of e-sports is as big as professional athletics. Inc Magazine just named Riot Games--the developers behind the smash hit video game League of Legends--as 2016's Company of the Year. Here are a few numbers that will make your head spin: The virtual goods players can buy inside League of Legends are set to yield nearly $1.6 billion in sales for Riot. And more than 100 million die-hard gamers log in to play each month. Madison Square Garden? Formerly reserved for iconic musicians and Hall of Fame athletic showdowns, it now boasts big-screen TVs and crowds of screaming fans supporting their favorite e-sports competitors and teams. What was once seen as a hobby for the socially inept has quickly become a mainstream phenomenon. And it's only going to get bigger.... For those outside the industry, it's difficult to understand the appeal. After all, as big as e-sports has become, it is an extremely niche community. You are either part of the clan or you are very, very far from it. For big brands, this is both the biggest challenge and also the industry's biggest appeal. According to a 2016 report, total e-sports revenue was estimated at $892.8 million in 2016. Direct consumer revenue grew 36 percent year-over-year, with e-sports consumers spending $231 million on tickets, merchandise, and prize pool contributions alone. Although Asia leads the market, North America and Europe are not far behind. By 2018, the e-sports market is set to reach $1.1 billion. Need more proof of the market's potential? I remember being a 17-year-old, back when I was one of the highest ranked World of Warcraft players in North America. This was in 2007, and the game's maker, Blizzard Entertainment, had just announced it would be hosting the first World of Warcraft e-sports tournament. I explained to my parents and friends that I wanted to go compete. Everyone looked at me like I was crazy, and I was assured that gaming was, in fact, "not a real sport." Well, ESPN now has an entire section of its site dedicated to e-sports, with high stakes matches bringing in massive viewership on national television. Not only that, but long-time professional sports associations are now buying up e-sports teams in the hopes of capitalizing on the action. For example, the Philadelphia 76ers became the first sports team in North America to dive in and purchase e-sports troupe "team diginitas." So, where do the brands come into play? Well, as of right now the e-sports economy is primarily driven by sponsorships and advertising, generating close to 78 percent of total revenues produced. But the challenge for big brands, especially those that might not seem like immediate fits for the booming industry, is figuring out how to effectively navigate the emerging landscape. There are several categories of brands right now looking to capitalize on the industry's recent popularity. The first and most obvious are the tech companies: Intel, for example, recently sponsored the Intel Extreme Masters--a series of international e-sports tournaments. Companies that manufacture keyboards, headsets, mice, etc., make for viable pairings with the tech-savvy consumers filling the seats of these e-sports competitions. Next, are the beverage companies, like Coca Cola, Monster, and Red Bull, known for sponsoring elite e-sports competitors. The tie-in here is the fact that gaming requires an extreme level of focus and long hours spent in front of a computer screen. The energy drink brands were some of the first to enter the space and have become staples in the industry. Then, surprisingly, are the health and fitness brands--and this is a perfect example of how much of the industry has yet to be defined. Since professional gaming is now considered a "sport," health, fitness, and supplement brands are looking to weave themselves into the narrative by supporting players' physical well being in order to help them compete at the highest levels. One of the first to enter the scene was Cellucor, which saw a massive opportunity to become a resource to e-sports athletes. Because here's the thing: One of the biggest challenges competitive gamers face is the toll that gets taken on their bodies by sitting in front of a computer for hours on end. Gamers, in general, tend to be stereotyped as athletically challenged and nutritionally deprived--when in fact, these high-level competitors fly around the world maintaining travel schedules sometimes as rigorous as any professional athlete. For health and fitness brands like Cellucor, this is an obvious (and yet not-so-obvious) sidestep into a parallel industry of high-performance competitors. They don't want to just sponsor these players--they want to help them thrive through the same rigorous travel schedules (and stress that comes with competition) a professional athlete would face. Combine that with the fact that colleges are now offering scholarships to competitive gamers, and it's clear that gaming is, in every sense, now considered an actual sport. When you think about the demographics of the e-sports industry, the kinds of brands entering the marketplace make perfect sense: The 16-to-34 male demographic is highly coveted, and reaching it on a regular basis in a way that is not intrusive has become a big challenge. Big brands hope that by partnering with e-sports events with viewership that now rivals professional athletics, they can not only get in front of those target consumers but win them over. The challenge the rest of the mainstream brands are facing, however, is in figuring out how to make themselves part of the narrative. The gaming community, especially, is a savvy bunch. They run ad blockers. They are known for pirating content. They spend all their time online and can spot poorly executed influencer marketing a mile away. Winning them over is a challenge. And more than that since, if you cause a disruption, they are a vocal bunch. The world of competitive gaming is not for the faint of heart, and its chat rooms and community make any "locker room talk" you've ever heard sound like cordial conversation. Having watched this industry explode from the very beginning, I feel these are exciting times. In fact, I recently partnered with a startup in the scene called LVLUP Dojo, looking to capitalize on one of the aspects of the industry few have yet to tackle: education. Since its message rings extremely true with me, I launched an online course with LVLUP Dojo, teaching gamers the value of building a personal brand online. Because when I was a 17-year-old competitor, I didn't understand the value of what I was doing. I didn't know having 10,000 people reading my gaming blog every day was valuable. I didn't know how much I should be getting paid by a sponsor. I didn't know how to navigate the industry--and even today, that remains a serious problem. The most astounding thing is that it's not just the brands that are confused--it's the gamers, too. They don't know their own worth. There's money being thrown around and nobody really knows who deserves it--is it the players bringing in the viewers or the brands hosting the competitions? The players are young, so they don't know what contracts they're signing. Lawyers are just now getting involved in brand-player negotiations. The entire industry is like the wild West, and everyone is out there figuring it out together. But the numbers are there, and they only seem to be growing. And in our world of rapidly changing technology and war for attention online, professional gaming houses some of the most devoted fans, followers, and viewers. That's what everyone wants a piece of--undivided attention from consumers. Like this column? Sign up to subscribe to email alerts and you'll never miss a post.

Admittedly progress is being made elsewhere, though when you look at companies like IBM or Intel or Oracle, these are all monsters of the 90s got beaten to the punch by the cloud native brands. Companies like Salesforce.com or Google fit perfectly in the cloud defined age, and it looks like SAP has successfully managed the transition without causing too much damage in the process. The total of cloud subscriptions & support revenue and software support revenue exceeded 61% of total predictable revenue across 2016. The success of the cloud over the last 12 months has also prompted the team to increase revenue and profitability forecasts through to 2020, with the cloud business driving the majority of the growth. Profits over 2016 increased to €3.6 billion, on total revenues of €22 billion, and the team now forecast between €28 billion to €29 billion total revenues in 2020, with profits between €8.5 and €9.0 billion. The cloud share of predictable revenues is also forecast to increase to between 70-75%. Alongside revenues shooting upwards, share price has also seen a 14% lift across the 2016, and total number of employees has increased from 76,986 to 84,183 in 12 months. If there are still companies out there who need any help on how to transform for the connected economy, SAP looks like it can provide a couple of good case studies. “SAP’s outstanding 2016 performance is the latest in our seven year run of profitable growth. We expanded our addressable market, acquired best in class assets and innovated a new generation of ERP with SAP S/4HANA,” said CEO Bill McDermott. “We are the leader in the business software industry with a consistent trifecta of strong software sales, fast cloud growth and operating income expansion. Our innovation agenda is accelerating in Machine Learning, the Internet of Things and Blockchain. SAP is winning big and we have enormous confidence in our accelerated 2020 ambition.” Like the other giants of the 90s, SAP was caught a bit cold in welcoming the arrival of the digital era. As companies such as Salesforce and Workday were hoarding new customers with cloud based solutions, SAP was stuck with a legacy on premise software business which was fast becoming unfashionable. 2009 and 2010 saw revenues decline, which seemed to have kicked the team into action. 2011 saw the purchase of SuccessFactors, a cloud-based HCM vendor, for $3.4 billion, in 2012 it bought Ariba, a cloud-based B2B marketplace, for $4.3 billion, and in 2014 behavioural target marketing company SeeWhy and expense management vendor Concur Technologies for $1.1 billion and $8.3 billion respectively. SAP may have been sluggish in terms of an organic transition to cloud, but it had cash and spent it wisely. SAP may not be a brand which grabs the headlines regularly, but 2016’s financial results show the team can team its PR hungry colleagues a thing or two about adapting with next generation technologies.

(Image: News18.com/ Sarthak Dogra) At the time when GPS was used only for military purposes, one technologist in Silicon Valley envisioned it as a mass product for consumers. He then went on to make it readily available for the everyday usage of people across the globe. Kanwar Chadha, popularly known as Mr GPS, talks about his journey in an exclusive interview with News18.com. Read how the entrepreneur, technologist and visionary brought GPS to your smartphones. Q: What brought on the idea of GPS as a mass product? A: When we started SiRF, I realised that although the GPS technology was present, its usage was only limited to defence or other high-end applications. I inherently felt that location is going to have a major impact on the day to day users and nobody was really working on the consumerization of GPS. Coming from a Silicon Valley background (Kanwar used to work at Intel), I felt that if we can integrate all the elements of GPS processing in small chips, then we can achieve a breakthrough in terms of the cost, power and solve some of the problems people were having, with GPS. It seemed a very interesting challenge at the time. If we could solve that problem, then GPS would surely have become a part of people’s everyday lives. Q: Did you have any Plan of Action for this? A: When we started thinking about GPS, we came up with an ‘Idea Book’ that looked into how GPS can be embedded into people’s lives. We were looking at it as a horizontal market instead of vertical, so we started looking at the problems which people face in the mobile environment. The first was obviously ‘Navigation’. The navigation systems were very expensive and were fixed in the car. So we worked upon making it portable and at a lower cost. We created a platform which enabled the Portable Navigation Market. We also started to ponder how to embed this technology into phones. The first idea was focussed on how to build on Geotags. At that time, I was thinking of it as an emergency response for people so they could get immediate help at the push of a button in times of emergency. The idea was to enable location as a core attribute so that other applications like Navigation, emergency response, searches could be built upon that. Q: What is SiRF Technology? Where all is it used? A: SiRF was all about putting location or GPS into small chips and also licensing the technology so it could be integrated into different mobile platforms. Then we merged SiRF with CSR which had Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Technology. Using this, we could combine location with wireless connectivity. SiRF technology is now a part of Qualcomm. We also licensed the technology to Samsung which is integrating it into the mobile phones. The whole idea was focussed on the mass market and not to a dedicated professional usage. Q: You came up with another startup named Inovi Inc. What was that about? A: After SiRF was sold to Qualcomm, me and my co-founder from SiRF, founded a new company which was focussed on wireless broadband. We felt that in the absence of Fibre infrastructure in most of the places, it was much quicker and cost-efficient to extend the connectivity wirelessly. The challenge was how to get the bandwidth that Fibre could provide, in a wireless way. So we started using millimetre waves, which are very high-frequency waves, to create what I call ‘wireless fibre-equivalent’. The company was later on taken over by Facebook. Facebook is now deploying the technology to create an open platform which will provide gigabytes of bandwidth anywhere at a much cheaper cost. Q: How is it different from Facebook’s satellite connectivity? A: Satellite is more focused on areas with remote connectivity while our technology, called ‘Teragraph’, is focussed on urban/ high-density connectivity where people need high bandwidth. Q: What are the present projects that you are working on? A: Now I’m working on ‘Internet of Things’ technology for consumer space. Even in IoT, location plays a crucial part. We are looking at how to bring cloud connectivity and services to day to day consumer lives. It brings the three core elements together: Location, Cloud and the device itself. Q: How do you ensure the security of the data transferred over the cloud? A: We ran into security issues with GPS too. The data transferred over the cloud is very sensitive and should not be compromised. Security for such information should be in multiple layers. First of all, the data should never go raw, it should always be encrypted. Second, the devices should be secured as well. Password protection and other protection measures should be embedded into the device. The link between the device and the cloud needs to be secured as much as the cloud. At the cloud level, you have the aggregation of data and that is the most dangerous place to be hacked. As Cloud combines multiple data streams, it needs to be the most secure platform in the entire IoT ecosystem. Q: You mentioned that the devices need to be secured. Are there enough mandates in place to ensure that? A: In the early stage, it was like the Wild West, as people started experimenting with IoT without realising the security and privacy implications. I think the next generation will be a lot more careful. Recently many cases of hacking came up and now the US regulatory people have started to go after the companies which do not put the necessary security elements into their devices. Today IoT is in the hyped phase. The subsequent generations will be able to make it more robust in terms of security and the services. Q: How is it different from the security implications for the defence sector? A: There has to be a separation between the Consumer Spectrum and the Defence spectrum. Consumer spectrum adds the leverage of making things cost-efficient but that alone does not solve the purpose for defence. Security becomes a significant value-add which you have to create on top of that. Q: How does India rank amongst the GPS infrastructure? A: India is one of the few countries having systems which complement GPS. Europe, Russia, China and Japan are the only other countries in this segment. Since GPS cannot be optimised for every region, complementing it with your own technology can really optimise it for a particular area. India is quite advanced in these terms as it has a good satellite technology and a good understanding of the usage of location and navigation. The challenge for India is that, though we have the scientific knowledge, we are yet to have the mainstream deployment or commercialization of such technology. e.g. for IoT, broadband connectivity is a crucial factor in which India lacks. I feel it’s a deployment problem. The good part is that India can leapfrog a generation using the already developed technology around the world. India has gone ‘mobile’ but has not gone ‘broadband’ as yet. To go ‘broadband’ India can skip the part of laying down wires now and directly jump to ‘Wireless connectivity’. I believe India is now ready to lead the world in terms of technology instead of just following the way. Q: Having achieved so many accomplishments, what are you most proud of? A: The thing that I am most proud of is that we came out with a vision of GPS at the time when nobody really believed in it. Today, I see my daughters who take location based technology for granted. The fact that now everybody uses GPS in their daily lives really makes me proud.

We round up all of the rumours about a proper update for the MacBook Air in 2017, including its likely UK release date and tech specs, as well as rumoured new features. Here's everything you need to know about the new MacBook Air in 2017 by Ashleigh Macro | 25 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents UK release date Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? When was the MacBook Air last updated? Price Dimensions  Specs & new features When will the new MacBook Air 2017 be released in the UK? What tech specs and new features will the new MacBook Air get? Is the 'Air' brand being killed off? Will the new MacBook Air get a Retina display at last? The MacBook Air had an update in 2016, but it was such a minor and frankly disappointing update - merely including an optional RAM upgrade in the standard package for the 13in model - that we're looking ahead to the next MacBook Air update. Will 2017 see a proper update to the MacBook Air lineup? Or will the MacBook Air lineup be killed off for good? In this article we round up all the rumours, hints and clues about the new MacBook Air for 2017, including the new MacBook Air's UK release date, tech specs, new features, design, along with speculation that Apple may be phasing out the 'Air' lineup completely. Read next: Best MacBook buying guide | Best Mac buying guide | Best cheap MacBook deals New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: UK release date Back in March 2016, MacBook Air fans were eagerly awaiting an update to their favourite laptop at Apple's special event. After all, the spring event represented one year since it was last updated and before that new Air models arrived in April of 2014. But instead, Apple used the event to show off the iPhone SE and the iPad Pro with 9.7in screen. We had to wait until 19 April for Apple to release new MacBooks and the updated MacBook Air. But the MacBook Air update was underwhelming, to say the least. While the MacBook got a power boost and a new Rose Gold colour option, the MacBook Air simply got a new 8GB onboard memory standard, and that's only for the 13in model. So when will we get a proper update to the MacBook Air line-up? If the lineup isn't getting the chop, we assume that Apple will stick to its yearly upgrade cycle and should release the new MacBook Air at some point in early 2017, possibly between March and May as has been the case in previous years. See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook release | New iMac release | New Mac Pro release | New Mac mini release New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? After the March event and its derisory MacBook Air update, and the subsequent Apple event that took place on 27 October 2016, it's unclear if the MacBook Air line will ever be updated again. No new MacBook Air was announced in October and the new MacBook Pro 2016 was compared in size, performance and weight to the MacBook Air. The new MacBook Pro is smaller in dimensions, and is also thinner than the existing MacBook Air, which was launched with portability in mind. It should also be noted that the 11in MacBook Air has now been discontinued, with the 13in variant receiving a £100 price bump - taking the basic model from £849 up to £949 and the 256GB model up from £999 to £1,099. (This price increase is most likely due to Brexit.) Some have taken this as gentle way of bringing the Air product line to a close, as not many people will want a costly Air with more powerful, and thinner, Mac laptops available. Following the October 2016 Mac event, there are strong suggestions that the MacBook Air line will be completely discontinued. This does mean that the entry level MacBooks are now a little more appealing, but does mean that an 11in MacBook Air will now be missed by some who were hoping for it to be replaced by a similar variant - we presume Apple didn't see a huge market for 11in laptops and thus decided to axe the product line. However, the 11in may not be the only MacBook Air to be discontinued. We think that Apple is about to discontinue the MacBook Air line altogether. Tech Blogger Jack March claims to have spoken with a source close to the situation who says that Apple is about to ditch the Air brand completely, including the MacBook Air and iPad Air products in its lineup. Right now, we think that Jack could be absolutely right. There are rumours that Apple won't release an iPad Air 3 now that the iPad Pro has a 9.7in option, and the MacBook Air doesn't seem to fit naturally in Apple's line-up now that the new MacBook is here and is thinner and lighter than ever. With the advent of the 12in MacBook and the 12.9in iPad Pro, it's no surprise that rumourmongers are starting to predict that at least the 11in MacBook Air, with a smaller screen than either of those devices, will be discontinued. The iPad Pro may indeed be viewed by Apple as a replacement for the 11in MacBook Air if Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments to the Telegraph are taken into account (published on 1 December 2015). Following the launch of the iPad Pro, Cook told the Telegraph: "I think if you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC any more? No really, why would you buy one? "Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones." However, should Apple discontinue the 11in MacBook Air, it does remove the lower price of entry from the line-up. But as mentioned, it may not just be the 11in MacBook Air that is discontinued. When the new MacBook launched on 9 March 2015, analysts began to suspect that the MacBook Air might not be around for much longer. "This wasn't the MacBook Air, but instead leaped past the Air," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "They kept the MacBook Air around just as they do with older iPhones, but the MacBook is now in the same position as the newest iPhone. That makes me wonder if the Air will go away over time." Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of US business for Kantar WorldPanel Comtech, also predicted a contraction of Apple's line-up. "All [notebooks] need to be more mobile, so something like the Air doesn't need to be branched out any more," she said of the differentiation Apple made for the line since its introduction more than eight years ago. "And it's to Apple's benefit not to have so many 'families' of Macs." More recently, KGI Securities analyst and Apple guru Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple is planning on launching a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in MacBook, which would serve as a replacement to the MacBook Air going forward. In a note obtained by AppleInsider, the analyst forsees an end to the meaningful development of the MacBook Air. Apple won't remove the line from its stores just yet, though - it'll serve as an entry-level device for Apple adopters, much like it did with the original MacBook before it was discontinued in 2011.  Over time, it seems likely that the MacBook Air range could be discontinued and eventually replaced by a Retina MacBook range at a lower price. In January 2017, DigiTimes cited Chinese site Economic Daily News and said Apple is going to drop the price of the non-Touch Bar 13in MacBook Pro and discontinue the MacBook Air, which only exists now in the 13in size. It added 'Apple is expected to unveil a new 12-inch MacBook in early second quarter with an additional memory option of 16GB' - this would all but render the Air unnecessary to Apple, even if consumers might lament the absence of its lower price point. We don't expect the 12in MacBook to drop in price.  New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: When was the MacBook Air last updated? We originally expected the MacBook Air to be updated with a Retina display back on 9 March 2015 at Apple's Spring Forward event. And were quite surprised when we got something else: a Retina MacBook, yes, but one with a 12in display and a USB-C port (and very few other ports), a new strand of products for Apple's MacBook laptop line-up. Less glamorously, Apple's MacBook Air did get an update at the same time, with new, faster processors, faster flash storage and better graphics, and was updated more recently in April 2016 with increased RAM, but the screen and overall design remained the same, with no Retina display for the Air line. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Price The last time that there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (aluminium, then white and black, and then eventually aluminium again). These older MacBook models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air was reduced to make it the new entry level (when the MacBook Air initially launched it was quite overpriced for the specs, just like the current Retina MacBook). It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models eventually replacing the MacBook Airs, at a lower price, but for now that seems a long way off. The 11in MacBook Air started at £749, while the entry level 13in model was £849 - this has now changed with the 11in axed - making the new 13in model, with a £100 price hike start at £949. If the 11in MacBook Air is removed from the line up perhaps the cost of entry of the 13in model will reduce to the level that the 11in model is currently, with a rumoured 15in model coming in at a higher price at some point in the future. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Dimensions  If Apple does update the MacBook Air range, what dimensions should we expect? As mentioned above, rumours suggest that the 11in MacBook Air will be discontinued, after all, the 11in MacBook Air is both smaller than the MacBook and the new iPad Pro, and didn’t receive an update when the 13in model did. However, 9to5Mac points out that the new 13in and 15in MacBook Air models could be additional sizes to the MacBook range. That site predicts that some time in 2017 we will have just two ranges of Mac laptops: the MacBook at the ultraportable level, and the more advanced MacBook Pro. Maybe the 17in MacBook Pro will make a comeback too, with a 4K display. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Specs & new features These new MacBook Air models are said to be thinner and lighter, with internal spec enhancements. Apparently, the new MacBook Air will feature new batteries, cooling modules, and chassis, according to the Economic Daily News. We also expect to see USB Type-C across the range, especially now that Intel has integrated Thunderbolt 3 into USB-C - more on that below. Processors The next-generation MacBook Air is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors - that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But here's a leftfield alternative. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has posted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE", a chip family that is now supported. This isn't a chip that anyone has heard of, but it would make sense for this to be an Apple custom ARM chip, fitting in as it does with the company's previous naming conventions: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Those are iPad/iPhone chips, of course, so does this mean Apple is going to let iDevices run macOS Sierra? Certainly not - but it might be about to put ARM chips in the MacBook Air. Image courtesy of Techtastic New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: E-ink keyboard Rumours are rife concerning Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro and, more specifically, its OLED touch bar. The OLED touch bar is rumoured to provide contextual shortcuts to the user based on the application that they're using at the time - but the most recent report suggests Apple isn't happy enough with the feature. 9to5Mac and TrustedReviews report that Apple has been in talks to use a laptop variant of Sonder Design's dynamic keyboard technology. Sonder Design is famous for developing an E-ink keyboard, using E-ink to change the key labels on the fly. This means that the entire keyboard is customisable, providing multiple languages as well as contextual shortcuts from a single keyboard. It allows users that are, for example, editing in Final Cut Pro to look down at the keyboard and see exactly which tool they need to use without having to memorise them before hand. What isn't clear is how Apple is planning on implimenting the software, or which laptop it could be featured on, leading us to believe that it could possibly make an appearance on the 2017 MacBook Air. Sonder has confirmed that talks between Apple and the company has taken place, although it won't comment on whether or not it's a deal - it has only confirmed that it's "closing B2B procurement contracts" with three laptop makers. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Retina display When Apple updated its MacBook Air in March of 2015, we had been convinced that the company was about to give the laptop a Retina display. Instead, it launched a brand-new MacBook line that's super-thin, super-light and does offer that high-resolution display, but does that mean Apple won't enhance the MacBook Air with a Retina display in the future? With the 2016 update only adding more RAM to the basic 13in model, it may be the case. The suggestion that the MacBook Air will feature a Retina display has been long running but those rumours were prior to the launch of the 12in Retina MacBook and the iPad Pro - suggesting the sightings of the Retina display some thought was destined for the MacBook Air was instead for these models. Does this mean that there will be no Retina display on the new MacBook Air when (or if) it launches? If Apple wants to keep the price down maybe not. Or perhaps the newly rumoured 15in Macbook Air will feature a Retina display, while the 13in model will lack the high-res display, but come in at a lower price, one similar to the current price of the 11in MacBook Air. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: MacBook Air to feature USB-C port While we assumed the next MacBook Air would feature USB-C ports, a recent report from Taiwanese website DigiTimes seems to confirm our theory - if believed, anyway. The publication claims that Apple is planning to release a MacBook Air with USB-C ports in future, but doesn't provide a launch timeframe for the upgraded laptop.  "Currently, Apple has decided to adopt the USB Type-C interface for its MacBook Air, while Asustek Computer and Hewlett-Packard (HP) are upgrading one of their notebooks' regular USB port to the Type-C. Lenovo, Acer and Dell are still evaluating the option." The issue with DigiTimes is that it isn't always accurate - the site has previously claimed that Apple would start shipping ultra-thin 13in and 15in MacBooks by the end of Q2 2016, which ended in June with no appearance, although the site's sources have proven reliable at times in the past. So, how accurate is this report? We're not 100 percent sure, but we imagine that if Apple wants to keep the MacBook Air alive, this is the road it'll be headed down.  However, Bloomberg reported in August 2016, one week before the reported iPhone 7 launch, that Apple is preparing a MacBook Air update "as soon as October". This might mean that the MacBooks are announced at the 7 September event, but won't ship until the following month. This seems a logical step; the MacBook has just one USB-C port and the rumoured new MacBook Pro will also feature this connection type. It would still represent a bold move overall for Apple however - it'd mean all of its laptops would no longer support standard USB-A connections, a move sure to annoy a few people, but ultimately shape the future of mobile computing.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpad While this isn't a new patent (it was originally filed back in 2014), a patent application has recently been granted that allows the Apple Pencil to work with Mac trackpads. What is most interesting about the patent is that it depicts a more sophisticated Apple Pencil than the one currently available, suggesting that the accessory is due to get an overhaul at some point in the future. It even goes as far to describe the Pencil being used as a general input device like a joystick or an 'air mouse'. "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." What isn't clear is if the upgraded Apple Pencil will only work with certain trackpads - if this is the case, we imagine that the technology would make its way to the next-gen MacBook Air. Although with this being said, Apple has a habit of applying for a patent and then doing nothing with it, so it isn't set in stone that we'll be seeing this featured on the next MacBook Air - but we can sure hope.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Touch ID and Force Touch We expect this feature to come on the Air model - if it isn't already discontinued!  There are also reports to suggest that it'll boast Touch ID within its Trackpad, which may also get the Force Touch upgrade that was given to the 13in MacBook Pro back in March 2015, and comes with the new MacBook. Touch ID is the fingerprint sensor that's built into the Home button of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It's also used to make Apple Pay more secure and with the recent announcement of Apple Pay coming to Mac as part of macOS Sierra, this rumour makes a lot of sense. According to an Independent report, Touch ID for the Mac line would require a dedicated chip to be built into the device. The rumour started with Taiwanese blog AppleCorner, which cited sources in the supply chain. Apparently the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad may get a biometric update too, enabling users to make Apple Pay payments on the web, but both those accessories were updated alongside the launch of a new 4K iMac so that seems unlikely to happen any time soon.  We'll be updating this article as more information about the rumoured Retina MacBook Air emerges so check back from time to time for the latest news.

Rumored for years, the cryptic device’s existence has not even been officially confirmed by the tech giant. Recently, however, a steady stream of rumors and a tease from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella himself has managed to get numerous tech aficionados excited, as it appears that the Surface Phone is slowly taking shape and getting ready for its highly-anticipated debut. The release date for the Surface Phone has always been a tough topic to discuss. Being a completely new device from the Redmond-based tech giant, it is quite difficult to speculate when the flagship smartphone would finally be unveiled. While the exact date of the device’s reveal remains unknown, speculations are high that the device might see a late 2017 release date, according to a report by the Express. Considering that Microsoft launched the Surface Studio and the Surface Book i7 last October, numerous rumors state that the tech giant might hold a similar event this year for its homegrown flagship smartphone. With the Surface Phone being Microsoft’s most ambitious effort to break through the elusive smartphone market, there are numerous risks that the tech giant appears to be taking in order to increase its chances of releasing a hit device. If rumors prove accurate, the Surface Phone would be a mobile device unlike any other before it. Thus, there are several things that could make the homegrown flagship a hit, and there are some factors that can make it fail. Here is a brief discussion on three reasons the Surface Phone would be a massive success. [Image by Hadrian/Shutterstock] It Has Insanely Powerful Specs The specs of the Surface Phone are yet to be revealed by Microsoft, but speculations have been going on for years that the device would pack internals that are notebook-worthy. Rumors about the device’s internals are numerous, with a Trusted Reviews report stating that the Surface Phone might come equipped with Qualcomm’s most powerful 10nm processor to date, the Snapdragon 835. The formidable chip is rumored to be paired by as much as 8GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage. Other leaks about the device are very few, though there are some speculations stating that the homegrown flagship would come equipped with some form of Intel’s RealSense technology, considering Microsoft’s initiatives in its HoloLens and Windows Holographic technologies. These specs are quite unheard of in a flagship mobile phone, and if Microsoft would indeed release a device along these lines, it would end up offering a smartphone that is a category above the best of what industry leaders like Apple and Samsung could offer. Its Design Would Be Refreshing One of things that Microsoft appears to be going for when it comes to its Surface devices is originality. Thus, speculations are high that the Surface Phone would not look like a clone of any Android or iOS device in the market right now. Instead, it would be a smartphone built from the ground up by the tech giant using a design that is inspired only by its own devices. A number of leaks have emerged with regard to the Surface Phone’s design, with the most recent ones even suggesting that the flagship might be equipped with a revolutionary foldable display. It is no secret that the world of smartphones has been effectively taken over by designs from industry leaders such as Samsung and Apple. In fact, numerous smartphones in the market from innumerable third-party manufacturers simply look like clones of other more popular brands. Microsoft could step away from this trend with the Surface Phone, offering consumers with an attractive alternative option. Here's what #SurfacePhone may look like based on patent filing.https://t.co/G90WiIaXra pic.twitter.com/J9xwCdRiBb — ICXM․net (@XboxMAD) January 18, 2017 Its Software Could Make It A Productivity Powerhouse Inasmuch as Microsoft has not had much luck in the mobile sector, its desktop-grade Windows operating system remains widely utilized by enterprises worldwide. Thus, compatibility with desktop-grade Windows operating systems could be one of the Surface Phone’s most formidable features. If the Surface Phone could be a machine that can effectively be used in tandem with a work computer, it might very well be the device of choice for the enterprise market, which is one of the most lucrative demographics in the computing world. Previous leaks about the Surface Phone have already emerged that appear to tease its focus on productivity, with some stating that the upcoming flagship would feature an upgraded version of Continuum, which enables the smartphone to function as a desktop computer when hooked up to an external monitor. If Microsoft does perfect the technology in time for the Surface Phone’s launch, it would allow its device to be leagues beyond what Android and iOS can offer in terms of real productivity. While the Surface Phone could be 2017’s runaway hit, there is also a possibility that the flagship device might fail. After all, in terms of mobile devices, history is not really on Microsoft’s side, with numerous high-profile failures such as the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL. With this in mind, here are a couple of things that might compromise the Surface Phone’s success. An Unreasonable Price The Surface Phone would be entering the market as a completely new, untested device. Thus, it would be wise for Microsoft to make its price as reasonable as possible. However, speculations have so far been consistent in the idea that the Surface Phone would be a very expensive device. While Microsoft has not revealed the price of the flagship as of date, rumors state that the Surface Phone might cost as much as $599 for the entry-level model and as much as $1099 for the top-tier variant. Raising the price of the Surface Phone to such an extent would be a massive gamble for Microsoft. After all, the device is, at its core, a largely untested product. Thus, requiring consumers to immediately pay a premium might not be the wisest strategy for the Redmond-based tech giant. [Image by Tooykrub/Shutterstock] A Release Date That Is Far Too Late It has taken a long time for the Surface Phone to be released. In fact, despite the generous amount of speculations and leaks about the device, it still remains to be seen if the homegrown flagship smartphone would finally see the light of day this year. Even if it does, its rumored release date of late October 2017 might be far too late for the flagship to make a significant impact in the smartphone market. After all, the most notable flagships from the top firms in the mobile industry, the Galaxy Note 8 and the iPhone 8, would be releasing around August to September. If Microsoft does indeed release the Surface Phone late this year, it might end up compromising the massive impact the device could easily make among consumers. For the Microsoft Surface Phone to reach its full potential as a game-changing device, it would need to enter the market at exactly the right time. The Surface Phone has a chance to make an impact in the smartphone market. With its powerful specs and possible revolutionary features, it might very well stand out from a sea of otherwise very similar devices. However, in order to pull off a breakout hit, the Redmond tech giant would need to dig deep and be extremely strategic when it comes to the release of its very first homegrown flagship smartphone.

The Windows 10 PC ecosystem gained a number of new members at CES 2017, from entry-level gaming systems to new 2-in-1s to updates of old favorites. New machines seem to be introduced on a daily basis, in fact. Toshiba joined the fray Tuesday with the announcement of two new notebooks, the Portégé X30 and the Tecra X40. The two new machines are both thin and light standard notebooks, with the Portégé X30 in the 13.3-inch class and the 14-inch Tecra X40 representing Toshiba’s entry into the thin-bezel movement. More: CES 2017 proves 2-in-1s are becoming the new normal Carl Pinto, Toshiba’s vice president of marketing and product development for its Client Solutions Division, described the new machines, saying, “The Portégé X30 and Tecra X40 are the latest examples of our ability to innovative the thin and light notebook form factor without sacrificing performance, features, battery life, or durability. We are confident the collection of features and technologies found in these notebooks will satisfy the needs of the modern mobile computing user.” The Portégé X30 is 15.9mm thick and weighs 2.3 pounds, making the 13.3-inch machine 11-percent thinner and 13-percent lighter than the previous model. The Tecra X40 is also quite thin at 16.9mm, and it’s also light at 2.76 pounds. Not only are the machines similar in overall dimensions, they share many of the same components and features. Both the Portégé X30 and Tecra X40 sport seventh-generation Intel Core processors, run Windows 10 Pro, and offer the same Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution screens. Wireless connectivity is provided by Intel 802.11ac Wi-Fi, while wired connectivity for both machines includes two USB Type-C connections with power delivery and Thunderbolt 3 support, a USB 3.0 port, HDMI connector, and a microSD card slot. Both machines also enjoy Windows 10 Hello support via both facial recognition and fingerprint scanners. Facial recognition is provided by standard infrared cameras, and the machines also incorporate touchpads with built-in fingerprint sensors via Synaptics’ SecurePad with Natural ID. Taken together, the Portégé X30 and Tecra X40 offer some serious flexibility in using Windows Hello to log in without a password. Finally, both machines incorporate scratch-resistant magnesium-alloy chassis and Toshiba’s shock-absorbent TouchBody design that includes the company’s unique honeycomb reinforcement. They are also the same color, Onyx Blue. More: Toshiba unveils a robust 2-in-1 PC aimed at professional users In addition to the new machines, Toshiba also announced the availability of the Portégé X20W 2-in-1 that was previously introduced during the CES event. The 12.5-inch Windows 10, 360-degree convertible uses a Full HD display with Gorilla Glass 4 and supports Toshiba’s TruPen Wacom-based pen technology. The company is also updating a number of existing notebooks with Intel’s seventh-generation Core processors, dubbed Kaby Lake.

In September, D-Wave announced it had developed a 2,000-qubit quantum annealing computer, doubling the number of quantum bits that were implemented in its previous model. On Tuesday, the company officially launched the system, which has been dubbed the 2000Q. The first 2000Q on the market is set to be snapped up by cybersecurity firm Temporal Defense Systems. “Combining the unique computational capabilities of a quantum computer with the most advanced cyber security technologies will deliver the highest level of security, focused on both prevention and attribution of cyber attacks,” Chief Technical Officer James Burrell said. The 2000Q continues D-Wave’s track record of doubling the number of qubits implemented in its most potent annealing computer every two years, according to Tom’s Hardware. Its added horsepower makes for an exponential increase in the problems that the system can handle — the company claims that the 2000Q is capable of 1,000 times better performance than its 2X computer, which was released in 2015. However, the qubit increase is not the only improvement that the 2000Q can claim over its predecessor. The system introduces new control features that can apparently improve its efficiency. More: Intel will leverage its chip-making expertise for quantum research “D-Wave continues to advance the state-of-the-art in quantum computing with each generation of systems we deliver to customers,” CEO Vern Brownell said. “We are the only company selling quantum computers, and our growing ecosystem of users and developers gives us the benefit of their practical experience as we develop products to solve real-world problems.” While Brownell’s claims are technically accurate, there is an asterisk over his definition of a quantum computer. D-Wave specializes in quantum annealing computers, rather than the universal quantum computers currently being developed by the likes of Intel, IBM, and various academic institutions. A quantum annealing computer isn’t capable of the full gamut of operations that a universal quantum computer would be able to perform. However, annealers hold an advantage over universal systems in that they are much closer to fruition at this point in time — even the most advanced attempts at a universal quantum computer are currently confined to a handful of qubits. D-Wave is steadfast in its claims that quantum annealing computers can help with tasks like optimization and machine learning. Temporal Defense Systems certainly seems to be convinced that the 2000Q offers an advantage over other hardware, as the rig will reportedly cost the company around $15 million. Also watch: Share

New Intel research shows that parents are finally waking up to the risks of leaving their children to navigate the digital world unsupervised and are taking their kids' mobile device use in hand. Over one third (35%) of the 13,000 parents that took part in the "New Family Dynamics in a Connected World" study now take physical steps to control and monitor how their children use tablets, smartphone and computers. Quotes in the article Intel Corp INTC ▲ 37.98 +0.42 +1.12% This usually entails taking overall charge of a device and only giving their child access to it at set times during the day. Nearly one in four parents (23%) said that they use software to help monitor how their children are using devices. However, the majority of parents are also ensuring that digital devices don't become the only entertainment or distraction in the children's lives. Some 48% of respondents across the 14 countries and four continents included in the study say that they limit screen time to one-to-two hours a day, and a further 20% cap exposure at less than one hour a day. However, even with attempting to put rules in place, devices are already changing household habits and 76% of parents now allow their children to take an internet-connected device to bed. And because the smartphone and the tablet have become so ingrained in daily life, parents admit that they're struggling to lead by example. Over one third (36%) said that their children have "called them out" because they're using a device when they should be engaged with the family. And while parents are for the most part getting proactive when it comes to when devices are used, respondents are still very much concerned about how children use them. Four in five parents (80%) are understandably concerned about their kids unintentionally interacting with digital predators or cybercriminals, and 85% say that they have already had a structured discussion with their children about online risks and sensible digital behavior.

Every gaming laptop manufacturer has tried to cram more power inside slim designs with smaller screens, but the best mobile gaming experiences are still found inside larger laptops like the Asus ROG G701VI. This 17.3-inch beast deploys an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080, an Intel Core i7 processor and a 120Hz G-Sync screen, and it’s on a mission to provide an unrivalled mobile gaming experience. And, in some ways, it succeeds. Related: Best PC Games to play on your gaming rig Asus ROG G701VI – Features The efficient Nvdia Pascal architecture means there’s barely any difference between the desktop and mobile versions of the GTX 1080 – both have 2,560 stream processors, 7.2 billion transistors and 8GB of super-fast GDDR5X memory. The mobile version has a slightly lower clock speed by default, but in this laptop it's actually been boosted ever so slightly. That's in Standard mode – the G701VI has an Extreme option, too. Impressively, that mode sees the GPU clocks improve to 1,622MHz and 1,811MHz. Both of those are better than the desktop core, meaning you're not losing an ounce of performance by playing on a laptop versus a PC. Video: How to choose a laptop in 2017 The GPU isn’t the only part that uses this machine’s Standard and Extreme options. The Intel Core i7-6820HK processor is a quad-core mobile processor with an unlocked multiplier, which means it can be overclocked. In Standard mode the 2.7GHz chip boosts to a modest peak of 3.2GHz, but in Extreme mode that improves to 3.8GHz – beyond Intel’s top speed for this part. Related: Intel Core i processors explained The rest of the G701VI’s specification is monstrous. This is the first time I’ve reviewed a laptop with 64GB of DDR4 memory, which is frankly overkill, and 953GB of storage comes from two high-end 512GB Toshiba SSDs in RAID 0. The only underwhelming area is connectivity: this near-£3,000 machine has standard 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Gigabit Ethernet, with no sign of gaming-focused Qualcomm Killer hardware. It's certainly not a must-have, but still a noticeable omission. This mighty specification brings the £2,880 Asus up against the Scan 3XS LG17 Carbon Extreme, which is a similarly chunky 17.3-inch notebook that also has a GTX 1080, but it pairs it with a desktop i7-6700K processor. The Scan has a more sensible 16GB of memory and an SSD and HDD setup, and it costs £2,550. For what it's worth, you can't configure that machine with 64GB of memory, so if that's something you want, the ROG on test here is a better bet. Sadly, there are no alternative specifications for the G701VI, so if you don’t like these components, that’s it. Related: Best Gaming Laptops Asus ROG G701VI – Design The 17.3in Asus is one of the most outlandish gaming laptops around. Coming from the Republic of Gamers range, though, that’s hardly a surprise. The thin screen has a huge logo and burnt orange slashes amid its brushed aluminium, and the area above the keyboard is a mix of more orange metal, Mayan-inspired patterns and an angled power button. The wrist-rest is a mix of aluminium and matte black plastic, the base has more Mayan artwork, and the beefy rear is covered with air vents. It certainly stands out more than the Scan, which was a modest machine made from dark metal. There’s no winner or loser here – design is subjective and both of these machines impress in their own ways. It’s easier to draw conclusions in other departments. The Asus weighs 3.8kg and is 35mm thick, which makes it thinner and lighter than the 39mm, 4.3kg Scan. However, the Asus is a little weaker – the screen is easy to bend, and there’s give in the wrist-rest. The Asus is still strong and I’m confident that it would shrug off being tossed in a bag and taken to a LAN party, but the Scan is positively bomb-proof. There’s another area where the Asus falls behind: interior access. It’s difficult to get inside the Asus, and cracking this machine open voids the warranty. Scan’s machine was easily accessible, and replacing easy-to-access components such as the RAM won't void the warranty. Related: Best Laptops Round-up Asus ROG G701VI – Keyboard and Trackpad Asus has installed a streaming button, five macro keys and even a switch to open its gaming software on this laptop, and the layout is good elsewhere: full-size keys, separated cursor buttons and a numberpad are all included. That’s a good start, but the chiclet keyboard can’t keep up the air of quality. It’s one of the softest I’ve used on a large gaming laptop, with a comfortable, squashy feel, modest travel and middling base strength. It's good for typing, but less so for gaming. The Scan 3XS LG17 Carbon Extreme had a traditional keyboard that’s much better for gaming despite its lack of macro keys: its buttons are snappier, with more travel and a firmer base. It’s a shame that the keyboard is a little underwhelming, because the trackpad is much better. It’s wide and smooth, with two high-quality buttons that have good speed and snap. Asus even includes its own USB mouse with this laptop, and it’s even closer to the speed and shallow click that I expect from the best gaming mice. This is a nice addition.

The first in this line of new Chromebooks come from Acer and Asus as the companies have launched their respective education-focused Spin 11 and C213 Chromebooks at the Bett education technology trade show in London. First, let's talk about the newly-launched Chromebooks. The Acer Chromebook Spin 11 sports an Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protected 11-inch HD IPS touchscreen display with a 360-degree dual-torque hinge to avoid wobbling. The display on Spin 11 comes with Wacom EMR (Electro-Magnetic Resonance) technology for improved compatibility with the stylus. Interestingly, Acer's new Chromebook Spin 11 has a MIL-STD 810G US military standard rating, which effectively means that the device has an impressive amount of durability. Depending on the variant, the Acer Chromebook Spin 11 packs either dual-core (N3350) or quad-core (N3450) Intel Celeron chipset, up to 8GB of RAM, and either 32GB or 64GB of flash storage. In terms of connectivity options, the Spin 11 comes with two USB-Type C ports, Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, a MicroSD card reader, and two USB 3.0 ports as well. The Acer Chromebook Spin 11 weighs 1.4kg and measures 296x206x20.5mm. The company claims that the Spin 11 has up to 10 hours of battery life. The Spin 11 comes with Google Play store out of the box. As of now, there is not much information available about the Asus C213 Chromebook but just like the Spin 11, it comes with a 2-in-1 design, USB Type-C, and Google Play store out-of-the-box, as pointed out in a report by 9to5Google. The pricing and availability of the new Chromebooks has not been announced but the devices are expected to be released in late Spring. Back to Google's new focus on the education sector. The company says it worked with educators and partners to design these two new Chromebooks in order to optimise them according to the needs of schools. The affordable stylus meant for these Chromebooks come with a "unique" eraser, Google said in its official blog post. The search giant points out that these low-cost styli don't need any charging or pairing and can therefore be easily replaced if lost. "We heard from educators that multiple chargers and slow charging wastes precious time for students. Going forward, all Chromebooks will have standard super-fast USB-C charging, so one Chromebook cart can charge any device quickly," Google said in its post. As Android apps are now available on Chromebooks, it makes sense for the company to make the Chromebooks more touch-friendly, which was not the case earlier. "In the coming weeks, Chromebook administrators will be able to create a library of approved Android apps and install them on select managed Chromebooks. Students will be able to access millions of Android apps, like Toontastic and Science Journal, for learning both online and offline," it added. Google has also announced creative apps on Chromebooks including WeVideo, Soundtrap, and Explain Everything. Apart from Acer and Asus, HP and Dell will also be announcing their new Chromebooks, as per Google. "With new apps, stylus and touch capabilities, we expect our partners will continue to build an even wider variety of Chromebooks in the future, including detachables and tablets," the company said.

Mobile by Shara Tibken January 24, 2017 11:39 AM PST @sharatibken Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) D.J. Koh, head of Samsung's mobile business, explains Sunday during a press conference in Korea what caused the Note 7 to overheat. Samsung For Samsung, it's not all about the Galaxy Note 7 -- at least not when it comes to financial results. Even as it faces a hit of more than $5 billion (spread across several quarters) from the death of its flawed phone, Samsung managed to post its best operating profit in three years. What it's benefiting from is strong demand for components that go inside mobile phones, TVs and other devices. Still, Samsung warned its overall earnings should slide in the first quarter as its mobile business faces higher marketing costs and as it sells fewer TVs. Its components businesses should continue to grow, though. Samsung may be best known as the world's biggest maker of phones and TVs, but it's also a major player in the semiconductor industry. It's the world's largest vendor of memory chips and the second biggest processor maker overall after Intel. Along with designing processors for some of its own devices, Samsung manufactures processors created by other companies, like wireless chip giant Qualcomm. See also Samsung answers burning Note 7 questions, vows better batteries Why Samsung is sticking with the Galaxy Note 8 Samsung, in a race to build your next smartphone chip, may just win "For 2016, Samsung achieved solid results despite the Note 7 discontinuation in the second half as a result of continuous efforts during past two to three years to strengthen its component business competitiveness by focusing on value-added products" and advancing its DRAM and V-NAND memory businesses, as well as its OLED display operations, the company said. The operating income for Samsung's semiconductor business soared 77 percent in the fourth quarter. Samsung said that in the mid- to long-term it expects the shift in the tech industry to focus on the internet of things, artificial intelligence and automotive to boost its components business. The company on Monday reported its overall fourth-quarter profit jumped 50 percent to 9.22 trillion won ($7.9 billion) as customers scooped up its memory chips and display panels. Sales were essentially flat at 53.3 trillion won ($45.8 billion). The profit in Samsung's mobile business also increased as customers sought out its nearly year-old Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, as well as its mid- to low-end phones. The Note 7 effect The Galaxy Note 7, one of Samsung's most high-profile phones, blew up in its face last fall, suffering multiple recalls and bans by airlines before flickering out with a final "death update" that essentially bricks the remaining units in the wild. Thousands of diehard Note 7 fans continue to hold onto their devices, but the vast majority -- 96 percent globally -- have been exchanged. The company on Sunday finally revealed what caused the Note 7 to overheat. The culprit proved to be two separate flaws with two separate batteries. One was a design flaw that led to the first recall. The second was a manufacturing error introduced after Samsung's second supplier ramped up production to meet demand as the sole Note 7 battery supplier. Explaining the Note 7's battery flaws (with cake) Bridget Carey finds a sweet way to illustrate Samsung's findings on why the Galaxy Note 7 overheated, and what the company is doing to prevent future battery failures. by Bridget Carey 2:31 Close Drag Fourth-quarter operating profit in Samsung's IT & mobile business rose 12 percent to 2.5 trillion won ($2.1 billion). Sales for the business slid 5.6 percent to 23.6 trillion won ($20.3 billion). By comparison, Samsung reported its worst operating profit in two years in the third quarter, the period when it recalled and then killed off its Note 7. Samsung's mobile division, the division responsible for the Note 7, reported an operating profit of 100 billion won ($87.8 million) in that quarter, a decline of about 96 percent and its lowest in nearly eight years. For its mobile business in 2017, Samsung expects slow growth in smartphone demand but said it will "continue to innovate both in software and hardware across its entire line-up and prioritize consumer safety. "Although the growth of the global smartphone market is expected to slow this year, new services such as artificial intelligence (AI) will be a differentiating factor," the company said in a press release. "The mobile business will seek to strengthen its leadership in the premium market and boost competitiveness of mid-to-low end smartphones by adding innovative features available in high-end models." That includes adding water resistance and fingerprint recognition to its cheaper phones. It also plans to expand Samsung Pay, Samsung Cloud and bring AI-based services to its premium smartphones. Overall, Samsung's net income more than doubled to 7.09 trillion won ($6.1 billion) in the fourth quarter. 18 Inside Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 testing lab Share your voice 0 comments Tags Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall Mobile Components Samsung Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall Samsung is in the middle of an active recall for the Galaxy Note 7 phone, which the company voluntarily recalled when a major battery flaw caused a small number of the phones to spontaneously explode and sometimes burst into flames, damaging property and leaking dangerous chemicals.

Verizon Communications is looking to maintain its position near the head of “5G” network development, noting it’s currently moving on “commercial-scale pilots” in about 10 different locations across the country. Speaking during the telecommunication operator’s fourth quarter conference call, Verizon EVP and CFO Matt Ellis said the carrier was moving onto the next phase of its 5G plans having concluded a number of technical trials and lab tests in 2016. The carrier had previously stated plans to begin commercial trials of next-generation wireless technologies in 2017, which are expected to revolve around a fixed-broadband use case. Verizon was one of the first domestic operators to announce its 5G network plans, unveiling efforts in late 2015 towards initial trials in 2016. The carrier has since moved on rolling out technical specifications for its vendor partners and is also in a bit of a battle with AT&T concerning standards timing. Verizon noted last summer it was seeing 5G network speed tests showing results in excess of one gigabit per second. However, research firm Mobile Experts recently released a case study on broadband-based 5G services focused on return on investment for deployments, noting current technology tied to the limited propagation characteristics of the 28 GHz band come up short in terms of supporting a business case. The firm said it calculated the potential ROI for operators investing in a pre-5G network using the 28 GHz band compared with LTE costs and “the potential costs for a sub-6 GHz network using 5G technology,” and found at “historical prices, 5G will not be successful.” To reach the necessary ROI, Mobile Experts said the market would need inexpensive access to large spectrum blocks. “The business case for 5G fixed broadband is not a slam dunk,” said Joe Madden, principal analyst at Mobile Experts. “We expect pre-5G deployment to be a very targeted investment by mobile operators, addressing very specific neighborhoods instead of nationwide deployment.” Madden noted millimeter wave links at 50 meters created a “challenge to the business case, because the number of customers served by each radio will be too small.” The firm noted links of at least 200 meters would be required to reach enough users to support sufficient ROI. “Link distance is a key factor in the pre-5G business case at 28 GHz,” Madden explained. “We’ve conducted some in-depth link budget calculations and compared our results to trial results reported by Samsung, Ericsson, Intel and others. Based on this deep technical work, we have some concerns about the power, linearity and heat dissipation in pre-5G infrastructure. The laws of physics will limit these pre-5G networks.” Mobile Experts noted the 28 GHz band and fixed wireless broadband services will be a starting point, “but a combination of low-band and high-band spectrum will be important to reach mobile gigabit performance.” Carriers have acknowledged the challenges of high-band spectrum for commercial wireless services. “If you put a hand in front of a transmitter you will see degradation of performance,” said Thomas Keathley, SVP of wireless network architecture and design at AT&T, during a panel discussion at the recent CTIA Super Mobility event. “It’s going to be a very different implementation than traditional cellular networks.” Adam Koeppe, VP of access technology planning at Verizon, noted that indeed propagation characteristics of high-band spectrum will be a challenge, but those “issues are not anything new.” Instead he noted what is different is the use of beamforming and beamtracking technology that allows the use of those bands in access-type deployments. “Our trials have been to take those out of the lab and into real world scenarios,” Koeppe said of the carrier’s 5G network trials. As for its eventual 5G deployment plans, Ellis attempted to provide some cost color on how the operator plans to use its technology and embedded infrastructure to support a business case for 5G. The embedded technology includes the fiber and spectrum assets it’s picking up from the acquisition of XO Communications, which is expected to close during the current first quarter. Verizon is also looking at early 5G deployments outside of its wireline footprint as a gateway to eventual commercial service offerings. Plans to bolster LTE ahead of 5G The move towards 5G could help Verizon alleviate some pressure on its current LTE network, which during Q4 of last year witnessed an approximate 49% increase in overall data traffic. Ellis noted the carrier was focusing its LTE spending on adding capacity using new technology, the continued refarming of spectrum assets and increased use of fiber for backhaul, which were central to Verizon Wireless rolling LTE-Advanced services in 2016, with expectations to further enhance the network this year. “We expect additional features to come through in the close of this year,” Ellis said. “And we will continue to expand our architecture. So within wireless you should expect to see the spending continue to move to make the network more efficient on a cost per-gig basis going forward.” Disappointing Q4 results Outside of updating its network plans, Verizon in general posted a disappointing operating quarter. The carrier posted a 57.3% year-over-year dive in direct connection additions for its wireless service, adding 582,000 total net connections during the most recent quarter. The growth involved 591,000 postpaid net additions, which came in below expectations and included just 167,000 net “phone” additions, and a loss of 9,000 prepaid customers, which was actually a significant improvement compared with the loss of 157,000 net prepaid connections in Q4 2015. For the full year, wireless growth dropped 45.5% to 2.2 million direct connection additions, with the carrier ending 2016 with 114.2 million direct connections on its network. The dip in growth was highlighted by an increase in customer churn from 1.23% in Q4 2015, to 1.34% in 2016, while postpaid churn increased above the 1% mark in the latest quarter to 1.1%. Customer spending was also challenged, with postpaid average revenue per account dropping 4.3% year-over-year to $141.89, but increased 2.9% when taking into account device payments. However, with device payments still a smaller percentage of overall revenues compared with services, Verizon Wireless’ total operating revenues dropped 1.5% in the quarter to just under $23.4 billion. For the full year, revenues were down 2.7% to $89.2 billion. Operating expenses for the quarter increased .8% to $17.1 billion, but were down 3.8% for the full year, which resulted in a 7.2% quarterly drop in operating income to $6.3 billion and a .4% full-year drop to $29.9 billion. Verizon management said it expects its financial picture to turn around beginning in 2018 as it drives deeper into transitioning its cost structure towards a greater reliance on device revenues, though had previously said it expected the change to begin in late 2017.

But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more black, Latino and female workers, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that haven’t changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts its large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a “pipeline problem,” meaning a shortage of woman and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, tech-industry employees and diversity advocates say there’s a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions of what makes for great tech employees — and that actively hampers diversity. “The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified,” says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don’t fit techie stereotypes aren’t “Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.” Miley, who is African-American, has previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and some early progress, Intel acknowledges there is “a great deal of work to be done.” Similar programs are everywhere throughout the tech industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs to sponsorships for coding boot camps to bias training and support groups. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can’t control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It’s not enough to release diversity reports and say, “Oh, not a lot has changed, but it’s the world, not us that’s the problem,” she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google’s 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they’re doing slightly better than the companies.

Devindra Hardawar, @devindra 01.25.17 in Personal Computing Comments 576 Shares Share Tweet Share Save This year marks a first for Dell's education-focused computer family: 2-in-1 laptops. Like the company's other computers destined for schools, the Dell Latitude and Chromebook 11 Convertibles are built to withstand classrooms and student abuse. They both sport the same basic design -- rubberized shock protection for falls, sealed keyboards to handle spills and lots of rounded corners -- but one runs Windows 10 and the other is powered by Chrome OS (we'll let you guess which is which). Gallery: Dell's 2017 Education Laptops | 8 Photos 8 +4 As with most convertibles -- including Dell's recent XPS 13 2-in-1 -- the new 11-inch laptops can be used in a traditional mode, folded in a tent formation, or have their screen wrapped all the way around like a tablet. Stylus-wise, they support Dell's optional Productivity Active Pen. The Latitude 11 Convertible will be powered by Intel's seventh-generation Pentium and Celeron chips, while the Chromebook model runs sixth-generation Celerons. Dell also redesigned its 11-inch and 13-inch Latitude and Chromebook laptops with a slimmer, more minimalist look. They're also built to withstand falls and spills, and they've received the requisite processor upgrades over the last generation. Once again, the Windows versions will get more CPU options, with seventh-generation Intel Pentium and Celeron chips for the Inspiron 11 and newer Core i5 processors for the Inspiron 13. The Chromebook variants, meanwhile, are stuck with sixth-gen Celerons (the Chromebook 13 also has a Core i3 option). All of the company's new education laptops will be available on February 7th. The Latitude and Chromebook 11 Convertibles will start at $579 and $349, respectively. The traditional Latitude and Chromebook 11 laptops, meanwhile, will start out at $349 and $219. And the flagship Latitude and Chromebook 13 models will go for $519 and $299. As usual, Chromebooks are an enticing deal for schools that want to get as many computers as possible in their classrooms. In other news, Dell also announced two new Interactive Touch 4K displays, a 55-inch and 86-inch model. They follow in the footsteps of the company's 70-inch 1080p touch display, and they're meant to offer more options for educators who want to have a large collaborative screen for their classes and meetings. They pack in DisplayPort and VGA connections for plugging in computers, as well as the expected HDMI ports (three for the 55-inch and four for the 86-inch). They'll be available on March 30th below $5,000 and $11,000, respectively (we still don't have an exact price).

The laptop is fittingly named the Chromebook 11 Convertible. It’s destined for schools, so its form is really the catchiest thing about it. It has a generation-old Intel Celeron processor; its keyboard and trackpad are “fully sealed” to protect against spills; and it has a “rubberized trim” to improve its shock resistance — it’s going to be in schools after all, so it better be able to take a fall. Google is very into convertible Chromebooks this year A model running Windows 10 and including a newer processor, stylus support, and a world-facing camera for tablet mode will be available as well, but it’ll be known as the Latitude 11 Convertible. Both versions launch February 7th, with the Chrome OS model selling for $349 and the Windows model for $579. Dell’s announcement comes right alongside Google’s renewed push to get Chromebooks into schools. Just yesterday, Acer and Asus both announced 11-inch convertible Chromebooks of their own, with one even supporting a stylus. It seems like Google has some ideas about what Chromebooks should be bringing to the table this year, and now it has a few partners getting that configuration out there. Alongside the Chromebook 11 Convertible, Dell also announced the Chromebook 11 and Chromebook 13, which are Chrome OS incarnations of existing Windows laptops that go under the names Latitude 11 and Latitude 13. Those two Latitude models are getting updated with new processors. The Chromebooks will have older processors but sell at a lower price. Those four laptops launch February 7th as well. The Chromebook 11 is $219, the Latitude 11 is $349, the Chromebook 13 is $299, and the Latitude 13 is $519. Update and correction, January 25th, 12:14PM ET: Dell initially indicated that the Chromebook 11 Convertible supported a stylus and world-facing camera, but after publication, a representative for the company informed us that both features would only be available on the Windows version of the device.

Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" Constructive criticism 5 things I'd fix with the Surface Studio By Daniel Rubino Tuesday, Jan 24, 2017 at 12:01 pm EST 77 Comments Last week I gave my review of the Surface Studio. There's still more to the story as I now have the high-end version with the NVIDIA GTX 980m GPU in the office. That version doubles the video memory from 2 to 4GB and gives a nice boost to graphics. We'll have a showdown in gaming and benchmarks between the two as well as the SSD upgrade, but for now, I just want to share a few things that Microsoft should do for the Surface Studio 2. Preface In my review, I noted how the overall concept of the Studio was a hit. I think Microsoft spent a lot of time agonizing over detail, quality and making a 'wow' product and they 100% succeeded. The issue I have is some of the internal hardware seems a bit of an afterthought. Of course, it's not without reason why the Surface Studio's guts are those of a high-end laptop. Cost, thermal considerations, size, overall design, and general engineering constraints limit what Microsoft can do with the goals they sought to achieve. Nonetheless, I reserve the right to complain about what I think are some drawbacks from what is otherwise an engineering marvel – just one of the perks of my job! This article is not so much second guessing either as I am confident that the intended audience of this product – creative professionals – will also want these improvements. 1. USB Type-C with Thunderbolt 3 My number one thing I would change with the Surface Studio would be the omission of a USB Type-C port supporting Thunderbolt 3. Why prioritize that over other things in this list? It's simple: Type-C with Thunderbolt 3 is very powerful – yet relatively cheap. With it, you could, in theory, you can use an external GPU (eGPU) of your choice. That means you can buy the Studio and continually upgrade its graphics card based on your budget and needs whenever you want. That kind of future-proofing passes the costs on to the consumer but also breathes a few extra years into the Studio. Thunderbolt 3 would also be enable use of the Surface Studio as just a display. For now, you cannot do that as it only does display out and not display in. The Microsoft-provided options of an NVIDIA 965m or 980m are anemic for a desktop PC designed for animators, artists, and creatives but with an eGPU, you could, in theory, boost the Studio up to a GTX 1080. You'll lose some of that juice with the Type-C cable, but it would still be a massive jump in performance. You can't just throw Type-C though on to any system as you need a modern motherboard and processor to support the technology. That's where it gets a bit complicated. External GPUs are still very new and quirky, which is likely one reason Microsoft held off on it for the Studio. A Surface Studio 2 though with USB Type-C, Thunderbolt 3, and an eGPU could be a lot of fun, though! 2. Offer a pure SSD option Obvious confession here, but… I'm a bit of a hardware snob. I feel sorry for those who must use a hard disk drive in 2017, especially the slow 5400 RPM SATA II utilized in the Surface Studio. Microsoft makes this situation a bit better by using a faster SSD for the OS with some extra storage to boot. This setup is what's called an Intel Rapid Hybrid Drive as it's basically like a RAID 0 setup, but with two different storage technologies. The OS sees it just as a single C: drive, but performance can vary from somewhat quick to slow depending on where what is stored. I get why companies use Rapid Hybrid Drive setups: cost. It's literally in between a straight HDD installation and an SSD one, but you can also get a lot of storage space. It's certainly better than a pure HDD solution. iFixit reveals the Surface Studio 5400 RPM HDD Dell learned their lesson with their all-in-one the XPS 27. That too had a hybrid drive years ago, and it still does for the new 2017 version. The difference is Dell is now offering just a full SSD option for those will pay for it. I like that approach. Pass the cost on to the consumer that is willing to shoulder that cost. The thing is the Surface Studio starts at $3,000 and goes up to $4,200. That's absurd, but fair for the product. If you're already pondering dropping $4200 on a PC getting you to "splurge" for a high-end SSD is an easy sell. Ironically, going with just a pure SSD would have saved room in the Studio's tightly packed base. They could have used that for better cooling or an improved GPU. 3. Get a better GPU File this under obvious, but the GPUs used in the Surface Studio are…underwhelming. Sure, a GTX 965m for the Surface Book is one thing, but in a full desktop for creatives? Try doing 3D anything with a GTX 965m and 2GB of video memory. The GTX 980m with 4GB of VRAM is a step in the right direction, but still a bit weak for what is a 4.5K display. Again, Microsoft was dealing with timelines and thermal constraints. Re-engineering the Surface Studio for NVIDIA's Pascal 10 series GPUs is not something you just do overnight. Nonetheless, talk to any tech person or creative professional, and they will tell you that at least a GTX 1060 would have been the bee's knees for the Surface Studio. For now, unless you don't care about performance I would steer clear of the 965m altogether and just for the 980m option. Too bad that means you are forced to buy the top-end $4,200 Surface Studio to get it. 4. Desktop CPUs This recommendation goes under the same explanations for the GPU, which is heat and cost consideration. The Surface Studio uses an Intel quad-core processor (good), but they are the ones designed for laptops (bad). Heat dissipation map of the Surface Studio under load Is it too much to ask to have a Surface Studio with a Core i7 and 65W to hit that 4GHz range? It was likely a problem with the small base of the Studio, so Microsoft will have to rethink it for the Surface Studio 2 – maybe make the base bigger to fit in better thermal management bits? I'm not even talking about having to wait for the 7th Generation Intel Kaby Lake processors, as a Core i7-6700 would have been just fine. 5. Make it modular The original patent for the Surface Studio hinted at a modular system. The benefit of this would be clear for an all-in-one: future upgradability. All-in-ones are amazing because they're so clean and minimal. The downside is you cannot upgrade them so after a few years they begin to wane. Being able to swap out the CPU, GPU, RAM, or even add new features lets Microsoft offer it for lower prices and lets the user have some control. Making the Surface Studio modular – or any all-in-one for that matter – is not easy. That's why no one else has done it yet. Not to mention modules bring their own issues, including future-proofing, availability, etc. Microsoft would have to lock-in to a system and stay there for it to work and that's a significant risk. But hey, we can dream, right? The bottom line The Surface Studio is a fantastic creation, but there is a lot of room for improvement. That's fine. It's a Gen-1 product with purposefully limited availability. Microsoft will learn from what people want and adjust going forward. I also get how the Surface Studio is more iMac than Mac Pro, but even the iMac offers pure SSD storage and a Core i7-6700K solution to consumers. That's all I'm asking for here: some choices when purchasing. See at Microsoft Store Did I miss anything? Am I being too harsh? Let me know what you think in comments! Like us!

Could that be a workaround for the inability to connect it directly or would lag be an issue? 0 2 days ago Reply Steve Adams Daniel, Thanks for giving honest, truthful reviews.  Your counterpart on imore, Rene, is the complete opposite.   If Microsoft screws up,  you call it.   He will come up with some wacky reason that it's exactly what apple tried to do and give silly reasons.    Thanks again for not being blind to the brand.  0 2 days ago Reply L0n3N1nja Only thing that bothers me is the GPU paired with that insane display resolution and the hard drive. Oh and the lack of USB C, every new device should be USB C only or include both types, not stick with the outdated. 0 2 days ago Reply Reflexx Put two side buttons on the pen and make them programmable. 0 2 days ago Reply jasongw Big item you missed: make the studio's display available *by itself* so people can buy that awesome screen and connect it to any PC they want. 0 3 days ago Reply Kieran Jeffery I think that this particular device is squarely aimed at being a digital drawing board with basic PC functionality on the side. for draughtsmen and digital art only. Maybe making 3D models, but surely if you need the level of detail that this provides, your going to have other dedicated computers for rendering and interpolating animations. Basically, it's not built to be your all-encompassing PC, but targeted more to those that have everything else, and just need a better surface to draw on. In which case, everything spec wise is more than adequate. By this time next year, half a dozen OEM's will have created a display that can connect to other computers and do all of the good stuff this can do. Again, with the modular thing and upgradeability. The main selling point is clearly the display, and in 2-3 years, you'll be looking at something 8-10k with probably some new display tech as well. The monitor will become as redundant as the rest of the parts would be my guess. Especially as every 6 months there seems to be something new coming to display technology. 0 3 days ago Reply Wevenhuis Sounds reasoable. i wouldn't consider the surafce studio a gaming device though, but thinking ahead for device upgradability to me sounds like a positive attitude and challenging ring ro it for the surface line. 0 3 days ago Reply Jose_Rey There are all in ones that you can upgrade actually. There's a few of them, but I think they all use the same shell(Samsung Screen and 450W power supply). There's the Omni, The Aura, Maingear Alpha, and the one I just ordered...The Arcus 34. I wished someone would've just sold me the shell, so I could've transfer my old system to the it, but alas, no cigar. It's the first of its kind and hopefully not the last. Everything in it is industry standard stuff. 0 3 days ago Reply Jules W So how come Daniel can afford a Surface Studio, but misery guts Paul Thurott can't and so keeps harping on about the price being too expensive. Too much time playing on Xbox I guess. 1 3 days ago Reply Chris_Kez Could be that Paul has a mortgage, two kids and is unusually rational (for a tech writer) about the cost of stuff. 1 3 days ago Reply Tarkus13 He wants MS to give him one, but they know he's probably going bash it, so funny they haven't done so yet. "Here, let me give you this product that you can rip to shreds in your review." 0 3 days ago Reply gerzhwin Daniel, I think you perfectly hit the top 5 things to improve the Studio. I only want to add that MSFT ist definitely playing a safe game here, and for a good reason: First gen product means issues for sure, so they made the best out of what they now, can handle, and send to production. Fail fast in mind, this is a reasonable descision, with a secure basis for customer satisfaction. Also, after/while finishing Studio they improved the Book's Basis because they achieved the knowledge to do so. 1 3 days ago Reply aXross I also think why that they have to recoup the R&D cost making this product. It really feels like this was being design like 2 years ago based on the specs given. Type-C Thunderbolt, and Pascal GPU were indicative that these were not really the latest they can get. They even haven't addressed the lack of tilt support on Pen which is highly requested and fix the jittery issue. Which is maybe why the cost is so high especially with limited production. 0 2 days ago Reply Dush Ku yeah that was odd they didn't make the base slightly bigger and include an actual desktop class cpu, since it's a desktop 1 3 days ago Reply fdruid I guess the GPU could be better. The CPU too. But to be honest, not every machine can be ultra-cutting edge. There's always a compromise and that compromise is part of design. I understand the Studio is a great device that delivers performance power for what it was designed for. Now, it's not a PC for anybody and it's not for any use either. So not being ultra powerful in terms of raw processing (CPU) or not having the fastest GPU or SDD ever for gaming is not really something negative. Again, not every computer can have the 100% peak specs. 0 3 days ago Reply Sin Ogaris The problem is that the Studio is designed for professionals, but Audio and Video (especially video) would be much better suited elsewhere. I'm sure its great for drawing, CAD and photography, but that's a smaller market than those who actually want, or could benefit from, a device like this. 0 3 days ago Reply JaimitoFrog I think they did shoot for that smaller market, and likely succeeded. If anything, got the right tech attention. Perhaps gen 2 device will cater to a larger general use market. They don't want to fail like surface RT again and eat 1 billion loss. By all accounts, i think they succeeded with SS in demonstrating innovation, creating a new category, improved company reputation, generated a buzz among tech industry, and made a profit. 3 3 days ago Reply aXross Which I think also the point and quite forgivable. For a first-gen, this is still pretty great product. Even reviewers who used to review high-performance computers especially with criteria of performance -to-price ratio praised it with few criticisms of course. This is why its so important to make it right by 2nd gen. Even Surface Book suffer from "first-gen" syndrome. The good thing is that they still get great first impression which is really important since it last a while and defines the brand. Hopefully they will address which can potentially make people truly impress to the product. 1 2 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi Good points. 0 2 days ago Reply milkybuet I agree with all five points, but lets be real here, it's really just one opint. Surface Studio needs to become a proper desktop PC if Microsoft markets it as such. It can keep the lustre and still be a viable long term solution. 2 3 days ago Reply Philippe Majerus "Making the Surface Studio modular – or any all-in-one for that matter – is not easy. That's why no one else has done it yet.​" Yeah, I can't wait for 2012 to come around and HP to introduce a modular and field-upgradable all-in-one workstation. ​http://www.hp.com/go/z1 2 3 days ago Reply Sin Ogaris I've mentioned it in other SS articles but it really does look like the Studio was a device designed last generation and released this generation. Hopefully when they release the inevitable version 2 they ensure it is current so that heavy professional use (outside of photography and auto cad) can become viable. 0 3 days ago Reply rjmlive USB-C changes everything, it's essentially necessary in a product >2016.  I suspect we'll see 2 C's and 2 A's. Better GPU yes, and will make external GPU less necessary.  I wonder if an AMD solution would be relevant to coincide with the Xbox Scorpio? Desktop CPU.. not sure.  Heat.  Noise.  I think they will have to consider a different base design, but they migh thave shoehorned themselves becasue of the monitor tilt.  It should probalby be thicker with better thermal management if they upgrade the CPU. HDD / SSD.. well with no cost restrictions it would be great to see EVO 950 PRO or equivalent, I just don't suspect that will be the case.  It would be nice to see it at least match the MBP speeds.  The EVO 960 is better value/speed but a serious hit to longevity and that would be very bad PR in a couple years when power users see their device failing.  Apple is apparently going to come out with a new MAC for ludicrous money no doubt, I think MS should take the lead and just offer everything a person could want at highest configuration, price be damned. 2 3 days ago Reply Steve Adams My changes would be, Pure SSD of 2TB, audio Subwoofer out, HDMI in, so you could use other devices on the sweet monitor, and change the 2 of the USB C to USB A, I have a lot of equipment that use USB A. Other than that....GOOD TO GO! Oh, yes, and MAX ram at more than 32. 0 3 days ago Reply spyderzWPC Ram was my issue, being limited to 32 gigs of ram would kill my productivity.  I have used 32 gigs of ram for over 4 years now.  I ended up building a system to put in 64 gigs.  If I am going to be doing heavy audio/video multi tracking, plus I run a bunch of vms I can see the system dragging in a year with all the new updates coming out.   0 3 days ago Reply aXross Well to begin with the CPU and GPU isn't even much of a horse power to benefit the such higher RAM. Though don't get me wrong, if there is a bigger option, the better. But yeah it needs to be paired with other components to really benefit the higher memory even better. 0 2 days ago Reply Sean D. And as usual, 99% of the people commenting here wouldn't have a thought one way or the other if the article didn't offer an opinion. But it will be described as "honest" (not saying it's not) simply because it's not 'praising' a Microsoft product. 1 3 days ago Reply Chris_Kez If they got it perfect the first time, we armchair engineers would have nothing to complain about. ;) 4 3 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi 😊 0 2 days ago Reply Chris_Kez Fan noise and related thermal constraints are huge considerations when you're going to be leaning over this thing in drafting mode, pen in hand, face close to the Studio. 0 3 days ago Reply Daniel Rubino Absolutely. To solve that the base could have been wider to accommodate larger, slower fans. I get it though they had goals for its design e.g. small, tight, minimal, etc. 1 3 days ago Reply Chris_Kez Some would say MS has too many large, slow fans. 1 3 days ago Reply netmann No they would not... 1 3 days ago Reply aXross That seem exaggerated. I don't think people wouldn't even care if the fans are still pretty silent anyways. Especially for its price, you get something a bit more to justify the overall cost. You really need something more beefier to drive that 4.5K resolution while working on some huge projects. It's a fine balance between fan noise , heat and raw power. So I see its a bug challenge. Though I don't think people were really asking for such a small base to begin with. A slightly a wider one wouldn't hurt and probably isn't even that noticeable. 0 2 days ago Reply Reynaldo Navedo I believe you are right everything comes down to the high price you are paying for. Definitely. Hopefully next year prices might cut into half so I can get one. Hahaha. 1 3 days ago Reply mase123987 It kind of sound like everything is good except the specs, which is a rather large portion.  I can't imagine spending a few thousand on a computer and felling like it is under powered. 1 3 days ago Reply peterfares They should just release a version that doesn't have a computer built into the base and just has DisplayPort IN and USB (for touch) ports. And A USB-C port that does both DisplayPort and touch data.  0 3 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi Display wouldn't be so slim then, right? You'd have to include the hardware components for the ports and it would change/muddle the standard of the 20-degree drafting feature (remember the core audience are artists). 0 2 days ago Reply netmann The main issue is the size of the base. If the base was 1 inch higher (thicker) and a few inches wider, and had pure ssd interfere upgradable to Samsung 960 pro, and had a raised angled slot on its motherboard for a discrete graphic card I would buy one immediately! 2 3 days ago Reply Daniel Rubino Problem with the height is it interferes with the display coming down; the height is kind of the max right now to get that 20 degree angle. But wider, sure. 2 3 days ago Reply Chris_Kez Make it too wide and you might have to tweak the hinge and the support assembly. Make it really wide and it just looks fugly. 1 3 days ago Reply JaimitoFrog Also harder to swivel the base when you want to present it or adjust another angle. 1 3 days ago Reply aXross I don't think so, with the display so huge, the proportion should be just right. It will still look great as I imagine it and I personally quite critical in terms of look and feel with products (I simply don't like working with not-so-good looking things both hardware and software, which is why I critic the Windows 10 design iconsistencies and odd aesthetic choices at times). ​Also it doesn't have to be too wide, just wide enough for better components and cooling allowance to fit. 0 2 days ago Reply aXross Yeah they should just increase the width instead. You can spread out the components to accomodate more. The new HP Spectre AIO for example have very wide base (though the reason is most likely for speakers) and still quite slim. ​With this display so huge, I think the base can be bit wider shouldn't hurt. It doesn't really cost so much space even with wider base.   0 2 days ago Reply collins2k1 The article misses the main problem, why is there a computer attached to this wonderful monitor? 2 3 days ago Reply Daniel Rubino I think there are complications in making it a stand alone display and still have the G5 co-processors for touch/inking working consistently. I think they really wanted an "all in one experience" with guaranteed performance. I see the point, of course, I just think there are some other issues. 2 3 days ago Reply Sean D. Seriously?? WTF is the point of creating an AIO with no computer?  1 3 days ago Reply Tom Westrick To plug in a beefier computer that doesn't use laptop parts 0 3 days ago Reply aXross In short it will be just a graphic display, not a PC. I think we should just pass it along to hopefully have OEMs that already makes monitors to make a standalone graphic display based on Surface Studio tech (that if MS will license it). On the other hand, we should wish that Surface Studio must be beefier and have more updated specs to actually worth its value given its high asking price. Thing is, the this PC is just even bit anemic for what it does since they put 4.5K display that is focused on digital media, which is still more demanding than typing couple of reports using Word. 0 2 days ago Reply Fred Leeson In terms Daniel of what would provide most bang for the buck I would argue that your first two suggestions are by far the most important. The USB type C port is a no-brainer for the reasons you mention and no other single change to the hardware other than fitting an SSD (m2, natch) would have such an immediate and comprehensive effect on the total performance of the system. 1 3 days ago Reply aXross Indeed, a Type-C Thunderbolt should be a standard among premium PCs these days. Especially when this PC costing at least 3,000 USD and could be more on other countries. I think it is just right to ask for more with this kind of pricing, despite to let's say "specialized userbase". Artist also deserve something more on the specs too that values the cost. What it bothers me most is not just really about including a Hard Drive on this expensive PC, but choosing a slower 5400 RPM drive instead of 7200 RPM. If they want to go with Hard Drive, they should at least choose the fastest out there as far as I know. But yeah, thtey should just at least go with full SSD for higher tier model. Even working with digital art and still photos requires fast I/O drive which benefits to the workflow and saves time. Especially that files were dealing with would be quite large in size and tons of them. 0 2 days ago Reply ThreeOnTheTree Oh, and thank you for the very honest reviews of SS. Your points are well thought out, and the concerns are completely valid on a premium product like this one.  3 3 days ago Reply Daniel Rubino Thanks, cheers. 2 3 days ago Reply aXross Thanks for this article too. It is undeniably a great product (most reviews was quite positive despite the shortcomings), but yeah it deserves to have constructive criticism hoping that MS will hear loud and clear and address the shortcomings and issues next version. The points are indeed something needs addressing, though I kinda wish there was bit more like the Memory Card placement which should be at the front, even a single Type-A USB also sould a front at least, Surface Dial grip needs improvement, and Pen Tilt which many artist was asking for a long time, especially that it is more obvious than mere pen-pressure. 0 2 days ago Reply ThreeOnTheTree It's a mixed bag of specs. It's expensive, and the screen is ultra premium, but that can all be negated by the slower internals. It's a tough investment to make knowing you have few upgrades available with most of the internals. When it comes down to workstations, price is a relatively easy concession to make if the hardware is right, and SS seems like it would be an absolute lock if they had made it modular. That display is good enough to last a few generations beyond the internals, but the SS is basically dead in the water once user demand exceeds the hardware. I would definitely wait for Gen 2, when I bet most of these issues will get resolved.  0 3 days ago Reply The Extreme G 6. Allow me to use it as monitor. At LEAST let other MS devices like the Surface Pro/Book use it as a second display. 2 3 days ago Reply Daniel Rubino That falls under #1 with USB Type C port and I specifically mention that. 4 3 days ago Reply The Extreme G Well damn, I missed that little part. 0 3 days ago Reply arend86 although this technically works and i think this is also possible on a mac i was wondering if you are sure that this also works with a windows 10 device that was not setup to receive input video meant as direct monitor video input? i also would prefer this device as a monitor only setup btw. 0 3 days ago Reply crise How about the puck not sliding down? -1 3 days ago Reply Daniel Rubino That is not a universal experience and can be alleviated by cleaning the puck and or display. Yes, it could be better, but I consider the 5 things here of higher priority. 3 3 days ago Reply crise But the puck is 'the unique experience', every other hardware aspect you mention is just a performance thing like with every device on the planet. The next surface studio will obviously get more powerful and you can always wish for faster equipment. The real area where the surface studio needs to shine is in its unique experience. The puck and pen experience should be perfected. Otherwise it's just another desktop pc. 2 3 days ago Reply Daniel Rubino But the Surface Dial does not even come with the Studio. They could do a version 2 of the Surface Dial and problem solved so I do not see how that fits here at all. 2 3 days ago Reply crise Well that is exactly the first thing they need to fix. Include it. 1 3 days ago Reply Tarkus13 So you think either they should eat the cost (not likely), or make everyone pay for a Dial, whether they want it or not (more likely). 0 3 days ago Reply crise If you can pay 4000 euro you can pay for a freakin dial. -1 3 days ago Reply Daniel Rubino You haven't made the case as to why Microsoft should force the Dial on anyone. It's an accessory, not required. They could even forgo the Pen. 2 3 days ago Reply Kieran Jeffery The dial isn't really meant to sit on the screen anyway, surely. You just pop it on to use it then pop it off again. It does absolutely nothing without you interacting with it, does it? Like a compass or a rule, you only put them on the paper when your are using them, then they go off to the side. If you're really hung up on the fact the dial slides down the screen, I would say that you haven't really gotten the point of the dial. 1 3 days ago Reply aXross Thing is they actually encourage and advertise you to put it on top of the display. Also I think having the Dial on the display gives more direct interaction and feeling on using the peripheral. But yeah, I think the point really is to address the grip of the Dial on top of the display. It's really annoying when it kept sliding even on your peripheral vision. Not to mention that the On-Screen Dial UI doesn't smoothly track the Dial position on the display, you get this choppy feeling that gives more attention. 0 2 days ago Reply aXross [Duplicated Comment] 0 2 days ago Reply aXross Though I think its still worth to mention that Dial grip should be improved, that also includes the software which the Dial UI doesn't even smoothly track, thus you get the choppy motion of sliding down continuously. In regards to Pen experience there is still few things needs to get addressed such as the lack of tilt support which is way more beneficial than pen-pressure, and the bitter that is still bit apparent especially on certain apps. Though it was said its tiny bit improved from Surface Book. 0 2 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi True Dan. A version 2 (which I expect from that nagging slide feedback) would find a way around that because the Dial needs to be able to stay on the Studio's screen (no-limit creativity). 0 2 days ago Reply Kyle Stilkey I think the gpu is the biggest issue I have. You can just replace the drive with a better one (sadly limited to the SATAII speeds) and the intel laptop chips do ok with the current gen stuff, but I agree fully it should at least have been a desktop chip even if it had to run slower due to heating. 2 3 days ago Reply collins2k1 Nar, sounds like the issue is why does your awesome monitor come with a GPU, would be great as a monitor then you have whatever pc you want. -1 3 days ago Reply bellyer The Studio should be able to take advantage of SATA III speeds, as the Studio has connectors for SATA III.  The issue is that the hard drive that comes in the Studio is a SATA II.  I have a 2 TB SSD with SATA III arriving tomorrow that I will be putting into my Studio this week.  Here's hoping that it gives the performance boost I'm expecting. 1 3 days ago Reply Yangstax Just selling the display as a standalone unit with a universal docking station as the base.  Let users worry about the upradability of their PC boxes. 1 3 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

McIntyre January 22, 2017 8:11 am EST Print Email Tweet Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares are up 3.61% to $120 so far this year, the best of any Dow Jones Industrial Average, and well ahead of the index itself which has risen 0.33% to 19,827.25. The improvement comes just ahead of earnings, which will post on January 31 (Apple recently sued chip maker Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) for monopolistic practices.) By way of contrast, Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) shares are down 0.4% to $30.10. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) shares are up 0.97% to $62.74. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) shares are up 1.85% to $36.94. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) shares are up 2.75% to $170.55. The rise is the continuation of a trend which is over a year old. During the last year, the stock has risen 20.69%, much of its after Apple’s last earnings report. The battle over the share price will stack up, once again, to iPhone sales. The consensus of analysts is that Apple sold 78 million iPhones in the December quarter. The excitement about Apple’s future and one of the reasons its share price is higher draws from anticipation of the iPhone 8. According to Business Insider, there may be a huge leap forward in smartphone technology when the iPhone 8 launches. The business website reported on January 18 Apple’s next iPhone could include “some form of facial/gesture recognition,” according to a research note distributed to clients by Cowen and Company on Wednesday. The note includes several new details about Apple’s upcoming iPhone, which is expected to launch in September. “Other features appear to include some form of facial/gesture recognition supported by a new laser sensor and an infrared sensor mounted near the front-facing camera and, as expected, should also finally include wireless charging,” Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote. A new kind of depth sensor has not yet been seriously rumored to be in the upcoming iPhone, but it makes sense. Apple bought Primesense, an infrared sensor company, in 2013 — and a new kind of sensor would be critical for Apple to add augmented reality features to upcoming versions of the iPhone. Pessimists about Apple’s future have often said that the iPhone’s features change too little as each version is released. That may be about to change.

Final Fantasy XV to receive monster encyclopedia in future update Free update for Final Fantasy 15 will add an encyclopedia showing monster weaknesses and dropped items. By Zachary Lyons on 24 January 2017   Many Final Fantasy games in the past have featured glossaries that detail monsters and enemies you’ve defeated, from the Bestiary in Final Fantasy Origins to the Enemy Intel in the Datalog of Final Fantasy XIII. Now it would appear Final Fantasy XV will be receiving a similar treatment, according to a recent interview with director Hajime Tabata. Japanese publication Entertainment Station asked Tabata directly, “Are there plans for a monster encyclopedia-like item that shows information such as a monster’s weaknesses and dropped items?” He responded, “There are plans. As for when, please look forward to further information.” Similar to the rest of Final Fantasy XV’s upcoming patches and DLC, it sounds like there may be a bit of a wait, but it’s always nice to have something to look forward to. Final Fantasy XV is currently available for PS4 and Xbox One. Check out our review here. Source: Gematsu Deals on eBay NEW!

But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more black, Latino and female workers, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, two per cent of Googlers were black and three per cent were Hispanic, numbers that haven't changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts its large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a "pipeline problem," meaning a shortage of woman and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, tech-industry employees and diversity advocates say there's a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions of what makes for great tech employees — and that actively hampers diversity. "The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified," says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don't fit techie stereotypes aren't "Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Appley enough or Twitter-y enough." Miley, who is African-American, has previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and some early progress, Intel acknowledges there is "a great deal of work to be done." Similar programs are everywhere throughout the tech industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs to sponsorships for coding boot camps to bias training and support groups. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can't control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It's not enough to release diversity reports and say, "Oh, not a lot has changed, but it's the world, not us that's the problem," she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as under-represented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. Diversity isn't just about fairness. It's about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products "will not appeal to a large population," says Lillian Cassel, chair of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related tech missteps: • Snapchat's release of two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface (one later withdrawn after public outcry, the other had "expired" and the company said it won't put it back into circulation); • Airbnb initially taking no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black (corrected after an outcry); • Twitter taking nearly a decade to tackle the vile harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece, Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urges companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise "we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future." Silicon Valley startups like to talk about "culture fit" — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate's attitude and behaviour meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they "hire what they know," says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley.
