The Nitro 5 stands out, as if offers both Intel and AMD hardware, plus an entry-level GPU. On Thursday, Acer introduced a handful of new products just days ahead of the Computex tech conference in Taipei. The company revealed four mobile devices in all: one laptop, one 2-in-1, and two Iconia-branded Android tablets. The specific hardware details weren’t made available at the time of this post’s publication, so we’ve pieced together what each product will bring to these markets through the company’s three announcements. Acer Nitro 5 This is a laptop focused on PC gaming that will be sold in multiple configurations. What’s interesting is that Acer addresses its Intel and AMD customer bases with this specific unit. The Intel configurations will pack a seventh-generation Core i5 and i7 processor that’s paired with up to a discrete Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphics chip.  Meanwhile, AMD-based configurations will include the company’s seventh-generation A-Series FX, A12, and A10 APUs along with up to a discrete Radeon RX 550 graphics chip. “The Nitro 5 features dual fans with Acer Coolboost technology, which delivers heightened fan speeds and cooling ability, and allows users to manually control the cooling process when heavy use requires an added boost,” Acer says. Here are the other details we pulled from the announcement: Display: 15.6 inches Panel type: IPS Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 System memory: Up to 32GB DDR4 @ 2,400MHz Storage: SSD maximum – 512GB (PCIe) HDD maximum – 2TB (SATA) Some configurations will include both Ports: 1x Gigabit Ethernet 1x USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C 1x USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-A (charges) 2x USB 2.0 Type-A 1x HDMI 2.0 (supports 90Hz refresh) Connectivity: Wireless AC (2×2) (up to 867Mbps) Keyboard: Red back-lighting WASD keys outlined in red Other details: Matte black with a hairline finish Red hinge along the back Bold black grill vent Touchpad outlined in red Acer Spin 1 Next up we have the Acer Spin 1, the company’s latest thin-and-light 2-in-1 Windows 10 device, measuring just 0.55 inches thin and weighting at 2.76 pounds. Arriving in several configurations, this laptop will be powered by a seventh-generation Intel Pentium or Celeron processor, and a battery promising up to eight hours on a single charge. “With a sleek all-metal chassis, the Windows 10 device is lightweight, portable, and supports Windows Ink through an Acer Active Stylus for creative users on the go,” the company says. “The Spin 1 combines superb hardware with innovative features to make the user experience really pop.” While Acer did not provide pricing with its press release, it’s fair to say this will be an affordable model. The Acer Spin 3 starts at $500. Here’s what we have on the Acer Spin 1 so far: Display: 11.6 inches Panel type: IPS with Touch support Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 System memory: 4GB DDR3L Storage: 32GB / 64GB / 128GB Ports: 1x USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-A 1x USB 2.0 Type-A 1x HDMI 1x Micro SD card slot Connectivity: Wireless AC (2×2) (up to 867Mbps) Bluetooth 4.1 Audio: 2x speakers supported by Acer TrueHarmony Other details: Precision touchpad Acer Bluelight Shield tech Supports Acer’s Active Stylus Acer Iconia Tab 10 & One 10 Finally, we have two new tablets under the Iconia umbrella: the premium Iconia Tab 10 (A3-A50) and the productivity-focused Iconia One 10 (B3-A40FHD). Acer wasn’t exactly forthcoming with the hardware details at the time this article went live, but the company said that both will be powered by a quad-core MediaTek processor, Android 7.0, and a battery promising up to eight hours of use on a single charge. Additionally, both tablets sport 10-inch screens backed by In-Plane Switching technology, which is also used in the two previously-mentioned laptops. Other shared features include two five-magnet speakers powered by DTS-HD Premium Sound, and Wireless AC connectivity. Here are a few notes regarding the exclusive features of each model: Iconia Tab 10 (A3-A50) Quantum Dot display technology Acer-patented subwoofer Measures just 0.35 inches thin Acer MediaMaster for creating profiles for movies and music Iconia One 10 (B3-A40FHD) 2x Micro USB ports supporting On-The-Go White frame Acer didn’t say when these four products will be available or for how much at the time of this publication. We will update the news when Acer provides the information, so stay tuned.
Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel: Thunderbolt 3 will be integrated with next-gen chips 05/24/2017 at 12:02 PM by Brad Linder 5 Comments It’s been a few years since the Thunderbolt 3 protocol was  introduced, and Intel says there are more than 120 PCs on the market to support the standard. But Intel’s latest chips don’t actually include native support for Thunderbolt 3. Device makers have needed to integrate a discrete Thunderbolt 3 controller, which has slowed adoption. That’s one of the reasons why every device with a Thunderbolt 3 port can support USB Type-C accessories… but not every device with a USB Type-C port supports Thunderbolt 3’s 40 Gb/s data transfer speeds and other key features. Now Intel wants to make it easier for device makers to adopt Thunderbolt 3 by integrating the technology “into future Intel CPUs.” Intel will also make the Thunderbolt 3 specification available royalty-free to help anyone integrate the technology. Here are a few of the benefits of Thunderbolt 3: Support for sending video to up to two external 4K displays Support for up to 100 watts of power delivery (your USB port can be your laptop’s power jack) Supply up to 15 watts to bus-powered devices (for charging phones or tablets, or powering USB displays, among other peripherals) Up to 4x faster data transfer speeds than you get with USB 3.1 By supporting Thunderbolt 3 at the chip level and making the spec available, Intel is probably increasing the odds that you’ll start to see the technology in mid-range PCs. Right now it tends to be available exclusively on higher-end machines. While Intel says Thunderbolt 3 will be integrated into “future” CPUs though, it’s unclear if that means all future CPUS including entry-level, low-power Celeron and Pentium chips or if this is a feature that will be reserved for Core family processors.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 5 Comments on "Intel: Thunderbolt 3 will be integrated with next-gen chips" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest Phil Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

These deals are made all the time between major tech corporations.

Releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification in this manner is expected to greatly increase Thunderbolt adoption by encouraging third-party chip makers to build Thunderbolt-compatible chips. We expect industry chip development to accelerate a wide range of new devices and user experiences. ” No Tacitus, you’re wrong. Straight from Intel’s mouth, it will be royalty-free. And they are ENCOURAGING third-party chip makers like AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, Nvidia, Huawei. And are EXPECTING a wide-range of new devices like phones, handhelds, tablets, TVs etc etc. Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 1 hour 26 minutes ago Guest opticron Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Intel's Thunderbolt interface was mostly a Mac-only curiosity until the company decided to bring it to USB-C ports, and now it is poised to become ubiquitous thanks to Intel's decision to allow any device manufacturer to use it without paying royalties. The end of royalty payments will take effect next year, and Intel announced on Wednesday that it also plans to integrate Thunderbolt directly into its future CPUs. The two changes should make the Thunderbolt interface, which currently supports transfer speeds of up to 40 Gbps, the de facto standard for data ports on everything from desktop PCs to virtual reality headsets. And it is emerging technologies like VR where Intel see's Thunderbolt's biggest promise. A Thunderbolt 3 cable can deliver enough throughput to allow 4K games on a virtual reality headset, according to Intel Vice President Chris Walker. Related What Thunderbolt 3 Means for PC Connectivity: An Explainer What Thunderbolt 3 Means for PC Connectivity: An Explainer Other benefits include the ability for laptop and desktop manufacturers to greatly simplify the variety of ports that they offer. Thunderbolt, which started life built into the MiniDisplay ports of Mac laptops and desktops, can function as a monitor cable or a power cord in addition to connecting external drives and other peripherals. "With Thunderbolt 3 integrated into the CPU, computer makers can build thinner and lighter systems with only Thunderbolt 3 ports," Walker explained in a blog post. "For the first time, all the ports on a computer can be the same – any port can charge the system and connect to Thunderbolt devices, every display and billions of USB devices." Making Thunderbolt royalty-free should also make its peripherals and cables cheaper and easier to find. When it comes to external hard drives, for instance, Thunderbolt is still mostly limited to high-end models geared toward media professionals, like the $399 6TB Lacie d2.

Cascade Lake-SP is the Skylake-SP refresh, with Intel tapping the 14nm+ node. Cascade Lake will support up to a mammoth 6TB of Optane DIMMs, which is a huge plus for Intel.   Intel has teased: "Intel persistent memory will allow users to improve system performance dramatically by putting more data closer to the processor on nonvolatile media, and do it in an affordable manner. This will truly be a game-changer when it comes to the way applications and systems are designed".   The next-gen Cascade Lake CPUs will be capable of being thrown into 4-socket configurations, supporting up to 3TB of Optane DIMMs, while the 8-socket systems will support up to 6TB of Optane goodness.

By Chris Duckett | May 25, 2017 -- 00:52 GMT (17:52 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Intel has announced that it will make its Thunderbolt 3 specification royalty-free from next year. The move is expected to boost adoption of the protocol, Intel vice president of the Client Computing Group Chris Walker said in a blog post. At the same time, the company said it would do away with its discrete Thunderbolt 3 component, and move it into the CPU itself, allowing for thinner and more power-efficient devices, Walker said. "For the first time, all the ports on a computer can be the same -- any port can charge the system and connect to Thunderbolt devices, every display and billions of USB devices," he said. Intel has touted its 40Gbps protocol as "the USB-C that does it all" as it is able to support USB, Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, and PCI Express protocols, as well as carry power to devices. In its new Surface Pro released this week, Microsoft continued to ship the device without support for USB-C, let alone add Thunderbolt 3 support. Support for Thunderbolt 3 is slowly making its way into peripherals, with Western Digital announcing this week it was updating its G-Technology product lines with USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 support. A slide leaked earlier this week suggested Intel would release a 12-core desktop CPU badged as a Core i9.

Dan Riccio, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering said that "Apple and Intel have collaborated on Thunderbolt from the beginning, and as the industry leader in its adoption, we applaud Intel's efforts to integrate Thunderbolt technology into its CPUs and open it up to the rest of the industry."     Intel notes in their press release that their original vision for Thunderbolt was not just to make a faster computer port, but a simpler and more versatile port available to everyone. Intel envisions a future where high-performance single-cable docks, stunning photos and 4K video, lifelike VR, and faster-than-ever storage are commonplace. A world where one USB-C connector does it all – today, and for many years to come. With this vision in mind, Intel announced today that it plans to drive large-scale mainstream adoption of Thunderbolt by integrating Thunderbolt 3 into future Intel CPUs and by releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification to the industry next year.   With Thunderbolt 3 integrated into the CPU, computer makers can build thinner and lighter systems with only Thunderbolt 3 ports. For the first time, all the ports on a computer can be the same – any port can charge the system and connect to Thunderbolt devices, every display and billions of USB devices.   Designs based on Intel's integrated Thunderbolt 3 solution require less board space and reduce power by removing the discrete component needed for existing systems with Thunderbolt 3.   In addition to Intel's Thunderbolt silicon, next year Intel plans to make the Thunderbolt protocol specification available to the industry under a nonexclusive, royalty-free license.   Releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification in this manner is expected to greatly increase Thunderbolt adoption by encouraging third-party chip makers to build Thunderbolt-compatible chips. We expect industry chip development to accelerate a wide range of new devices and user experiences.   Microsoft has enhanced Thunderbolt 3 device plug-and-play support in the now available Windows 10 Creators Update. Intel and Microsoft plan to continue to work together to enhance the experience in future versions of the Windows operating system.   "Microsoft and Intel are working together to enable Thunderbolt 3 on Windows PCs to deliver on the 'if it fits, it works' potential of USB-C," said Roanne Sones, general manager, Strategy and Ecosystem for Windows and Devices at Microsoft. "The Windows 10 Creators Update enhanced plug-and-play support for Thunderbolt 3 devices, with additional enhancements planned for future OS releases."   State-of-the-Art Single-Cable Docks   Mobile platforms continue to get thinner, lighter and more powerful. The challenge? A simple and universal way to unleash the full performance of these mobile devices when docked. Today, business and home users are forced to choose between performance and mobility.   Thunderbolt 3 docks enable mobility without compromise. Some people are more productive with a large high-resolution monitor, and others with multiple monitors. Only Thunderbolt 3 docks support both, while simultaneously transferring large files and charging the notebook. Other people want a simple way to play and create, and Thunderbolt 3 docks can connect to any compatible peripheral or display, avoiding confusion. The power Thunderbolt 3 brings to docking is speed and simplicity. Some of these products are available now for less than $200.   Faster-than-Ever Storage   The amount of data the average person creates, uses and saves these days is exploding. For example, taking 1,000 high-resolution photos can quickly create over 20GB of data. Likewise, shooting an hour of 4K video from a drone can generate a jaw-dropping 1.5TB of data. It could take hours to transfer this data to storage via conventional methods.   In order to speed up data transfer, storage makers are shifting from slower Serial ATA (SATA) drives to non-volatile memory (NVMe) SSDs for higher speed and lower latency storage solutions. For any media lover or YouTuber generating large amounts of data, there is often a great need for external storage that is as fast as the internal SSD to expand capacity. Since only Thunderbolt can connect NVMe SSDs to your PC, Thunderbolt 3 storage fulfills this need and enables people to save time with data transfers that happen in a snap. A full 4K movie can be transferred in less than 30 seconds.   Epic Gaming   Gaming desktops will continue to offer best-in-class performance for the ultimate gaming experience. And gamers who want to combine mobility and performance gaming in one device can use Thunderbolt 3 to do so.   With Thunderbolt 3, gamers can travel, work or enjoy long hours at a coffee shop with a thin and light notebook. Then, when it's time for epic gaming, the notebook can be paired with a Thunderbolt 3 external graphics box to get a GPU boost for higher resolution and settings experience.   Lifelike Virtual Reality   When a person experiences virtual reality, they are fully immersed in a different world. The higher the resolution, the better the experience. To date, that has required multiple cables to transfer the experience from the PC to the headset in real time for 2K resolution. Only Thunderbolt 3 can deliver up to 4K resolution in virtual reality with a single cable.   The benefits are endless – simplicity to performance to versatility – as Thunderbolt 3 becomes an essential part of our digital world by creating a universe of possibilities.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The new MacBook Pro has four of them, and HP's Spectre x360 has two. In fact, Intel says that over 120 PCs are using the technology. Designed by Intel to be a sort of one cable for everything, it can handle bandwidth of up to 40Gbps (5GBps). This means that a single port can power two 4K monitors at a time, or one 5K monitor. It supports a number of standards, including PCIe 3.0, HDMI 2.0, and DisplayPort 1.2. But Intel announced today that it's taking steps to further adoption of the technology. Moving forward, the company will be integrating Thunderbolt 3 into its future chips, saying "all the ports on a computer can be the same – any port can charge the system and connect to Thunderbolt devices, every display and billions of USB devices." The firm says that by removing the discrete component that's necessary for Thunderbolt 3, less board space and power will be necessary. It's also going to release the Thunderbolt protocol spec under a "nonexclusive, royalty-free license." This means that competitors, such as AMD, will likely be more encouraged to build Thunderbolt-compatible processors. Intel says that while Microsoft has "enhanced Thunderbolt 3 device plug-and-play support in the now available Windows 10 Creators Update", the two companies will continue to work together to better the experience.

Pre-order: Surface Laptop | NEW Surface Pro Coming to Surface next year? Intel drops Thunderbolt 3 royalty, adds CPU integration and works closely with Microsoft By Daniel Rubino Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 2:57 pm EDT 49 Comments Daniel Rubino is executive editor of Windows Central. He has been covering Microsoft since 2009 back when this site was called WMExperts (and later Windows Phone Central). His interests include Windows, Surface, HoloLens, Xbox, and future computing visions. Follow him on Twitter: @daniel_rubino. New changes by Intel will speed up the adoption of Thunderbolt 3 heading into 2018. Here's how it may impact your future PC purchase. Over the last few days, Thunderbolt 3 has been a hot topic amongst Windows users especially with its notable absence with the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop. Part of the problem is adoption, integration, cost, and consumer confusion according to Microsoft. Intel is aware of the current roadblocks to Thunderbolt 3 implementation, which adds 40Gbps data transfers along with charging and display support for USB Type-C. Today, the company announced numerous changes to its roadmap to speed up its adoption, including: Dropping royalty fees for the Thunderbolt protocol specification starting next year. Integrating Thunderbolt 3 into future Intel CPUs. While some tech-savvy consumers equate USB Type-C as interchangeable with Thunderbolt 3 that is not the case. PC manufacturers need to pay to enable Thunderbolt 3 per device, and that cost is passed on to the consumer. Also, Thunderbolt 3 is a discrete component on the PCB board, which requires more space, increased power usage, and surging costs. As a result, USB Type-C ports are becoming more common, but very few are full Thunderbolt 3-enabled. That just means the Type-C port equates to a USB Type-A 3.1 for speeds and data, or can act as a power port, but lacks dual-4K display output and the increased bandwidth capability. Further complicating matters are the dedicated PCIe lanes, which can vary from two to four. Only the latter configuration guarantees the full 40Gbps data speed and allows for things like external GPU (eGPU) support (which itself is shaky for standards). USB Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 3 are very powerful, but still flawed today. All of this delves nicely with Microsoft's insistence that Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C are not quite ready for mass consumer acceptance. Additionally, adding the port does require significant PCB board redesign – and sacrifice – to enable. Why Microsoft's new Surface Pro doesn't have a USB Type-C port The good news here is that Intel is dropping many of the roadblocks with today's announcement. By subtracting the licensing costs for Thunderbolt 3 and integrating into the CPU, Intel can finally push mass adoption. As Vice President of the Intel Client Computing Group Chris Walker noted: With Thunderbolt 3 integrated into the CPU, computer makers can build thinner and lighter systems with only Thunderbolt 3 ports. For the first time, all the ports on a computer can be the same – any port can charge the system and connect to Thunderbolt devices, every display and billions of USB devices. Designs based on Intel's integrated Thunderbolt 3 solution require less board space and reduce power by removing the discrete component needed for existing systems with Thunderbolt 3. Microsoft and Intel see Thunderbolt 3 as the future Getting back to Microsoft, Intel noted that the two companies are already working closely together with the latest Creators Update bringing more OS support for the protocol. Roanne Sones, general manager, Strategy, and Ecosystem for Windows and Devices at Microsoft added that such cooperation would continue with even more OS-level integration coming down the road: Microsoft and Intel are working together to enable Thunderbolt 3 on Windows PCs to deliver on the 'if it fits, it works' potential of USB-C. The Windows 10 Creators Update enhanced plug-and-play support for Thunderbolt 3 devices, with additional enhancements planned for future OS releases. Put all together, and we can speculate that Surface devices in 2018 and beyond will begin to adopt USB Type-C with full Thunderbolt 3 for the consumer market. While that is not soon enough for some prosumers, Intel notes that there are now 120 PC designs with Thunderbolt 3 today with it ramping up to 150 by the end of the year.

There's only so much Microsoft can pack into a montherboard for devices as small as the Surface Pro, they made a choice to improve existing features instead of packing a feature that takes a lot of space on the board now and that they likely knew would not be nearly as needed in the future. 13 11 hours ago Reply asoyemi I am betting you HP Spectre is one of this 120 devices that intel alluded to in this excerpt of the article "While that is not soon enough for some prosumers, Intel notes that there are now 120 PC designs with Thunderbolt 3 today with it ramping up to 150 by the end of the year." 1 11 hours ago Reply n m Instead, maybe the mighty MS has used it's considerable influence to pressure those in the industry to finally clean up a very confusing and complicated mess.

If you find a laptop you like today that supports Thunderbolt 3, you're not going to gain anything by waiting a year - besides the standard stuff like newer processors, etc.  1 11 hours ago Reply blackfire It depends. There are chances that a laptop with TB3 support may not meet Mrbob88's requirements if he would like to plug in an external GPU. So if that's something he is interested in, and if my interpretation of this article is correct (maybe it isn't), there are chances that a laptop that support this a year from now will end up being considerably cheaper than one he buys today to do the same thing. Now, we know technology prices usually go down over time, so it would be interesting to know how much would OEMs, and eventually the end customer, end up saving by either implementation a year from now.  0 11 hours ago Reply pessimistic observer I hope this means we can see thunderbolt3 on AMD systems that would actually cause the price of TB3 equipped devices to go down. 0 9 hours ago Reply ananve the price will come down. 0 6 hours ago Reply HeyCori LET THE REVOLUTION BEGIN!!! 0 11 hours ago Reply L0n3N1nja So AMD can't do thunderbolt 3 if they actually get a competitive mobile CPU from their Ryzen based parts? 0 11 hours ago Reply csd_images Probably can do it through a controller and PCI bridge chip. 0 10 hours ago Reply rbgaynor Exactly - that is how (separate silicon) Apple is doing it currently. 0 7 hours ago Reply blackfire Question: I do believe mass adoption is great, but what will all of this enable on Windows PCs that is not already possible today on a USB-C enabled MacBook Pro or a high-end  Windows PC with the full implementation of USB-C and TB3 using all 4 PCIe lanes? Is this mainly about lower prices for the masses and making those scenarios available to the average user sometime between now and a year from now?  0 11 hours ago Reply Daniel Rubino A few things that you allude to. Lower prices, smaller devices, more battery, and most importantly it being used more, which drives accessories for Type-C. It also means not exclusive just premium devices. Issue with Type-C now is like on MateBook. You have one for power, one for data, but neither are TB3. It's just weird/confusing. 13 11 hours ago Reply blackfire Thanks Daniel! 0 10 hours ago Reply pessimistic observer You think thats bad cheap type-c cables have been known to break systems. 0 9 hours ago Reply five-one-three This should have been done years ago, better late than never i suppose...

Now I start to understand why MacBook Pro 2017 with 4 TB3 ports has that price.Hopefully TB3 can become popular with this move and external VR headsets, SSD drives, 4K HD tvs, audio reveivers, monitors, GPU cards, etc adopt this standard 5 11 hours ago Reply Daniel Rubino Thanks and I agree. Apple, for all the flak they get on their ports, did do it right. All 3 or 4 of those Type-C ports are full 40 Gbps TB3. It's an impressive achievement that's very powerful and it takes the thinking out of the equation for the consumer. 6 10 hours ago Reply bsd107 Nope, even Apple's implementation does not put full capabilities on all ports on all MacBook models. From Apple's support website: " MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) supports Thunderbolt 3 at full performance using the two left-hand ports. The two right-hand ports deliver Thunderbolt 3 functionality, but have reduced PCI Express bandwidth. Always plug higher-performance devices into the left-hand ports on MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) for maximum data throughput. " Even in Apple's case, you would NEVER know this by looking at the laptop itself.  God forbid they actually label the ports so you could tell.  It is only buried deep in their website.  (At least they mentioned it there...) 1 44 min ago Reply coip Indeed. I had no idea how confusing the situation all was. It's much clearer now. I wonder, though, if Intel is dropping the royalty now to encourage mass adoption, is there anything preventing them from jacking up the royalty after that happens? 0 3 hours ago Reply Rui Gomes1 Right on time for the Surface Pro and Surface laptop....oh wait. -1 10 hours ago Reply WPenvy I... thought that the lightning symbol on my 2 year old laptop just indicated that, that was the port for charging while asleep..... Mistaken? 0 10 hours ago Reply AndroidPurity This is great news! Now even less excuse to nit include thunderbolt 3 port in 2018. Glad that me Lenovo Yoga 720 15" has it. But supposedly is only 2 lanes :-( but haven't seen direct proof yet. 0 9 hours ago Reply Biff Henderson Rather than worry about USB Type-C not implementing all 4 PCIe lanes in some hardware implementations, it is more worrysome to me that many hardware products that claim to support Thunderbolt 3, are only using 2 PCIe lanes as well. (Dell) Its too bad that the consumer has to be knowlegdeable in chip sets and PCIe lanes in order to not get screwed. Poor mom. I guess we have to continue to read the fine print on all of this stuff. 1 9 hours ago Reply randyoaks187 Is it possible to build a "mag safe" version of the thunderbolt connector? I know the Surface connector is somewhat equivalent, but could it be compacted to make it more "design friendly"? I prefer the safety of the magnetic connection over all other things. 1 9 hours ago Reply noirsoft Part of why many of us are disappointed with the new Surface Pro is that Kaby Lake adds on-die support for TB3, so it already supports the features alluded to in Intel's report without needing a separate chip. All of the cost & battery savings (except for the licensing cost) are already realized with using a Kaby Lake CPU. I would still be happy with just a new dock that has a TB3 port on it. I don't need it on the device itself, just when docked so as to make use of more powerful peripherals and eGPU when docked. It's very disappointing that there are such trade-offs when considering purchasing a Surface Pro vs other brands. -1 7 hours ago Reply sporosarcina The Surface is much more crowded internally than a convertible or thicker two in one and space is specifically allocated. It probably wasn't the cost, but the extra silicon that killed it in the Surface so far. 1 7 hours ago Reply MrElectrifyer I sure hope you're right about that. Looking forward to the next iteration. Really want a Surface Pro with Surface Connect + USB Type C Thunderbolt 3 + USB Type A USB 3.0 + MicroSD + 3.5mm Headphone Jack + Keyboard Connect ports. That's the truly future-proof upgrade to my Surface Pro 2... 0 4 hours ago Reply Murani Lewis When I went to buy my new video editing desktop the model I chose only has usb 3.1 but not Thunderbolt 3. At first that was a huge turn off but then I realized that its not nearly at the top of my must have features for what I need to do. I can still get really good speeds with external drives. 0 6 hours ago Reply MrElectrifyer Your video editing Desktop already has a built-in Desktop-class discrete GPU.

Many of you still had questions, however, about the timing and nature of some of the updates we would see later on this year, when Vega might launch for consumer cards, and what’s next for AMD. AMD CEO Lisa Su spoke at the JP Morgan Media & Telecom Conference earlier this week, and gave some additional color on these questions. Let’s break it down: Desktop, server, and future foundry plans During AMD’s financial analyst day, it unveiled a roadmap for Zen that showed 14nm/14nm+, followed by a Zen 2 and Zen 3. Lisa Su confirmed that Zen 2 would be a 2018 or 2019 part (likely depending on GlobalFoundries’ own timetable for 7nm rollouts). This implies we’ll see a refreshed Zen point-update at some point on a second-generation 14nm process. Exactly which benefits will be baked into the core are unclear. But yearly product cycles have become the norm for AMD as well as a number of other semiconductor firms, and we can safely predict what kind of chip they’ll launch — a modest improvement to Zen, possibly with some internal tweaks and combined with slightly higher clocks or improved TDP. Lisa Su did note they’ll be doing tapeouts for 7nm this year, and tapeout usually leads introduction by 12-18 months depending on the part. Su also announced that going forward, the data center is the primary focus for AMD. I don’t think that means gamers should give up on Ryzen as a gaming chip — historically, in fact, focusing on the data center gave AMD the best CPU performance and overall market position that it ever enjoyed. Opteron and Athlon 64 / 64 X2 were AMD’s best cores at a time when Intel was performing poorly, with Opteron driving AMD up to nearly 25 percent of the server market over just a few short years. This is the number one priority, the number one opportunity for us over the next three to four years. I think our priority really is a little bit around time and time it takes to ramp product. So our EPYC CPUs we’ll be launching later this month – I’m sorry, in June and our Vega GPUs also in a similar timeframe. And what we will be doing is working closely with our customers. AMD intends to engage with cloud providers with gradual ramping across the entire server market. Lisa Su claims that the ramp will be somewhat slower than you might see in PCs, and AMD has set a goal for itself of capturing 10 percent of the data center market over the next few years. She also noted that moving to a multi-chip module (MCM) approach on Epyc has improved cost structures and yields because it doesn’t require AMD to hit a perfect 32-core microprocessor in a single die. Connecting four eight-core chips via MCM has been the better strategy. Licensing and IP monetization Su also spoke to AMD’s plans for licensing agreements and its own IP monetization, and indirectly confirmed what Intel has already said — there’s no plan to license AMD graphics technology to a major competitor in that kind of licensing agreement. She explicitly states, “We’re not trying to become an ARM or an Imagination…And so it’s about how do we sell more products or how do we have our IP in markets that we’re not currently selling products. And so that’s kind of how we think about it. We’re not looking at enabling a competitor to compete against our products.” Between her statements and Intel’s, it’s safe to dismiss this rumor. An AMD-designed Intel integrated GPU might have been interesting, but it clearly isn’t happening. She did note that AMD had a new, non-game console, semi-custom design it expected to produce revenue from 2018 – 2020, and that its license agreement with THATIC (the joint venture it formed last year) was also going well and producing revenue on-schedule. Vega’s consumer launch date Lisa Su didn’t give as much detail as some might like regarding AMD’s Vega plans, but she did speak to them, saying: Yes, so we’re very excited about Vega. Vega is a brand new architecture and actually has really the world’s most advanced memory architecture for CPUs. What we did announce at our Analyst Day is that the first shipping Vega will be the frontier editions, which will ship with 16 gigabytes of memory and it will ship towards the latter half of June. You will see the enthusiast gaming platform, the machine learning platform, the professional graphics platform very soon thereafter. And so we will be launching Vega across all of the market segments over the next couple of months. Here’s how I’d parse that statement. As per AMD’s previous comments, the only Vega shipping in June will be the Frontier edition. Lisa Su is saying that Vega will launch across all platforms against the next couple of months, which could be read several different ways. If she means “The next couple of months after June,” then we’re looking at consumer launches in August and September (assuming “couple” is read loosely). If we read it more tightly, then we could see launches earlier, in July – August. But there’s very much a question as to where AMD will focus its efforts, and how it will price Vega. All of the following is conjecture and based on no inside information from within AMD, but the company has sent some significant signs that its focus with Vega will not be on the consumer market. First, there’s the fact that Lisa Su has specifically identified data centers and machine learning as major foci for AMD. These are the markets where high-end GPUs truly make bank — a consumer high-end card may sell for $800, but the professional version of that same GPU could be a $1,600 – $3,200 part. Seriously, check Nvidia’s Quadro pricing against the same GPUs in consumer parts, or the gap between AMD’s FirePro and Radeon. Workstation cards do sometimes field certain capabilities that consumer cards lack, but nothing that remotely justifies the huge price premium between the two. But given the issues that seem to be piling up around HBM2, it’s just not clear how low AMD’s Vega pricing will be, or where the company will introduce the GPU. Much, of course, depends on performance. Here, I think the naysayers are selling the company short. We watched doubts pile up around Ryzen for years before its introduction, only for the final chip to be a far stronger overall performer than many (including myself), expected — and I expected Ryzen to be a vast improvement over AMD’s Bulldozer-derived architectures. I’m not going to make any assertions or claims about how Pascal or Volta will compare, because there’s just not enough information to speak to that point. If AMD starts pushing Vega into consumer markets in July and can keep the card on store shelves at reasonable prices, it’ll be a sign that whatever production issues may have occurred, they’ve been ironed out. But if it continues to focus on the highest end of the market, or to emphasize data centers and machine learning, it could mean the GPU will only see limited release to consumers. We won’t know which way the situation will break until AMD releases more concrete information or launches the GPU.

Chipzilla announced on Wednesday that it will be throwing its weight behind an effort to make the next-gen port standard the biggest thing since USB. Possible applications include solid-state hard drives and 4K video cameras. "Intel's vision for Thunderbolt was not just to make a faster computer port, but a simpler and more versatile port available to everyone. We envision a future where high-performance single-cable docks, stunning photos and 4K video, lifelike VR, and faster-than-ever storage are commonplace," wrote Intel Client Computing group VP Chris Walker. "A world where one USB-C connector does it all – today, and for many years to come." To help spread the gospel of Thunderbolt, Intel says it will be opening up the standard as a royalty-free, non-exclusive license. This will allow motherboard makers to solder the ports into their boards without licensing worries, and as Intel hopes, make Thunderbolt ports a permanent feature on PC builds. Thunderbolt is already a feature on Apple machines, but as past history shows, Cupertino doesn't always set the trend for connectivity (see: FireWire). Instead, Intel is looking to employ the likes of Microsoft to help make Thunderbolt USB-3 ports a thing. "Microsoft and Intel are working together to enable Thunderbolt 3 on Windows PCs to deliver on the 'if it fits, it works' potential of USB-C," said Microsoft Windows and Devices strategy and ecosystem general manager Roanne Sones. "The Windows 10 Creators Update enhanced plug-and-play support for Thunderbolt 3 devices, with additional enhancements planned for future OS releases." Intel has long pitched Thunderbolt as the plug of the future. Going back to 2015, Chipzilla floated the standard for high-speed data transfers. With the platform now a royalty-free standard, Intel hopes peripheral makers will be more likely to build compatibility into their devices with the guarantee of support from Microsoft. ® Tips and corrections 13 Comments MORE Intel Thunderbolt Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Intel touts bug bounties to hardware hackers Website and Intel Security (McAfee) products excluded from 'Wild West' payouts scheme 2 Comments Intel breathes $2bn sigh of relief over patent trial Jury finds that chip giant did not infringe on AVM patent Intel reveals Optane will need a 7th-gen core and a PC-centric launch You're going to need a whole lot of Intel Inside to make this work 16 Comments Intel's data center boss Diane Bryant logs off Server silicon head unplugs after 30+ years at Chipzilla 3 Comments Intel loses its Lustre – Chipzilla bins own-brand HPC file system Between killing an OpenStack research team and killing IDF, we see a pattern here 15 Comments Intel, Samsung join Apple, FTC firing squad against rival Qualcomm Two more chip heavyweights enter the patent fray 4 Comments Whitepapers Secure Mobile Development Best Practices Covering the vulnerabilities hackers might use to launch an attack, and remediation tips that you can use to build security into your app. Preparing for Private Cloud and Hybrid IT with Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure IT organizations continue to run many of their traditional apps on premise, moving to private cloud, while using public shared cloud for selected “other” workloads.

It foresees Thunderbolt via USB Type-C to be a key enabler of these goals. In a blog post today Chris Walker, the vice president of the Client Computing Group and general manager of the Mobility Client Platform​ at Intel Corporation, claimed Intel's Thunderbolt 3 solution is the natural successor to the ubiquitous USB port. The new Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C connector can do it all, says Walker, "today, and for many years to come." Intel hopes Apple, which has gone all-in with the port for its modern computers, is an example of history repeating itself - as the success of the original gel-coloured iMacs drove production and wide adoption of USB peripherals. At the current time Intel is claiming success as shown by more than 120 PC and peripheral designs with Thunderbolt 3, expected to ramp to 150+ by year end. Two key strategic decisions have been made by Intel to help its visions of widespread Thunderbolt 3 adoption become reality. First of all Intel today announced that it will drive large-scale mainstream adoption of Thunderbolt by integrating Thunderbolt 3 into future Intel CPUs. Secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, Intel will release the Thunderbolt protocol specification, royalty-free, to the industry next year. The compact and functionally flexible Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C port has already enabled slimmer and sleeker designs from portable PC and mobile device makers. Intel reminds us of the wide variety of purposes which such a port can be utilised for. Docking devices and external storage are obvious uses, as it just takes over from where ye olde USB currently is ubiquitous. However external GPUs, single cable VR headset connections, and its greater power delivery possibilities put its ancestors in the shade.

According to a Wired report, the protocol specification for the data-transfer technology will will be released under a non-exclusive license next year. Part of the plans will see Thunderbolt 3 integrated into future CPUs, meaning less space will be needed on the Mac or PC's logic board. That will also remove the need for a Thunderbolt controller, Intel says. Related: MacBook Pro 2016 review This will mean thinner and lighter devices, according to the firm, while more devices could benefit from Thunderbolt 3’s improved battery efficiency. There could also be knock-on effects for the USB-C technology, which shares the same connector design. This move could see more and more manufacturers adopt USB-C as main charging and data transfer method. By eliminating the costs of using Thunderbolt 3, manufacturers may now be more likely to adopt the USB-C standard, unburdened by licensing fees on Intel’s end. Thunderbolt 3 is able to transfer data at 40Gbps, while it can also be used to power devices and peripherals like 4K monitors. “We think the first thing is going to drive broader adoption and deployment of Thunderbolt 3 in PCs,” says Jason Ziller, Intel’s lead for Thunderbolt development. “The second will drive also broader adoption in the ecosystem, with a lot of different peripherals and other devices.” Will making Thunderbolt 3 free to use boost adoption?

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Intel takes drastic measures to keep Thunderbolt 3 alive Chris Davies - May 24, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Intel is baking Thunderbolt 3 into its new chips and ditching licensing fees, in order to avoid adoption of the high-speed connection stuttering to a halt. The processor company said today that it will make it much easier – particularly more affordable – for third-party hardware companies to embrace Thunderbolt 3, the multi-purpose cable which can deliver data, video, and power over a single connection. The move has already won approval from Apple and Microsoft. It’s probably fair to say that neither Thunderbolt nor Thunderbolt 2 had quite the game-changing impact Intel and others hoped for. The high-speed interconnects were billed as the answer to rapidly increasing data throughput demands of virtual reality, 4K+ video editing, and more. They’d even blur the lines between internal and external upgrades, so the promise went; none embraced such a vision as completely – and, with hindsight, so disastrously – as Apple with the cylindrical Mac Pro. That revolution didn’t happen. Peripherals, when there were released, proved to be unduly expensive; many professionals in the creative industries Thunderbolt was pitched to decided that USB 3.0 was fast enough. Now, Intel is looking to avoid making the same mistakes with Thunderbolt 3. The chip company announced a two-step process to that end today. For a start, Thunderbolt 3 will be integrated into future Intel CPUs. Rather than the current system, which requires a separate Thunderbolt 3 controller, Intel will bake support into the CPU silicon. It’ll demand less board space, opening the door to slimmer and smaller notebooks and tablets, while also being more power efficient since there’ll be fewer components. Arguably more important, though, is Intel’s decision to scrap licensing fees. Next year, the chip company says, it’ll make the Thunderbolt protocol specification available to the tech industry under a nonexclusive, royalty-free license. In short, companies making accessories, peripherals, and systems using the technology will be able to implement Thunderbolt 3 without having to pay Intel for the privilege, while third-party companies will be able to make their own versions of the controllers. “Releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification in this manner is expected to greatly increase Thunderbolt adoption by encouraging third-party chip makers to build Thunderbolt-compatible chips,” Chris Walker, vice president of the Client Computing Group and general manager of the Mobility Client Platform​ at Intel, suggests. “We expect industry chip development to accelerate a wide range of new devices and user experiences.” As you might expect, having worked with Intel on the initial Thunderbolt development, Apple is already onboard with the idea. It launched the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar last year, ditching every legacy connector but the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of four USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 ports. Each of those ports can supply power to the notebook, hook up to a data peripheral such as an external drive, or be used to connect a display. It’s in the Cupertino firm’s best interest to see adoption increase more broadly, and help its users avoid living “that dongle life.” Microsoft, meanwhile, has been stung with criticism recently for not equipping its latest machines – the Surface Laptop, announced earlier this year, and the Surface Pro that was revealed yesterday – with Thunderbolt 3 or indeed USB Type-C ports of any sort. However, it too says it’s working with Intel to embrace the interconnect. “The Windows 10 Creators Update enhanced plug-and-play support for Thunderbolt 3 devices,” Roanne Sones, general manager, Strategy and Ecosystem for Windows and Devices, said of Intel’s news, “with additional enhancements planned for future OS releases.” Almost 150 different PC designs and systems using Thunderbolt 3 are expected to be on the market by the end of the year, Intel predicts. Meanwhile it’s expecting docking stations, super-fast external storage, and 4K virtual reality headsets getting power, data, and video from a single cable from a PC to hit the market.

(AMD) Stock Has 85% Upside Intel and AMD have more in common than you think, but it's still not enough May 24, 2017, 12:05 pm EDT  |  By Will Ashworth, InvestorPlace Contributor     View All   The longstanding rumor that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) would license Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) GPU intellectual property once Intel’s deal with Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ended in March appears to have hit a roadblock. Source: Shutterstock A little more than a year ago, this rumor began circulating throughout the tech world and even though Intel made no attempt to quell the speculation, investors bought into it hook, line and sinker. Up went AMD stock. “Intel held its Investor Meeting on February 9, and I observed that there was no announcement. The month of March has come and gone, still without an announcement,” wrote Seeking Alpha tech contributor Mark Hibben on April 5. “At this point, one has to seriously question what has been going on ever since the Bloomberg non-report that attracted so much attention without a whit of journalistic traceability. I can’t prove the negative that there is no agreement, but I should think that any agreement would have been made public by now.” It’s these kinds of rumors that keep me from investing more heavily in tech stocks. You really can’t trust a lot of the reporting going on, and while I doubt much of it is intentionally harmful, that’s precisely the result when a rumor like this is allowed to live and breathe on the internet. Investors lose real money buying into these rumors. Fast Forward to May 16 The tentative AMD/Intel deal resurfaced May 16 when the tech website Fudzilla claimed the licensing deal was real, and it was a go. AMD stock jumped almost 12% on the “news”. Later that day, Advanced Micro Devices held its Investor Day presentation, and it said not a peep about this so-called deal. Intel finally weighed in telling CNBC there was no deal. Down went AMD stock. I’m sorry, but I don’t know how anyone can make an investment in a stock that’s so ripe for gossip and speculation. And the worst part is that investors didn’t even bother to consider the value of such a deal to Advanced Micro Devices stock. “The licensing deal Intel had with Nvidia was reportedly worth $200 million per year in royalties. Presuming any deal with AMD would be similarly sized, such an agreement could add $200 million worth of high-margin revenue to Advanced Micro Devices’ annual top line of around $4.4 billion.” wrote InvestorPlace Feature Writer James Brumley May 16 before Intel squashing the rumors. “From that perspective, even if there was some truth to the whispers, it would be tough to deem the deal a game-changer for AMD or for INTC stock.” Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2017/05/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-stock-85-upside/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 10 Stocks That May Crash 20%+ 3 Stocks to Buy for a Breakout in 2017 7 Fund Picks for High-Energy Returns 3 Dividend Stocks to Buy for 12 Months of Retirement Income 3 ETFs for Scorching Small-Cap Gains 10 High-Tech Graduation Gifts for 2017 ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Editor's Picks 10 Hot Stocks That Could Crash 20% or More 3 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for a 2017 Breakout 3 Dividend Stocks to Buy for 12 Months of Retirement Income 4 Reasons Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a Terrible Short The 3 Biggest Risks Facing Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Most Popular The 7 Best “Comeback” Stocks to Buy for a Huge Second Half 7 S&P 500 Stocks That Will Drop by Double Digits 10 Best Mutual Funds for Retirement 3 Big Bank Stocks That Are Printing Money 3 Dirt-Cheap Index Funds to Buy Now 5 Dow Jones Stocks to Sell Now As the Trump Trade Fades Poll of the Day View and vote in our How confident are you about the U.S. economy under President Donald Trump? poll Partners ADVERTISEMENT About Us   ·   Press Center   ·   Resources   ·   Advisory Services   ·   Free Newsletters   ·   Free Reports   ·   Contact Us   ·   Advertise With Us   ·   Employment   ·   Privacy   ·   Terms and Conditions   ·   Disclosures and Disclaimers   ·   Media Sites RSS   ·   Sitemap More On InvestorPlace: Choose A Page About Us Press Center Resources Advisory Services Free Newsletters Free Reports Contact Us Advertise With Us Employment Privacy Terms and Conditions Disclosures and Disclaimers Media Sites Sitemap Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services, Inc.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Broad Institute To Release Genome Analysis Toolkit 4 (GATK4) As Open Source Resource To Accelerate Research CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard will release version 4 of the industry-leading Genome Analysis Toolkit under an open source software license. The software package, designated GATK4, contains new tools and rebuilt architecture. It is available currently as an alpha preview on the Broad Institute’s GATK website, with a beta release expected in mid-June. Broad engineers announced the upgrade, as well as the decision to release the tool as an open source product, at Bio-IT World today. The new version is built on a new architecture, allowing significant streamlining of individual tools and support for performance-enhancing technologies such as Apache Spark™. This new framework brings improvements to parallelization, capitalizing on cloud deployment and making the process of analyzing vast amounts of genomic data easier, faster, and more efficient. Courtesy of Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard „We wanted to remove traditional barriers of scale while offering the same high level of data quality our users expect,” said Eric Banks, Senior Director of Data Sciences and Data Engineering at Broad and a creator of the original GATK software package. „Thanks to the rapid adoption of cloud computing, researchers can finally do away with many of the infrastructure-related complications that have hampered progress, especially at smaller institutions and startups.” Today, more than 45,000 academic and commercial users worldwide rely on the GATK, running millions of analyses. The GATK is the industry standard for identifying SNPs and indels in germline DNA and RNAseq data. In addition to improving the performance of these established tools, GATK4 extends this scope of analysis to include copy number and structural variation, for both germline and somatic research applications. Fully open source software GATK4 will be released as a fully open source product, thanks in part to a collaboration between Broad Institute and Intel Corporation to advance high-performance analytics so researchers can study massive amounts of genomic data from diverse sources worldwide. At the Intel-Broad Center for Genomic Data Engineering, software engineers and researchers have spent the last several months building, optimizing, and widely sharing new tools and infrastructure to help scientists integrate and process genomic data. GATK4 has benefited from this collaboration, which has helped engineers optimize best practices in hardware and software for genome analytics to make it possible to combine and use research data sets that reside on private, public, and hybrid clouds. „Releasing GATK4 as open source was the obvious next step for our team,” said Geraldine Van der Auwera, Associate Director of Outreach and Communications within the Data Science and Data Engineering group at the Broad Institute. „We believe it’s the most effective way to support the community, and we hope it continues to grow, innovate, and help researchers make insights that are essential for future human health breakthroughs.” „It is critical for progress in biomedicine that the software we use for analysing the genomes of millions of people is robust and well understood,” said Ewan Birney, Director of EMBL-EBI and Chair of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). „Releasing GATK software with an open source license directly supports open innovation, data re-use and data re-analysis in the global biomedical community.” „The GATK tools are crucial for both germline and cancer analyses,” said Robert L. Grossman of the University of Chicago Department of Medicine and an expert in biomedical informatics. „Releasing GATK4 as an open source software package will increase adoption, and benefit the community.” „Open sourcing the GATK is a big deal for open genomics, and for open science in general,” said Jeremy Freeman, manager of computational biology at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI). „Not only does it make this critical tool available to as broad as possible an audience for use, reuse, inspection, and contribution — it provides a powerful example to the community for how an existing project can embrace open source.” „Open source code is a foundation of efficient biomedical research,” said Brad Chapman, a research scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. „It enables reproducibility, reuse and remixing by removing barriers for sharing and distributing analyses. The Broad Institute’s GATK team leads in the development of scalable, sensitive and specific variant calling algorithms, and open sourcing GATK4 will allow frameworks like Blue Collar Bioinformatics to make these methods broadly available to the scientific research community.” „Cloudera has always been a supporter and believer in the power of open source code,” said Tom White, data scientist at Cloudera and a member of the Apache Hadoop PMC. „We’ve been excited to contribute to the GATK codebase, to make it run smoothly on Apache Spark™ and Cloudera. This next phase of the GATK, powered by Spark and open source software, will expand access and improve collaboration among genomic data scientists.” „The open sourcing of GATK4 is a great step for genomics, allowing for scalability and performance gains to be openly available to the research, biotech and pharmaceutical communities,” said Jason Waxman, corporate vice president and general manager of Data Center Solutions at Intel. „GATK4, when run on Intel’s new reference architecture, can achieve a 5X speed-up compared to earlier versions of the software.” „We at Google are excited to see this new release,” said Ilia Tulchinsky, Google Cloud Healthcare Engineering Lead. „We’ve been collaborating with the Broad Institute for the past three years to enhance genomic processing on Google Cloud Platform. As a strong supporter for open source technology, we believe that making GATK available this way will facilitate its use by genomic scientists everywhere. As fellow collaborators with Intel, we particularly look forward to enabling researchers to run GATK4 on Google Cloud using the upcoming Intel Xeon processor Scalable family.” „The GATK is one of the most widely-utilized software packages in the life sciences, and our team has worked very productively with Broad to accelerate it for use on Azure,” said Geralyn Miller, Director, AI & Research, Microsoft. „This new model will greatly facilitate this effort going forward, and we are excited to continue and expand our efforts around GATK on Azure.” „With the open source launch of GATK4, there is an opportunity to create a global community that can collaborate together and advance the state of art in bioinformatics,” said Hong Tang, chief architect at Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group. „We look forward to closely working with Broad Institute in bringing the cloud-based GATK service to genomics customers in China, as well as in ongoing GATK research and development.” In addition to offering GATK4 as an open source toolkit, Broad Institute will continue to offer user support, training, and outreach on its popular user support forum. GATK4, like many of the Broad Institute’s genome analysis tools, will be available through the Broad Institute’s cloud based analysis platform, FireCloud.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | May 24, 2017 -- 17:00 GMT (10:00 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Less than a year after expanding its partnership with the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT to advance the use high-performance computing for genomics analytics, Intel is announcing some milestones. Intel and Broad have developed a new reference architecture, called the Broad-Intel Genomics Stack (BIGstack), which delivers a 5X improvement to Broad's genomics analytics pipeline. It uses Intel's CPUs, Omni-Path Fabric, and SSDs. The stack also includes optimizations for the Intel's integrated CPU and FPGAs. The new architecture supports data volumes "at truly unprecedented scale," wrote Jason Waxman, corporate VP and GM of the Data Center Solutions Group at Intel, in a blog post. With this sort of advancement in genomics analytics, he wrote, "we can take new steps toward understanding the molecular drivers of cancer and other diseases and accelerating the promise of precision medicine." BIGstack is now available to the 45,000 registered users of GATK, Broad's genomics analysis toolkit. Waxman called it "the kind of breakthrough in affordability for the genomics analytics community" that Intel had in mind when it committed $25 million to its five-year collaboration with the Broad Institute last year. Meanwhile, Intel also announced that the Broad Institute is open-sourcing GATK4. Additionally, BGI -- a leader in China's genomics industry -- is adopting GATK tools, including GATK4, Broad's workflow management system Cromwell and the WDL (workflow definition language) on the BGI Online platform. The move should help align genomics research around the globe, Waxman said. A problem-solving approach IT workers should learn from robotics engineers Sometimes the most profound solution is to change the entire problem.

Thunderbolt To Be Offered As A Royalty-Free Industry Specification Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 24 May 2017 at 12:17 PM EDT. 21 Comments Intel is looking to make Thunderbolt more widely-adopted by industry players. Intel has announced they plan to integrate Thunderbolt 3 support directly into future Intel CPUs. This should lead to more system builders supporting Thunderbolt and allowing for a variety of new possibilities moving forward. Additionally, Intel has said they plan to make the Thunderbolt protocol specification available under a non-exclusive, royalty-free license. But that opening of Thunderbolt isn't expected to happen until 2018.

System makers and businesses alike have been pining for more choices when it comes to processor vendors in hopes that more competition will accelerate innovation and drive down prices. Related articles Today's channel rundown - 24 May 2017 Almost half of businesses operating without digital transformation plans - research Upcoming AMD PC, server chips provide channel Intel alternative Today's channel rundown - 23 May 2017 Kaseya challenges MSPs to ask the hard questions AMD's upcoming chips should give them options in important segments of the PC and servers spaces, which will be a boon for partners, Moorhead told Channelnomics in an interview "AMD-powered PCs and servers bring more choice to the channel and, in some circumstances, differentiation for the channels who assort it," the analyst said. "Both [Ryzen] Threadripper [for PCs] and EPYC [for servers] are unique in very highly threaded environments and EPYC in single-socket [systems]." Intel, with its broad family of x86-based processors, has long been the dominant player in both PCs and servers, with market shares for both well north of 90 percent (some analysts have placed Intel's share of servers at more than 98 percent). Meanwhile, OEMs and end users, for competitive and pricing reasons, have been hoping other vendors will chip away at Intel's market share. In addition, having a second silicon provider gives them protection should there be a disruption in Intel's vast supply chain. There are contenders. Both ARM and IBM through its OpenPower efforts are making a push for a greater presence in the server space. In AMD's case, 12 years ago it had about 20 percent of the server chip market, but that has essentially disappeared. Over the past decade it has made occasional runs at its larger rival in servers and PCs, but with limited success. However, earlier this month officials at an AMD meeting with financial analysts unveiled more details about the company's upcoming Threadripper and EPYC processors - as well as next-generation Vega Frontier GPUs for workstations - giving the industry greater hope for more competition in the chip market and a boost to the somewhat stagnant PC and server markets. AMD introduced Threadripper, a high-end PC chip with 16 cores and 32 threads and scheduled for release this summer. At the same time, officials laid out plans for other Ryzen processors aimed at systems like 2-in-1s and gaming desktops, as well as low-end systems, which are due out later in the year and are based on the Zen microarchitecture. On the server side, AMD announced EPYC, a chip that had been codenamed "Naples" and based on Zen and that will offer up to 32 cores and 64 threads with bulked-up capabilities around interconnect and memory. It could also help reduce costs for large enterprises and cloud datacenters by enabling a single-socket EPYC server to potentially replace a two-socket system powered by Intel Xeons. More details are expected at the Computex 2017 show next week in Taiwan. This is good news for the channel, which will have a broader array of solutions that it can sell to customers. "I am confident [Threadripper] will do well in both OEMs and the channel," Moorhead told Channelnomics. "AMD announced that the Ryzen desktop [chip] would be in the top five desktop OEMs by the end of June, and I have seen models already from Lenovo, Acer and Asus. EPYC is newer, and I'm interested in seeing third-party testing. Intel has 99 percent share in servers, so there is a strong desire to have an alternative." That same desire is evident in parts of the PC market, particularly gaming and commercial PCs, a reason that AMD is currently doing well in the channel, Moorhead added. Threadripper will be "less of an alternative, but likely the only 32-thread desktop CPU available for a while", he noted. It's now up to partners to learn as much as they can about the new AMD chips, according to the analyst. "The channel should take advantage of all the channel training AMD has available and also trial the products to get up to speed with how they work," Moorhead said. "Technical training is the fairest priority, followed by go-to-market training. In addition, the channel should work to leverage market development funds from both AMD and OEM, he said.   Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   Topics Vendor Hardware PCs Servers Intel PC servers Hardware vendor More news Today's channel rundown - 24 May 2017 Daily tech news and analysis channel partners need to know now, including APC's Cisco certification, Guidance's GDPR research, iland's partner program and more Channel Business 24 May 2017 Almost half of businesses operating without digital transformation plans - research IT services and telecommunciation services in demand for digital transformers, CenturyLink data finds Research 24 May 2017 GDPR compliance lag putting pressure on partners Partners have opportunity to build reputation in cloud, datacenter managed services Solution Provider 24 May 2017 Upcoming AMD PC, server chips provide channel Intel alternative Analyst discusses implications of new Ryzen and EPYC processors Vendor 24 May 2017 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Thunderbolt 3 aims to be the one USB-C connector that can support high-performance single-cable docks, 4K photos and video, VR, and more. Intel today announced its plans to integrate Thunderbolt 3 into future Intel CPUs. Also, Intel is releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification to the industry next year. Both these moves will drive large-scale mainstream adoption of Thunderbolt. If Intel integrates Thunderbolt 3 into CPUs, OEMs can build thinner and lighter systems with only Thunderbolt 3 ports. Such designs will require less board space and reduce power by removing the discrete component needed for existing systems with Thunderbolt 3. Also, releasing the Thunderbolt protocol specification under a nonexclusive, royalty-free license will increase Thunderbolt adoption by encouraging third-party chip makers to build Thunderbolt-compatible chips. Intel is partnering with Apple, Microsoft and others to improve support for Thunderbolt 3 on popular operating systems. With the recently released Windows 10 Creators Update, Microsoft enhanced Thunderbolt 3 device plug-and-play support. Now, Intel is working with Microsoft to further enhance the experience in upcoming Windows updates. “Microsoft and Intel are working together to enable Thunderbolt 3 on Windows PCs to deliver on the ‘if it fits, it works’ potential of USB-C,” said Roanne Sones, general manager, Strategy and Ecosystem for Windows and Devices at Microsoft. “The Windows 10 Creators Update enhanced plug-and-play support for Thunderbolt 3 devices, with additional enhancements planned for future OS releases.” I really hope Microsoft starts including Thunderbolt 3 ports in their Surface family of devices in the future.

By Tiernan Ray May 24, 2017 10:43 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Rosenblatt Securities’s Hans Mosesmann this morning reiterates a Buy rating on shares of chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), after reviewing some of the past week’s coverage of the company’s recently introduced parts, and finding encouraging signs for the company vis a vis Intel (INTC). Mosesmann, who has a Sell rating on Intel stock, cites one piece from May 17th by The Next Platform’s Timothy Prickett Morgan that concerns the “EPYC” server chip that AMD unveiled a week ago Monday at its annual analyst meeting. Morgan writes that AMD is going to take on Intel by offering so-called single-socket chips for servers that are as good on performance as Intel’s, while saving customers 30% of the total cost of an Intel part that is “dual-socket." Writes Mosesmann, "More datapoints are coming out regarding AMD's thrust in servers with the EPYC 1-socket vs. Xeon 2-socket debate that strikes us as quite disruptive to the hyperscale world (half the area, big memory bandwidth and I/O advantage for EPYC)." "But also the fact that most enterprise software is priced on a per socket basis (not cores); which also is an interesting derivative." In addition, Mosesmann cites an article by Usman Pirzada of WCCFTech, which states AMD’s “yield” of chips from manufacturing is going better than expected, itself citing an article by Gian Maria Forni of BitsandChips.it. Mosesmann is impressed with that: "More datapoints pointing to AMD Zen yields that are better than expected and a article indicating 4 core die size advantage of 10% vs. equivalent Intel Sky- lakes. This is remarkable to us given AMD's use of a more modest Global- Foundries 14nm process node (vs. Intel 14nm)."

Fortune Insiders Search Search CybersecurityNewly Discovered Vulnerability Raises Fears of Another WannaCry Cyber Attack Harley-DavidsonHarley-Davidson Is Building a Factory in Thailand to Serve Southeast Asia FacebookFacebook Reportedly Signs BuzzFeed, Vox and Others for Original Video Shows Career AdviceWhy You Should Take a Sabbatical From Work Businesswomen taking selfie in office Tom Merton/Getty Images/Caiaimage Commentary Most Powerful Women Here’s What You Should Do When Your Boss Plays Favorites Sandra Lopez May 24, 2017 The MPW Insiders Network is an online community where the biggest names in business and beyond answer timely career and leadership questions. Today’s answer for, “How do you deal with favoritism at the office?” is written by Sandra Lopez, vice president of Intel Sports Group at Intel. Favoritism in the workforce is extremely cancerous. It affects the morale of the organization and demotivates employees. To help create an inclusive workforce, we must work together to help end favoritism at work. Here’s how each person involved can play a role in the process: The victim If you feel that you are a victim of favoritism, you first need to ensure that what you are experiencing is in fact favoritism. If possible, engage with one of your colleagues and determine if they too are observing favoritism in the office. When you see your boss possibly favoring one employee over the others, ask your colleagues what they think of your boss’s actions. It is important that you do not bias your colleagues; as such, ask open-ended questions. If you do believe favoritism is going on, it is time for you to tell your boss that they’re being discriminating. In the discussion, provide concrete examples of when you experienced favoritism. After the discussion, begin correcting favoritism in real time; this can correct the bad behavior more quickly. For example, when the favorite is being asked for input more than others are, you can state, “We hear from Sandra often. I think we should hear from Mary right now.” The favorite In one phase of my career, I was the favorite. I continuously would question if I was being rewarded because of my talents or because I was the teacher’s pet. You are most likely a favorite if you are the recipient of more office kudos than others, being included in more meetings, or being continuously asked to lead special projects. If you are the favorite, then your colleagues are most likely referring to you as “that person” and are unlikely to respect you and your work. If you find yourself in this role, have an honest conversation with your manager and inform them of the importance of being treated objectively. Continue to have this conversation until their behavior starts to change. Also, inform your colleagues that you are aware of the unfair treatment and that you are taking action. The next time you are asked to drive a special project, suggest that someone else head it instead. The observer If you see favoritism outside of your department, you still have the responsibility to take action. Discuss your observations with your direct manager and provide concrete examples of how the other department’s manager is treating their employees unfairly. Whether you are the victim, favorite, or observer, you need to take action if you notice favoritism at the office.

USB-C is a complicated specification — just because a port is physically a USB-C port, doesn’t mean it’s got the same technology driving it on the inside. One of those standards is Intel’s Thunderbolt 3, the current generation of Intel’s ultra-fast data transfer system, which switched from using the Mini DisplayPort connection to USB-C. Thunderbolt 3 is one of the most versatile USB-C solutions out there, with fast speeds and charging, but Intel’s licensing fees also meant that its more expensive to use. By opening up the protocol, Intel hopes to encourage “broader adoption in the ecosystem, with a lot of different peripherals and other devices,” Jason Ziller, who leads Intel’s Thunderbolt development, tells Wired. Intel is also reportedly working to integrate Thunderbolt 3 into future CPUs, which should also help adoption.

The move should help expand the Thunderbolt ecosystem by making the protocol more affordable for technology companies and accessory makers alike. Intel expects third-party Thunderbolt-compatible chip development to accelerate a wide range of new devices and user experiences. Intel also revealed plans to integrate Thunderbolt 3 into its future CPUs, but it didn't provide a timeline as to when. The all-in-one design will take up less space on a Mac or PC's logic board, and reduce power consumption by eliminating the need for a standalone Thunderbolt controller. “Apple and Intel have collaborated on Thunderbolt from the beginning, and as the industry leader in its adoption, we applaud Intel’s efforts to integrate Thunderbolt technology into its CPUs and open it up to the rest of the industry,” said Dan Riccio, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering.Intel said Thunderbolt 3 built into the processor could pave the way for thinner and lighter devices, although the current Thunderbolt 3 controller used in Apple's latest MacBook Pro has a package size of 10.7mm×10.7mm, so any logic board space saved would likely be negligible. The greater benefit will likely come from Thunderbolt 3's increased power efficiency, paving the way for longer battery life. Thunderbolt 3 carries power, USB, DisplayPort, HDMI, and VGA over a single port that shares the USB-C connector design, creating one standard for connecting most accessories and peripherals. Apple's latest MacBook Pro has two or four Thunderbolt 3 ports depending on the model. Thunderbolt 3 can transfer data at speeds up to 40Gbps, allowing for a full 4K movie to be transferred in less than 30 seconds. The interface is suitable for 4K virtual reality experiences on PCs, high-end gaming, and single-cable peripherals such as external displays, docks, and storage drives. Tags: Intel, Thunderbolt 3 [ 177 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) Return Zero 16 hours ago at 08:05 am Sounds like great news. 40Gbps is just insane speed; I can't wait for this to become a ubiquitous standard.

In 2/3 years, anyone who bought an expensive computer with old ports will regret it Regret it how? Person buys brand new computer today, May 24th. A standard config with USB, HDMI, Display Port, SD Reader. Come 2020, the computer still works. So what's to regret? I bet you can find forum members with computers that are 2, 3, heck 5-7 years old (or older) running perfectly fine. I know my 2011 MBA is still humming along. It's pretty hard to regret something that doesn't exist yet, and it definitely isn't a confirmation that Apple was correct about anything. In fact, didn't Apple recently acknowledge some of their decisions weren't exactly spot on? Rating: 21 Votes FasterQuieter 16 hours ago at 08:18 am I wonder how many thunderbolt capable Macs I'll have gone though before there is a sensibly priced thunderbolt peripheral.

Rating: 11 Votes ThunderSkunk 15 hours ago at 08:35 am Actually it adds to the confusion, as now you'll have to find out if the USB-C port also supports Thunderbolt 3. :) Most of the lower to mid range devices will keep using USB 3 or 3.1 for connectivity, and not Thunderbolt. Rating: 10 Votes OldSchoolMacGuy 15 hours ago at 09:27 am Sounds like great news. 40Gbps is just insane speed; I can't wait for this to become a ubiquitous standard. Sadly so few people get this part. Yes, it sucks to switch and have to use some adapters for a bit but the payoff is HUGE. Once you make the change you never need a different cable for power, and a different cable for networking and a different one for your monitor, and a different one for your hard drive, and a different one for your card reader, and a different one for your.... Switching to Thunderbolt 3 means a single cable can run everything and run it as speeds beyond what anything currently on the market can achieve. I'm already super happy with the new MBP and Thunderbolt 3. When I sit down at my desk, I plugin a single cable which means charging and connection to my dual monitors, external hard drives, keyboard, and other peripheral. Super simple and fast with a single connection. Sure beats having to deal with a million different devices and plugging each one in every time as some seem to love.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Integrated Graphic Chipset Market Technological breakthroughs 2024 Integrated graphic chipsets are incorporated onto motherboard as a portion of chipset, or inside the same component as CPU, like APU, AMD or Intel HD Graphics. On some motherboards, integrated graphic chipsets of AMD use dedicated side-port memory. This is a distinct fixed block of high performance memory which is used by the GPU. Previously, computers with integrated graphics accounted for approximately 90% of all PC shipments. These were less costly to implement, as compared to dedicated graphics processing, however were less proficient. Moreover, integrated processing was generally considered unfit to run intensive graphical programs or play 3D games, but were used for less intensive programs, like Adobe Flash. Obtain Report Details: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/integrated-graphic-chi… Examples of such integrated graphic chipsets are SiS and VIA circa 2004. However, current integrated graphics processors like Intel HD Graphics and AMD Accelerated Processing Unit among others are capable of handling 2D and 3D graphics. These integrated chipsets has negligible or no dedicated video memory and thus compete with the GPU, which is exceptionally memory intensive. Moreover, integrated graphic chipsets can have approximately 29.9 GB per second of memory bandwidth from system RAM, however a graphic card can use approximately 264 GB per second of bandwidth between its GPU core and RAM. This bandwidth is referred to as the memory bus and can be performance limiting. Older integrated graphic chipsets lacked hardware lighting and transform, but newer ones include it. Initially, laptops had been developed to emulate the functionality of desktops. However, increasing demand for laptops for the purpose of entertainment has resulted in the manufacture of more compact devices, like tablets and netbooks among others. Notebooks are designed to function similarly like desktops but are mostly geared towards personal use. Moreover, with increasing declining costs and miniaturization in size of the circuits, there has been an increasing trend of including support for a number of peripherals on the motherboard. The total cost and physical size of the system are being reduced continuously by combining different functions on printed circuit boards. Thus, integrated graphic chipsets are becoming extremely popular in budget computers and small form factor. Considering all these factors, the market for integrated graphic chipsets is likely to grow at a rapid rate during the forecast period. However, there are many high end gaming software and video editing software, which require high end graphics for better performance. In such cases dedicated graphic chipsets are mostly used over integrated ones. This factor is likely to restrain the market growth to some extent. Integrated graphic chipset market can be broadly classified on the basis of applications and geography. By application, the market is segmented into communication systems, consumer electronics, aerospace and defense, automotive and industrial. The consumer electronics segment is likely to hold the largest market share by 2024, due to increasing demand of consumer electronics, such as notebooks and tablets among others. By geography, the integrated graphic chipset market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia pacific, Middle East and Africa and Latin America. Fill the form to gain deeper insights on this market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Currently North America is dominating the market in terms of revenue, followed by Europe and Asia Pacific. Large number of suppliers of integrated graphic chipsets, such as NVIDIA, AMD and Intel among others have their widespread presence in North America. Moreover, many manufacturers are entering into the market owing to huge technological advancements in North America. There is also enormous demand for this market in developing countries, such as China, India and Brazil among others.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You BENGALURU: Mumbai-based fintech company ItzCash has raised Rs 800 crore from US-based Ebix Inc, a global insurance SaaS company. Ebix has acquired 80 per cent stake in the company, thus valuing Itzcash at $150 million and giving exits to early investors Matrix, Intel Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Essel Group will own the remaining 20 per cent stake in the company. ItzCash, which was founded in 2006, had so far raised about $51 million from Matrix Partners, Intel Capital and Lightspeed. ItzCash managing director Naveen Surya said the investors received returns between 3x to 4x of their initial investments. The Nasdaq-listed Ebix is a global supplier of on-demand software and e-commerce services to the insurance, financial, e-governance and healthcare industries, and currently operates in 40 countries, including India. Surya said the investment will allow the Indian company to cater to Ebix clients beyond India and open cross-selling opportunities to sell each other’s complementary services to clients. "This partnership with Ebix will help us to deepen our foray into all kinds of financial services such as credit, insurance, healthcare and investments to accelerate our growth momentum, even outside India," Surya said. ItzCash said it turned profitable in the financial year 2016-17. While the company initially started with prepaid card and wallet products, it has since expanded into businesses such as remittances, financial services and corporate products. The company also has cloud-based solutions at about 75,000 stores across 3,000 cities and towns, wherein the kirana store also enables bill payments and money transfer. "In ItzCash, we found attributes that none of their peers had – market penetration across 3000 cities, 75000 + brick & mortar distribution outlets, CAGR of approximately 35 per cent, and the only company who was profitable amongst all its peers. With one of India’s most prominent business houses, the Essel group deciding to align their interests with Ebix, the decision to invest in ItzCash became easy for us," Ebix CEO Robin Raina said in a statement. Surya had told ET earlier that the company had plans of considering IPO options. "The IPO plan is still open, but we will now discuss with our new partners on when to go ahead with it," Surya said. The company will also look at new partnerships this year, including investments, joint ventures and acquisitions. It recently invested in Bengaluru-based fintech startup Finly, which works on expense management for corporates.

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Brian Barrett. Brian Barrett Gear Date of Publication: 05.24.17. 05.24.17 Time of Publication: 9:00 am. 9:00 am Intel’s Plan to Thunderbolt 3 All of the Things Intel Nearly two years ago, Intel gave a major boost to Thunderbolt, its zippy hardware interface, by embracing USB-C, the do-it-all port that will eventually eat the world. Now, the company’s attempting another kickstart, this time focusing on making Thunderbolt available to anyone who wants it. That may be more people than you’d think. Thunderbolt 3 comes equipped with transfer speeds of 40Gbps, which roughly works out to a 4K movie in 30 seconds. It can power devices, and connect to 4K peripherals. But Thunderbolt’s had six years to go mainstream, a combination of high cost and low availability have hampered its success. USB-C helped with that some: 180 Intel Core PCs now offer Thunderbolt 3, with another 30 or so expected by the end of the year. They’re accompanied by over 60 peripherals. Now, though, Intel is taking two steps to push that adoption even further: integrating Thunderbolt 3 into Intel CPUs, and then making the Thunderbolt protocol specification available to third-party chipmakers, royalty-free, next year. “We think the first thing is going to drive broader adoption and deployment of Thunderbolt 3 in PCs,” says Jason Ziller, Intel’s lead for Thunderbolt development. “The second will drive also broader adoption in the ecosystem, with a lot of different peripherals and other devices.” The broader availability also aligns with an increased need for high-rate transfers and versatility. Much of the workload previously handled by USB ports has been offloaded to the cloud. But in a world of 4K drone videos and PC-driven virtual reality experiences, 40Gbps Thunderbolt’s speed offers an essential time-saver. Assuming ports don’t disappear entirely, it makes sense to get the most out of the ones that are left. As a case study, look at last fall’s MacBook Pro update. It ditched Apple’s MagSafe charging standard in favor of USB-C/Thunderbolt 3, allowing users to power their laptops, connect to a Thunderbolt Display, and transfer data all through the same port. “There always have been and probably will continue to be some wired ports on even the thinnest and lightest computers,” says Ziller. “So having a single port that really do everything that you need is our vision for Thunderbolt 3.” Making Thunderbolt 3 easier to incorporate may help drive adoption, but lowering the cost would as well. The cheapest Thunderbolt 3 cable in the Apple Store currently costs $30. And Thunderbolt 3 accessories tend to ring up at significantly higher sums than their USB 3.1 counterparts. Yes, they offer better performance, but still. Thirty bucks for any cable makes for a hard sell. “Cost is always a consideration,” says Ziller. “I think the integration into future CPUs will help reduce the overall solution cost on the computer. And we’re continually working with the industry to lower the cost of the cables and the devices.” He notes, too, that improving USB-C economies of scale should help Thunderbolt 3 drive down costs as well. Which amounts to a little bit of wait and see, a familiar game in the world of Thunderbolt 3. Then again, the world’s already used to waiting on Thunderbolt 3 to fulfill its very speedy promise. At least now, the journey doesn’t feel quite so uphill. This story has been updated to reflect that the Thunderbolt protocol spec will be available next year, not later this year. Go Back to Top.

By DiversityInc Staff / May 24, 2017 On World Hypertension Day 2017, the Novartis Foundation and its partners, including Intel Corporation, the NCD Alliance, city governments and local partners, announce the launch of Better Hearts Better Cities, an innovative initiative to address the high rates of high blood pressure (hypertension) in low-income urban communities. Rapid urbanization in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has deepened health inequities and increased pressure on already under-resourced urban infrastructures and services. This is critical in LMICs which face a growing health crisis of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, with almost 75 percent of the global NCD deaths occurring in LMICs.[1] The Novartis Foundation is taking ambitious steps to tackle hypertension, the prime risk factor for cardiovascular disease, in low-income urban communities. Better Hearts Better Cities convenes multisector partners – from food suppliers to health authorities, employers and city planners – to contribute expertise and resources for local solutions that improve cardiovascular health in cities. The innovative approach is being tested in three cities, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, Dakar, Senegal, and a city in Brazil to be announced later this year. “To thrive, cities must become ecosystems of health and wellbeing, where each part works toward the same goal of improving people’s quality of life. No single actor can tackle hypertension alone and multisector innovation is needed. This is the driving force behind Better Hearts Better Cities. We plan to create a network of partners to co-design, implement and evaluate interventions that strengthen urban health systems while seeking to innovate the way prevention and care is provided,” said Ann Aerts, Head of the Novartis Foundation. “Cities in LMICs can be made healthier places only through close collaboration, with clear benefits to be gained by employers, governments and communities alike in taking joint action to support a healthy workforce” said Katie Dain, Executive Director of the NCD Alliance, the initiative’s global NCD advocacy and workplace partner. “Our priority is to strengthen NCD prevention and control by uniting and strengthening the civil society networks in low-income urban areas to stimulate advocacy, action and accountability.” Information and communication technology (ICT), or digital technology, is an integral part of Better Hearts Better Cities. Intel Corporation, as digital advisor for this initiative, provides in-kind support by performing ICT assessments in the three cities. Intel plans to utilize the insights together with the other partners to design a more sustainable health system that incorporates next generation technology infrastructure alongside improvements in care delivery. “The affordability constraints and lack of existing healthcare infrastructure in LMICs  actually represent a great opportunity to leapfrog over mature markets, because we can bypass costly development stages that are just not realistic there,” said Jennifer Esposito, General Manager, Global Health and Life Sciences at Intel Corporation. “We’re excited to apply our technology expertise and collaborate on novel approaches that help deliver care at significantly lower costs while improving access and increasing quality.” Progress in Ulaanbaatar Implementation of the initiative is most advanced in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia and home to half of the country’s population, around 1.4 million people.[2] In this capital city, also one of the world’s most polluted cities,[3] more than 25% of the population suffer from hypertension[4] and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, accounting for over 40% of the annual deaths.[5] Better Hearts Better Cities partners, including Onom Foundation, Ulaanbaatar City Municipal Government and Health Department, National Insurance Fund and the Mongolian Chamber of Commerce, seek to address determining factors such as high salt consumption and poor diet,[6] and are co-developing and implementing a first wave of interventions to improve quality and efficiency of care as well as health literacy.

UK pricing is to be confirmed for the three devices but will range between €999 (£864) – €1,399 (£1,210). This is the second range launch for the MateBook series, last year Huawei gave the MateBook 2-in1 its debut at Mobile World Congress. MateBook X The MateBook X is the flagship of the range, measuring 13-inches and powered by seventh generation Intel Core i7 or i5 processors. It boasts an 88 per cent screen-to-body ratio and 4.4mm bezels. The 2K display is made of Corning Gorilla Glass and features an all-metal design. An interesting feature of the MateBook X is that the laptop is completely fanless, so it will be interesting to see if the thermals can cope. Other features include a fingerprint sensor, 41.4Wh battery and Dolby Atmos Sound System. Prices start from €1,399 (£1209) for an Intel i5, 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD storage. The €1599 (£1,382) model will get an Intel i5, 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD storage. The top-of-the-range model costs €1699 (£1469) and includes an Intel i7, 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD storage. The MateBook will be available in gold, grey and rose gold. MateBook E The MateBook E 2-in-1 seems to be the closest successor to the MateBook from last year.  The keyboard has a hinge that can be adjusted up to 160 degrees. It is powered by the power-efficient Intel M and i5 series processors. Much like the original device, the MateBook E will be compatible with MatePen, though it’s currently unconfirmed whether it will be included. Other features include a 33.7Wh battery, fingerprint sensor and MateDock 2. Prices start from €999 (£863) for an Intel M3, 4GB and 128GB SSD storage. The €1,199 (£1,036) model will get an Intel i5, 4GB and 256GB SSD storage. The top-of-the-range model costs €1,299 (£1,123) and includes an Intel i5, 8GB and 256GB SSD storage. The MateBook E will feature in blue, brown and pink. MateBook D At the bottom of the range is the MateBook D which represents a more traditional laptop. It’s a 15.6-inch aluminium notebook measuring 16.9mm in thickness with 6.2mm bezels and an 83 per cent screen-to-body ratio. It packs in a bunch of connectivity ports including a 3.5mm headphone jack, two USB 3.0 ports and a USB 2.0 port, as well as a HDMI port. You’ll also get the choice of either Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, plus an NVIDIA GeForce 940MX graphics card on select models. Other features include a 43.3Wh battery. Prices start from €799 (£690) for an Intel i5, 8GB RAM and 1TB HDD storage. The €899 (£777) model will get an Intel i5, 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD storage. The top-of-the-range model costs €999 (£863) and includes and Intel i7, 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD storage. The MateBook D will feature in grey, champagne gold and blue.

Here’s where to pre-order the new Surface Pro in the UK. At an event in Shanghai in late May, Microsoft announced a pseudo-successor to the Surface Pro 4, which is simply dubbed ‘Surface Pro’. This new tablet-cum-laptop hybrid features the latest 7th-generation Intel Kaby Lake processors and a claimed battery life of 13.5 hours. The new Surface Pro also features a 12.3-inch PixelSense touch display with a decent 2736 x 1824 pixel display resolution – that's a pixel density of 267ppi. There are a raft of storage options ranging from 128GB to 1TB, as well as RAM configurations that fall between 4GB and 16GB of LPDDR3 memory. All models feature an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera that can capture Full HD video, as well as a 5-megapixel front-facing camera that supports Windows Hello log-ins. And then there are the usual bonus features like a headphone jack, a MicroSDXC card reader, and optional 4G/LTE connectivity. Microsoft says the new Surface Pro will start shipping in the UK by June 15, 2017.

Focusing on Nokia’s 5G FIRST offering, the trio will test end-to-end applications over-the-air between Nokia’s AirScale base station and Intel’s 5G Mobile Trial Platform, a proposition which has been grabbing a few headlines in recent weeks. Tokyo will be the focus of the trials, notably around busy tourist, shopping and business locations as well as at public events hosted by the operator. “This trial is an important milestone for the development of 5G in Japan, which will be one of the first countries in the world to adopt the technology,” said Jae Won, who leads Nokia’s Japanese business. “Furthermore, the initiative is an important step forward in our collaboration with NTT Docomo, as well as other key technology partners, as we develop a technology that will meet the ever-growing demands of huge numbers of people living in megacities.” “This is a vital first step to allow us to ensure that we have the 5G network infrastructure available for when we commercially introduce the technology, with an ecosystem of device vendors to offer our subscribers the best possible choice and highest quality,” said Seizo Onoe, NTT Docomo’s CTO. While Japan is generally recognised as one of the more advanced telco markets worldwide, the pressure is on to deliver 5G without delay. D-Day is the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which would certainly be a suitable backdrop to launch 5G onto the waiting world. Although it is a useful little field-test, it isn’t the first surrounding the 4.5GHz band. In Yokohama last November, Japan Huawei and NTT Docomo set up a ‘5G base station’ and conducted a trial using technology compliant with the current 3GPP New Radio standard agreements. It used 200 MHz of spectrum in the 455 GHz band via 64 transceivers to serve 23 separate pieces of user equipment (UE), both static and mobile. At total of 11.29 Gbps of throughput (around 1 Gbps per UE) was claimed with a latency of 0.5 milliseconds.

New Microsoft Surface Pro (2017) vs Surface Pro 4 (2015): What’s the difference? By Luke Edwards 24th May 2017 Features Tweet We compare the new 2017 model of Surface Pro to Microsoft's previous Surface Pro 4 device, to see how these 2-in-1 tablet/laptop convertibles stack up. Microsoft has just taken the wraps off a new Surface Pro hybrid tablet-cum-laptop that it says is faster, more powerful, even lighter and more intuitive to use than the 18-month-old Surface Pro 4. The new name ditches those numbers for a simple Surface Pro title. This is partly because the new model has been completely redesigned inside and out, for an rebooted experience better than ever before. At least, so claims Microsoft. Perhaps the company just fancied doing an Apple, who in 2017 has already released the all-new 'Apple iPad'. The new Surface Pro consists of a whopping 800 new parts when compared to the older Surface Pro 4. So what’s actually changed and will this new platform be the ultimate way to experience Windows 10? Check out our detailed comparison of the new Surface Pro 2017 model with the iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 and Huawei's all-new MateBook E. New Surface Pro is faster and lasts longer than Surface Pro 4 One of the biggest and most important updates for the new Surface Pro is the processor tech. Stuffed inside this convertible device you'll now find Intel’s latest seventh generation Kaby Lake CPUs (with a choice of m3, i5 or i7 processors). These fanless chipsets support up to 16GB of RAM and offer Intel HD Graphics 615 or 620, or Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, depending on the model involved. The older Surface Pro 4 topped out at Intel Core M, i5 and i7 6th-gen models with Intel HD Graphics 540. What does that actually mean in normal speak? Well, you can of course expect the new Surface Pro 2017 model to be faster than the older Pro 4. You can also expect more efficient processing - in fact, Microsoft reckons you'll get 13.5 hours of mixed use on a single charge. We'll be testing this out in full for our new Surface Pro review, of course. New Surface Pro sports a different design to the Pro 4 Microsoft is proud to say that the new Surface Pro is 'ultra light', for added portability and convenience. The official specs place it somewhere between 766g and 786g, depending on your chosen chipsets. The older Surface Pro 4, by comparison, weighed in at between...766g and 786g. Hmm, slightly confusing. When Microsoft launched the Surface Laptop, it made a big deal about that Alcantara skinned keyboard. Well, now it’s added the same material to the new Surface Pro. This Alcantara Type Cover will offer the same grip and tactile feedback as well as high quality finish that you get on the laptop, for a more premium feel compared with the Surface Pro 4's standard Type Cover. Microsoft says the new Surface Pro is also more flexible, literally, thanks to the upgraded hinge mechanism. This will fold right out into the new Studio mode, meaning a lie-flat position ideal for using the Surface Pen. Ports are the same across both Surface Pro models with USB 3.0, mini-DisplayPort and microSD expandability on offer. New Surface Pro has a next-gen Surface Pen Microsoft has launched the next-gen Surface Pen along with the latest Surface Pro device. This features a hefty 4,096 levels of pressure, measuring with a 21ms latency and tilt sensitivity. If you're after incredible precision for your creative sketches, this is the one for you. It also looks like you’ll have access to the Surface Dial accessory that appeared with the Surface Studio. That means the ability to quickly select new tools and manipulate on-screen items with ease. How do the other specs compare? Microsoft's enhanced colour PixelSense display has been used for the new 2017 edition of Surface Pro. That means a 12.3-inch multi-touch screen with a 2736 x 1824 resolution. For the eagle eyed, you’ll notice that’s the same resolution as the Surface Pro 4, offering a pleasing 267 pixels-per-inch. Both the new and old Surface Pro feature 8-megapixel rear cameras that can record up to 1080p HD video, plus 5-megapixel front-facing cameras also with 1080p HD video capabilities. No changes when it comes to storage space, either. Both Surface Pros are available with these storage options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB or 1TB. New Microsoft Surface Pro's asking price is slightly higher than the Surface Pro 4 As you’d probably expect, the latest Surface Pro is a little more pricey than the older Surface Pro 4, but not by much. The new Surface Pro will be released on June 15 here in the UK, starting at £799. The Surface Pro 4, still available to buy now, starts at £749. Since you can spec the models out as you please, that price can go all the way up to just over £2300 on the Surface Pro 4. Meanwhile the new Surface Pro tops out at an eye-watering £2700.

For now, it is simply called the Surface Pro. The company refreshed its internals and design, but the biggest change is rebranding it as a “versatile laptop.” Here’s everything else that you should know. Surface Pro Specs Microsoft claims that the Surface Pro has 1.7 times more computing performance than the iPad Pro and it also lasts 35 percent longer, thanks to the refreshed processor. The new tablet/laptop now packs an Intel Kaby Lake SoC with three configurations, Core m3, Core i5 and Core i7, PC Advisor reports. Microsoft launches new Surface Pro like Apple, with an edge https://t.co/RmWQWnn2Pu pic.twitter.com/U9X1wXpi0p — CNET (@CNET) May 24, 2017 With the upgrade in processor comes updated graphics. Core m3 comes with Intel HD 615, Core i5 with Intel HD 620 and Core i7 has Intel Iris Plus 640. The improved processor also means good tidings for the battery. The Surface Pro can now run 13.5 hours of video playback, whereas its predecessor can only do so for nine hours. Apart from that, not much change took place. The Surface Pro still retains the 12.3-inch PixelSense display with the same 2736 x 1824 resolution. But it is thinner than the Surface Pro 4 with less than a millimeter difference. The rear eight-megapixel camera and the front-facing 5-megapixel camera are still intact as well. Good news is that the Surface Pro still has the 3.5mm headphone jack. The Surface Pro’s RAM options stay at 4GB, 8GB, and 16GB, while the internal storage choices of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB also remain. Surface Pro Design When it comes to design, there is no apparent change as well. Looking closely, though, reveals that the edges are curved more. Business Insider also observed that the new Surface Pro looks and feels essentially the same, so telling them apart might be a chore. This means that the same premium finish is present on the Surface Pro. The kickstand at the back looks the same as well, but it can now be leaned back further. Users can now push it back by as much as 165 degrees, which might be useful for using it as a canvas. Surface Pro Accessories The new Surface Pro does not come with accessories, unlike its predecessors. The new and improved Surface Pen should now be bought separately for $99 because people can still use their old one, Microsoft says. The new Surface Pen should be worth it, though, as it is now smoother to use with four times more sensitivity. It measures 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity and can sense when it is tilted, a feature that the Apple Pencil first introduced. The accessory comes in four colors, Cobalt Blue, Burgundy, Platinum, and Black. 5 Things To Know About @Microsoft's New #SurfacePro: https://t.co/lIgt6IwrSa #MicrosoftEvent https://t.co/TXAqymcB4M pic.twitter.com/yuwp02HLe0 — CRN (@CRN) May 24, 2017 The keyboard, as usual, is also sold separately at $129 to $159. It has also been slightly improved but still has no distinct advantage over the hold one. The Surface Pro is also compatible with the Surface Mouse, should users find the need to use it. The new Pen and keyboard are also compatible with the previous Surface Pro devices. Surface Pro Price Considering that the new Surface Pro is not bundled with a Pen anymore, the entry-level model stands pricey at $799. That’s the one with an Intel Core m3 chip, 4GB RAM and 128GB internal storage. Most users should find this variant suffice for their needs, but there’s the option to upgrade. A jump to an Intel Core i5 will set buyers back $200, while a Surface Pro i5 with 8GB RAM and 256GB will cost $1,299. For those who would like to play more PC games, the Intel Core i7 model might be more suitable. With 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD, a unit costs $1,599. At $2,199, the i7 chip is paired with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. The most expensive option of all and the best one is priced $2,699. For that price, buyers will get a Surface Pro with an Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, and 1TB SSD. Surface Pro Release Date Pre-orders for the new Surface Pro are open now. All units, however, will not start shipping until June 15. The new Surface Pen and keyboard should also be available within the next few weeks.

Microsoft announced the new Surface Pro for 2017 at an event in Shanghai, and the product is already up for pre-orders in the US and other countries. On the India site for Microsoft, Surface Pro (2017) is still listed as ‘coming soon’, and its India price has not been announced. Microsoft’s new Surface Pro is squarely aimed at the iPad Pro, so let’s compare the two devices. Surface Pro (2017) vs iPad Pro: Display, Dimensions and Design The Apple iPad Pro was launched in 2015, this is for the 12.9 inch version, which is a closer competitor of the new Surface Pro if you’re going just by the size. Apple did launch a smaller version of the iPad Pro in March 2016, which has a smaller 9.7-inch display. In terms of design, the new Surface Pro continues with the same look that we’ve come to expect from the series. Microsoft claims they have added over “800 new custom parts and used 99% of the space inside the device”. The company also claims to have improved the Surface Pro hinge that now has full 165-degree range of motion, and lets users go into a special ‘Studio Mode’ which has inspired the company’s Surface Studio desktop. Microsoft’s new Surface Pro has a 165-degree hinge, meaning it can be almost flat on the table. The new Surface Pro’s dimensions are 292 mm x 201 mm x 8.5 mm, and it weighs starting at 768 g for Intel m3 version going up all the way to 784 g for the Intel Core i7 processor version. Apple’s iPad Pro with 12.9-inch has the following dimensions: 305.7 mm x 220.6 mm x 6.9 mm, so yeah the iPad is a shade thinner than the new Surface Pro. But remember this one doesn’t have any hinge on the back. Apple expects you to rely on their custom covers for the same. Apple’s iPad Pro is also lighter at 713 grams for the WiFi-only version and 723 grams for WiFi + Cellular model. On the design front, Apple iPad Pro sticks with the design that we’ve come to expect of the iPad. It has the round home button with Touch ID on the front, and a metal chassis. The iPad colour scheme remains at Space Grey, Rose Gold and Gold. You’re getting Surface Pro 2017 in Platinum colour but Microsoft is introducing new colours later.  A new Surface Keyboard has also been launched, which is covered in the company’s next-generation Alcantara material. Microsoft calls this Surface Keyboard as “its most luxurious ever,” though this cover will add another 310 grams to the Surface Pro device. Apple’s Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro adds around 337 grams in weight to your device. Apple’s iPad Pro comes with support for Apple Pen. There are two display sizes in the iPad Pro series: 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch. On the Display front, Apple’s iPad Pro has a 12.9-inch screen which is LED-backlit with 2732 x 2048 pixels resolution, which comes to 264 pixels per inch (ppi). Apple has added fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating, anti-reflective coating and this is a fully laminated display. Apple iPad Pro has support for the Apple Pen on the display as well. With the new Surface Pro, Microsoft has kept the display size at 12.3-inch and calls it the PixelSense Display with a resolution of 2736 x 1824 pixels, which comes to 267 ppi. Microsoft’s Display comes with support for Microsoft’s new Surface Pen as well as the Studio Dial. With the new Display, Microsoft says it has 50 per cent more pixels than a 12-inch MacBook, and that they have provided a colour-switcher, so users can go from SRGB format to an enhanced colour format. Apple’s iPad Pro has a 12.9-inch screen which is LED-backlit with 2732 x 2048 pixels resolution, which comes to 264 pixels per inch (ppi).

Apple’s iPad Pro comes with A9X chip with 64‑bit architecture, and there’s an embedded M9 co-processor as well.

Now this is claimed for video playback and the testing was done with a “preproduction” device with Intel Core i5 processor, 256GB storage and 8 GB RAM.

By: Tyler Bernath | Editorials in Storage | Posted: 1 day, 15 hours ago Comment () | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA   At the end of 2016, I knew time was running short for our beloved MacBook Pro. We purchased that MacBook in early 2014 to take on Thunderbolt 2 reviews since Windows support wasn't quite ready. Three years later the battery life was getting abysmal, to the point I had to keep it on AC power most of the day, the original 128GB SSD had died and was replaced and Thunderbolt 2 was no longer the hot new technology.   With that, discussion and research ensued to find a replacement, and at first, I was 100% set on getting the new Kaby Lake MacBook Pro. At launch, Apple had some issues with the touch bar, and the specs for the model I was looking at just weren't that great for the money, so I considered the current Thunderbolt 3 storage solutions and wouldn't you know, Windows has full-fledged support from nearly all vendors.     With vendor support for Windows, our options grew to include the Alienware 15 R3. After doing some research, I found the Kaby Lake models were fixed to take care of heat issues found in the Skylake models of 2016, and so I ordered our new test system and thanks to Corsair upgraded the memory, the system is spec'd out as below.   Intel Core i5 7300HQ 16GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4 3000 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB MyDigitalSSD BPX 480GB SSD Samsung 960 EVO 250GB SSD   This article will look at the storage performance of the Alienware 15 R3, internal and external. The drives we are using for this purpose include the BPX NVMe SSD from MyDigitalSSD in m.2 Slot 0 and the Samsung 960 EVO NVMe in m.2 Slot 1. The Intel 730 480GB SATA SSD will test the 2.5" drive performance along with USB-C and USB 3.0 while the LaCie Bolt3 will take on Thunderbolt 3.   Benchmarks handle performance differently as well. Anvils has long been a storage performance staple when it comes to storage, so we will pair that with CrystalDiskMark and one of my new favorites, Flash Bench to test the overall performance of each storage medium.     First, we dive in to get an overview of all the connectivity options of the Alienware 15 R3. Unboxing this unit, it's quite a bit heavier than our old MacBook Pro. It has a black and gunmetal gray color scheme, with the Alienware logo on the top. The edges of the panel and base have LED bars with full RGB support.     Starting on the left side of the notebook, we find USB 3.0 along with the USB-C port.     The backside houses gigabit LAN to the far left with DisplayPort and HDMI functionality next to it. The Thunderbolt 3 port is centered and followed by the Graphics Amplifier port and power input.     The right side houses a single USB 3.0 port.     Internally, the system has three m.2 slots. Two are 2280 capable while the third is 2240. The bottom right is where the 2.5" drive caddy resides.     Above, we are ready to install our BPX in SSD-3. The Samsung 960 EVO is in SSD-2 above the BPX.     Of course, no system would be complete without a killer set of memory. Thanks to Corsair we were able to outfit this system with a 16GB kit of Vengeance DDR4 3000 sticks.     NVMe Storage Performance     Starting off our performance tests, we take a look at the NVMe BPX from MyDigitalSSD. Anvils gives it a score of 9267 as a secondary drive reaching 1926 MB/s read and 1170 MB/s write.     Scooting over to CDM, we find the BPX reaching 2719 MB/s read and 1407 MB/s write in sequential QD32 while 4K QD1 sits at 37.2 MB/s or roughly 9500 read IOPS. Write came in at 160 MB/s or around 41K IOPS.     Over to flash bench, performance starts out at 2075 MB/s at 16M holds through 8M and then starts to taper off. Write performance, on the other hand, starts at 1245 MB/s and holds through 512K before it slowly tapers.     Starting over with the Samsung 960 EVO, Anvils gives it a score of 10449 with the Samsung NVMe driver installed. The sequential performance hit 1956 MB/s read and 1024 MB/s write, about the same as the BPX.     CDM showed much higher sequential performance on our EVO. 3145 MB/s read and 1293 MB/s write. 4KQD1 was near 40 MB/s read and 187 MB/s write.     Above, we have two runs through flash bench for the EVO. As you can see, sequential started near 2175 MB/s read and tapered quickly. Write performance is more linear starting around 1100 MB/s and holding that through 1M.     Thunderbolt 3 Storage Performance     Thunderbolt 3 performance can be summed up with just one image. I used the LaCie Bolt 3 before I sent it back to Seagate for this and as you can see I was reaching 2400 MB/s read and a touch over 1000 Mb/s write. Theoretically, Thunderbolt 3 should be able to reach ~4.6GB/s, so we will certainly be on the lookout for which vendor goes after the performance crown first.     SATA 6Gb/s Storage Performance     Back at it, the Alienware 15 R3 uses the CM236 chipset, so things like USB 3.0 and SATA 6Gb/s are native in the chipset. Using the Intel 730, we look at SATA performance for the AW15 and notice it's certainly on par. 496 MB/s read and 455 MB/s write and a score of 4413 in Anvils.     CDM gives slightly higher results of 546 MB/s read and 498 MB/s write. 4KQD1 comes in at 32 MB/s read and 86 MB/s write or 8000 read IOPS and 22K write IOPS.     Flash bench shows strong performance for our 730 holding steady at 505 MB/s read and 496 MB/s write.     USB Storage Performance   USB performance for the AW15 lets us use the USB-C port on the left side. Internally, this isn't a 10Gbps port but rather a gen 1 with a fancy connector. Often newer USB-C devices, even if they use the same drive, will have higher performance due to the better enclosure chipset. For this test, I used the Plugable USB-C Dock that's coming up for review very soon. This dock utilizes the ASMedia 1351 USB 3.1 to SATA bridge.     Performance starts off with Anvils giving our Intel 730 a score of 3083, 1200 points lower than SATA 6Gbps.     CDM performance was higher over USB-C in Sequential read and write. 4KQD1 suffered slightly compared to SATA, bringing in about half the performance.     Flash bench showed smooth performance both read and write. We start high at 490 - 500MB/s and cost slowly down to 400 MB/s at 256K.     Final Thoughts   All in I paid around $1100 for this notebook thanks to sales and reward points I had saved. The base configuration for this model comes in at $1199.99, that's with a 180GB SATA m.2 and a single 8GB stick of DDR4 and GTX 1050 Ti, boosting to the GTX 1060 6GB, brings the MSRP to $1349.99. I should mention this does come stock with an NVIDIA G-Sync display, Tobii eye tracking, and a full array of RGB lighting.   As far as I/O is concerned, I find it lacking, to be honest. I use this mainly on my couch with a LapDesk XXL and Logitech G403. That leaves me with the mouse plugged in on the left side in the Type-C port, leaving the USB-C on the left side and a secondary Type-C on the right. The secondary Type-C is too close to the mouse and its movement to use with any full-size device, especially flash drives or devices with long cords. The ideal application would be to find a wireless mouse with a low-profile USB adapter, or optionally find a Thunderbolt 3 dock suitable to your needs.   Getting down to the performance, the AW15 is stacked. With a possible three m.2 and one SATA, there is potential for high capacity / very quick storage. In my tests, I had both the m.2 2280 slots filled and found no performance loss in this configuration. As you saw from the benchmarks above, the AW15 allowed the BPX to push 2700 MB/s read and 1400 MB/s write and 33K Write IOPS. One thing of note and a few of you have asked me about this, utilities like CDI and other smart monitors will show the BPX having temps sometimes over 60c, and in my case, ran at 63c for a long period.   I talked to MyDigitalSSD and came away with this quote: "Not to worry, our drive definitely runs hot, but the main reason for that is because we put the heat sensor on the controller itself whereas our competition put the sensor further away on the PCB. You will not need to worry unless the drive breaks the 120c mark." The 960 EVO performed remarkably well too, reaching 3100 MB/s read and 1300 MB/s write in sequential tests. 4K performance was near 10K IOPOs read and 37K write QD1.   USB 3.1 and SATA were both up to the task with SATA providing 560 MB/s read and 500 MB/s write with our Intel 730. That same SSD carried its performance over to USB 3.1 in the Alienware 15 R3 reaching 561 MB/s read and 500 MB/s write. 4KQD1 was a bit lower over USB 3.1 than SATA but both performed quite well.   The Alienware 15 R3 offers a solid amount of value in its base configuration. I find the three m.2 slots and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity the most useful for my purposes and you can certainly look forward to Thunderbolt 3 reviews coming to you very soon using this notebook.

This is perhaps why other companies look at Apple as a measure to which they can make their products to look good. The latest addition to the ever increasing number of companies following Apple’s footsteps is Huawei. The company just announced its very first laptop in the market; the Huawei MateBook X. Huawei is known for its high-end smartphones as well as tablets and hybrid devices. Now, the company has dipped its toe into the mainstream electronics market by introducing the MateBook X. Apart from taking the look of the MacBook, the MateBook X does have a few tricks up its sleeve. Starting with an Intel Kaby Lake processor The one thing that a MacBook does not have is a good processor. Right now, the most that one can have on the laptop is an m7 chip. Not to say that the Intel m7 processor is a bad one but it does not compare to a full-fledged Intel processor. The Huawei MateBook X, while sharing some design styles, sports the latest Intel Kaby Lake chip. Not only that, the laptop can have as much as an i7 under its hood. In addition to the new processor, it also packs an 8GB RAM as well as 512GB of flash storage. Bigger display Another spec of the MacBook that users have much gripe on is its 12-inch display. While this is more than enough for most applications, it is still rather easy to run out of space. The good thing is, the MateBook X does offer a bit more headroom with its 13-inch panel. Apple MacBook (via apple.com) The 2160×1440 IPS panel has an aspect ration of 3:2, similar to a Surface Pro, and has a brightness of 350 nits. In terms of color space, it can recreate 100 percent of sRGB color. More ports to connect with MacBook users all know how it is to live a dongle life. It is not a secret that the laptop only has one USB Type-C port that doubles as its charging port. Therefore, anyone who uses the said port for charging will not be able to use it for other purposes. The good news is, the Huawei MateBook X has two USB Type-C ports. On top of that, it comes with its own MateDock that splits one of the USB 3.0 ports to two USB Type-A and an HDMI port as well as a VGA port. Enough juice to last a day of use All of these impressive hardware specs will be for naught if there is not enough juice to power them all. Nowadays, most users choose devices that last at least eight hours as a matter of convenience. And this is where a MacBook flourishes. The good news is, the Huawei MateBook X is not the one to be left behind. Packing a big enough 41.4Wh lithium-ion battery, the Huawei laptop can last for up to ten hours of video playback. Huawei MateBook X (via huawei.com) MacBook-esque features For users who are very concerned about security, the MateBook X does have fingerprint scanner embedded underneath the power button. This feature not only prevents non-registered users from gaining access to the device, it can also identify who the user is. Price and release date For anyone looking to buy the Huawei MateBook X can do so starting at $1,399. It comes with an Intel i5, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of flash storage. For those looking for more, there an i7 option for $1,899. Unfortunately, Huawei is yet to announce the official release of the laptop. Nevertheless. Consumers can expect the laptop to become available anything before the end of this year. For more updates on the Huawei MateBook X, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 was announced in Shanghai at Microsoft's event on 23 May 2017. Starting from $1199 in Australia, the new Surface will be available on 15 June 2017, the same day as the new Surface Laptop. The new 2017 Surface Pro remains largely unchanged from the Pro 4, but has one significant change - Microsoft no longer considers it a 2-in-1 device, but rather a laptop, as the company believes it provides everything you'd need on a laptop.  The new device is named as the 'new Surface Pro', it doesn't follow the numeric sequence many thought it would follow. So no, it isn't called the 'Microsoft Surface Pro 5'. Microsoft Surface Pro: Features and specs The new Surface Pro looks identical to the Pro 4, but has several fundamental differences. The biggest news is the inclusion of new Intel Kaby Lake processors. This time around, the new Surface Pro will start shipping with the Intel Core m processors too, which sits aside the Core i5 and Core i7 processors. This also means that its internal graphics have received a cyclical update, with the Intel HD 615 and 620 in the Core m3 and Core i5 models respectively. The Core i7 model comes with the more powerful Iris Plus 640 iGPU. Memory configurations haven't changed, with 4-, 6- and 16GB models available. Its internal memory has received a healthy boost with PCIe NVMe technology now used throughout its internal SSDs, with a choice of 128-, 256-, 512GB and 1TB are available. Another notable change is its quoted battery life. It's now 13.5hrs, up from 9hrs on the Pro 4. This sizable increase in battery life will be good news for those looking to use the laptop without the sight of a power plug. If you like listening to music directly from your Surface Pro, you'll be pleased to know that the 2017 version focuses on delivering better sound. A front-facing 5-megapixel camera and microphone are also used to access Skype and Windows Hello features, which are both fundamental parts Windows 10. There's also an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera for taking pictures of scenery. USB Type-C is still missing from the new Surface Pro, with Microsoft opting to maintain its proprietary connector for charging. On the plus side, there's still an SD card slot, mini-DisplayPort, a standard USB Type-A 3.0 port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Wireless connectivity options include Wi-Fi 802.11ac and Bluetooth v4.1. Unfortunately, the rumours of a stunning 4K display aren't true. The same 2,736 x 1,824 (267ppi) resolution is utilised with a PixelSense display, which allows multitouch and a visually accurate display. The Surface's accessories have also received an update, with both the keyboard and pen receiving healthy updates. The Type Cover keyboard now has slightly more travel distance, allowing you to type more naturally. The pen has double a number of supported pressure levels, allowing you to more accurately draw or write on your new Surface Pro. The Type Cover is available from $169 and the Surface Pen is set to cost $US99. You'll be pleased to know that you can use the $US99 Surface Dial with thew new Surface Pro. This allows designers greater freedom and allows them to replicate a Microsoft Surface Studio. Finally, you can look forward to LTE variants of the new Surface Pro, with Microsoft announcing that in Fall 2017 there will be devices that can independently from an access point.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Chuwi SurBook 12.3 inch Apollo Lake tablet launches for $299 and up (for crowdfunding early birds) 05/24/2017 at 5:00 AM by Brad Linder 2 Comments Chuwi’s 12.3 inch tablet with a Microsoft Surface Pro-style display is now up for pre-order from crowdfunding site Indiegogo. Like Microsoft’s premium tablet, the SurBook features a 2736 x 1824 pixel display and a built-in kickstand that lets you connect an optional keyboard and use the tablet like a notebook PC (on a flat surface, anyway). But while Microsoft’s newest Surface Pro sells for $799 and up, Chuwi is offering its tablet for as little as $299 to early bird backers of the Indieogogo campaign. One key difference? Microsoft’s new Suface Pro tablets have Intel Kaby Lake processors. The Chuwi SurBook has a 6 watt Intel Celeron N3450 Apollo Lake processor. You’ll also probably get better build quality and support from Microsoft, as well as support for that fancy new Surface Pen.  But if you’re looking for a budget option, there’s a lot to like about the SurBook. The tablet featrues 6GB of RAM, a USB Type-C port and two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, a 10,000 mAh battery and an optional pen and detachable keyboard. Chuwi’s tablet measures 11.7″ x 8″ x 0.37″ and weighs about 2.1 pounds without a keyboard, and the company says it should offer up to 8 hours of battery life. It’s also fanless, has a magnesium alloy body, and features 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 and stereo speakers. A pledge of $299 reserves a tablet with 64GB of storage that should ship in July. Or you can pledge $349 for the same tablet plus a keyboard and a pen with support for 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity. And a $399 pledge reserves a 128GB tablet/keyboard/pen combo. Those prices are only available for the first 200 Indiegogo pledges at each level though. After that, the prices go up to: $369 for a 64GB tablet $473 for a 64GB tablet/pen/keyboard combo $498 for a 128GB tablet/pen/keyboard combo Note that this is actually the second time we’ve written about the launch of an Indiegogo campaign for this tablet. It looks like someone jumped the gun last week by launching a campaign a bit early, and then pulling down the web page. This time Chuwi gave me a heads up that the campaign is set to go live, so I’m pretty sure the campaign isn’t going anywhere. Chuwi is a pretty well established PC maker in China at this point and the company probably doesn’t need to run a crowdfunding campaign for the new tablet. The campaign goal is set at $30,000 which is not nearly enough to cover the costs of research, design, and manufacturing this sort of tablet. But a crowdfunding campaign does provide a way to build some buzz and gauge the level of interest in the product.

For instance I was looking at Clevo’s laptop range and only the desktop-equivalents (which I refuse to call laptops) have it. Among tablets, I think we’re limited to the Dell XPS 12 but I’m not 100% sure on that. I have yet to see it on anything coming out of china’s design houses.

This subtly named model is the new flagship Intel Z270-based motherboard in MSI's Gaming series, and thus displaces the well-reviewed Z270 Gaming M7. Though now officially unveiled, MSI did not provide an extensive specifications breakdown for this new model. However, certain elements can be deduced just by looking at the motherboard itself. First and foremost, given its unusually large width, this is clearly an Extended ATX form factor model. This is most evident if you look at the amount of PCB space between the DDR4 memory slots and the edge of the motherboard. In that top-right corner you will also notice a debug LED, power and reset buttons, and the familiar MSI Game Boost Knob. The Z270 GODLIKE appears to have good storage connectivity, with one U.2 port, six SATA 6Gb/s ports, one USB 3.1 Gen2 header, two USB 3.0 headers, and three USB 2.0 headers. The triple M.2 slots with M.2 Shields are obviously one of the defining features of this new model. There are four steel-reinforced mechanical PCIe x16 slots, as well as a single PCIe x1 slot. The onboard audio duties are handled by the new AUDIO BOOST 4 XTREME implementation, which features fully isolated audio circuitry, an ESS DAC, and two audio CODECs that will allow gamers the option of using headphones and speakers at the same time. As you would expect on a gaming motherboard released in 2017, MSI's Mystic Light RGB LED lightning feature has clearly found its way to the Z270 GODLIKE GAMING. There are fifteen RGB LEDs spread throughout the motherboard, all of which can be independently controlled, along with a 4-pin header that can power an LED light strip. Thanks to the Mystic Light Sync integration, the included Phanteks Rainbow Strip can be made to match the colors and effects of the onboard RGB LEDs. This same sync concept applies to any future Mystic Light Sync compatible products. One interesting development is that the Z270 GODLIKE Gaming is going to be first motherboard to utilize the brand new ASMedia ASM3142 USB 3.1 Gen2 host controller. While we don't know much about the new controller, it is the clear successor to the ASM2142, which was the first USB 3.1 Gen2 controller connected with two PCIe 3.0 lanes and thus capable of handling up to 16Gb/s. ASMedia claims that the new ASM3142 controller will not only improve performance, but consume at least 50% less power than previous USB controllers. The performance claims are interesting, since the ASM2142 already had a pretty solid performance advantage over the Intel Alpine Ridge controllers.  Another industry first - and apparently an exclusive feature - is the inclusion of Rivet's new Killer xTend technology. By combining the network capabilities of three Killer E2500 LAN controllers and an onboard Killer Wireless-AC 1535 WiFi module, Killer xTend essentially turns the motherboard into both a network switch and a Wi-Fi extender. How these network expansion capabilities work for a wired setup is that one of the three ethernet ports act as a WAN port - in other words the internet input - while the other two act as conventional LAN ports to which you can connect other PCs or even gaming consoles. The Wi-Fi module can be used to wirelessly connect the primary gaming PC to the internet, or as a 867Mbps wireless link to the other PCs/connected devices when using a wired internet connection, or it can even handle both wireless connections when acting as a Wi-Fi range extender. This removes the need to purchase additional networking hardware, simplifies configuration, and of course prioritizes traffic to the Killer-powered gaming PC over that of other connected devices. We have no word with regard to pricing or availability, but we definitely expect additional information at Computex 2017.

Reply unityofsaints - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link PS/2 has n-key rollover, USB doesn't. Also, when extreme overclocking (e.g. LN2), USB can hurt stability. Reply fazalmajid - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link Will n-key rollover still work when it's not a real PS/2 keyboard but a USB one with adapter, as most are nowadays? Reply Samus - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link Of course. The keyboard controller detects when PS/2 is used and can simply pass more simultaneous keystrokes (or more specifically...simultaneous grid connections) Reply North01 - Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - link Interesting how they have a 6.35 mm (1/4 inch) headphone jack on the back. Reply mr_tawan - Thursday, May 25, 2017 - link Guess they will add XLR in the future. Reply Lolimaster - Thursday, May 25, 2017 - link Why would you want an obsolete platform when you got AM4 with upgrades till 2020?

It will certainly add some additional transistors to Intel cpus looking ahead, however, and Thunderbolt has had years to achieve widespread adoption and so far has gathered little interest--being custom-cable-dependent has a lot to do with it, imo. Probably looking at another Firewire story--although I suspect Firewire even though it failed ultimately garnered a far wider adoption than has Thunderbolt thus far--and for the same reason--the Tbolt cables, again.     waltc3 View Public Profile Find all posts by waltc3   (#3) hpascoa Newbie     Videocard: AORUS Radeon RX580 8G Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 1700 Mainboard: ASRock X370 Taichi Memory: 16GB G.SKILL DDR4-3200 Soundcard: Realtek ALC1220 (onboard) PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 650 G3 Yesterday, 21:03 | posts: 22 | Location: USA Quote: next year Intel plans to make the Thunderbolt protocol specification available to the industry under a nonexclusive, royalty-free license. That's excellent news. I really do like the idea behind TB, it's a shame Intel was never willing to let 3rd parties in on the game. Hopefully this will also mean that we will eventually see TB available on AMD systems. Quote: IMO, not very interesting as the expensive/complex part of Thunderbolt is in the cables The reason why the cables are expensive is because the technology hasn't become mainstream yet. It's like HDMI back in the day when it first came out and the cables cost a fortune. Once production reaches critical mass, then prices will come down. They could have driven up adoption of TB3 back in 2015, if they had built it into the 100 series chipset when they released Skylake, instead of relegating it into the separate (and expensive) Alpine Ridge controller. Motherboard manufacturers didn't want to drive up prices, or lower their margins, on their mainstream boards by including Alpine Ridge, so the feature was available only on some high-end motherboards (and MacBooks), and as such never reached the mainstream.     hpascoa View Public Profile Find all posts by hpascoa   (#4) typhon6657 Newbie   Videocard: Zotac GTX 1080 SLI Processor: I7 7700k de-lid 5.2ghz Mainboard: ROG MAXIMUS IX HERO Memory: F4-4266C19D-16GTZR Soundcard: STR-DH550,Klipsch R-15M's PSU: SeaSonic 1200 SS-1200XP3 Yesterday, 21:24 | posts: 35 | Location: Madera CA Sweet cant wait for that shizzel to drizzel on my comzzel     typhon6657 View Public Profile Find all posts by typhon6657     (#5) FeDaYin Newbie   Videocard: MSI GTX 780 reference Processor: i5-2500K @ 4.6 Ghz Mainboard: GIGABYTE Z68X-UD3H-B3 Memory: KINGSTON 4x4GB Soundcard: Chord Mojo+JBL LSR305 PSU: Corsair RM1000i Yesterday, 21:43 | posts: 34 | Location: ROMANIA USB 3.1 gen2 in 2020 ?     FeDaYin View Public Profile Find all posts by FeDaYin   (#6) terremonde Newbie     Videocard: asus amd 6670 ddr5 Processor: amd a-10 5800k Mainboard: Msi a88x gaming g45 Memory: G.skill snipers 1.25v cl9 Soundcard: onboard PSU: thermaltake smart m750 Yesterday, 22:09 | posts: 17 | Location: canada as a fanboy.

I always been under the impression if there nothing wrong and thing are working as they should, dont update mb bios, most download pages for them say same thing. At one point I update my X58 SLI LE to it latest bios when I had no issue and it droped my cpu default speed by 100mhz, and only reason i did this was in hopes the bios update would fix dissapearing ram issue it always had which id didnt fix, to this day that system still has that issue and there remains with 6gb (2x3) cause that only set out 6+ set i tried that ever work and never lost stick. What are your opinions?

Liberman went on to say that he would not go into details about the nature of the information that Trump shared. “We looked into it and cleared the air on the entire issue, and there is no need to continue to focus on it,” he said, adding that “what we had to clarify with our friends in the United States, we did. We did our checks.” Israeli officials were reportedly “furious” that Trump gave the information, which concerned an ISIS terror plot, to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak during a White House meeting earlier this month. Trump apparently tried to defend himself during a joint appearance in Jerusalem on Tuesday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling reporters that he “never mentioned the word or the name Israel” during the Russia meeting. “Intelligence cooperation is terrific, never been better,” Netanyahu added.

Samsung is elevating the foundry business to show its independence and guarantee its access to resources within the company. The South Korean company on Wednesday also promised customers that it will introduce new production techniques ahead of competitors and have a new plant up and running by the fourth quarter of this year. Creating a separate unit for the business may ease the concerns of some potential customers who compete with other parts of Samsung, said Kelvin Low, a senior director of foundry marketing. “As part of our commitment to play seriously in the foundry area we felt that it was best that we create an independent organization,” Low said. “That will result in less conflict of interest -- although that’s not really an issue these days -- it’s still a perception in some customers’ minds.” Samsung’s commitment underlines the importance of its chip unit and the growth in demand for outsourced production of chips. Fewer companies than before can afford to invest the billions of dollars it takes to build and equip plants and fund research into new manufacturing. TSMC, which dominates the market by producing components for companies such as Apple Inc., has posted double-digit percentage revenue gains for the last five years. In March, Intel Corp., which is the world’s largest maker of chips through its lead in the market for computer microprocessors, said it’s recommitting itself to building its own made-to-order chip business and claimed its manufacturing is still ahead of Samsung and TSMC. All three companies fight for orders from companies such as Qualcomm Inc. and Apple, which design their own chips but don’t own any manufacturing. The electronics arm of South Korea’s largest business group doesn’t currently break out sales of its foundry unit. As the world’s biggest maker of memory chips, sales of those components make up most of the company’s total semiconductor revenue, contributing 12.12 trillion won ($10.5 billion) of 15.66 trillion won in the first quarter. That indicates the other chips, including foundry produced and those made for its own internal consumption, had sales of 3.54 trillion won in the quarter, a gain of 10 percent from a year earlier. That’s still less than half of the $7.53 billion in revenue TSMC posted in the quarter. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Samsung, whose chip unit provided two-thirds of companywide operating profit, is locked in a race with TSMC and Intel to improve factory output in increments the industry refers to as nanometers. Currently the best is 10-nanometer production. Samsung said it was the first to mass produce at that node and TSMC said it’s now in full production of 10 nanometer with a rapid increase in output due in the second half of this year. Samsung on Wednesday said 8 nanometer is coming later this year and 7 will follow in 2018. Its 7-nanometer production will be the first to use extreme ultraviolet lithography -- a new version of the process of burning the circuit patterns into layers of materials on silicon to create chips. Switching to that will reduce the number of steps required, reduce cost and make the chips perform better, Samsung said. The company believes it will begin to introduce 4-nanometer production in 2020, a step which will require a brand new arrangements of transistors, the fundamental building blocks of chips.

Peter Bright - May 24, 2017 11:10 pm UTC Enlarge / It was either this or yet another picture of some lightning. Airwolfhound reader comments 69 Share this story We're big fans of Thunderbolt 3 here at Ars, attracted by its enormous versatility, high performance, and the promise of being a single port and a single cable that can do it all. While the technology is becoming increasingly common on high-end portables, it's still far from ubiquitous. Intel has announced a couple of measures that should go a long way toward boosting Thunderbolt 3's adoption. The first step is straightforward and, in our view, a long time coming: the company is going to finally integrate Thunderbolt 3 into its processors. Although the first Thunderbolt 3 chips, codenamed "Alpine Ridge," were released in the third quarter of 2015, last year's Kaby Lake chipsets, including the high-end Z270, didn't include any native Thunderbolt 3 support. Instead, vendors had to add Alpine Ridge chips separately, with many of them opting not to do so. They preferred to avoid both the extra expense and extra complexity. Alpine Ridge also includes support for USB 3.1 generation 2, which offers speeds of 10 gigabits per second, doubling generation 1's 5 gigabits per second. But while many desktop motherboards do include generation 2 support, they've almost invariably done so using chipsets other than Alpine Ridge. Again, companies want to avoid that expense and complexity. With Thunderbolt 3 an integrated part of the processors, those issues largely evaporate. System builders will still have some work to do if they want to actually hook up the processor to the physical interface. But it should be much simpler for them to do and is sure to drive much wider adoption. Intel did not specify which processors would include the controllers or when they will ship. The second step is perhaps the more important of the two. Currently, those Alpine Ridge chips are the only way to do Thunderbolt 3, with an Intel chip needed at both the PC end and the device end. Nobody else can make Thunderbolt 3 controllers. But next year, Intel says that it is going to make the Thunderbolt 3 specification available on a non-exclusive, royalty-free basis. This will enable third parties to integrate the interface into their own silicon, opening the door to, for example, AMD systems with Thunderbolt 3 support and cheaper chips for the device end of the cable. We're still some time away from seeing third parties get on board (and we'd love to know why Intel's not just making the specs available today). But the future for the high-speed interface is looking bright. It's already seeing much more adoption than its two predecessors ever did, and a world in which one cable can do it all is getting that bit closer. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

The Mobileye purchase could push Intel into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when the world’s carmakers and suppliers are keen to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, Drive.com.au reports. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. “This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” says Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. “Mobileye’s technology is very critical… The price seems fair,” she adds. However, industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors notes Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye is a strategic move “very far outside its core business franchise”. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich says the acquisition is like merging the “eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua told Reuters earlier this year that building a truly autonomous car requires more than one player. “The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data.” Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year.

"A business does not have the right to take the Fifth," Senator Mark Warner, the committee's lead Democrat, told reporters as he and chairman Richard Burr pledged to "keep all options on the table". Mr Burr and Mr Warner announced they would subpoena documents from the two Flynn businesses they were aware of - Flynn Intel LLC and Flynn Intel Inc, both based in Alexandria, Virginia. They are also sending a letter to Mr Flynn's lawyers challenging them on "whether Flynn can take the Fifth as it relates to document production", and itemising more specifically what documents they want Mr Flynn to furnish. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up Under the US Constitution, the Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being witnesses against themselves. The commitee's moves stop short of seeking a citation of contempt against Mr Flynn for failing to comply with its subpoena - for now. "We've taken actions that we feel are appropriate right now," Mr Burr said. "If in fact there's not a response, we'll seek additional counsel on how to proceed." Tuesday's moves come after lawyers told intelligence leaders in a letter on Monday that Mr Flynn would invoke his right against self-incrimination because the documents the committee was requesting were "testimonial" in nature. They argued that the request for records of calls between June 16, 2015, and Jan 20 this year was especially broad, adding that Mr Flynn had "more than a reasonable apprehension that any testimony he provides could be used against him". Committee leaders were frustrated with the response and changed the request in a seeming attempt to call Mr Flynn's lawyers' bluff. Mr Warner also said director of national intelligence Daniel Coats and National Security Agency director Michael Rogers "owe the committee some explanation" about the conversations they had with President Donald Trump in which he asked them to pressure then FBI director James Comey to drop his investigation into alleged links between Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams, and Kremlin officials.

One of the fascinating things about the concept of the tablet is that, between Apple and Microsoft, Microsoft came up with the idea first and Steve Jobs first called it out as stupid, and then made a far more popular tablet. With this latest version of Surface, and during what has been a near catastrophic market decline for the iPad, Microsoft has created what the iPad should have really been. I think there is a teachable moment here so let me walk you back through how this all came about. Windows Tablet Back around 2000, Microsoft created the Windows Tablet concept. It relied on partners to build products based on this tablet specification. This was long before Intel really felt the need to create a truly mobile process so the result was hulking laptop/tablets that weighed in at two to three times what an iPad eventually weighed, had around a third of the battery life, and cost up to four times as much. Granted, we didn’t even know what an iPad was back then, and a lot of us thought that Windows Tablets were the future. They weren’t, and it took Jobs calling the concept stupid for us to see these things as they were: overweight, pricey laptops with a feature that made no sense in its size and weight class. As a result, the market, except for a couple of vertical business segments like insurance (forms), and health care, went back to laptops as the preferred mobile product and the Windows Tablet never got to critical mass. Now the concept came out of Bill Gates’ belief that folks who hadn’t moved to PCs wanted something that was more like a pad of paper they could write on and he figured a form factor that was closer to what they wanted would fill the gap. Not only was he wrong, the truth was much closer to them not trusting or wanting a computer in the first place. But Microsoft repeated the mistake it made with Microsoft Bob and tried to apply the new form factor to folks who had no problem with laptops. (Microsoft Bob was initially designed for people who feared computers, where it worked, but it failed because it was presented as the next user interface for everyone, and engineers freaked out.) iPad Jobs came at the market very differently. He took what was basically an iPod Touch with a bigger screen and presented it as something magical and unique. And it was; the iPad was great for movies, decent for reading books and magazines, and better for many games than a smartphone. Much like the Nintendo Wii did initially, the iPad became the device everyone needed. But it was close enough to the size of a laptop that a critical mass of influencers tried to use it to replace their laptops and that didn’t end well. People didn’t want to carry a smartphone, tablet and laptop, they wanted to leave one of them at home. The iPad couldn’t perform as a laptop did, and then smartphones got bigger. The result is the iPad, because it couldn’t grow to replace the laptop and didn’t do telephony (it would have been interesting to see someone hold an iPad up to their head), the product became largely redundant. What Apple should have done is merged the MacBook with the iPad and created a more fully featured offering. But Apple doesn’t like to cannibalize products, even though cannibalizing the iPod to create the iPhone was massively successful. It thought it could get people to constantly buy all three products and it learned that there apparently is a hard line for most folks at two. It did create the iPad Pro, but the market didn’t say it wanted something bigger, it wanted something that could be both a MacBook and a tablet. Just making a larger iPad fell well short. Surface Pro Surface Pro was created as an iPad killer. The problem initially was that Windows is Intel-based and Intel was very slow to recognize that it needed a fully featured product that had far better energy management. The first attempt to bridge this was to create an ARM-based Surface called the Surface RT, which was very much like the iPad but lacked a critical mass of apps, and the Surface Pro, which was more like the old Windows Tablets than it was the iPad. The market wanted the battery life and weight of the RT but the application support and experience of the Pro and whatever these first generations of Surface were, they weren’t iPad killers. To give you a sense of how close this new Surface Pro is to the iPad Pro, the iPad Pro has an impressive 10 hours of battery life, the new Surface Pro around 13, the weight of the iPad Pro is 1.57 pounds, the new Surface Pro (m3) 1.69, the iPad Pro with 128 GB costs $899, the new Surface Pro (M3) with 128 GB $799, and the screen resolution of the iPad Pro is 264 ppi and the new Surface Pro is 267. On specifications, the products are right on top of each other, but the Surface Pro can replace a Windows laptop, while the iPad Pro can’t yet replace a MacBook. Wrapping Up: Teachable Moment Breaking down the history, we had Microsoft coming up with a flawed idea: that people who didn’t like technology would move to a technical solution if they could write on it and then positioning against a broad market that wasn’t initially targeted. Apple was targeting that broad market correctly, but not realizing that Gates did get one thing right: Folks wanted to work on the product. Then Microsoft was the first to put all the elements together. The lesson is that you really need to know the audience, match the solution to the audience, and then modify that solution based on how it changes the audience. Microsoft missed the audience for its product. Apple hit but the product modified what the audience wanted. Microsoft saw this and adapted, Apple didn’t, thus the Surface sales are growing and iPad sales are declining.

Joining Intel and Mobileye, Delphi has been announced as a "development partner and system integrator", with a view to developing 'levels' (the new way of describing degrees of autonomy) three, four and five. Delphi has already assisted with the development of a prototype computer platform, and will work with Intel and Mobileye to further perception, sensor fusion, and automated driving computing systems. “This is a great opportunity for Delphi to use its technical depth and experience with automated driving and electrical architecture to help the cooperation develop and deploy at scale," Delphi CEO, Kevin Clark, said. "Our close working relationship with all three partners serves as a solid foundation for a success." BMW's Klaus Fröhlich said the carmaker's autonomous platforms were designed to be "non-exclusive", and that the addition of Delphi to the mix would strengthen the development phase. The group is looking to apply their technology to a mass-produced model by 2021.

Via Cloud, Now It Can Tell You System monitors vibrations, temperatures, openings of packages Tweet  Print This   David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News After Intel Corp. couldn’t find a device that indicated when sensitive chip-making machines tilted too much during shipping, the company decided to build one. The maker of microprocessors teamed up with Honeywell International Inc., which makes handheld warehouse computers, to create a system that can monitor vibration, temperature, unauthorized openings and a host of other things on pallets of goods or even individual packages. It is being tested by shippers including Kuehne & Nagel International AG, DHL Worldwide Express and Bertelsmann SE. The many freight-tracking products now in the $8 trillion worldwide logistics market usually only trace a large container or truck. The devices don’t have an onboard computer that gives detailed information and on which new applications can be created, said Martin Kolbe, chief information officer at Switzerland’s Keuhne & Nagel. “It’s real-time monitoring on the one hand, but you can do much more with the data,” Kolbe said in a telephone interview. “This is creating a new eco-environment where over the next years more solutions will come in.” The tracking system is part of Intel and Honeywell’s effort to introduce products that use sensors linked to the internet to collect data on machinery, office buildings, aircraft, and freight to make them operate more efficiently or to spot maintenance problems before a breakdown. The Honeywell-Intel product consists of sensors linked to one transponder that relays data to cloud-computing networks where it can be monitored and processed. The sensors, which now cost more than $10 a piece, can be placed on pallets or individual packages while the transponder can be placed among the packages or on the vessel. Honeywell wants to drive down the price of the sensors to as low as $2, said Taylor Smith president of Honeywell’s workflow solutions business. Reducing the cost of the system will help gin up demand beyond goods such as medicines, fresh food and high-tech equipment that require close monitoring and have high value. The market for monitoring freight is about $4 billion, Smith said. “We think this could open that market even more,” Smith said. Insurance companies are keen on the technology’s ability to pinpoint when an incident occurred and what happened to insured cargo, which may speed up claims and settle disputes more clearly regarding who was at fault, Smith said. Many transportation companies provide tracking services, but it’s a patchwork system with some working better than others, Kolbe said. The ability to track a package that’s handed off among different carriers is appealing, and decisions to reroute or even adjust variables such as temperature could be made on the fly, he said. “There’s like a mini-PC onboard so we can start in the future to think about small algorithms to take local decisions for local conditions,” he said.

Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee speaks to reporters at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on May 24, 2017" Courtesy Christian Science Monitor    Shocking: Reporters Don’t Ask Dem Intel Leader About ‘Leaks’ or ‘Unmasking’ Richard Pollock Reporter 2:41 PM 05/24/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Not a single reporter at Wednesday’s Christian Science Monitor (CSM) Newsmaker breakfast asked about “unmasking” of Trump administration officials and leaks to the media during a morning interview with Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is the ranking member on the House Select Committee on Intelligence. Most of the questions for Schiff were about Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election and the legal plight of President Donal Trump’s former National Security Advisor Gen. Michael Flynn. The intelligence committee is investigating the unmasking of Trump officials, and the illegal leaks of their names to media outlets. But not a single reporter posed a question on either subject to the panel’s top Democrat. “Unmasking” refers to revealing the names of individual Americans intelligence agencies overhear when eavesdropping on conversations of foreign persons of interest. The CSM event has been an important interview opportunity for Washington newsmakers since 1966, and it also provides a glimpse into what’s top-of-mind among members of the national press corps. Four presidents and five vice presidents have attended the newsmaker events. Wednesday’s questioning was all Russia all the time. Obama aides use of U.S. intelligence assets to spy on Trump campaign officials and the flood of national security leaks that have driven news reporting for much of 2017 were never in play. Thirty-six reporters posed 15 questions to Schiff at the St. Regis Hotel in downtown Washington D.C. Schiff spoke once about the unmasking issue, but only to complain about having been denied access to National Security Agency (NSA) documents that allegedly show former National Security Advisor Susan Rice unmasked Trump’s aides who spoke with foreign officials. Under the 1947 National Security Act, only the Senate and House intelligence chairmen can see the most classified documents. The ranking Democrat or Republican does not have automatic access. “We’re still trying to get those documents for the full committee,” Schiff huffed in an April 6 CNN interview. “We would like the White House’s help if they are sincere about wanting to share this information. But as yet, we have not been able to make those documents available to the full committee.” The White House eventually caved and shared the documents with Schiff and later with all the committee Democrats. After Schiff saw the documents, however, he fell totally silent. He remained silent Wednesday as none of the reporters asked about the NSA documents and the unmasking issue. And none asked whether he was concerned about the continuing leaks of sensitive or classified information by their colleagues. According to the newspaper’s website, the CSM breakfast promises “in-depth conversations,” which it often accomplishes.  The briefings are on-the-record meetings, and they often feature newsmakers who are otherwise hard to reach for journalists. “The goal is light – not heat,” according to the Monitor.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Internet of Things Market – Rising Initiatives Taken By Governments of Many Nations To Expand IoT Services Worldwide Internet of Things Market is expected to reach US$1490.31 bn 2024, Internet of Things Market is expanding at a phenomenal CAGR of 20.55% 2024, Internet of Things Market revenue share Leaders of the global internet of things market in 2015 included the likes of Google, Inc., Apple, Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon, Intel Corp, and Cisco Systems. As seen, a lot of the key players in the global internet of things market are predominantly from consumer electronics or ICT fields, and a majority of the market leaders are headquartered in the U.S. As one of the highly trending markets in the world today, the global internet of things market is expected to be crowded by a large number of players of all sizes, according to a research report released by Transparency Market Research. Key players in the market are already ahead in terms of development rates and the acquisition of proprietary technologies. Wi-Fi is expected to continue being the leading technology in the global internet of things market, despite the grand entrance of alternative device communication methods such as ZigBee and NFC, which are also gaining an intense amount of demand and popularity. The global internet of things market is expected to reach US$334.22 bn at the end of 2016. Gaining strength at a whopping projected CAGR of 20.55%, this market’s revenue is expected to reach US$1,492.31 bn by the end of 2024. Obtain Report Details @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/internet-of-things-market.html Cloud Computing Opens New Doors in Global Internet of Things Market “It is only natural for two of the leading concepts in device communication, software, and interfacing to find a way to merge with each other to create a whole new world of developments. The global internet of things market is currently finding a massive scope of growth through the growing demand for cloud computing across the world, because IoT communication can help resolve the constraints faced by cloud computing. IoT technologies can help supplement cloud platforms with additional storage options, processing power, and even help out with the energy constraints of hosting large-scale cloud computing solutions,” states a TMR analyst.  The global internet of things market is also being augmented by the increasing rates of globalization and urbanization in all regions. A staggering number of users across the world today have access to multiple branches of information technology, data sharing and storage methods, cloud computing solutions, and communication portals. The global internet of things market adds a beneficial layer to all this unlike any other concept and is therefore in extremely high demand. Real-time Analytics for IoT Lagging Behind The phenomenal rate at which the global internet of things market currently can unfortunately not yet be matched by data safety and integrity analytics solutions. As the scope and usage of IoT concepts increases by the day, there is a very high need for real-time assessment of failures and data integrity across all networks. The real-time vehicle diagnostics, for instance, are critical in allowing a vehicle’s sensors of dangerous road conditions, collision threats, and internal system failures. This is difficult to achieve as in reality, these scenarios require a very fast rate of analysis backed by a constant monitoring status. Fill The Form For An Exclusive Sample Of This Report @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=7214 “The sectors of healthcare, hospitality, and retail are expected to be golden grounds for the global internet of things market to expand on over the coming years. Players in the market are likely to find massive growth opportunities in these sectors through concepts such as next-gen door locks and security systems, connected televisions, improved food delivery, and room settings controlled remotely. Retails stores are also showing a high demand for security sensors connected to smartphones or portable devices to monitor their stores efficiently,” adds the analyst.    Related Reports:- Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-To-Machine (M2M) Communication Market – http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/iot-m2m-communication-market.html  IoT Communication Protocol Market – http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/iot-communication-protocol-market.html Narrowband Internet-of-Things (IoT) Chipset Market – http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/narrowband-internet-of-things-chipset-market.html   About Us Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company, providing global business information reports and services.

The pilot and copilot opened the cockpit window to wave goodbye before disconnecting the plane from the air bridge. Delta ground crew presented each passenger with a souvenir. Several passengers hugged ground crew in a warm atmosphere tinged with a sadness. One passenger who traveled with her family said that Delta has many destinations in Europe and the US, and it is a pity that the airline is leaving Taiwan, because it will be more inconvenient for them to transfer to other carriers. TECHNOLOGY E-paper makes breakthrough E-paper display supplier E Ink Holdings Inc (元太科技) yesterday said it has made a major breakthrough in boosting the resolution of e-paper displays for e-readers, smartphones, tablets and Internet of Things (IoT) applications in collaboration with Japan Display Inc (JDI). The new e-paper displays, combining JDI’s LTPS technology with E Ink’s energy-saving e-paper technology, deliver high resolution 400 pixels per inch, or 600ppi, which is likely to broaden the use of e-paper displays to applications beyond LCD, the companies said in a joint statement. The new high-resolution display module is on show at the annual SID Display Week in Los Angeles, which concludes today, the statement said. TELECOMS APT to show 5G technology Asia Pacific Telecom Co (APT, 亞太電信), a subsidiary of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (鴻海精密), yesterday said it plans to demonstrate high-speed 5G technology by the end of this year as its technological cooperation with Intel Corp bears fruit. That is the latest development a year after Hon Hai inked a memorandum of understanding with Intel in June last year to develop 5G telecom equipment and infrastructure. Supported by APT’s 5G network, consumers will have access to 3D floor introduction and real-time sales promotion via a mobile app when visiting Syntrend Creative Park (三創園區), an electronics retailing venue operated by Hon Hai. OPTOMETRY Ginko shutdown order lifted Ginko International Co (金可國際), which makes contact lenses and lens-care solution, yesterday said that Chinese regulators have lifted a shutdown order against a plant operated by its subsidiary, Jiangsu Horien Contact Lens Co Ltd (江蘇海倫隱形眼鏡), that began on April 26. The company on Tuesday passed a follow-up inspection by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration, remedying shortcomings in record keeping that resulted in breaches of medical device manufacturing rules. Ginko shares yesterday gained 3.52 percent to close at NT$235. REAL ESTATE New home loans slow New home loans at five major state-run banks totaled NT$29.3 billion (US$970.75 million) last month, a retreat of NT$7.5 billion from March and a drop of NT$6.5 billion from a year earlier, the central bank said, as housing transactions slowed. The monthly tally on new home loans at Bank of Taiwan (台灣銀行), Land Bank of Taiwan (土地銀行), First Commercial Bank (第一銀行), Hua Nan Commercial Bank (華南銀行) and Taiwan Cooperative Bank (合作金庫) is considered a gauge on the local property market, as they account for 40 percent of the market. Property transactions in the six special municipalities declined 13 percent sequentially last month, data from the six governments showed. This story has been viewed 1260 times.

Clear Linux Switches From Xfce To GNOME, Benchmarks Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 24 May 2017. Page 1 of 3. 51 Comments The Intel-developed high-performance Clear Linux operating system has decided to shift their desktop focus from Xfce to GNOME. For those using this rolling-release, performance-minded distribution, the change-over happened a few days ago with GNOME becoming the default desktop environment while Xfce is still bundled via the os-utils-gui bundle for the time being. Originally they made use of Xfce for it being lightweight and easier to package, but in seemingly realizing its somewhat stagnate development and plans for making use of Wayland, they are now focusing on GNOME. With the switch-over to GNOME also comes many of the GNOME desktop components being packaged in Clear Linux bundles, making the distribution a bit more useful as a desktop/workstation platform rather than just for cloud/container/server applications. The experience in using GNOME on Clear Linux has been stable and they are making use of the upstream GNOME 3.24 packages with a relatively stock package set. GNOME Shell is the default via GDM while the GNOME Flashback session is also available for those wishing to use the more classic/Metacity experience. With the new desktop stack, they are also now starting GDM by default rather than requiring users to run "startx" each time as was previously the case. Curious about the performance impact of changing over the desktops, I ran some Intel HD Graphics tests using the latest Clear Linux release as of yesterday. Xfce 4.12 vs. GNOME Shell 3.24 was compared along with the GNOME Flashback session. Clear Linux 15430 shipped with the Linux 4.11.1 kernel, X.Org Server 1.19.3, and Mesa 17.2-dev as the most noteworthy components for this graphics comparison. Tests were done on an Intel Xeon E3-1245 v5 Skylake box featuring HD Graphics P530.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman PE Stretch Film Protects Products From Getting Spoiled Due To Moisture And Air Resistance “Global PE Stretch Film Market Research Report 2017” The PE Stretch Film Market is one of the rapidly evolving markets which leads other conventional means of pallet unitization. Market Intel Reports recent published study “Global PE Stretch Film Market Research Report 2017”  Browse 156 Pages and an in-depth TOC on “PE Stretch Film Market” here http://www.marketintelreports.com/report/9dime11541/global-pe-stretch-film-market-research-report-2017 The PE film is used for packing or protection of products which range from loads bundled on pallets to individual items of big dimensions. It has a low thickness and high durability which ensures the stability of the load. The stretch film is used to wrap products. The polyethylene film is earmarked for wrapping loads with the help of a packing machine. The thickness of the manufactured film is from 10 to 35 micrometres. These films have chemical properties that make them different in their flexibility and elasticity. They are moisture resistant and air resistant which makes the products from getting spoiled. The quality of the packaged products is thus enhanced. When compared to a traditional stretch film, the PE stretch film has a positive impact on the environment due to the reduced amount of waste. Scope & Regional Forecast of the PE Stretch Film Market The PE Stretch Film Market is one of the largest and rapidly evolving markets. The stretch film processors have been confident about the increase in the demand for their products. The wrap stretch film continues to ahead of other conventional means of pallet unitization and product bundling and like plastic and metal banding, PE stretch film and pallet wrap/shrouds. The pallet stretch wrapper is the most cost effective, faster, more user-friendly, more energy efficient and safer. Get Sample Brochure of Report @ http://www.marketintelreports.com/pdfdownload.php?id=9dime11541 There are three types of the pallet film which are commonly produced namely, hand-wrap, machine rotary, power stretch wrap, and silage wrap stretch films. New applications for the special grades of PE film are being developed and commercialized in North America and more sophisticated stretch films are designed for existing applications. The demand for the pallet stretch wrapper in the US is expected to grow by 3.5% annually to $3.1 by 2019. This is due to the increasing sales of retail items and with the increase in layering and efficiency in film manufacturing. The PE Stretch Film Market will get a boost from the increased manufacturing activity and spending on consumer goods as well as improvements in machinery and resign strength. Segmentations & Key Players Involved in the PE Stretch Film Market can be broken down into various segments as follows: Products- low density polyethylene, PVC, linear low density polyethylene.

Who needs 'em? Huawei's Richard Yu shows off the MateBook X 24 May 2017 at 15:33, Tim Anderson Hands On Huawei this week launched three Intel devices running Windows 10: a slim notebook, a Surface-a-like 2-in-1, and a conventional 15.6" laptop. “We want to bring a full range of products for your digital life including a smartphone, a smart tablet, smart watch, wearable devices, and also notebooks, the PC,” said Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Group, at a press conference in Berlin. The Chinese company, which is the world’s third biggest smartphone vendor, behind Samsung and Apple, released its first Windows notebook, the original MateBook, in the first half of 2016. The PC market is in decline and many significant players have pulled out of the European consumer market, including Samsung, Sony and Toshiba and Fujitsu. Worldwide shipments declined 2.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2017, according to Gartner, dipping below 63 million units in a quarter for the first time since 2007. So why is Huawei investing in this market? It is all about communications, according to a Huawei spokesperson. PCs matter because they are mobile communication devices: "The notebook is connectivity, like a smartphone or tablet." MateBook X The slim side view of the Matebook X The Berlin announcement shows that the company is serious about notebooks. The MateBook X (from €1399) is the world’s smallest 13” notebook, according to Yu, and is the star of the range. The screen has very thin borders, giving an 88 per cent screen-to-border ratio - compared with MacBook Pro's 76 per cent. There is still room for a front-facing camera at the top. The device is smaller than an A4 sheet of paper, and 12.5mm thin when closed. Weight is approximately 1.05kg. Borrowing a feature from Huawei smartphones, the power button on the MateBook X doubles as a fingerprint sensor, giving you one-touch power and log-on. The MateBook X power switch is also a fingerprint sensor The device is delightful to hold, as you would expect from such a thin and light device, and the sandblasted metallic body is attractive. The keyboard is chiclet-style with 1.2mm of stroke travel and I had no problem typing at a decent speed. It is also said to be protected from coffee spillage. The built-in speaker system is another plus. There is an unusual near full-width grille, behind which sit two 11 x 34 mm speakers, each with dual coils. These are part of the hardware support for Dolby Atmos, a system for simulating 3D sound. Sound was good in Huawei’s demo booths - with anechoic panels just like you have at home (ha!). Lenovo also has Dolby Atmos notebooks, but this works via headphones only, whereas the Huawei notebooks have Atmos via speakers. "This is a combination of a unique hardware design with a custom version of the Atmos software," A Dolby spokesperson at the conference told us. Battery gives up to 10 hours video playback. There are a couple of snags with the MateBook X. One is lack of a touchscreen. At the press hands-on session, journalists constantly found themselves stabbing at the screen, and I was no exception. Why no touch? “It was because of the thickness of the screen part,” a spokesperson told The Reg. “The design should stay thin and light, and therefore we decided against touch for the X.” Is being thinner than a Macbook Pro that important? A touchscreen would not add all that much bulk or weight, though apparently the screen part of the MateBook X is actually thinner, at 4.2mm, than a Huawei P10 smartphone, and this is because of the lack of touch capability. Also you get just two USB C ports, one on either side. The one on the left supports data transfer and charging, and the one on the right data transfer and an external MateDock 2 expander that gives you one USB A, one USB C, one HDMI, and one VGA port. If you need these ports, the dock will be a nuisance, but you can understand why there is no room for them on the main unit. Fortunately there is a standard 3.5" headphone socket. Fit and finish is good though not the very best. We noticed some keyboard wear even on the demo units. And when you close the MateBook X, the screen is not quite perfectly flush to the keyboard but this is nit-picking. It is a lovely device. MateBook E and MateBook D The MateBook E 2-in-1 Next up is the MateBook E 2-in-1 (from €999). This is a 12" tablet with a folding type cover and is a refinement of the original 2016 MateBook. The cover has an improved design, with a stiff hinge that allows free choice of angle when used like a laptop. When positioned on your lap it is better than its predecessor but not as good as a "real" laptop. The pen is an optional €69 accessory and can detect 2048 degrees of pressure – not quite as good as Microsoft’s latest Surface pen but good enough. The E 2-in-1 has a touchscreen, which is welcome. There is a headphone socket and a single USB C port, with support for the MateDock 2 for expansion. The MateBook E feels great when folded but Huawei has work to do on the ergonomics. Although the device is perfectly usable, I found the tablet came away from the type cover too easily when experimenting with different stand positions. Microsoft came up with the Surface design for Windows 8, the idea being to support hybrid tablet and laptop use at a time when Windows was heading for a touch interface as primary for new-style “Modern” apps. In practice you almost always see a Surface used like a laptop, and with Windows 10 Microsoft has moved back to focus more on keyboard/mouse interaction, though touch remains important. The outcome is that the 2-in-1 design feels like a slightly worse laptop most of the time, and I can see this being the case with the MateBook E. Finally, the MateBook D (from €799) is the cheapest and least interesting of Huawei’s Notebook range. This is a traditional 15.6" laptop and not a high-end device. There is a choice of graphics, integrated on three lower-end models, and Nvidia GeForce 940MX discrete graphics on the top models. In the first instance Huawei is positioning the device as a gaming notebook for the Asia market - as Europe and North America require “a very intense level of notebook graphics” that the current model does not deliver. Huawei’s notebook ambitions What are the company’s goals? Huawei is testing the water, a spokesperson told The Reg. “We are entering the market as a newbie for notebooks, there is no particular number of sales we want to generate but it’s more important to arrive successfully on the market. We want to create acceptance for the brand.” Consumers are the initial target - the company is still planning how to approach the business market. Prices seem high for home buyers, but expect discounts. “There might well be some surprises coming up. We are aware of how to deal with the prices,” we were told. No availability date has been published but a worldwide release for the MateBook X and E, starting with Germany is slated in “about three to four weeks”. Is Huawei likely to be significant in the PC market? Given the company’s rapid growth in smartphones, you would not want to bet against it. The MateBook X, in particular, is a great little device that shows the company’s ability to marry its smartphone expertise with PC technology. It could do well if the price is right. ® Key specifications and prices MateBook X 13" screen, 2160 x 1440 pixels, 12.5 x 286 × 211mm, 1.05kg. 7th Gen Core i5-7200U or Core i7-7500U CPU 5449 mAh battery Dolby ATMOS i5/8GB/256GB SSD €1399 i5/8GB/512GB SSD €1599 i7/8GB/512GB SSD €1699 MateBook E 12" screen, 2160 x 1440 pixels, 6.9 x 278.8 x 194.1mm, 1.1 kg with keyboard. 7th Gen Cor m3-7Y30 or Core i5-7Y54 CPU. 4430mAh battery m3/4GB/128GB SSD €999 i5/4GB/256GB SSD €1199 i5/8GB/256GB SSD €1299 MateBook D 15.6" screen, 1920 x 1080 pixels, 1.9 Kg. 7th Gen Core i5 or i7 CPU.

The Senate Intelligence Committee announced it has subpoenaed two companies owned by Flynn. Leaders of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence say they have issued subpoenas for documents from two businesses operated by former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Vice Chairman Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in remarks to reporters, said the subpoenas were sent to Flynn Intel LLC and Flynn Intel, Inc. with a specific list of documents they are seeking. The senators did not say what to what those documents relate. As the Two-Way reported, Flynn has invoked the 5th Amendment and has refused to turn over any documents subpoenaed by the committee related to his interactions with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign. "While we disagree with Gen. Flynn's lawyers' interpretations of the taking the Fifth, it is even more clear that a business does not have a right to take a Fifth if it's a corporation," said Warner. One subpoena has been served and another is in the process of being served, he added. Yesterday Flynn's lawyers said that the committee's subpoena was overly broad and that complying with them would "feed the escalating public frenzy against him." But Burr disagreed and said the committee has sent a letter to Flynn's lawyers questioning the legal basis for his refusal to cooperate with the request for documents. Copyright 2017 NPR.

Intel's Thunderbolt 3 controllers have swept away some of this confusion by providing USB 3.1 Gen2 support along with Thunderbolt's swift 40 Gb/s transfer rate, ensuring that a USB Type-C connector hooked up to such a controller will Just Work™ with most any USB Type-C device. Thunderbolt 3 also lets PC makers implement the USB Power Delivery standard so that a USB Type-C port can charge a notebook PC's battery. Partially because Thunderbolt 3 relies on a discrete controller chip at the moment, however, manufacturers have reserved the feature for premium notebooks and motherboards—if it's implemented at all. This morning, Intel announced plans to spur adoption of Thunderbolt by integrating support for the protocol directly into its future CPUs and making the Thunderbolt protocol specification available under a "nonexclusive, royalty-free license" in 2018. That means third-party peripheral manufacturers can start developing their own Thunderbolt-compatible controllers, as well. Intel's integration of Thunderbolt into the CPU should be an appealing move for notebook and tablet designers who might have otherwise balked at finding room for another discrete component in today's increasingly thin-and-light PCs. Potentially, the technology could do away with the need for proprietary docking connectors on devices like Microsoft's Surfaces. It could also allow for the development of blistering external storage and single-cable VR headsets. There's plenty to like about the idea of Thunderbolt everywhere. Intel being Intel, however, we'd expect to see significant feature segmentation by price point with Thunderbolt-equipped silicon. Less-expensive PCs might get only the USB 3.1 side of the bargain (or even fewer features), while Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs might be the only ones with every feature of the Thunderbolt controller flipped on. We'll have to wait and see just how the company's more open approach to Thunderbolt is received by the PC industry and peripheral manufacturers as time goes on, but we're still hopeful that the technology will be the one to drive every USB Type-C port from here on out.

The actions announced by Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Virg., on Tuesday include issuing two new subpoenas of Flynn's businesses. "While we disagree with General Flynn's lawyer's interpretation of taking the Fifth, it is even more clear that a business does not have a right to take the Fifth if it's a corporation," Warner told reporters after a closed committee meeting. Warner said the committee has issued subpoenas to Flynn Intel LLC and Flynn Intel, Inc. seeking a specific list of documents. Flynn's lawyer sent a letter to the committee on Monday revealing that his client would not comply with a previous subpoena, claiming Flynn enjoys a right not to produce the documents under the Fifth Amendment. Burr said the committee has sent a letter back to Flynn's lawyer questioning whether the Fifth Amendment can be invoked when it comes to documents. If Flynn continues to refuse to comply, Burr said the committee will seek additional counsel advice on how to proceed. Burr said all options are on the table, including a contempt of Congress charge against Flynn, although he said that is not the preferred outcome. "We would like to hear from General Flynn. We would like to see his documents," Burr said. "We would like him to tell his story because he publicly said, 'I've got a story to tell.' We're allowing him that opportunity to tell it." Flynn was forced to resign as President Donald Trump's National Security Adviser in February after it was revealed that he had lied about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. (Photo: Gage Skidmore) by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News DNC Day 3: Dems Attack Trump Weekday At Bernie's: Sanders Supporters Disrupt DNC in Philly Republican Convention: Waiting For Trump...Wait, He's Already Here...Again Next Story General News Poll Shows Support For Appointing Special Prosecutor In Russia Probe U.S. Existing Home Sales Pull Back Off Ten-Year High In April The 10 Lowest-Paying College Degrees Former CIA Director Says Russian Officials Contacted Trump Campaign Trump's "Taxpayer First Budget" Includes Big Cuts To Safety Net Trump Attributes Deadly Manchester Attack To "Evil Losers" U.S. New Home Sales Pull Back Much More Than Expected In April Chaffetz Postpones Oversight Committee Hearing After Speaking With Comey Trump Urges Arab Islamic World To Isolate Iran Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein Stands By Comey Memo Weiner Pleads Guilty To Sexting With Teen Friend Claims Comey "Disgusted" By Hug From Trump Ryan Calls Potential Re-Vote On Healthcare Bill A "Non-Issue" San Francisco Trying To Ban Delivery Robots Most Voters Say Trump Sharing Intel With Russians Was Inappropriate <<Previous        24 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed U.S. Existing Home Sales Pull Back Off Ten-Year High In April Senate Intelligence Committee Takes New Actions Against Flynn President Trump Meets Pope Francis In Vatican The 10 Lowest-Paying College Degrees Trump's "Taxpayer First Budget" Includes Big Cuts To Safety Net Trump Attributes Deadly Manchester Attack To "Evil Losers" Flynn Refuses To Comply With Senate's Russia Inquiry Subpoena U.S. New Home Sales Pull Back Much More Than Expected In April Eurogroup Aims For Greece Deal In June Ariana Grande Suspends World Tour After Deadly Attack On Manchester Concert Member States Made Significant Progress In Fiscal Policy, EU Says Trump Urges Arab Islamic World To Isolate Iran Ariana Grande Suspends World Tour After Deadly Attack On Manchester Concert Trump's "Taxpayer First Budget" Includes Big Cuts To Safety Net U.S. Existing Home Sales Pull Back Off Ten-Year High In April Trump Urges Arab Islamic World To Isolate Iran Flynn Refuses To Comply With Senate's Russia Inquiry Subpoena U.S. New Home Sales Pull Back Much More Than Expected In April Chaffetz Postpones Oversight Committee Hearing After Speaking With Comey Member States Made Significant Progress In Fiscal Policy, EU Says Students Walk Out During Pence's Speech At Notre Dame Graduation Ceremony Former CIA Director Says Russian Officials Contacted Trump Campaign Eurogroup Aims For Greece Deal In June The 10 Lowest-Paying College Degrees The 10 Lowest-Paying College Degrees Former CIA Director Says Russian Officials Contacted Trump Campaign Trump's "Taxpayer First Budget" Includes Big Cuts To Safety Net Trump Attributes Deadly Manchester Attack To "Evil Losers" Flynn Refuses To Comply With Senate's Russia Inquiry Subpoena U.S. New Home Sales Pull Back Much More Than Expected In April Chaffetz Postpones Oversight Committee Hearing After Speaking With Comey Eurogroup Aims For Greece Deal In June Ariana Grande Suspends World Tour After Deadly Attack On Manchester Concert 19 Dead And About 50 Injured In Manchester Arena Blast Member States Made Significant Progress In Fiscal Policy, EU Says Trump Urges Arab Islamic World To Isolate Iran Copyright © 2017 RTTNews.

(Vetr) Related INTC Major Keys From Xilinx's Analyst Day Breaking Down The Reasons An Advanced Micro Devices Deal With Intel Not Likely To Happen Rumors of a potential GPU licensing deal between Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) may finally be over. The rumored deal, which never really made sense from Intel’s perspective, was likely put to rest for good at the JPMorgan Tech Conference this week when AMD CEO Lisa Su said, "We’re not looking at enabling a competitor to compete with our products." The Rumor The origin of the rumor came from the IT website Fudzilla, which claimed a deal had been reached between AMD and Intel on May 16 after a previous licensing deal between Intel and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) expired in March. "We can now confirm the rumors that Intel has given up on Nvidia because it has written a cheque to license AMD’s graphics,” the Fudzilla story read. However, even after AMD management made no mention of an Intel deal at the company’s analyst day on May 16, Fudzilla appeared to stand by its story in a follow-up report on May 18. Fudzilla said its sources for the original story were “well-placed industry insiders” and that “the Intel and AMD deal will include Intel CPUs using Radeon graphics." Related Link: Breaking Down The Reasons An Advanced Micro Devices Deal With Intel Not Likely To Happen The Street Even before Su’s comments, analysts and experts were skeptical of the potential deal. “In our view, the obligation to Nvidia is over and done, with no compelling need for Intel to license patents from either Nvidia or AMD for legal protection,” Citi analyst Christopher Danely wrote this week. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann agrees that a deal between AMD and Intel doesn’t make sense. “The deal with Nvidia was basically a settlement on unrelated issues. This Intel/AMD licensing thing is fake news,” Mosesmann said. After initially spiking more than 8 percent on the Fudzilla report, AMD shares are now down 14.6 percent in the past five trading sessions and 23 percent in the past three months. The stock traded recently at $10.86. Posted-In: Christopher Danely Citi fudzillaAnalyst Color News Rumors Top Stories Tech Best of Benzinga © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Hongkiat.com Main Menu Design / Dev Technology Inspiration Social Commerce All Deals Search Hongkiat for: Reveal Search Form Reveal Off-canvas Navigation Meet Microsoft’s New Surface Pro Published by Sia, in Gadgets — May 24, 2017May 24, 2017 It’s been nearly two years since the Surface Pro 4 was first released and many were hoping that Microsoft would finally come up with its successor. Well, those who were waiting for a new Surface device will be glad to hear that Microsoft has officially announced the all new Surface Pro, and here’s what you need to know about it. All About Microsoft Surface Laptop and Windows 10 S All About Microsoft Surface Laptop and Windows 10 S Just weeks before Microsoft's Build 2017 was supposed to take place, the company held a special #MicrosoftEDU event…Read more Let’s begin with the first thing that stands out about this new 2-in-1: the name. Microsoft has decided to drop the numbering scheme with this new iteration of the 2-in-1, so what would probably be known as the Surface Pro 5 will now be simply known as the Surface Pro. Design In terms of design, the new Surface Pro looks very much like the Surface Pro 4. However, there are some subtle changes to the overall design of the Surface Pro, with the most noticeable one being the rounded edges of the tablet. Speaking of design, the biggest improvement that the Surface Pro has is its new hinge design. For the new 2-in-1, Microsoft has opted to provide the Surface Pro with the same 165-degree angle hinge that can be found on the Surface Studio. This enables what Microsoft calls Studio Mode, which allows the user to lean on the screen itself for support. Specifications As expected from an updated device, the new Surface Pro now comes packed with components that are more in-line with the devices of today. For starters, the 2-in-1 now comes equipped with Intel’s Kaby Lake m3, i5 or i7 processors. The device can sport up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of SSD storage space. However, the biggest talking point of the Surface Pro lies in its battery life. According to Microsoft, the combination of the new Intel processors coupled with improvements made to Windows 10 means that the device is capable of delivering up to 13.5 hours of battery life. In a first for the Surface line of products as a whole, Microsoft will be offering a model of the Surface Pro that comes with LTE connectivity. While Microsoft did not go into too much detail about this particular Surface Pro model, the company did state that the device will be able to support micro SIM and eSIM. Peripherals It wouldn’t be a Surface device if it didn’t have peripherals of its own, and sure enough, the Surface Pro comes with peripherals that have received their own updates. First up on the list of Surface Pro devices is the Surface Pen which has been on the receiving end of some huge upgrades. For starters, the new Surface Pen now has a pressure sensitivity of 4,096 levels, which is a huge jump from the previous 1,024 levels that can be found in the Surface Pro 4’s Surface Pen. On top of that, the new Surface Pen has a lower activation force and it comes with a tilt functionality that works on the new Surface Pro. However, it appears that Microsoft will not be bundling the new Surface Pen with the Surface Pro itself, so those who want it will need to buy it separately. Next up on the list of peripherals is the Type Cover. With the Surface Pro, Microsoft will be offering two versions of the Type Cover for users to choose from. The first version is the standard black Type Cover, while the second version is the new Alcantara Type Cover that comes platinum, burgundy and cobalt blue colors. Incidentally, the Surface Pen will also come in the same colors as the Alcantara Type Cover, so those who are looking to get both peripherals can choose to color match them. Finally, those who own a Surface Dial will be pleased to know that this peripheral will work with the new Surface Pro. However, just like the Surface Pen and Type Cover mentioned above, those who want to use it will need to buy it separately. Pricing and availability Does the Surface Pro interest you? If so, then you would be pleased to know that it will have a starting price of 799 USD. As for the peripherals: Surface Pen is priced at 99 USD. Black Type Cover is priced at 129 USD. Alcantara Type Cover price at 159 USD. The Surface Pro is expected to start shipping out in 26 different countries on July 15th.

Written by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar | Published:May 24, 2017 4:47 pm After the agitated students contacted university, authorities cross-checked with various companies only to find that job offers to not only these 21 but more than 100 students by nine companies were fake. (Source: http://www.soauniversity.ac.in/) At a time when there is massive layoffs in Indian IT sector, students of a top-ranking university of Odisha who had got campus placement offers in multinational companies, were enraged after the offer letters they received turned out to be fake. Over 50 students of Students of Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan University in Bhubaneswar and their parents today gathered before the university campus and raised slogans against the university for being taken for a ride. Though a platoon of policeen were deployed, tension ran high as the parents accused the university officials of playing with the lives of their children’s future. After the agitated students and their parents contacted the university, the authorities cross-checked with various companies only to find that job offers to not only these 21 but more than 100 students by nine companies (Huawei, Ircon Construction, Schneider Electric, Mitshubishi Electric, Honeywell, Toshiba, Magneti Marelli Supertech and Intel) were fake. In March-April this year, over 100 B Tech graduates of the engieering college Institute of Technical Education and Research under Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan University were selected for jobs in Huawei, Ircon Construction, Schneider Electric, Mitshubishi Electric, Honeywell, Toshiba, Magneti Marelli Supertech and Intel through a Gurgaon-based job consultancy. However, 26 of them who went to the Gurgaon offices of the respective companies, were told by the HR officials of the companies that they had not recruited anyone from the university. “We were shocked and felt humiliated when the HR executives told us that the the offer letters were fake,” said one of the students who hoped to join her first job. “For sometime I thought my four years of study was all in vain. The university has cheated us,” said another student. The SOA university officials said the consultancy firm that did the hiring was at fault. “We have lodged an FIR against the firm at a police station in Bhubaneswar,” said PK Sahu, dean of the university. “We have become victim of an imposter who had no legitimate connection with the companies,” BB Pradhan, registrar of the university wrote in a mail to all the students and their parents. The university’s placement officer Raj Kumar Hota, resigned holding himself responsible for the fiasco. “The consultancy did not do proper verification before bringing the companies. It kept us in the dark about the whereabouts of the company,” Hota said in a mail to one of the affected student. In a damage control, the university offered a few options to the affected students. “We will provide a stipend support of monthly Rs 20,000 to them and engage them as teaching assistants for a year or till they get jobs. The university will explore job prospects for them. If the students want to pursue M Tech degree in the university, the entire course fee will be borne by us,” said registrar B B Pradhan. In April this year, SOA university, a deemed one, was ranked at No 20 in India in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2017 rankings of the Ministry of Human Resource Development. The deemed university ha got ‘A’ grade acrreditation by NAAC. In October last year, the university’s founder Manoj Ranjan Nayak was arrested after a blaze in his medical-college-cum hospital killed 21 patients, many of them in ICU. Nayak, a computer teacher-turned-edupreneur, was arrested over lack of fire safety and negligence that cost the poor patients their lives. He was later released on bail, but the accident cost then health minister and Nayak’s friend Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak his job. Before that Nayak had his first brush with controversy in 2000 when the Joint Entrance Examination that conducts entrance test to engineering colleges in Odisha lodged a case of cheating and forgery against him among several others. However, he managed to get a reprieve after the Odisha High Court quashed the case. For all the latest Education News, download Indian Express App now No Comments.

GCC Developers Potentially Deprecating Intel MPX Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 24 May 2017 at 07:14 AM EDT. 1 Comment It was just with GCC 6 that MPX support was flipped on with Intel's Memory Protection Extensions (MPX) just premiering with Skylake CPUs. But now GCC developers are thinking about potentially deprecating this feature. Intel MPX is designed for increased security by checking pointer references at run-time to avoid buffer overflows. Aside from needing a Skylake or newer CPU for the new registers needed by MPX, there has been MPX support within the mainline Linux kernel, GCC compiler, and related components. But now GCC is eyeing the deprecation of their compiler support for MPX. GCC developer Richard Biener had sent out a documentation patch to deprecate MPX. Intel developers have still been sending in fixes for MPX in GCC, but the bootstrapping with MPX has been broken and some developers are in favor of dropping this security feature in order to work on more easily restructuring other code. See this mailing list thread for details. We'll need to wait and see if the MPX deprecation happens for GCC 8 or this Intel security feature is resurrected. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The Senate Intelligence Committee announced it has subpoenaed two companies owned by Flynn. AP Leaders of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence say they have issued subpoenas for documents from two businesses operated by former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Vice Chairman Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in remarks to reporters, said the subpoenas were sent to Flynn Intel LLC and Flynn Intel, Inc. with a specific list of documents they are seeking. The senators did not say what to what those documents relate. As the Two-Way reported, Flynn has invoked the 5th Amendment and has refused to turn over any documents subpoenaed by the committee related to his interactions with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign. "While we disagree with Gen. Flynn's lawyers' interpretations of the taking the Fifth, it is even more clear that a business does not have a right to take a Fifth if it's a corporation," said Warner. One subpoena has been served and another is in the process of being served, he added. Yesterday Flynn's lawyers said that the committee's subpoena was overly broad and that complying with them would "feed the escalating public frenzy against him." But Burr disagreed and said the committee has sent a letter to Flynn's lawyers questioning the legal basis for his refusal to cooperate with the request for documents. Copyright 2017 NPR.

Thursday 25 May 2017 Home Trade News Trade News Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Media & Promotion Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Lifestyle Analysis, Interviews, Opinions Miscellaneous Other Sectors Business Directory Contact Advertise Newsletter Premium Content Home   » Industry, Logistics & Shipping   » Story Sensor data is captured by a mobile gateway placed inside a truck or shipping container Honeywell freight solution provides real-time information UAE, 23 hours, 41 minutes ago Honeywell has announced a new Connected Freight solution that gives shippers and logistics companies the ability to monitor shipments of high-value and perishable goods, helping prevent costly damage and loss. The new solution, developed in collaboration with Intel and third-party logistics companies, provides real-time information about the location and condition of critical freight while in transit. The solution was introduced during a recent Honeywell Safety and Productivity Solutions’ launch event, said a statement from the company. The announcement comes as the Middle East continues to focus on developing its transport and logistics sectors in line with the regional economic diversification agenda, it said. The development of world-class infrastructure that maximises efficiency and creates high-quality services for end users is at the heart of this ambition, it added. Edmond Mikhael, general manager for Honeywell SPS in the Middle East, Turkey and Africa (Meta), said: “Our company is developing a range of connected supply chain solutions that leverage technology and data to make supply chains more efficient, better able to adapt to rapid change, and in turn, support the Middle East’s economic growth.” “For an important and growing sector in the region, the convenient cloud-based solution allows shippers, logistics providers, retailers and others faced with a host of costly freight challenges, such as theft, damage, spoilage and delays, with detailed analytics. This enables customers to plan, anticipate and react immediately to incidents that occur during shipment,” he said. Real-time shipment information is critical, for example, when shipping perishables and goods that require uninterrupted refrigeration, such as pharmaceuticals, or high-value equipment that is sensitive to vibration or shock, said a styatement. Chet Hullum, general manager for industrial solutions at Intel, said: “After assessing our internal supply chain needs and the needs of the industry, we forged a unique collaboration with Honeywell.” “Together, we've customised our connected logistics platform technology to deliver an IoT offering that solves real logistics problems,” he said. “Thanks to data accessibility, shippers and carriers will be able to establish a more reliable supply chain network by having deeper visibility and information on shipments,” he added. Honeywell’s Connected Freight solution consists of cost-effective sensor tags that sense a range of environmental conditions, such as temperature or vibration. The tags can be affixed to pallets or individual packages. The sensor data is captured by a mobile gateway placed inside a truck or shipping container and then transmitted via cellular networks to a cloud-based command-and-control platform, it said. Users can establish alerts based on temperature, shock, tilt, humidity, pressure and intrusion detection. The solution can alert manufacturers of high-value, highly sensitive technology if equipment has been damaged while being loaded or unloaded, or if it may have been stolen. The cloud can also store data for compliance and audit needs, and provide predictive and reactive analysis, such as which routes to avoid, it added. Honeywell developed the technology with Intel and three prominent third-party logistics companies: DHL, Expeditors and Kuehne + Nagel. Martin Kolbe, chief information officer at Kuehne + Nagel International AG, said: “We chose Honeywell and Intel to partner in the development of Connected Freight because of their expertise and competence in this kind of technology.” “We have used our competence as a global provider of logistics services and our expertise in supply chain management in order to co-develop this new technology,” he said. “We understand and anticipate the need for real-time data to inform customer actions during transportation very well. Armed with the Connected Freight solution, we can offer a variety of new services tailored to our customers’ specific needs. There are ongoing trials of the technology with one of our customers in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry, which is of strategic importance for us,” he concluded. In addition to Connected Freight, Honeywell unveiled a range of connected solutions for truck drivers, delivery workers and field technicians to improve productivity and ensure compliance with regulations, it stated. – TradeArabia News Service Tags: | freight | Solution | Honeywell | information | More Industry, Logistics & Shipping Stories Bahri hosts crew conference in Manila DMCA shares experience with Ajman tourism team Topaz revenue down 25pc in Q1 Top experts attend Siemens Digitalization Roadshow Agility reaches conditional settlement in US case Ras Al Khaimah unveils new International Corporate Centre Global renewables workforce to hit 24m by 2030 BP completes drilling of 50th well at Khazzan project Iran, European firms sign $3.3bn petrochem plant deal 15 startups take part in ‘Investor Day’ Women achievers honoured at Dubai event Oman Air vows to back SMEs Honeywell introduces new cloud-enabled BMS Oman Shipping sets up new chartering service DigiRobotics inks $26m Saudi deal at Gisec SR Technics named ‘Independent MRO of the Year’ Mapei unveils top product lines at Dubai expo Top experts to attend Dubai knowledge summit Kotkamills introduces Aegle Zero Hormann introduces high-speed door for food sector Emirates SkyCargo helps export of perishables from Vietnam Navistar Defense tactical vehicles contract from Iraq Omani firms to set up $31m abalone farming projects Saudi joint venture signs deals for 1,000 buses Ford names Jim Hackett as new president and CEO DMCC chief holds trade talks in Perth Alba wins corporate governance award Dafza holds India forum; eyes investments Grid inter-connectivity to net $33bn savings for GCC New hub to drive SME, start-up growth in Saudi Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

The new Surface Pro brings up to 13.5 hours of battery life and is more than 2.5 times faster than Surface Pro 3, and provides versatility and mobility in a lighter, more refined design.  Surface Pro is not only a powerhouse laptop, but also a mobile creative studio with a vibrant 12.3” PixelSense™ touch display that supports the new Surface Pen,2 the fastest pen ever, and Surface Dial2 both on- and off-screen. Twice as accurate as the previous version and enhanced by our PixelSense Accelerator custom silicon, the new Surface Pen and new Surface Pro together set the industry standard for faster, more fluid writing and drawing, and now Surface Pen supports tilt3 for more natural shading. Inking in applications across Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 365,2 including the new Microsoft Whiteboard app, will unlock ways for people to use digital ink to be more creative, collaborative and productive. “With Surface Pro we created a new category and challenged the status quo of the laptop,” said Panos Panay, corporate vice president, Microsoft Devices. “With every release since we have continued to push boundaries — redefining the ultimate laptop with Surface Book and making the classic laptop feel fresh again with Surface Laptop. With the introduction of the new Surface Pro we are once again advancing the category by delivering the versatility of a powerhouse laptop and a mobile creative studio in one thin, lightweight device.” The most versatile laptop The new Surface Pro has been redesigned from the inside out to give people more performance and 50 percent more battery life than the Surface Pro 4. Everything has been streamlined and refined — from softer, rounded edges to cameras built to fade into the bezel. At just 8.5mm thin and starting at 1.69 pounds4 the new Surface Pro is lighter than the bag it will be carried in, and packs the power of a 7th generation Intel® Core™ processor into a new fanless,5 whisper-quiet design. The new Surface Pro Signature Type Cover delivers a high-quality scissor mechanism and 1.3 mm of key travel for faster and more accurate typing. A full-size glass trackpad with five-finger multi-touch capabilities allows for ultimate precision, and the entire keyboard is wrapped in soft yet durable Alcantara® material, creating a comfortable palm rest and beautiful aesthetic. The new Surface Pro will also be available with LTE Advanced later this year to provide even greater mobility to let people work, collaborate and create from anywhere. A mobile creative studio The Surface Pro takes the immersive experience of creating on Surface Studio and brings it to life in a highly portable form factor. With a new hinge that adjusts to 165 degrees, people can now put Surface Pro into Studio Mode, creating the optimal position to write or sketch. The high-resolution 12.3” PixelSense™ Display is engineered to work with the new Surface Pen, the fastest digital pen ever, to deliver an amazing inking experience. When used with the new Surface Pro, the new Surface Pen is twice as responsive as the previous version with 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity for increased accuracy and responsiveness. New tilt functionality detects the angle of the Surface Pen to enable more natural shading. The Surface Dial also works on-screen with the new Surface Pro, unlocking a set of unique experiences pioneered by Surface Studio. Placing Dial on the screen brings up app-specific digital tools, allowing people to quickly access shortcuts and move seamlessly through their workflow. Starting at $799 USD, the new Surface Pro allows people to customize their experiences with an array of colorful options for the new Surface Pro Signature Type Cover, the new Surface Pen and the Microsoft Surface Arc Mouse.2 Each comes in rich tone-on-tone colors to match your personal style: Platinum, Burgundy and Cobalt Blue.  The new Surface Pro will launch on June 15, 2017, in 25 markets including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Preorder for the new Surface Pro and Surface Pro Signature Type Cover begins later today in select markets at Microsoft Store, microsoft.com, BestBuy.com and JD.com where available. The new Surface Pen will be available in the coming weeks. Microsoft Store is also offering custom device fittings to help people find the Surface that’s right for them. Knowledgeable associates are committed to helping people match their needs to the right Surface, then set it up and assist with customization, including the applications people use every day like Office.2 Inking comes to life in Microsoft Office 365 and the new Microsoft Whiteboard With the new Surface Pro and Surface Pen, digital inking comes to life for artists and inspires creativity worldwide. But people use pens not just to sketch or paint, but also to be productive — write and share comments in documents, notes in notebooks, and sketches on whiteboards. We are making the creative power of the new Surface Pen available in the world’s most powerful productivity suite: Microsoft Office. New inking features in Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint include a customizable gallery of your favorite pens, pencils and highlighters that roam with you as a personalized setting across Office apps and devices, along with support for tilt and shading with the new Surface Pen. These capabilities will begin to release to Office 365 subscribers in June, including the more than 100 million monthly active commercial users and 26 million consumer subscribers. Additional inking experiences will continue to roll out in the future, including the new Microsoft Whiteboard app, which offers a limitless canvas for creativity and collaboration with simultaneous inking between multiple people across the world. With Microsoft Whiteboard, people will be able to collaborate on ideas and projects across an expanded set of ink-enabled Windows 10 devices later this year, with exclusive capabilities for Office 365 subscribers. Surface Studio comes to new markets Surface Studio, first introduced in October 2016, is a new class of device built to transform from a workstation into a powerful digital canvas, unlocking a more natural and immersive way to create on the thinnest LCD monitor ever built.6 Surface Studio will launch in Austria, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Surface Studio will be available for preorder starting today at microsoft.com and select third-party retailers, and will begin shipping in these markets on June 15, 2017.

Confirmed in a tweet Russian Army’s scout class would be represented by members of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death. The Women’s Battalion was initially formed as a propaganda initiative to raise morale. They were commanded by Maria Leontievna Bochkareva and fought most prominently during the Kerensky Offensive, Russia’s final offensive campaign of the Great War. The first footage of the expansion will be shown at EA Play on June 10th, and it will be available on PS4, Xbox One and PC upon release.     In a tweet yesterday, the official Battlefield Twitter account confirmed that the Russian Army’s scout class would be represented by members of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death. The Women’s Battalion was initially formed as a propaganda initiative to raise morale. They were commanded by Maria Leontievna Bochkareva and fought most prominently during the Kerensky Offensive, Russia’s final offensive campaign of the Great War. With an estimated 6,000 Russian women combatants in World War One, their addition to the multiplayer campaign makes sense in spite of commenters who object to their historical immersion being broken. “[You’re] kidding me,” one Twitter poster said. Having never read a history book, they added: “Barely any women fought.” Adding women soldiers fits with Battlefield 1’s tone, which included a single player campaign featuring African American soldiers from the Harlem Hellfighters infantry regiment, a woman Bedouin protagonist, and soldiers from various fronts across the world. The first DLC, The Shall Not Pass, added the French Army. EA promised to share more detail about the expansion at the upcoming EA Play event, running from June 10-12 in Hollywood. I’ll be attendance at this event and will tell just how awesome it feels to storm the trenches as a tough gal then. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

Sadly this has nothing to do with history, its all SJW crap, they just try to find reasons to "inject" a bit of "progressiveness" into anything. vase Maha Guru Posts: 1619 Joined: 2015-03-20 #5435268 Posted on: 05/24/2017 12:55 PM Quote: Originally Posted by RavenMaster That's WWII mate this game is WWI.

I was just making a point that it isn't a far fetched thing to have female soldiers in a World War oriented game. Apart from the fact that it's totally legit in general, also specifically in WWI there were female battalions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s-Battalion Quote: Originally Posted by cryohellinc Yes the same way it makes sense that Germany has 1 black soldier in their roster.

The weaponry is progressive as well and consists of a lot of experimental or "fun" guns. Still they put it in. Because it makes the game more fun and less dull. I can't even imagine the idiocy to complain about implementing female soldiers. This is like reverse-SJW ... seriously... bitching around about a complete NON-issue that in the best case just makes a game more interesting and adds more visual nuances.

Adding a Gauss Gun wouldn't really impact it's realism. 2.

At a Microsoft event in Shanghai on Tuesday, the all-new Surface Pro 4 was unveiled. By: FE Online | Published: May 24, 2017 11:36 AM The new Microsoft Surface Pro will be made will be available in 25 countries. The pre-ordered devices will start shipping from June 15. The next generation of Microsoft Surface Pro has finally arrived. At a Microsoft event in Shanghai on Tuesday, the all-new Surface Pro 4 was unveiled. Meanwhile, Apple might expectedly update its MacBook lineup at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, and it may also include the long-neglected MacBook Air. The new Surface Pro is a 2-in-1 tablet-cum-laptop device and the pricing begins from $799 and is up for pre-orders too. The company will be offering a special price of $719.10, but that will be available only for students, teachers or staff at colleges and universities. From the looks of it, the new Surface Pro is a beautiful device, as its design features clean lines and curved edges. While the Surface Pro has continued with the basic iconic look of the popular Surface Pro device, Microsoft has redesigned it from inside out. The company has said that the new Surface Pro will be made will be available in 25 countries. The pre-ordered devices will start shipping from June 15. Along with the device, customers can also buy a new Surface Pro Type cover separately, whose pricing starts at $129 and the new Surface Pen at $99. Here is a list of features and what’s new in the device: 1. Battery: It is the highlight of the new Microsoft device. The Surface Pro packs up to 13.5 hours of battery life. According to Microsoft, it is 50 percent more than Surface Pro 4 and 35 percent more battery life than an iPad Pro. You may also like to watch: 2. Performance: Microsoft says that the Surface Pro can produce upto 2.5 times more computing performance than the Surface Pro 3 and 1.7 times than that of iPad Pro. In 2016, the Surface Pro 4 came with the Intel 6th-generation Core processors – Intel Core M3, Intel Core i5 and Core i7. However, Microsoft will go with the 7th generation Intel Core processors configuration going from Core M3 to Core i7. Also, it will be a very ‘quiet’ device, as the processors will contain no fans. 3. Display: The Surface Pro has a high-resolution (2736 x 1824 pixels) 12.3-inch PixelSense display screen. The device features an impressive resolution of 267ppi and 3:2 aspect ratio, and according to Microsoft, the Surface Pro’s PixelSense screen has 50 percent more pixels than a 12 inch MacBook. The company had developed custom silicon, the PixelSense Accelerator, to enhance colours in the display. Interestingly, the laptop can additionally support up to two 4K monitors via Surface Dock. You may also like to watch: 4. Pen: The is the most interesting innovation that Microsoft has introduced this time. The Surface Pro works well with an on-screen Surface Dial, but this time the company has also come up with a new Surface Pen. It will be a very responsive pen, as it contains more than 4096 pressure points, only 21 milliseconds of latency and new tilt functionality. More than two times more accurate, with four times more pressure sensitivity than the original Surface Pen, Microsoft claims to have engineered Surface Pen to be the fastest pen ever. 5. Price: The Microsoft Surface Pro with Intel Core M3, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB SSD comes at $799. The variant with Intel Core i5, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB SSD model is priced at $999. The variant with Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM & 256GB SSD is available at $1299. The Pro model with Intel Core i7, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB SSD comes at $1599. There are two 16GB RAM variants with 512GB SSD and 1TB SSD, are also up for grabs at $2199 and $2699 respectively. Microsoft Surface Pro runs on Windows 10 Pro, and buyers are offered a free 30-day Microsoft Office trial with the purchase. G Geoff May 24, 2017 at 4:42 pm The surface pro 4 has been out for a year, the Surface Laptop is the new product. Surface pro 4 - can be just a tablet, have a keyboard attached, 6th generation chipset. Surface book - all metal finish connected keyboard can hinge out of the way to be a tablet. Surface laptop this is the new device with 7th generation chipset, multi color connected keyboard and touch screen. The article is misleading and confused.

Supplier Metabox www.metabox.com.au Price $2166 AUD > Pricing info Specs 15.6-inch FHD 1920 x 1080 WVA Matte 120Hz LED with G-Sync • NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB • Intel Core i7-7700HQ Processor (quad-core, HyperThreaded, Turbo 3.80 GHz) • 16GB DDR4 2400MHZ Memory • Intel 540S 240GB SATA 3 M.2 SSD Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Well made and powerful Aussie beast While the other laptops this issue focus on portability, battery life, sexiness and convertibility, the Metabox Prime P650HP-G is an entirely different creature. This chunky hunk of plastic forgoes artisan-crafted aluminium shells, or a chassis so thin that it can barely be seen side on. No, this laptop focuses on cramming in as much performance into a relatively simple chassis for a competitive price, delivering a gaming machine that won’t blow the bank yet is also just portable enough to be able to take on the road on a regular basis.  Ok, when we say portable, we may be stretching things a little bit. At 2.6kg it’s a long shot from the 1.2kg we’re used to with the other laptops we tested this month, but that’s to be expected when you’re packing real firepower into a gaming machine. It’s also considerably larger thanks to the 15.6-inch screen. The entire chassis is made of plastic to help keep the costs and weight down, but feels rugged enough to handle a rough night out at a long LAN. It’s also rather large, measuring 38.5 cm (w) x 27.1 cm (d) x 2.5cm (h); again though, for a gaming machine this isn’t exorbitant.  Unfortunately we had some confusion with the G-sync support of this machine. While the specs claim it has a 120Hz 1080p G-Synch enabled monitor, we could find no mention of G-sync in the Nvidia control panel. It was only after doing a bit of Internet investigating that we discovered that MSHybrid (another name for Nvidia’s Optimus technology) had to be disabled via the BIOS to allow G-Sync to work. Users simply shouldn’t have to deal with this kind of issue. We also had severe performance issues before running the Windows update – it would take around ten seconds to simply open a program such as 3DMark. Yet given the Intel 540S 240GB SATA 3 M.2 SSD and Intel Core i7 7700HQ Processor, these results simply shouldn’t happen – we implore suppliers of hardware to ensure their machines are up to date when they send them out.  Speaking of the CPU, it’ll cut the mustard for any of today’s games, with its four HyperThreaded cores peaking out at 3.8GHz under load. To our delight, the Prime was barely audible under load, even during the most demanding tests, so we couldn’t use our sound meter as it was below the ambient noise level. On the GPU side, we have Nvidia’s capable, albeit entry-level, GTX 1060. This is a fine, affordable part if you’re playing relatively basic games or high-end games on low-to-medium level; just don’t expect to laud it through Ghost Recon: Wildlands on the highest detail settings. As our benchmarks show though, it’ll give most modern games a good run for their money, though we do feel the 120Hz display will probably be a waste for most, as they’ll never come close to these framerates. Said display is surprisingly an IPS panel, and it delivers a very wide viewing angle as well as solid contrast and colour performance. It’s not in the same league as some of the other displays in this issue, but at this price it does well enough.  Given the added padding of this machine, it’s no surprise to see a veritable smorgasbord of I/O options. On the right-hand side we have three 3.5 mm stereo minijacks – one for headphones, one for S/PDIF and one for a microphone. There’s a total of five USB ports on both sides, with twin USB 3.1 Gen 2 port (Type-C), as well as 3 USB 3.0 ports (USB3.1 Gen1, 1 x powered USB port, AC/DC). Nvidia’s GTX 1060 also delivers excellent video output capabilities, in the form of one HDMI output port (with HDCP) and two Mini DisplayPort 1.3 output Ports, though we’re not sure which are powered by the CPU’s integrated GPU, and which are powered by the Nvidia discrete GPU. Networking is supplied via Intel 8265 AC Dual Band WIFI/BT chipset, along with a single Gigabit Ethernet port.  If there was one issue we had with this machine it’s the number of applications set to automatically start when this machine boots up. Despite this, it’s still great value for the performance, but needs a little tinkering to get the most out of it.  Related Reviews Review: MSI GT83VR 7RF Titan SLI gaming laptop Review: Asus GL502VS with GeForce GTX 1070 Review: Asus ROG Strix GL502 Gaming Laptop Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority.

The company has announced two new laptops, the Matebook X and Matebook D, as well as a refresh to last year's Windows 10 tablet, the Matebook E. The MateBook X is a 13-inch ultraportable clamshell device made of a "microencapsulated phase change material" that looks and feels like metal. It also looks quite a lot like Apple’s MacBook Air but has better specs overall — that includes a Core i5-7200U or i7-7500U processor with Intel HD Graphics 620, 4GB or 8GB of RAM, 256GB or 512GB of solid-state storage, and a 2160 x 1440 IPS display with a 4.4mm bezel, wide viewing angles, 100% sRGB color coverage, and 350 nits, 1000:1 contrast. In terms of ports and connectivity Huawei included only two USB 3.0 Type-C ports — one for charging, and one for data transfer — and a 3.5mm headphone jack. There are no USB Type-A ports or any other kind of ports, however the company includes MateDock 2.0 with the laptop, which offers one USB Type-A, DVI, and HDMI each as well as a second USB-C port for pass-through charging. Other features of this stylish, 12.5mm thick laptop include a power button that doubles as a Windows Hello-compatible fingerprint reader, a Dolby Atmos-enhanced surround sound system, and battery life good for up to 10 hours while watching 1080p video on a single charge at 50% screen brightness. Pricing for the MateBook X starts at at €1,399 (about $1,569) and it will come to the US in two colors: space gray and a warm, bronze-like gold called "prestige gold." The MateBook D is a 15-inch laptop targeted at a wider audience with prices starting at €799. It features an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, 4GB to 16GB of RAM, storage option from a single 500GB HDD to a combined 1TB hard drive and 128GB SSD, and optional GeForce 940MX discreet graphics. Its 15.6-inch display offers a Full HD 1920x1080 resolution and uses an IPS panel with wide viewing angles and 800:1 contrast. Like the MateBook X, the MateBook D also offers a narrow bezel design. Ports include USB 3.0 Type-A, one USB 2.0 Type-A for some reason, full-size HDMI and 3.5mm audio jack. Its bulkier than the X but not terribly so at 16.9mm thick and but only appears to include a 43.3 Wh battery which is on the low side for laptops of this size. It’ll come in Space Gray, Champagne Gold and Aurora Blue. Lastly, the MateBook E is the company’s second generation 2-in-1, featuring an upgraded display (2K instead of 1080p) as well as a much improved battery that reportedly holds up for up to 9 hours. The 10-inch Windows 10 tablet now comes with the leather keyboard accessory included instead of it being a separate accessory, and there’s an optional upgrade to an Intel i5 processor up from an Intel M3. The tablet starts at €999 and has either 4GB or 8GB of RAM, 128GB to 512GB internal storage options, one USB Type-C port and will be available in gray or gold colors.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Senate issues two more subpoenas for Michael Flynn’s documents posted at 7:21 pm on May 23, 2017 by John Sexton Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES As Ed noted yesterday, Gen. Michael Flynn said he would plead the 5th Amendment rather than testify or deliver documents to the Senate Intelligence Committee. But the Intel Committee isn’t taking no for an answer and today it issued two more subpoenas to Flynn’s businesses. Politico reports: President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser has invoked his Fifth Amendment rights in response to the committee’s previous subpoena attempt. Committee leaders are directing the new subpoenas at his businesses, believing they can’t plead the Fifth. “While we disagree with Gen. Flynn’s lawyer’s interpretation of taking the Fifth, it is even more clear that a business does not have a right to take the Fifth if it’s a corporation,” said top committee Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia. Before becoming Trump’s national security adviser, Flynn ran a consulting firm called the Flynn Intel Group. Sen. Chuck Schumer is pushing to force Flynn to appear before congress and plead the 5th Amendment, at which point he could be held in contempt. “He should comply and there will be consequences if he doesn’t,” Schumer said Tuesday. It’s fair to assume Schumer is primarily interested in creating a TV spectacle which might benefit Democrats in 2018, but it sounds as if Republican Chairman Richard Burr isn’t ruling out the possibility of holding Flynn in contempt if he doesn’t respond to the latest subpoenas. “At the end of that option is a contempt charge, and I’ve said that everything is on the table,” Burr said during a press briefing today. But Burr made clear he wasn’t there yet. “We would like to hear from General Flynn. We’d like to see his documents. We’d like him to tell his story because he publicly said ‘I’ve got a story to tell.’ We’re allowing him that opportunity to do it,” Burr said. Here’s the full statement to the press by Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Warner: Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES Tags: House Intelligence Committee, Michael Flynn, subpoenas Related Posts: NY Times: Russian officials discussed how to influence Trump Paul Ryan: ‘I like Jim Comey’ Rep.

However, this time the company is insisting that the Pro is no longer a tablet that can act as a laptop, but is instead "the most versatile laptop we've ever built". Announced at an event in Shanghai, the device has been overhauled to feature a 13.5-hour battery life, 7th generation Intel processors and a whole host of behind-the-scenes improvements. It's been almost two years since the last iteration of the Surface Pro was made available, and in the meantime Microsoft's expanded its devices line to include the more powerful Surface Book hybrid, the Surface Studio desktop machine and the recently announced Surface Laptop. Microsoft says it's brought all its experience making these devices to bear on the new Surface Pro, and after a quick look at the machine in action it's an easy claim to believe. The Pro's hinge can now prop the device up as normal or open to 165 degrees to lay it down in a slanted "studio mode", making for a miniature version of the Surface Studio's drafting table shape for writing or drawing. Microsoft says in this mode the device is stable enough to lean on. The Type Cover that transforms the Surface Pro into something resembling a traditional laptop has also seen an upgrade, although disappointingly it is still a sold-separately accessory. The cover packs LED-backlit scissor mechanism keys and a full-sized glass trackpad for multi-touch gestures, and it's covered in the same warm-looking suede-like Alcantara fabric seen on the Surface Laptop. Also compatible with the redesigned Surface Pen — which Microsoft says is twice as fast as the Apple Pencil with only 21ms of latency — and the design-focused Surface Dial, the new Pro might be incredibly light (at less than 800 grams) but could be a hefty investment if you need all the various bits and pieces. Launching in Australia in June, the Surface Pro will be available at a number of different price-points depending on the amount of grunt you'd like the laptop to have. $1199 will get you a model with one of Intel's mobility-focused m3 chipsets, a 128GB drive and a meagre 4GB of RAM, while the models with the more powerful i5 processors will start at $1499. Power users that want one of the i7-powered beasts with Iris Plus graphics and 16GB RAM will need to part with at least $3299. Microsoft says it plans to release additional models that include 4G LTE functionality later in the year. Speaking to Fairfax Media ahead of the Shanghai event, Microsoft's GM for commercial devices Ryan Gavin said the device is a new start for the two-in-one form factor the company helped pioneer. "It will feel very familiar … but in fact it's a complete redesign. We have, inside and out, over 800 custom new parts that we've built for the Surface Pro", Gavin said. "This is not your father's Surface Pro 4. This is a new Surface Pro, dramatically improved". Many of those new parts offer improvements on existing functionality. For example there's still the biometric Windows Hello camera to log you in to the machine by scanning your face, but it's now fast enough to do it "within half a beat". The design of the machine is also now heat efficient enough that the m3 and i5 models are completely fan-free and silent, while the i7 models will only have their fans kick in when they're really working hard. While the chassis has undergone some subtle softening and slight tweaks, many aspects of the exterior machine, including the 2736x1824 display, the cameras and the array of ports — USB 3.0, Mini DisplayPort, MicroSD — appear identical to 2015's Pro 4. For better or worse, this stands in contrast to many competitor devices which have made the switch, at least partially, to the new USB-C standard. Upgraded, versatile, and exceptionally powerful, with iconic Surface design. Meet the new Microsoft #SurfacePro. #MicrosoftEvent pic.twitter.com/o1RQjzlySE — Microsoft Surface (@surface) May 23, 2017 The return of the Pro and its reclassification as a laptop means Microsoft's portable lineup now consists of three similar Surface machines, but Gavin says each offers a distinct experience. "This isn't about one replacing the other, this is about having a full range of laptops now from Surface that will match where our customers are", he said. The beefy Surface Book "is the ultimate performance machine. When you want to be powering multiple monitors, to be putting it through the ultimate paces, that's our Book experience. Then we've got Surface Laptop with Windows S, which really is our take on the traditional laptop experience but we've streamlined it for performance and security". The new Pro, then, is designed to be a mobile creative studio that packs in as much power and functionality possible, while still lasting all day and being "lighter than the bag that you're putting it in".

First from the new Acer Nitro family, the Nitro 5 series provides a good balance of powerful features with a sharp and stylish design. Acer is offering a variety of configurations that feature popular graphics and processors, providing consumers with a wide selection to meet different budgets and needs. Gamers can choose from configurations[1] featuring up to NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1050 Ti graphics paired with 7th Generation Intel® Core™ i7 or i5 processors, or models with AMD Radeon™ RX550 graphics with 7th Generation AMD A-Series FX, A12 or A10 APUs. These models all feature Windows 10, and support up to 32GB of DDR4 2400 MHz memory.  Ideal for accelerating boot-up time and shortening in-game loading times, select models[1] come equipped with super-fast PCIe SSDs (up to 512GB) paired with an optional HDD for storage (up to 2TB).  A Gigabit Ethernet port delivers fast and reliable wired connections, while the 802.11ac 2x2 MIMO wireless technology provides blazing-fast wireless connectivity. A comprehensive selection of ports includes one USB 3.1 Type-C (Gen 1) port, one USB 3.0 port with power-off charging, two USB 2.0 ports, and an HDMI 2.0 port[1], which can support up to 90 Hz refresh rates. Of course, no gaming system is complete without a thermal solution to manage heat and keep the system running optimally. The Nitro 5 features dual fans with Acer Coolboost™ technology, which delivers heightened fan speeds and cooling ability, and allows users to manually control the cooling process when heavy use requires an added boost. All models offer a vibrant 15.6-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS[2] display, while Dolby Audio™ Premium and Acer TrueHarmony™ technology provides incredible sound depth. These work in tandem to provide immersive experiences for gaming or watching movies.  The Nitro 5's sophisticated design includes a matte black chassis with a hairline finish. A smooth sleek red hinge runs along the back of the notebook, above a bold black grill vent. The keyboard features red backlighting, and the WASD keys and touchpad are also outlined in red for ease-of-use.

The new Acer Spin 1 features a metal chassis, a 1920 x 1080 pixel IPS touchscreen display with support for an optional Acer Active Stylus. So you might think this is a premium machine. But it also has some of the hallmarks of an entry-level device including an Intel Apollo Lake processor and eMMC storage. Acer hasn’t announced the US price or release date for the Spin 1 yet, but the company is unveiling the convertible ahead of next week’s Computex computer show in Taiwan. Acer introduced the Spin line of compact convertible notebooks last summer, and you can currently pick up a first-gen Spin 1 for as little as $250, but the new model has a slimmer, lighter, and sturdier design thanks to its all-metal construction. The notebook will be available with Intel Celeron or Pentium processor options and 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB storage configurations. Each model has 4GB of RAM. Other features include 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, a USB 3.1 port, a USB 20 port, and a microSDXC card slot. Acer says the laptop should get up to 8 hours of battery life. The optional active stylus is sold separately.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

News & Analysis Big Data Reshapes Silicon The view of Compute 2.0 from Bristol Rick Merritt 5/25/2017 00:01 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — The huge data sets collected by web giants such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook are fueling a renaissance of new chips to process them. Two of the latest efforts will be described at an annual conference on computer architecture in late June. Stanford researchers described Plasticine, a reconfigurable processor that sports nearly 100x better performance/watt than an FPGA while being easier to program. Separately, two veteran designers at Nvidia were part of a team that defined an inference processor that delivers more than twice the performance and energy efficiency of exiting devices. The chips represent tips of an iceberg of work. Intel acquired three machine-learning startups in the past year. Rival Samsung, along with Dell EMC, invested in Graphcore (Bristol, U.K.), one of a half-dozen independent startups in the area. Meanwhile, Nvidia is racking up rising sales for its GPUs as neural network training engines. Simultaneously, it is morphing its architecture to better handle such jobs. Google claims that neither its massive clusters of x86 CPUs nor Nvidia’s GPUs are adequate. So it has rolled out two versions of its own accelerator, the TPU. “This is Compute 2.0; it is absolutely a new world of computing,” said Nigel Toon, chief executive of Graphcore. “Google eventually will use racks and racks of TPUs and almost no CPUs because 98 percent of its revenues come from search,” a good application for machine learning. Eventually, machine-learning chips will appear in a broad range of embedded systems. With 18 million cars sold a year compared to 10 million servers, “self-driving cars could be a bigger market than the cloud for this technology, and it’s a market that never existed before,” said Toon. The shared vision is an AI processor that can handle both training and inference for today’s rainbow of neural networks — and maybe even some emerging self-learning techniques. They need to deliver performance through massive parallelism, yet be power-efficient and easy to program. Even the basic math for the job is a subject of lively debate. Toon believes that a mix of 16-bit floating-point multiplication with 32-bit accumulates delivers optimal precision with minimal errors. That’s the approach that the new tensor cores in Nvidia’s Volta use, as well as the competing high-end chip that Graphcore will sample to early partners in October. The startup is focused on one big chip using novel memories and interconnects in and out of the chip to link cells and clusters.

News & Analysis Intel Inside DJI Mini-Drone Computer vision & image processing in one unit Junko Yoshida 5/25/2017 00:01 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet MADISON, Wis. –DJI, the Shenzhen-based world leader in drones and aerial cameras, rolled out Wednesday (May 24) its first mini-drone — called Spark.  DJI was apparently unfazed by a controversial ruling by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) last week that requires all civil-use drones heavier than 250g to be registered online starting June 1. Packed inside Spark’s compact body — measuring 143×143×55 mm and weighing 300g — is a vision processing unit, dubbed Myriad 2, designed by Movidius, now an Intel company. DJI claimed that Spark is “the first drone that users can control by hand gestures alone.” Movidius’ Myriad 2 enables the new drone to recognize a user’s face and understand his or her signals. Face recognition allows Spark to adjust its flight according to the user’s preference. Once Sparks takes off from the user’s hand, “it automatically enters Gesture Mode,” according to DJI.  DJI's Spark taking off from a user's hand (Image: DJI) Why hand signals? A user — in the midst of climbing a steep mountain, for example — can simply signal the shape of a photo-frame and Spark will snap a picture of that moment. The user can call back the drone simply by waving hands. “Even if you’ve never flown a drone before, flying Spark is easy because the only remote control you’ll need is your hand,” DJI explained.  “This is the ultimate portable drone with a lot of advanced features. DJI has really upped the ante” in a fierce race shaping up among consumer drones, observed Remi El-Ouazzane, formerly Movidus CEO, now vice president and general manager within the New Technologies Group of Intel. DJI’s engineering team tried to pack so many advanced features in such a small body of the drone while facing the need to optimize its bill of materials. El-Ouazzane believes Myriad 2 VPU played a crucial role in making that happen.  Myriad 2 for ‘double duty’  This is the first time DJI has used Movidius’ Myriad 2 vision processing unit to drive “both computer vision/deep learning and image signal processing,” El-Ouazzane told EE Times. Until now, DJI has deployed other vendors’ image signal processors for its imaging pipeline, while putting Myriad 2 VPU to use for adding “autonomy” to drones.

CNET First Look Huawei's new laptop looks like a MacBook Pro The Matebook X is a sleek 13-inch fanless debut from Huawei. 1:35 / May 23, 2017 Transcript [MUSIC] Huawei is dipping its toes into the laptop pool. The company unveiled its first laptop ever, the MateBook X. Running Windows 10, it's the first 13" fanless laptop with with in Intel u series processor. The Wallway Makebook X looks very similar to the 12 inch Macbook Pro, but with the Wallway logo on its cover. It has a sleek aluminum chasee that will be available in gold, gray, and pink. It's 12.5 milimeters thick and weights a little over two pounds. It's 2k resolution screen is beautifully sharp and vibrant with super narrow 4.4 milimeter bezels that maximize screen space. It also has a three by two screen ration that's more conducive for office work. The laptop is first to feature Dolby's Atomos sound system. Which features integrated software and hardware solutions for superior sound quality.

The prosecution takes aim at the political intelligence industry in Washington, in which consultants -- often former government employees themselves -- nurture ex-colleagues for information about potentially market-moving decisions, and relay that to hedge fund traders and others in exchange for lucrative consulting fees. That’s what prosecutors in Manhattan accused three partners at Deerfield Management, a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services employee and David Blaszczak, a former CMS worker with his own D.C. consulting firm, of doing. They were all charged with fraud Wednesday, accused of profiting on trades with the help of advance knowledge about pending decisions by CMS to cut coverage for a certain kind of cancer treatment and to increase payments for kidney dialysis. Deerfield, a $7 billion investment advisory firm focused exclusively on the health-care industry, is one of hundreds of hedge funds that have hired D.C. consultants who have an inside track on CMS reimbursement decisions. Those can mean millions of dollars in gained or lost revenue for companies that make medical devices or provide health-care services. SEC Readies Inside-Trading Claims Against Political-Intel Firm Deerfield is the second hedge fund with ties to Blaszczak to find itself in the crosshairs of federal prosecutors. Earlier this year, in the trial of a former credit portfolio manager at Visium Asset Management, Blaszczak’s name surfaced in trial testimony as the source of insider information that was used by the firm to shape trading strategy. According to an indictment handed down Wednesday, from 2012 to 2014 Blaszczak used his close personal relationships with former colleagues at CMS to get advance knowledge of pending decisions and passed them on to his clients at Deerfield. One of those contacts was Christopher Worrall, according to the U.S., whom Blaszczak allegedly invited to join his firm in 2014, promising they’d probably make $2 million in revenue by the end of the year. “You’re like a drunk whore to me,” Worrall responded, according to the indictment. “Hard to resist. Lol. Let’s talk.” Also charged in the case are: Jordan Fogel, 33, Theodore Huber, 55, and Robert Olan, who were listed as principals in Deerfield. “Ted Huber did absolutely nothing wrong,” his attorney Barry Berke said in a statement. “This prosecution is an ill-advised attempt to transform entirely innocent research and trading into a crime.” Fogel’s lawyer, Marc Mukasey, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did Frank Razzano, a lawyer for Blaszczak. Dentons, a law firm representing Worrall, declined to comment. Huber and Olan are now on leave from the firm, according to a person familiar with the matter. Fogel left last year. Deerfield is cooperating with the government’s investigation, a spokesman said in an emailed statement. Visium’s Valvani Charged Over Drug Tips From Inside FDA One of the CMS decisions involved a July 2012 move to reduce reimbursable treatment times for a kind of cancer therapy. Two months before the change was announced, Blaszczak allegedly learned about it from a CMS insider, and tipped off Huber and Olan. The firm then sold short millions of shares in three companies and made more than $1.8 million after the stocks fell on the policy announcement. In exchange for the information, Blaszczak’s firms received payments from the hedge fund, including $47,500 in the aftermath of the oncology decision -- which included a $29,000 "discretionary bonus," according to the indictment.

Sign Up After working at CMS until 2005, Blaszczak’s bounced around multiple consulting firms before co-founding Precipio Health Strategies in September 2014. He transferred his business with Deerfield, which he considered to be his most important client, to his new firm. The relationship was mutual. Fogel told his colleagues that Blaszczak was “an outlier on the street” saying his information was “way more valuable than the other dc clowns put together.”  Blaszczak boasted about the quality of his information, telling Fogel in an email that his predictions differed from those of a competitor, who “doesn’t know anyone at CMS. His guesses are just wild random guesses.” He allegedly gleaned that information from his friend, Worrall. The two worked together at CMS and frequently met for lunch, golf, and baseball games.

The former national security adviser will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination on Monday as he notifies the Senate Intelligence committee that he will not comply with a subpoena seeking documents. Evan Vucci — The Associated Press file By Deb Riechmann and Chad Day, The Associated Press Posted: 05/24/17, 7:03 PM PDT | Updated: 2 hrs ago # Comments WASHINGTON >> Subpoenas for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn piled up Wednesday as the House intelligence committee pressured Flynn to cooperate with its investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The prospect of new congressional subpoenas came one day after the committee’s Senate counterpart served its own subpoenas to Flynn’s businesses. The FBI also informed a House committee that it would not be complying with a Wednesday deadline to turn over memos written by former FBI Director James Comey detailing his discussions with President Donald Trump. One memo reportedly shows Trump pressuring Comey to shut down the bureau’s investigation into Flynn’s Russia ties. Meanwhile, former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page told The Associated Press he will testify next month before the House intelligence committee. And The New York Times reported that U.S. intelligence services obtained information during the 2016 presidential election that showed senior Russian officials discussing how to influence Trump through his campaign advisers. Citing three current and former American officials, the Times said U.S. intelligence officials collected information last summer showing Russians zeroed in on Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, a former head of U.S. military intelligence who was a key Trump campaign adviser. The Russian officials thought Manafort and Flynn could be used to influence Trump’s views on Russia. The Times said some of the officials bragged about ties to Flynn. Others thought they could use Manafort’s association with former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who led a pro-Russian political party, to their advantage, the Times reported. A day earlier, former CIA Director John Brennan told a House committee that he had seen intelligence that “revealed contacts and interactions” between Russian officials and Americans “involved” in the Trump campaign — a cause for concern in case the Russians could get the Americans to cooperate. During a breakfast Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the House intelligence committee’s top Democrat, told reporters that Flynn declined to turn over records to the committee, and he said it will be “following up with subpoenas.” Schiff said the subpoenas will likely go out this week. He did not elaborate on what materials the committee was seeking. The attempts to compel Flynn to produce documents were just another sign of the intense focus on Trump’s former national security adviser, who was fired in February after the White House said he misled administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his contacts with Russian officials. Advertisement In addition to the congressional scrutiny, Flynn is currently a target of an FBI counterintelligence investigation, a federal probe in Virginia and a Defense Department inspector general’s inquiry into the propriety of foreign payments he accepted. In a letter to the Senate committee on Monday, Flynn invoked his Fifth Amendment protection from self-incrimination in deflecting the panel’s subpoena for a wide array of documents and information related to his contacts with Russians. Flynn’s attorneys argued that the Senate’s request was too broad, and if Flynn were to comply, he could be confirming the existence of some documents and, in effect, providing testimony that could be used against him. They also said an “escalating public frenzy” against Flynn and the appointment of a special counsel had created a legally perilous environment for Flynn to provide the information. In response, the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday sent a letter narrowing its request for documents. It also issued subpoenas seeking documents from two of Flynn’s businesses— Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm owned by Flynn and his business partners, and Flynn Intel Group LLC, a company he used for other projects, such as his paid speeches. Flynn could choose to contest the congressional subpoenas seeking his business records, but legal experts said he would not prevail. Solomon L. Wisenberg, a Washington defense lawyer who worked as a prosecutor during the Starr investigation of President Bill Clinton, said both of Flynn’s corporate structures would likely have to turn over all business records sought by the committee. “The Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to business entities, period,” he said, adding that both Supreme Court and District of Columbia Circuit Court rulings would weigh on the committee’s side. While Flynn decides what, if anything, he’ll provide to Congress, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said the FBI will not be turning over memos and other materials that detail discussions between Comey and Trump. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said in an interview on CNN that the FBI sent his committee a two-sentence email saying that it would not be turning over the materials now that the Justice Department has appointed a special counsel. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who was appointed as special counsel, is overseeing an investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and whether there was any collusion with Trump associates. Chaffetz said he is considering issuing a subpoena for the documents, and he wants a better explanation from the FBI about why it’s not turning them over. “It isn’t going to be good enough to just offer two sentences and say: ‘Hey, there’s a special counsel. We’re not going to let Congress do its job,’” he said. Chaffetz said he also asked Comey this week about the memos, but Comey declined to say whether they were in his personal possession or still at the Justice Department. The FBI declined comment. Meanwhile, Page said Wednesday that details are still being worked out about his testimony before the House intelligence committee next month. Page said he expects to testify sometime during the week of June 6 and wants at least part of his testimony to be public. ABC News first reported Page’s planned testimony. Page is one of several people associated with Trump’s campaign who are under investigation over their ties to Russia. Page has denied any involvement in Russian attempts to influence the election.

Essel Group will own the remaining 20% stake in the company. ItzCash's managing director Naveen Surya said the investors received three to four times returns on their initial investments in the company , which was founded in 2006 and had raised about $51million so far. Nasdaq-listed Ebix is a global supplier of on-demand software and ecommerce services to the insurance, financial, egovernance and healthcare industries and operates in 40 countries, including India. Surya said the investment will allow the Indian company to cater to Ebix clients beyond India and open cross-selling opportunities to sell each other's complementary services to clients. “This partnership with Ebix will help us deepen our foray into all kinds of financial servi ces such as credit, insurance, healthcare and investments to accelerate our growth momentum, even outside India,“ Surya said. ItzCash said it turned profitable in 2016-17. While the company initially started with prepaid card and wallet products, it has since expanded into businesses such as remittances, financial services and corporate products. The company also has cloud-based solutions at about 75,000 stores across 3,000 cities and towns, where kirana stores also enable bill payments and money transfer. "In ItzCash, we found attributes that none of their peers had -market penetration across 3,000 cities, 75,000 plus bricks-and-mortar distribution outlets, CAGR of approximately 35%, and the only company which was profitable among all its peers. With one of India's most-prominent business houses, Essel Group, deciding to align their interests with Ebix, the decision to invest in ItzCash became easy for us," Ebix CEO Robin Raina said in a statement.

Samsung is elevating the foundry business to show its independence and guarantee its access to resources within the company. The South Korean company yesterday also promised customers that it will introduce new production techniques ahead of competitors and have a new plant up and running by the fourth quarter of this year. Creating a separate unit for the business may ease the concerns of some potential customers who compete with other parts of Samsung, said Kelvin Low, a senior director of foundry marketing. “As part of our commitment to play seriously in the foundry area we felt that it was best that we create an independent organization,” Low said. “That will result in less conflict of interest—although that’s not really an issue these days—it’s still a perception in some customers’ minds.” Samsung’s commitment underlines the importance of its chip unit and the growth in demand for outsourced production of chips. Fewer companies than before can afford to invest the billions of dollars it takes to build and equip plants and fund research into new manufacturing. TSMC, which dominates the market by producing components for companies such as Apple Inc, has posted double-digit percentage revenue gains for the last five years. In March, Intel Corp, which is the world’s largest maker of chips through its lead in the market for computer microprocessors, said it’s recommitting itself to building its own made-to-order chip business and claimed its manufacturing is still ahead of Samsung and TSMC. All three companies fight for orders from companies such as Qualcomm Inc and Apple, which design their own chips but don’t own any manufacturing. The electronics arm of South Korea’s largest business group doesn’t currently break out sales of its foundry unit. As the world’s biggest maker of memory chips, sales of those components make up most of the company’s total semiconductor revenue, contributing 12.12 trillion won (RM45.08 billion) of 15.66 trillion won in the first quarter. That indicates the other chips, including foundry produced and those made for its own internal consumption, had sales of 3.54 trillion won in the quarter, a gain of 10 per cent from a year earlier. That’s still less than half of the US$7.53 billion (RM7.53 billion) in revenue TSMC posted in the quarter. Samsung, whose chip unit provided two-thirds of companywide operating profit, is locked in a race with TSMC and Intel to improve factory output in increments the industry refers to as nanometers. Currently, the best is 10-nanometer production. Samsung said it was the first to mass produce at that node and TSMC said it’s now in full production of 10 nanometer with a rapid increase in output due in the second half of this year. Samsung yesterday said 8 nanometer is coming later this year and 7 will follow in 2018. Its 7-nanometer production will be the first to use extreme ultraviolet lithography—a new version of the process of burning the circuit patterns into layers of materials on silicon to create chips. Switching to that will reduce the number of steps required, reduce cost and make the chips perform better, Samsung said. The company believes it will begin to introduce 4-nanometer production in 2020, a step which will require a brand new arrangements of transistors, the fundamental building blocks of chips. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Auto industry to recover slowly this year, BMI Research says Ringgit opens at 4.2760/2810 against US dollar KL shares open higher, tracking trend on regional bourses Asian markets rally after Fed minutes, Opec meeting in focus Dollar on defensive after Fed minutes, euro resumes rise Singapore court fines ex-broker for corruption in 1MDB probe IRB hits Magnum, subsidiary with RM476m penalty Chinese automaker Geely takes 49.9pc stake in Proton PM: Malaysia and Indonesia will retaliate against countries which boycott palm oil Bank Negara’s MyClear merges with MEPS to form PayNet Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: Expedia enables hotel booking in Cuba Reuters Video: 'I didn't expect that to happen,' says Manchester bomber's father Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Mustapa: DRB-Hicom-Geely partnership a strong commmitment KL shares end morning session mixed, benchmark barometer finish higher Malaysia’s Maybank Q1 net profit up 19pc on loans growth KL shares turn mixed at mid-morning, benchmark barometer trending higher Auto industry to recover slowly this year, BMI Research says Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Foreign meetings omitted from Sessions' security clearance World by Deb Riechmann And Chad Day, The Associated Press Posted May 24, 2017 5:00 pm MDT Last Updated May 24, 2017 at 8:40 pm MDT FILE - In this Feb. 13, 2017 file photo, Mike Flynn arrives for a news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington. The former national security adviser will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination on Monday, May 22, 2017, as he notifies the Senate Intelligence committee that he will not comply with a subpoena seeking documents. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON – Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not disclose contacts with foreign dignitaries, including the Russian ambassador, on a security clearance form he submitted as a United States senator last year, the Justice Department acknowledged Wednesday. The department said Sessions’ staff relied on the guidance of the FBI investigator handling the background check, who advised that meetings with foreign dignitaries “connected with Senate activities” did not have to be reported on the form. The news comes just two months after Sessions recused himself from a Justice Department investigation into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign after it was revealed that he had two previously undisclosed encounters, last summer and fall, with the Russian ambassador. Sessions said at his Senate confirmation hearing that he had not any communication “with the Russians.” In a statement, Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior said Sessions met with hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign dignitaries while in the Senate. Prior said Sessions’ staff consulted with the FBI and others familiar with the disclosure process, and was told not to list those meetings connected to his Senate job. CNN first reported the omissions. Also Wednesday, the FBI told a House committee that it would not be complying with a Wednesday deadline to turn over memos written by former FBI Director James Comey detailing his discussions with President Donald Trump. One memo reportedly recounts Trump pressuring Comey to shut down an investigation into the foreign ties of foreign national security adviser Michael Flynn. Lawmakers conducting their own probe continued to pressure Flynn to co-operate by raising the prospect of additional subpoenas, while Carter Page, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, told The Associated Press he would testify next month before the House intelligence committee. Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that U.S. intelligence services obtained information during the 2016 presidential election that showed senior Russian officials discussing how to influence Trump through his campaign advisers. Citing three current and former American officials, the Times said U.S. intelligence officials collected information last summer showing Russians zeroed in on Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, a former head of U.S. military intelligence who was a key Trump campaign adviser. The Russian officials thought Manafort and Flynn could be used to influence Trump’s views on Russia. The Times said some of the officials bragged about ties to Flynn. Others thought they could use Manafort’s association with former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who led a pro-Russian political party, to their advantage, the Times reported. A day earlier, former CIA Director John Brennan told a House committee that he had seen intelligence that “revealed contacts and interactions” between Russian officials and Americans “involved” in the Trump campaign — a cause for concern in case the Russians could get the Americans to co-operate. During a breakfast Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the House intelligence committee’s top Democrat, told reporters that Flynn declined to turn over records to the committee, and he said it will be “following up with subpoenas.” He did not elaborate on what materials the committee was seeking. The attempts to compel Flynn to produce documents were just another sign of the intense focus on Trump’s former national security adviser, who was fired in February after the White House said he misled administration officials, including Vice-President Mike Pence, about his contacts with Russian officials. In addition to the congressional scrutiny, Flynn is currently a target of an FBI counterintelligence investigation, a federal probe in Virginia and a Defence Department inspector general’s inquiry into the propriety of foreign payments he accepted. In a letter to the Senate committee on Monday, Flynn invoked his Fifth Amendment protection from self-incrimination in deflecting the panel’s subpoena for a wide array of documents and information related to his contacts with Russians. Flynn’s attorneys argued that the Senate’s request was too broad, and if Flynn were to comply, he could be confirming the existence of some documents and, in effect, providing testimony that could be used against him. They also said an “escalating public frenzy” against Flynn and the appointment of a special counsel had created a legally perilous environment for Flynn to provide the information. In response, the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday sent a letter narrowing its request for documents. It also issued subpoenas seeking documents from two of Flynn’s businesses— Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm owned by Flynn and his business partners, and Flynn Intel Group LLC, a company he used for other projects, such as his paid speeches. Flynn could choose to contest the congressional subpoenas seeking his business records, but legal experts said he would not prevail. Solomon L. Wisenberg, a Washington defence lawyer who worked as a prosecutor during the Starr investigation of President Bill Clinton, said both of Flynn’s corporate structures would likely have to turn over all business records sought by the committee. “The Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to business entities, period,” he said, adding that both Supreme Court and District of Columbia Circuit Court rulings would weigh on the committee’s side. While Flynn decides what, if anything, he’ll provide to Congress, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said the FBI will not be turning over memos and other materials that detail discussions between Comey and Trump. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said in an interview on CNN that the FBI sent his committee a two-sentence email saying that it would not be turning over the materials now that the Justice Department has appointed a special counsel. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who was appointed as special counsel, is overseeing an investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and whether there was any collusion with Trump associates. Chaffetz said he is considering issuing a subpoena for the documents, and he wants a better explanation from the FBI about why it’s not turning them over. The FBI declined comment. Meanwhile, Page said Wednesday that details are still being worked out about his testimony before the House intelligence committee next month. Page said he expects to testify sometime during the week of June 6 and wants at least part of his testimony to be public. ABC News first reported Page’s planned testimony. Page is one of several people associated with Trump’s campaign who are under investigation over their ties to Russia. Page has denied any involvement in Russian attempts to influence the election. ___ Associated Press writers Stephen Braun and Eric Tucker contributed to this report.

The prospect of new congressional subpoenas came one day after the committee's Senate counterpart served its own subpoenas to Flynn's businesses.

More >> Members of key congressional committees are pledging a full public airing as to why former FBI director James Comey was ousted amid an intensifying investigation into Russia's interference with the U.S. election.More >> By DEB RIECHMANN and CHAD DAY Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not disclose contacts with foreign dignitaries, including the Russian ambassador, on a security clearance form he submitted as a United States senator last year, the Justice Department acknowledged Wednesday. The department said Sessions' staff relied on the guidance of the FBI investigator handling the background check, who advised that meetings with foreign dignitaries "connected with Senate activities" did not have to be reported on the form. The news comes just two months after Sessions recused himself from a Justice Department investigation into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign after it was revealed that he had two previously undisclosed encounters, last summer and fall, with the Russian ambassador. Sessions said at his Senate confirmation hearing that he had not any communication "with the Russians." In a statement, Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior said Sessions met with hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign dignitaries while in the Senate. Prior said Sessions' staff consulted with the FBI and others familiar with the disclosure process, and was told not to list those meetings connected to his Senate job. CNN first reported the omissions. Also Wednesday, the FBI told a House committee that it would not be complying with a Wednesday deadline to turn over memos written by former FBI Director James Comey detailing his discussions with President Donald Trump. One memo reportedly recounts Trump pressuring Comey to shut down an investigation into the foreign ties of foreign national security adviser Michael Flynn. Lawmakers conducting their own probe continued to pressure Flynn to cooperate by raising the prospect of additional subpoenas, while Carter Page, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, told The Associated Press he would testify next month before the House intelligence committee. Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that U.S. intelligence services obtained information during the 2016 presidential election that showed senior Russian officials discussing how to influence Trump through his campaign advisers. Citing three current and former American officials, the Times said U.S. intelligence officials collected information last summer showing Russians zeroed in on Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, a former head of U.S. military intelligence who was a key Trump campaign adviser. The Russian officials thought Manafort and Flynn could be used to influence Trump's views on Russia. The Times said some of the officials bragged about ties to Flynn. Others thought they could use Manafort's association with former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who led a pro-Russian political party, to their advantage, the Times reported. A day earlier, former CIA Director John Brennan told a House committee that he had seen intelligence that "revealed contacts and interactions" between Russian officials and Americans "involved" in the Trump campaign - a cause for concern in case the Russians could get the Americans to cooperate. During a breakfast Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the House intelligence committee's top Democrat, told reporters that Flynn declined to turn over records to the committee, and he said it will be "following up with subpoenas." He did not elaborate on what materials the committee was seeking. The attempts to compel Flynn to produce documents were just another sign of the intense focus on Trump's former national security adviser, who was fired in February after the White House said he misled administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his contacts with Russian officials. In addition to the congressional scrutiny, Flynn is currently a target of an FBI counterintelligence investigation, a federal probe in Virginia and a Defense Department inspector general's inquiry into the propriety of foreign payments he accepted. In a letter to the Senate committee on Monday, Flynn invoked his Fifth Amendment protection from self-incrimination in deflecting the panel's subpoena for a wide array of documents and information related to his contacts with Russians. Flynn's attorneys argued that the Senate's request was too broad, and if Flynn were to comply, he could be confirming the existence of some documents and, in effect, providing testimony that could be used against him. They also said an "escalating public frenzy" against Flynn and the appointment of a special counsel had created a legally perilous environment for Flynn to provide the information. In response, the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday sent a letter narrowing its request for documents. It also issued subpoenas seeking documents from two of Flynn's businesses- Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm owned by Flynn and his business partners, and Flynn Intel Group LLC, a company he used for other projects, such as his paid speeches. Flynn could choose to contest the congressional subpoenas seeking his business records, but legal experts said he would not prevail. Solomon L. Wisenberg, a Washington defense lawyer who worked as a prosecutor during the Starr investigation of President Bill Clinton, said both of Flynn's corporate structures would likely have to turn over all business records sought by the committee. "The Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to business entities, period," he said, adding that both Supreme Court and District of Columbia Circuit Court rulings would weigh on the committee's side. While Flynn decides what, if anything, he'll provide to Congress, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said the FBI will not be turning over memos and other materials that detail discussions between Comey and Trump. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said in an interview on CNN that the FBI sent his committee a two-sentence email saying that it would not be turning over the materials now that the Justice Department has appointed a special counsel. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who was appointed as special counsel, is overseeing an investigation into Russia's meddling in the election and whether there was any collusion with Trump associates. Chaffetz said he is considering issuing a subpoena for the documents, and he wants a better explanation from the FBI about why it's not turning them over. The FBI declined comment. Meanwhile, Page said Wednesday that details are still being worked out about his testimony before the House intelligence committee next month. Page said he expects to testify sometime during the week of June 6 and wants at least part of his testimony to be public. ABC News first reported Page's planned testimony. Page is one of several people associated with Trump's campaign who are under investigation over their ties to Russia. Page has denied any involvement in Russian attempts to influence the election. ___ Associated Press writers Stephen Braun and Eric Tucker contributed to this report.

John McAfee, the pioneering and controversial anti-virus software developer, who took over as the chief executive officer of MGT Capital Investments Inc. last year and turned the video-game company into a cybersecurity firm. He expects the money-losing company to be profitable as it ramps up its bitcoin mining business, with the goal of becoming the biggest in the world. "We will definitely be profitable before the end of the year," McAfee said in a phone interview Wednesday. "From bitcoin mining, we will get the experience and expertise to apply the blockchain to our security products." MGT Capital announced plans last June for the first phase of its bitcoin operation, which was the company’s only revenue driver in the first quarter. It’s stationed in the mountains of Washington state and employs two people, whose primary job is to maintain the air conditioning system for the computers that are doing the mining, McAfee said. MGT Capital has a dozen employees. The bitcoin venture generated $312,000 in sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017, according to a government filing. The company had a net loss of $5.89 million. MGT Capital said Monday that it received financing to buy 1,000 mining computers from Chinese firm Bitmain Technologies, bringing the total to around 1,300. It expects to start generating 225 bitcoins per month, up from about 100, which was the most recently disclosed number. The cryptocurrency is currently worth about $2,500 per coin. Skeptics have warned that there’s a bubble in the making. Bitcoin and other digital currencies like ethereum have surged as more companies embrace the underlying technology and some investors seek financial refuge from political uncertainty across the globe. MGT Capital primarily mines bitcoin, but also has small-scale operations for ethereum and monero, McAfee said. Read more about the surge in bitcoin and other alternative currencies "No matter how much government and regulators may scream and complain, there will be a world standard alternative currency," McAfee said. "Bitcoin appears to be the one... It cannot possibly be a bubble." Bitcoin transactions are overseen by a network of so-called miners whose computers perform calculations to validate each transfer, preventing double-spending.

The news sent its shares into a frenzy, but the euphoria quickly faded after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed the company and the stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. The company is now embroiled in a lawsuit with Intel Corp. over the use of the McAfee moniker. Intel bought the McAfee computer-security business in 2011, but recently sold its majority stake. McAfee, who wants to change MGT Capital’s name to John McAfee Global Technologies, sued Intel for the right to use his name. MGT Capital employees who aren’t working on bitcoin are focused on the cybersecurity business, which McAfee anticipates will ultimately be the main revenue source as it expands product offerings, and the number of bitcoins left for mining dwindles. The company’s Sentinel "anti-hacking system," which consists of software and hardware, can reduce the time a hacker has to operate, according to its website. MGT Capital is also developing a " privacy phone" that features a kill switch. "I don’t know anyone more capable than me," said McAfee. "I have never lost in terms of business and I certainly don’t intend to start now." (Updates to add details on bitcoin mining operation in seventh paragraph.

Madrigal May 24, 2017 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Over the last 20 years, the technology industry has become the most powerful industry in the world, boasting seven of the 20 most profitable companies. Last year, Apple literally doubled the profits ($53.4 billion) of the second-most profitable company, J.P. Morgan Chase ($24.4 billion). And when it comes to market value, tech companies sweep the top five: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. These companies are not only huge and profitable; they’re also growing. By most measures, though not all, this power is concentrated in one specific region, the Pacific Coast, and even more tightly centralized in the San Francisco Bay Area. Incredibly, three of those five most valuable companies are located in three adjacent little towns in Silicon Valley. The total distance from Facebook in Menlo Park to Alphabet (née Google) in Mountain View to Apple in Cupertino is just 15 miles. These companies—with apologies to Intel, Oracle, and Cisco—have become the Big Three of Silicon Valley. Detroit had a Big Three for decades: General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. They were also amazingly profitable, industry-leading, and birthed a global industry. In the late 1950s, these three companies had over 90 percent market share in the U.S. car market, which was also the world’s largest. Now, companies from a similarly small region occupy a similarly dominant role in the economy, which has powered economic growth over the last several decades. But a comparison between Detroit’s Big Three and Silicon Valley’s shows how much the economy around any individual company or place has changed. * * * Investors now value tech as they once valued automotive (and oil) companies. It was the IPO of the decade. Thousands of people flocked to brokers hoping to get their hands on some of the paper from one of the century’s most innovative and respected companies. Finally, finally, the common person could share in the wealth generated by the genius of … Ford. The year was 1956, and Ford, privately held since its inception by the Ford family and (later) the Ford Foundation, was accessing the public markets. More than 10 million shares went on the market and were immediately snatched up by hundreds of thousands of investors at an opening price of $64.50. The Ford Foundation made $642.6 million in the sale. It was the biggest IPO ever, as befit the automotive industry, which was the biggest in everything around the mid-century. Likewise, at the time Ford went public, the true behemoth of the American economy, General Motors, was the nation’s most valuable stock, running $263.27. And for good reason. These companies make a ton of money. In the second (1956) edition of the Fortune 500, Ford held the third slot in revenue and profit. That year, the company made $437 million dollars. General Motors took the top spot by becoming the first company to break $1 billion in profit that year ($1.19 to be exact). Only 16 companies even made $100 million in 1956. Chrysler was the least profitable of those companies, eking into the echelon with $100.1 million in profits. The only rival the car industry had was the oil industry, which had the number-two company on Fortune’s list, Exxon Mobil, as well as seven others in the top 20 most profitable companies. All this to say: making cars and fueling them dominated the American profit-making enterprise. Hell, even the two big tire manufacturers were among the top 35 profit-makers of 1956. Cars were national. Tech is global. But there are crucial differences between Detroit’s Big Three and Silicon Valley’s. One is that Silicon Valley’s companies are fully global enterprises. Since 2015, the majority of Facebook’s ad revenue comes from overseas. Apple crossed that threshold in the first quarter of 2010, and now roughly two-thirds of the company’s revenue comes from abroad. Google, too, has long made a majority of its money outside the U.S., though its home country represents nearly half its revenue. In fact, all the money that these companies are making overseas is one reason why they are valued so highly, Harvard Business School’s Shane Greenstein told me. “Since the election, the markets have factored in a presumed ‘tax holiday’ that allows firms to repatriate their foreign earnings without U.S. taxes,” Greenstein said. “That especially shapes the values of Apple and Google.” Since the election, Facebook is up 11 percent, Google is up 21 percent, and Apple is up a gobsmacking 34 percent. Perhaps this is even more remarkable, given that tech company employees gave Hillary Clinton 60 times the money they gave to Donald Trump ($3 million to $50,000). The tech labor force is a tiny fraction of the automotive industry’s. The other crucial difference is that tech’s leading companies employee far fewer people than Detroit’s Big Three did. This point can be made in the single chart above,  but it’s worth unpacking in three ways. One, even though the big industrial giants did employ a lot of people, by the 1950s they were already automating away some of the jobs that they’d just created by building huge factories. “Between 1948 and 1967—when the auto industry was at its economic peak—Detroit lost more than 130,000 manufacturing jobs,” the historian Thomas J. Sugrue has written. To me, that’s startling. This was the absolute golden age of manufacturing, yet in the seat of the most important industry, companies were shedding jobs. Two, the car companies’ employees were far more concentrated in Detroit and the surrounding cities than the tech companies’. Apple only has 25,000 employees in the “Santa Clara Valley.” Google likely has around 20,000 at its home. And let’s call it at around 6,000 Facebook folks in Menlo Park. Three, the tech companies have many, many, many subcontractors, from content moderators in the Philippines to manufacturing people at Foxconn in China to custodians on their own campuses to bus drivers dragging people up and down from San Francisco. The way modern companies work, they try to keep employees off their own balance sheets unless absolutely necessary, especially lower-wage workers. The original Big Three were the motive power for a whole region’s economy. By employing so many people at decent wages, they created broad-based prosperity. In Silicon Valley, the wealth that the Big Three create goes to a much smaller slice of the population, building wealth for thousands instead of hundreds of thousands of workers. In 2016, Facebook generated $600,000 of net income per employee. That is to say, the tech world, for all its disruptions, is a supercharged example of how the American economy as a whole works right now: The skilled and the already rich make huge amounts of money, and everyone else gets the leftovers.

I was 11, a typical American kid, before I realized who she was. The ashes filled a black plastic box about the size of a toaster. It weighed three and a half pounds. I put it in a canvas tote bag and packed it in my suitcase this past July for the transpacific flight to Manila. From there I would travel by car to a rural village. When I arrived, I would hand over all that was left of the woman who had spent 56 years as a slave in my family’s household.

But a new clinical approach offers hope. This is a good day, Samantha tells me: 10 on a scale of 10. We’re sitting in a conference room at the San Marcos Treatment Center, just south of Austin, Texas, a space that has witnessed countless difficult conversations between troubled children, their worried parents, and clinical therapists. But today promises unalloyed joy. Samantha’s mother is visiting from Idaho, as she does every six weeks, which means lunch off campus and an excursion to Target. The girl needs supplies: new jeans, yoga pants, nail polish. Listen to the audio version of this article:Download the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles. At 11, Samantha is just over 5 feet tall and has wavy black hair and a steady gaze. She flashes a smile when I ask about her favorite subject (history), and grimaces when I ask about her least favorite (math). She seems poised and cheerful, a normal preteen. But when we steer into uncomfortable territory—the events that led her to this juvenile-treatment facility nearly 2,000 miles from her family—Samantha hesitates and looks down at her hands. “I wanted the whole world to myself,” she says. “So I made a whole entire book about how to hurt people.” Continue Reading Shannon Stapleton / Reuters The Trump Organization Says It's 'Not Practical' to Comply With the Emoluments Clause Russell Berman The president’s business tells lawmakers it is too difficult to track all its foreign revenue in accordance with constitutional requirements, and it hasn’t asked Congress for a permission slip. Days before taking office, Donald Trump said his company would donate all profits from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury, part of an effort to avoid even the appearance of a conflict with the Constitution’s emoluments clause. Now, however, the Trump Organization is telling Congress that determining exactly how much of its profits come from foreign governments is simply more trouble than it’s worth. In response to a document request from the House Oversight Committee, Trump’s company sent a copy of an eight-page pamphlet detailing how it plans to track payments it receives from foreign governments at the firm’s many hotels, golf courses, and restaurants across the globe. But while the Trump Organization said it would set aside all money it collects from customers that identify themselves as representing a foreign government, it would not undertake a more intensive effort to determine if a payment would violate the Constitution’s prohibition on public office holders accepting an “emolument” from a foreign state. Continue Reading Corbis Historical / Getty Why American Workers Now Dress So Casually Deirdre Clemente The office was, until a few decades ago, the last stronghold of fashion formality. Silicon Valley changed that. Americans began the 20th century in bustles and bowler hats and ended it in velour sweatsuits and flannel shirts—the most radical shift in dress standards in human history. At the center of this sartorial revolution was business casual, a genre of dress that broke the last bastion of formality—office attire—to redefine the American wardrobe. Born in Silicon Valley in the early 1980s, business casual consists of khaki pants, sensible shoes, and button-down collared shirts. By the time it was mainstream, in the 1990s, it flummoxed HR managers and employees alike. “Welcome to the confusing world of business casual,” declared a fashion writer for the Chicago Tribune in 1995. With time and some coaching, people caught on. Today, though, the term “business casual” is nearly obsolete for describing the clothing of a workforce that includes many who work from home in yoga pants, put on a clean T-shirt for a Skype meeting, and don’t always go into the office.

Marvel Comics has been having a rough time lately. Readers and critics met last year’s Civil War 2—a blockbuster crossover event (and a spiritual tie-in to the year’s big Marvel movie)—with disinterest and scorn. Two years of plummeting print comics sales culminated in a February during which only one series managed to sell over 50,000 copies. Three crossover events designed to pump up excitement came and went with little fanfare, while the lead-up to 2017’s blockbuster crossover Secret Empire—where a fascist Captain America subverts and conquers the United States—sparked such a negative response that the company later put out a statement imploring readers to buy the whole thing before judging it. On March 30, a battered Marvel decided to try and get to the bottom of the problem with a retailer summit—and promptly stuck its foot in its mouth.

Collected here are recent scenes from abandoned construction projects, industrial disaster zones, blighted urban neighborhoods, towns where residents left to escape violence or natural disasters, derelict Olympic venues, ghost towns, and more.

Go down into the long tail of Grand Canyon videos, and you’ll eventually find a two-part, 35-minute lecture by Andrew Snelling. The first sign this isn’t a typical geology lecture comes about a minute in, when Snelling proclaims, “The Grand Canyon does provide a testament to the biblical account of Earth’s history.” Snelling is a prominent young-Earth creationist. For years, he has given lectures, guided biblical-themed Grand Canyon rafting tours, and worked for the nonprofit Answers in Genesis. (The CEO of Answers in Genesis, Ken Ham, is also behind the Creation Museum and the Ark Encounter theme park.) Young-Earth creationism, in contrast to other forms of creationism, specifically holds that the Earth is only thousands of years old. Snelling believes that the Grand Canyon formed after Noah’s flood—and he now claims the U.S. government is blocking his research in the canyon because of his religious views. Continue Reading AP/The Atlantic What ISIS Really Wants Graeme Wood The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs, among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Here’s what that means for its strategy—and for how to stop it. What is the Islamic State? Where did it come from, and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving, and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December, The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata, the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East, admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic State’s appeal. “We have not defeated the idea,” he said. “We do not even understand the idea.” In the past year, President Obama has referred to the Islamic State, variously, as “not Islamic” and as al-Qaeda’s “jayvee team,” statements that reflected confusion about the group, and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

Inside ABC’s tonally bizarro update of the seminal 1987 romantic drama Dirty Dancing are about four different projects trying to get out. There’s the most obvious one, a frame-by-frame remake of the original that’s as awkward and ill-conceived as Gus Van Sant’s 1997 carbon copy of Psycho. There’s the one Abigail Breslin’s starring in, an emotionally textured and realistic coming-of-age story about a clumsy but engaging wallflower. There’s a musical, in which Breslin and Nicole Scherzinger mime along to their own singing voices in a strange dance rehearsal while half-heartedly exploring the idea that power emanates from the vagina. And there’s the most compelling story, a Wide Sargasso Sea-inspired spinoff starring Debra Messing as a lonely housewife coming to terms with the turbulent depths of her own desire.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) May 24, 2017 at 2:23PM Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key focus of many technology companies right now. It seems nearly every major technology player is already investing in its own AI, snatching up companies that are working on it, or a little bit of both. But what if you're an investor who wants to venture into the burgeoning AI market -- which may reach $37 billion by 2025 -- and earn a dividend on your investment at the same time? For that, you should look to the top five dividend stocks in artificial intelligence. These companies aren't necessarily the best dividend stocks you can choose, but they're some of the best AI players that also pay their investors: Company Market Cap 2016 Revenue Dividend Yield Payout Ratio IBM (NYSE:IBM) $143 billion $79.9 bilion 3.7% 46% Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) $528 billion $85.3 billion 2.3% 66% Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) $168 billion $59.4 billion 2.9% 45% NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) $82 billion $6.9 billion 0.37% 18.9% Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) $802 billion $215 billion 1.49% 26.6% Data sources: Yahoo! Finance and company filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.   IBM IBM is a longtime player in the AI space (essentially, since the beginning) but launched its "cognitive solutions" business in 2011, and just added its Watson AI services for its mainframe customers. The company's latest move aims to make Watson the go-to AI for sifting through private data on company clouds, so that enterprise businesses can better use all of the data they've collected. Image source: IBM. IBM is understandably keen on getting its AI systems into more businesses, because the company earns 82% gross profit margin from its cognitive solutions segment, far higher than any of its other businesses. IBM is a solid dividend play in addition to its lofty AI pursuits. The company has raised its dividend every year for the past 22 years, and has a yield of about 3.7% and payout ratio of 46%. Microsoft Microsoft already uses artificial intelligence in everything from its Bing search engine to its Xbox gaming console. But it's the company's Azure cloud-computing platform that AI-leaning investors should focus on most. Azure's machine-learning capabilities are already used for Microsoft's retail, financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing customers.The company doesn't share how much revenue it earns from any of its AI services, but Microsoft is on track to earn $20 billion from its cloud-computing platform by fiscal 2018. The company wants its Microsoft Graph -- a collection of user data from Microsoft apps on varying devices -- to build what it calls the "intelligent cloud," so that consumer and enterprise devices are aware of the information that they need, when they need it. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft has increased its dividend, currently at a 2.3% yield, for the past 13 years, and has a payout ratio of 66%. Intel Intel has consistently moved further into AI over the past few years, with the development of its own AI chip and purchases of companies focused on AI technologies. Its biggest purchase came in late 2015, when it bought Altera for $16.7 billion, to acquire the company's field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip technology, ideal for creating AI chips for cloud computing. And most recently the $15.3 billion purchase of Mobileye, maker of driverless-car technology, moved the company further into the AI space. Mobileye uses AI to teach cars how to respond to new driving scenarios based on their past experience. It says that its technology is "one of the first embedded versions of AI" -- actually built into chips in the car, as opposed to in the cloud. Image source: Intel. Intel currently has a dividend yield of 2.9% and its payout ratio is about 45%. The company is still in the middle of transitioning away from its old PC business, but its bet on AI technology could prove to be a winner as this market continues to expand. NVIDIA NVIDIA is at the forefront of artificial intelligence both in the driverless-car space and in data centers. The company's Drive PX 2 supercomputer uses AI to help autonomous cars understand their surroundings, and make driving decisions based on that information. NVIDIA's DGX-1 supercomputer uses the company's Pascal architecture chips, built for AI, to process information much like humans do (via neural networks); it can do the work of 250 traditional servers. NVIDIA has an estimated AI opportunity of about $5 billion to $10 billion, and its increasing expansion into data centers means that its AI opportunity is materializing sooner rather than later. Image source: Getty Images. Investors should know while NVIDIA has lots of AI upside, it only began paying a dividend in 2012, and its trailing 12-month yield is only 0.37% right now. The company's payout ratio is currently about 18.9%. And it's worth noting that NVIDIA proved in its latest quarter that it still has lots of room to grow, which leaves open the opportunity for more dividend growth as well. Apple Apple has been involved in AI for a while; its most public foray into the space came when it launched Siri back in 2011. The company has since quietly infused AI upgrades into Siri and its native apps. For example, its Maps app uses AI to redirect drivers around traffic and AI is used to identify people in the Photos app. The company has AI research centers in Seattle, purchased an AI company called Turi for $200 million last year, and recently announced a new AI research lab in Japan. Some people have been skeptical about Apple's opportunity in AI, because the company is famous for keeping its user data private, and AI needs to analyze lots of data to be effective. But Apple can still improve how its customers interact with their Apple devices via embedded AI systems. Image source: Apple. The company has paid out a quarterly dividend on a continual basis, and has increased its dividend each year since it started the dividend plan in 2012. Apple has kept to its word of increasing its dividend on a yearly basis, and most recently announced a 10.5% increase in its fiscal second quarter.

Now you can re-live it Chris Davies - May 24, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Microsoft’s big Surface Pro announcement this week saw the long-anticipated update of its tablet, but you’d be forgiven for missing the whole thing. The decision to hold the event in China meant that you’d have needed to get up pretty early in order to watch the livestream from North America. That’s a shame, as Microsoft devices chief Panos Panay spared no enthusiasm around why the Surface Pro should be in your bag. Now, though, you have a second chance. Microsoft has released the video of the whole event, 45 minutes of Panay eagerness and the Surface Pro being put through its paces. It’s a big deal, too, since the upgrades have all been hotly anticipated. Microsoft jumped to Intel’s 7th-generation processors, with m3, Core i5, and Core i7 options on the spec sheet. The Core i5 is even fanless, now, for quieter operation. The display remains a 2736 x 1824 PixelSense panel, measuring in at 12.3-inches, but the digitizer gets an upgrade. It now supports 4,096 levels of pressure recognition, while the Surface Pen can transmit tilt information to compatible apps. Its latency has been cut as well, to 21 milliseconds, though now Microsoft isn’t including it in the box. It’ll cost you $99 to add it. Also an option is the Type Cover. That’s still $129, but comes in four updated colors; Microsoft is also using the same Alcantara material that it has on the Surface Laptop. The Surface Pro’s hinge has been reworked, adding a “Studio Mode” lean-back of 165-degrees that should please digital artists, and down the line there’ll be an LTE-A option for onboard cellular connectivity. All the same, the updated Surface Pro wasn’t quite the slam-dunk some were hoping for. Expectations of a port revamp – with most hoping for USB Type-C at least, if not Thunderbolt 3 – were dashed, with Microsoft sticking with USB Type-A instead. Just as on the Surface Laptop, announced earlier this month in New York City, you’ll have to use an adapter if you want the updated port type. So, if you’re on the fence, it’s up to Panay to convince you. Presales of the Surface Pro have already opened up, with the 2-in-1 priced from $799 for the Core m3 version, while the top-spec Core i7 with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of solid-state storage is a heady $2,699.99. They’ll begin shipping on June 15 in 25 markets worldwide.

In addition to continuing to dominate the tennis court — she won her twenty-third Grand Slam, the Australian Open, this January, while pregnant — she runs a clothing line, owns a stake in the Miami Dolphins, and is the face of Intel’s latest campaign. Now, she’s venturing further into the tech world. Today, Williams took to Instagram to announce her new role as a board member for poll-taking company SurveyMonkey. “I believe in the power of a question and the impact of data,” Williams wrote in her caption. “Like SurveyMonkey, I’m driven to ask what’s happening, and why. We also share a fierce commitment to letting all voices be heard.” Advertisement Thrilled to join the @surveymonkey team. I believe in the power of a question and the impact of data. Like SurveyMonkey, I’m driven to ask what’s happening, and why. We also share a fierce commitment to letting all voices be heard. #embracetheanswer A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on May 24, 2017 at 5:30am PDT It’s the last part of that statement — “letting all voices be heard” — that Williams intends to champion in her work with the company. In a tweet about her new position, she included a link to a survey of her own. The focus: diversity in the workplace. "In recent years, we've made progress in closing the gender pay gap in professional tennis. How much progress, if any, has there been where you work?" She asked. There is a five-star rating system, going from "no progress" to "a great deal of progress." She also zooms in on the lack of diversity in Silicon Valley, in particular: "This position gives me a new platform in Silicon Valley, and I have a lot to say. What are the important issues you’d like me to focus on first?" The answer options include, "Breaking down barriers, training for excellence, competitive fire, organizational strength and agility, and/or other." My first move as board member of @SurveyMonkey is to make a poll 📝(obvi)! I’m curious about you - take my survey! https://t.co/4P9qekGsex— Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) May 24, 2017 Advertisement In an interview with The Associated Press, the tennis ace talked about the impact she hopes to have, though she doesn't detail how she will achieve it. "I feel like diversity is something I speak to," Williams told the AP. "Change is always happening, change is always building. What is important to me is to be at the forefront of the change and to make it easier for the next person that comes behind me." This isn't the first time that Williams has expressed an interest in bringing more diversity to the tech industry. In a 2015 interview with Wired, she said: "I’m a Black woman, and I am in a sport that wasn’t really meant for Black people. And while tennis isn’t really about the future, Silicon Valley sure is...I think we’re making progress. But we can keep working even more to increase equality — whether it’s making sure to interview Black candidates for tech jobs or standing up to cyberbullying or making sure that our technology is designed by all kinds of people. " According to The AP, Williams was connected with SurveyMonkey by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who is also on the board and whose late husband, Dave Goldberg, served as SurveyMonkey’s CEO. Serena Williams and Sheryl Sandberg? That is one powerful doubles pairing.

Mello Jr. May 24, 2017 11:37 AM PT Microsoft on Tuesday announced a refresh of its Surface Pro tablet-laptop computer. Although Microsoft said the fifth generation of the unit has been redesigned from the inside out with more than 800 new custom parts, the Surface Pro looks similar to its predecessor. "If you were looking for a major redesign of Surface, this isn't it," said Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. Nevertheless, Microsoft has made some significant improvements in the tablet cum laptop. "Overall, the new Microsoft Surface Pro is a significant, even substantial, improvement over the Surface 4," said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. Better Battery Life Battery life has been boosted to 13.5 hours, which is 50 percent greater than the new Surface Pro's predecessor, and 35 percent greater than its Apple rival, the iPad Pro. Microsoft has upgraded the processors in the line, too, giving the new unit 2.5 times more computational performance than the Surface Pro 3, and 1.7 times the performance of the iPad Pro. The Surface Pro models that use Intel's 7th-generation Core m3 and i5 chips are fanless, so they're quiet as well as powerful. The i7 model of the unit with a fan is relatively quiet, too, with a noise level of 18db. "The fanless 7th-gen Core i5 capabilities are unique in a tablet, and it's apparent Microsoft did some serious thermal work," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. The new Surface Pro also has a high-resolution screen -- 2736 x 1824 -- with 267 pixels per inch, which is 50 percent more than a 12-inch MacBook. The display is enhanced by Microsoft's PixelSense Accelerator technology, which is designed to make colors vibrant and precise. More Sensitive Pen Improvements also have been made to the Surface Pen, which is sold separately and is offered in four colors -- platinum, burgundy, cobalt blue and black. With 4,096 pressure points, the pen is four times more sensitive than the original Surface Pen, Microsoft said, and with a latency of 21 milliseconds, it's close to capturing the experience of an analog pen to paper. "The long battery life and the fanless design will be the greatest draws for this Surface Pro," Reticle's Rubin told TechNewsWorld. Meanwhile, "the new pen technology should resonate with those using their Surface for nuanced drawings," he added. Drawing on the new Surface Pro is easier, too, thanks to an improved hinge that gives the unit 165 degrees of motion. Microsoft also has spruced up the keyboards for the new Surface Pro. They're covered with Alcantara fabric, which is treated with a high-performance polyurethane coating to resist spills. Keyboard colors match those of the Surface Pen. Future LTE Support The new Surface Pro remains light and thin at 1.7 pounds and 8.5mm, and it's going to support LTE later this year, Microsoft said. "If you preorder a unit, you will not have the option to use 4G connections," explained Jeff Orr, senior practice director for mobile devices at ABI Research. "You can only use WiFi or Bluetooth connections." The addition of cellular connectivity rounds out the capabilities of the Surface Pro. "If you're talking about a truly mobile product, you should be able to connect anywhere," Orr told TechNewsWorld. Despite its many improvements, the new Surface Pro still doesn't support USB-C connections. "It would have been nice to have at least one USB-C port," Pund-IT's King told TechNewsWorld. Microsoft also has dropped numbering with this latest model, which may confuse the market in the long run. "It's more difficult for buyers to know what is new and what is old in the channel," Moorhead told TechNewsWorld. "Buying peripherals are more difficult, too," he continued. "We have seen these issues with the Apple iPad, and we will see them with Surface Pro." Refresh Needed Badly A new version of the Surface Pro was overdue. "The product line definitely needed a refresh. This brings the Surface Pro products up to spec with other Surface products," ABI's Orr said. "This will help Microsoft continue the momentum it's had with Surface and help establish it in more organizations," he added. Before the refresh, that momentum might have begun to stall. "The current Surface Pro has been around for a year and half now, so its sales began to slip because it's old technology," said Jack E. Gold, principal analyst at J.Gold Associates. "They really needed to update it," he told TechNewsWorld. Microsoft began taking advance orders for the new Surface Pro Tuesday, and will start shipping units June 15. Base price is US$799 for a model with an Intel Core m3 processor, 4 GB of RAM and a 128-GB solid state drive. Keyboards are $159.99. Pricing for the Surface Pen was not announced. John P.

Snigdha Sengupta (From left) Nexus Venture Partners’ co-founder Suvir Sujan, managing director Anup Gupta, co-founder Sandeep Singhal and co-founder Naren Gupta. Mumbai: By this time, Nexus Venture Partners, one of India’s top venture capital firms, should have been sitting on a substantial pile of cash from the sale of its stake in troubled e-commerce company Snapdeal. Instead, for more than three months, the Mumbai-based firm has fought a bitter (but losing) boardroom battle to save its investment. At this juncture, it may have little choice but to walk away from what could have been its most lucrative bet with its principal investment and pride barely intact. Delhi-based Snapdeal (Jasper Infotech Pvt. Ltd)—it has been widely reported—is up for sale and for a song. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp., Snapdeal’s largest investor, is desperately trying to merge the company with its larger Bengaluru-based rival Flipkart in an all stock transaction that values the former at about $1 billion. Snapdeal was valued at $6.5 billion at its peak not too long ago. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son. Photo: Bloomberg As part of the transaction, SoftBank, which owns about 33% of Snapdeal, has offered to buy the stakes of Nexus and Kalaari Capital, another early venture capital investor in the company, for $60 million and $30 million, respectively. They each own about 10% and 8% of Snapdeal and enjoy veto rights on critical matters such as the proposed distress sale. Until recently, both were opposed to the terms being offered by SoftBank. But, early this month, Kalaari Capital managing director Vani Kola resigned from the company’s board. That doesn’t necessarily mean the Bengaluru-based venture capital firm loses its veto rights. However, if the move signals acquiescence to SoftBank’s terms, which is more likely than not, it leaves Nexus with little leverage in its standoff with the Japanese media and internet conglomerate. It isn’t difficult to understand Nexus’s dogged resistance. The venture capital firm hasn’t liquidated any of its stake in Snapdeal, acquired at an estimated investment of more than $40 million over multiple funding rounds. On the other hand, Kalaari Capital, whose overall investment is estimated at $27.5 million, has already harvested a reported $100 million by selling a portion of its original stake to SoftBank more than two years ago. Nexus’s predicament, however, brings up a couple of pertinent questions. One, like other early-stage investors, why didn’t it sell its stake, even partially, before Snapdeal fell off the wagon? According to three people familiar with developments at the company who spoke on condition of anonymity, the venture capital firm had at least two prime opportunities to do so well before matters spun out of control. Two, does Nexus need to re-evaluate its own strategic direction as an early-stage investor in the Indian technology start-up market? Nexus declined to respond to an e-mailed questionnaire. A fatal error in judgement? When SoftBank entered Snapdeal in October 2014 with a $627 million investment, it is believed to have made offers to buy the stakes of some of the company’s existing investors. Since Snapdeal’s valuation had vaulted to a reported nearly $2 billion with SoftBank’s entry, many of its early investors stood to reap a significant upside. Apart from Nexus and Kalaari, the other early investors in the company at the time included Bessemer Venture Partners, Intel Capital, eBay Inc. and Saama Capital. Some passed up on the offer. Others such as Kalaari and Bessemer decided to cash in. Bessemer, which owned a 4% stake, sold shares to SoftBank and hedge fund Stanley F. Druckenmiller (see chart). SoftBank declined to respond to queries. Nexus is also believed to have been among those who passed up on the offer to sell. It had its reasons. Just months before SoftBank arrived, the firm had rolled up its investment in Snapdeal by participating in a $134 million funding round led by Nasdaq-listed e-commerce marketplace eBay. The investment was reportedly made from its $110 million India Opportunities Fund, a sidecar fund raised for the specific purpose of follow-on investments in potentially successful later stage portfolio companies such as Snapdeal. It probably reckoned that with the financial muscle of SoftBank on board, the going could only get better. And, for a brief while it did. About nine months later, Taiwanese manufacturing company Foxconn Technology Group, Chinese e-commerce marketplace Alibaba and SoftBank led a $500 million funding round in Snapdeal. Existing investors Temasek Holdings, BlackRock, Myriad Asset Management and Premji Invest also participated in the round. Snapdeal’s post-money valuation jumped to $4.8 billion. This time, eBay decided to cash in. It sold 1.16% of its 9% stake to Foxconn. Around the time that the Foxconn-Alibaba funding round was being closed, Canada’s largest professional pension fund, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP), came calling at Snapdeal. It made offers to buy the stakes of some of the company’s remaining early investors. Bengaluru-based venture capital firm Saama Capital cut a deal to sell its entire stake to OTPP. The deal closed in November 2015. Saama Capital managing partner Ash Lilani told Mint in March last year that the sale was profitable enough for the firm to return its second fund, the $26 million Saama Capital II, to its investors or limited partners. Saama had invested about $4 million over multiple funding rounds in Snapdeal. Lilani declined to share details about the size of the stake sold. Again, Nexus is believed to have been among those that OTPP approached. The venture capital firm passed up on the offer. At the time, Snapdeal’s valuation had climbed to over $5 billion and Nexus’s stake would have been worth well over $500 million. Email queries to OTPP remained unanswered at the time of going to press. “There was a small mismatch in the valuation… Nexus turned down the (OTPP) offer because it wanted a slightly higher valuation,” says one of the three people cited earlier. That error of judgement may have cost Nexus possibly the most profitable exit from its portfolio. Snapdeal hasn’t been able to raise any significant primary capital since the Foxconn-Alibaba round and its valuation has plummeted due to external and internal factors. “Timing is everything in the venture capital business. Especially when it comes to exits. In this case, greed seems to have obscured that judgement,” says the second of the three people cited earlier. Whether it was greed or whether Nexus allowed itself to be blindsided by SoftBank’s financial muscle is something there are no clear answers to yet. What’s incredible though is how a frontline venture capital firm failed to see that it could never be anything but incidental to a devastating game of oneupmanship that was playing out between two of the most powerful investors in India’s start-up market at the time. Nikesh Arora vs Lee Fixel Before SoftBank announced its arrival in India, New York-based hedge fund Tiger Global Management enjoyed unobstructed access to some of the country’s fastest growing technology start-ups. The hedge fund employed a swift pace of dealmaking and higher-than-market valuations to edge out some of the most experienced venture capital investors at the deal tables. By late 2014, the firm’s private equity arm, led by secretive fund manager Lee Fixel, had put an estimated $2 billion to work in buying up prime stakes in frontline start-ups such as cab hailing services Ola, online classifieds platform Quikr and Flipkart. Tiger Global’s rising fortunes in the Indian market soon attracted a myriad of global investors from hedge funds to sovereign wealth funds to strategic investors. Like Tiger Global, they were often willing to pay a hefty premium to corner a piece of the world’s fastest growing consumer internet market. Among them, SoftBank had the most resources and ambition and, it lost no time in matching Tiger Global dollar for dollar. Led by Nikesh Arora, a former high profile Google executive who had recently taken charge as vice-chairman, SoftBank quickly deployed nearly $2 billion across start-ups such as Snapdeal, Ola, property listings platform Housing, budget stays aggregator OYO Rooms and grocery e-tailer Grofers in a matter of months and, not surprisingly, at peak valuations. Venture capital firms such as Nexus, though relegated to the sidelines of the battle between these two investors, didn’t have cause for complaint. Valuations were only headed north and as long as the money continued to flow in, they were happy to ride the wave. Their investee companies, among them Snapdeal, Flipkart and Ola, also rode the wave. Encouraged no doubt by their deep-pocketed investors, they threw caution to the wind and went on a spending spree to corner market share. Vanity metrics such as GMV (gross merchandise value) trumped boring ones such as unit economics. Then the music stopped. Some time during the last quarter of 2015, Tiger Global and a host of non-traditional start-up investors were compelled to scale back their investments. China had just devalued the yuan and global public markets were in turmoil. With the hot money gone, it didn’t take long for valuations to crash across the board. India’s start-up market, especially the consumer internet sector, slipped into a downturn that continues to this day. Layoffs, fire sales and investment write offs became commonplace. And suddenly, the premium valuations that investors such as SoftBank had paid during the good times became untenable. Things may not have turned as bad as they did for Snapdeal and Nexus, in particular, but for one surprise development in the middle of last year. Arora, who was tipped to succeed SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son as chief executive officer, suddenly quit. The reason for his somewhat unceremonious departure was that Son wanted to keep the CEO’s job for a few more years. Arora didn’t think it was worth his while to wait. His departure, however, almost immediately turned off the funding tap for SoftBank’s portfolio companies in India leading Nexus to its current predicament. Time to change track Nexus is no minnow in India’s venture capital market. It commands a portfolio of more than 75 companies and has raised $1.2 billion across four funds, making it the country’s second largest venture capital firm. It is also fairly popular with global limited partners (investors in venture capital funds). It latest fund, the $450 million Nexus Ventures IV, was raised in the midst of the ongoing downturn and is the biggest it has ever raised. Despite those credentials, however, the Snapdeal debacle may compel the venture capital firm to revisit how its wants to play the market, especially in India, in the years ahead. Founded over a decade ago by Naren Gupta, Sandeep Singhal and Suvir Sujan, Nexus has always been a bit different from other homegrown venture capital firms. It has one foot in the US and one in India and spreads its investments across the two markets. Gupta, a successful former technology entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, leads the firm’s overseas investments from Menlo Park in California. Singhal, who earlier co-founded Mumbai-based venture capital firm eVentures India, and Sujan, co-founder of online auctions platform Baazee, lead investments in India out of the firm’s Mumbai and Bengaluru offices. The dual market strategy has helped the firm to deliver exits from the portfolio relatively early in its history and, unlike many of its peers, fairly consistently year-on-year. It scored one of its earliest ones in 2011 when DimDim, a web conferencing services firm, was acquired by Salesforce.com for a reported $31 million. Other early exits from the portfolio include Cloud.com, acquired by Citrix for a reported $200-250 million, Gluster (acquired by Red Hat), Netmagic (acquired by NTT Docomo) and Astrid (acquired by Yahoo Inc). In all, the firm has exited 16-odd companies from the portfolio. But, there’s a catch. Ten of those exits, nearly all of them very profitable, are from investments in overseas companies, usually based in Silicon Valley. Many of those companies do have fairly extensive back-end operations in India but essentially constitute the firm’s overseas portfolio. On the other hand, the handful of exits it has been able to push through from its India portfolio are less remarkable. Among Nexus’s better known exits from the India portfolio are hotel aggregation platform MagicRooms, which was acquired by Yatra in 2011 for an undisclosed sum, classifieds platform OLX (it sold its stake to South African internet and media conglomerate Naspers), and the sale of its stake in Komli Media’s India business to SVG Media for an undisclosed sum. The consumer internet portfolio, in particular, has been a rough ride for the firm. In early 2015, Mumbai-based Housing, one of its earliest investments which also, incidentally, had SoftBank as co-investor, turned into a public spectacle when the company’s founder and CEO Rahul Yadav engaged in an ugly and very public spat with its investors. Yadav was ultimately ousted by the investors led by SoftBank and Housing was merged with rival PropTiger this year in an all stock transaction. The outcome of that investment now depends on how well PropTiger performs. Another early investment, budget stays aggregator Stayzilla, recently shuttered operations after it was unable to raise fresh capital and is now trying to pivot to a new business model. The firm has also had trouble with its investments in TinyOwl and Roadrunnr. About a year ago Mumbai-based food ordering service TinyOwl closed its operations and merged with Bengaluru based Roadrunnr, a hyperlocal delivery service, in an all stock transaction put together by the investors of the two firms. The merged entity was rebranded and relaunched as Runnr. Recent media reports suggest Runnr is now up for sale after being unable to raise fresh capital. A profitable Snapdeal exit would have helped the firm reverse that track record and establish its credentials as a bankable investor in India as much as one in the US. There is an outside chance that the firm may still be able to salvage its investment in Snapdeal. It isn’t clear yet whether the payout being offered by Softbank for its 10% stake includes a stake in Flipkart if the merger materializes. But, if that is not the case, it may be time for Nexus to rethink its future direction. Incidentally, last year, the firm upped investments in the US market. Seven out of the 12 deals it closed involved start-ups based there. It would not be surprising, and probably neither unwelcome to its limited partners, if the firm decided to shift strategy to being a largely US-focused investor while continuing to invest opportunistically in India.

The Chinese-based drone maker announced Wednesday a $499 drone called Spark, its smallest drone to date. The drone’s standout feature is that it can be controlled purely by gesture, detecting its user’s body movements such as raising and lowering hands or waving them. The drone then can interpret those gestures to follow commands such as flying up and down, or taking a picture. The Spark can even land in the palm of its user’s hand -- a seemingly impossible feature that competitors like Lily once promised -- and failed to deliver. (The drone startup Lily filed for bankruptcy and never shipped a drone to any of the over 61,000 people who pre-ordered one.) This is the first time that DJI has unveiled a product designed specifically for consumers, previously having left smaller drone-makers like Intel-funded INTC, +0.73%   Yuneec and French drone-maker Parrot PARRO, +0.66%  to make drones at those lower price points. Until Wednesday’s announcement of Spark, each drone announced by DJI had been released for at least $1,000. The company rose to popularity with its ready-to-fly Phantom drone, and also makes drones with high-quality cameras for professional filmmakers, as well as heavy-lifting drones designed for enterprise use. Some analysts believe that DJI, which has a valuation of $8 billion, has a market share as high as 85%. The Spark drone, which will be available in five colors including white, blue, green, red and yellow, has a battery life of 16 minutes with a camera supported by a two-axis gimbal. It can capture 1080p video and 12 megapixel still photos, and has onboard sensors that allow it to detect and avoid obstacles. Spark, which weighs 0.6 pounds, is next in a group of consumer drones getting smaller and more portable. Yuneec last year debuted a small $500 drone called the Breeze that could be controlled with a smartphone. GoPro’s GPRO, -1.04%  Karma drone was also designed to be portable. In November of 2016, DJI announced the DJI Mavic Pro, an $1,000 drone that -- though larger than Spark -- could be folded up to become the size of a soda can. Given the size, DJI expects that drones will be more accessible and used on a more regular basis. “The average consumer doesn’t know what they would do with a drone on a daily basis,” said DJI’s Director of Strategic Partnerships Michael Perry. “They want to know if it’s easy to fly, and when they are going to use it.” More from MarketWatch More Coverage Here’s how Trump wants to change the way you repay student loans Bitcoin’s rise: $1,000 invested in 2010 would be worth $35 million today The stock market should be more worried about the hard economic data Quote References INTC +0.26 +0.73% PARRO +0.07 +0.66% GPRO -0.09 -1.04% Most Popular The many failures of Elon Musk, captured in one giant infographic Three reasons to fear the coming crash in bitcoins The stock market should be more worried about the hard economic data Bitcoin is up over 400% in the past year—what’s stopping it from going mainstream?

O R Tambo to present Budget Vote 32 of the Department of Telecommunication and Postal Services, worth R1.6 billion. We salute this revolutionary who comes from the generation of leaders that rose above their oppressors, as illustrated by his 1989 message to the Soweto rally to welcome leaders; “This is a joyful day for all of us. It is a day of celebration for all the people of our country. Those who have chosen to turn their backs on our festivity are a small minority who continue to cling to the anti-human concept and practices of racial arrogance, white minority domination and super-exploitation of the masses of our people. Yet they, are part of our heritage. They are part of that history and continuing reality of our country which has meant the imprisonment of the best representatives of our people for a quarter of a century and more, murder of thousands…. and millions who have suffered from the daily violence inherent in the apartheid system.” Our key priorities for the year include measures to; expand ICT access through the broadband roll out, increase skills for internet utilisation, reduce the costs for data and devices, the corporatisation of the Postbank and the implementation of the National Integrated ICT White Paper to foster radical transformation in our sector. We are pursuing these priorities on the backdrop of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is fundamentally changing the way we live, conduct business and the how we interact with government. It offers potential great benefits for those who participate in it but widens the divide to the excluded. The ANC government is embracing this revolution as a platform to propel us to be globally competitive. It calls upon us to prepare the current and future workforce through skilling and reskilling. Some of the skills you need to survive this revolution include; cognitive skill such as mathematical reasoning and visualisation, comprehension and ICT literacy, manual dexterity and precision, critical thinking and listening, emotional intelligence and service orientation, judgment and systems analysis, complex problem solving, resource and time management, and technical skills such as equipment maintenance, operation, and repairs The key to these new skills is the learning of mathematics, science and coding for every school going child. State of our broadband Honourable House Chairperson, In 2016, despite the tough economic environment, total investments towards ICT increased by 18.8% to R28 billion. However, the focus of the industry was on general network improvements as well as fibre deployment in major urban areas. This improved our World Economic Forum (WEF) Network Readiness Index from 75th to 65th position in 2016. This index measures the country’s propensity to exploit opportunities offered by ICTs and their impact on its competitiveness. The ITU Development Index also improved slightly but constrained by low usage and poor ICT skills. The recent ICASA Report showed 3G coverage reaching 99% and the 4G rising to 75% of the population. However, not all those who are ‘covered’ have access to or are using the internet, as only 53,4% of South African households have access to the internet . The 10 districts with the least access to internet are; Alfred Nzo, Amatole, UKhahlamba, Sekhukhune, O.R. Tambo, UMzinyathi, Sisonke, Dr. Ruth Mompati, Chris Hani, Pixley ka Seme and Vhembe District Municipalities. The reasons for not having access to home or mobile internet includes: 38% lacks skills or confidence, 35% Lacks relevant content or the need for use, and 20.9% due to high costs. However, in the metropolitan areas, the high costs of data and equipment are the main concern. South African Internet for All Partnership Initiative Fellow South Africans, We need to connect 22 million people if we are meet our SA Connect and National Development Plan target of universal access to the internet by the end of 2020. The ANC Government maintains this enormous target because we know very well that the majority of the unconnected are those marginalised by  the apartheid system, including  women as well as people living in rural areas and underserviced municipalities. This task requires our collective effort. We are pleased that at recent WEF meeting in Durban, we adopted and announced Internet for All – South Africa Partnership initiative. We forged a partnership with WEF, business, civil society and donor agencies to advance priority areas. In June we will a national launch  of Internet for All to enable more stakeholders to commit on their respective actions. The initiative will rest on four pillars; infrastructure expansion, ICT skills development, Affordability, relevant content development including making internet content in our languages. Let me take this opportunity to thank Ms. Elsie Kanza from WEF and all the global and national partners who have joined us today and are seated at gallery. The government will provide the secretariat for support and coordination; business provide project management and WEF supervise and guide for success. The Internet for All global steering committee organisations have already committed to be core champions of this project. They include Telkom, MTN, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Intel Corporation, Boston Consulting Group, Digital Opportunity Trust, Cisco, DBSA, Neotel/ Liquid Telecom, African Development Bank, UK DFID and World Bank. In our preparatory meeting in Cape Town yesterday, more partners committed including Vodacom, Cell C, Google, Ericsson, Accenture, Altron, IDC, SOEs, ICT SMMEs, Research ICT Africa, Ndlovukazi online media and WEF Global Shapers. The meeting was also blessed with the presence of Inkosi Madikane II Diko of AmaBhaca ‘Tholelengwe!” Some of the commitments to date include; training millions of South Africans on digital skills, Research assistance,    Infrastructure deployment and funding, and Mobilisation of the participation of our youth Phase 1 Broadband Project Implementation Honourable Members, Last year we committed to commence the implementation of the first phase of South Africa Connect in eight pilot districts after following the open tender process by State Information Technology Agency (SITA). Unfortunately, there was no successful bidder among those who participated, resulting in its cancellation in November 2016. We have since decided to utilise our state entities such as SITA, BBI and SENTECH in line with their mandates to implement this critical project. In the current financial year, R416 million has been set aside to connect 2700 sites. House Chairperson, In the last financial year, Broadband Infraco (BBI) expanded its network to more than 14 900 km of fibre. It optimised 41 Points of Presence to enable third parties to access to its network. In this financial year, BBI will continue to aggregate state network services and lead in connecting sites in pilot districts. In advancing inclusive growth, BBI continues to connect Black-owned regional Internet Service Providers such as GALELA, UMZINYATHI and BRIGHTWAVE Technologies. SENTECH is one of our best managed entity with unqualified audits. However, its going concern is currently being threatened by the broadcasters that are experiencing funding challenges and defaulting on paying for SENTECH services. We appeal to broadcasters to make efforts to resolve this debt. SENTECH received a budget of R193 million for DTT dual illumination until next year where we hope digital migration may be completed. SITA provides the core private network of government. In addition, it has partnered with private sector and Western Cape government to roll out 1930 site in just two years. It is exploring a similar relationship with the Limpopo government. In this financial year, SITA will play a leading role in digitising and connecting sites in pilot districts. SAPO and Postbank Compatriots, The corporatisation and full licensing of the Postbank is on track as part of government effort to ensure financial inclusion in the underserved market. Some of the significant milestones towards compliance target by 03 July 2017 are; in July last year, SAPO obtained approval to establish a bank from the regulator In March 2017, the first Postbank Board was appointed after a rigorous fit and proper assessment. In April 2017, the South African Postbank SOC Ltd company was registered and incorporated with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC). Most of IT capabilities have already been implemented Key appointments in internal audit, regulatory and risk management positions have been made, and Now, our efforts are concentrated in resolving the structure of the Bank Controlling Company as well as the resolution of the legislative conflicts around the definition of a public company by aligning the Banks Act to the Companies Act. It is important to note that despite the challenges in SAPO, the Postbank division is well cushioned, managed and profitable, with its capital adequacy requirements in excess by R1.4 billion in the last financial year. In April 2016, SAPO was authorised to increase its long term borrowing to R3.7 billion in the domestic markets. This enabled SAPO to settle past debt, which was crippling its operations. The rest is being spent on revenue generation measures of the Strategic Turnaround Plan. SAPO is ready to assist SASSA to take over the payment of social grants as directed by the court. Policy implementation Honourable Members, In September 2016, the ANC Government approved the National Integrated ICT Policy White Paper to drive the NDP objectives of creating an inclusive information society and knowledge economy. Since then, we have been engaging the ICT industry stakeholders on how best to implement the policy. There is general agreement with the thrust of the policy and the need to implement it without delay. Most of the discussions focused on how best we implement Wireless Open Access Network (WOAN) and the allocation of and the return of the high demand Spectrum. I am pleased to announce that after the last consultation meeting on 19 May 2017 we agreed on the following approach; There may be no urgency to return the current high demand spectrum from licensees until the end of current licence period to ensure investment certainty  In return, the licensees committed to buy at least 30% of the existing capacity of WOAN to ensure its viability Given the current levels of investment on the 4G network, the Minister committed to conduct an urgent high level study to determine if WOAN will utilise all high demand spectrum for 4G network. If there will be remaining spectrum, it will be licenced to operators with rural coverage obligations. In such case the licensees further committed to buy at least 50% of WOAN capacity. It is important to realise that without WOAN, the new entrants particularly black entrepreneurs and SMMEs will find it impossible to enter this industry. In the next few months we intend to finalise the Implementation Plan. Fellow South Africans, Our work is made easy and enhanced by our councils and forums we have created. The Deputy Minister will expand on these as well as E-Skills Institute, National Cybersecurity Hub and Universal Service and Access Agency of South Africa (USAASA). Honourable Chairperson, We agree with the call from South Africans that “DATA PRICES MUST FALL.” According to 2017 StatSA Report, the ICTs contributes 3.0% to the GDP and constituted 4.6% of household expenditure. In 2016, I issued a policy directive to ICASA to prioritise the commencement and conclusion of an inquiry and the prescription of regulations to ensure effective competition in broadband markets.  We are still awaiting concrete interventions from ICASA. The response from the regulator suggests they will finalise this work in the next 2-3 years. The speed of intervention is critical in a rapidly evolving sector such as ICT.  The ICASA’s State of ICT Report seem to suggest lack of competition, particularly by dominant players. The report indicates that data traffic increased by 55%, data revenue increased from R30 to R38 billion, the employment decreased by 4000, yet prices remain sticky at same level. In our view, this may need the attention of the Competition Commission. We appeal to operators start competition in services to ensure the cost data and call fall to affordable levels or below 2% of average household income. International engagements House Chairperson, Our international work is advancing our national development goals in the International Telecommunication Union, Universal Postal Union, United Nations, African Union and the Internet Governance Forum. Earlier this month, South Africa joined the Smart Africa Alliance. This is an initiative that aims to transform Africa into a single digital market, through harmonising policy, legal, regulatory and investment codes in the continent, generating more demand and establishing more favourable market conditions. Ultimately the intension is to enhance African economy, attract large scale investment, build new industries and create jobs. It supports digital government through IoT such as smart cities, agriculture, water, sanitation energy etc. South Africa will champion the skills development programme and localisation, to stimulate demand of locally produced electronics for the African market. In Conclusion With our modest budget and through strategic partnerships, we are on track to meet our ambitious target of ensuring that all South Africans have access to and are utilising internet for their development. We are taking bold and practical steps to move towards inclusive growth in the ICT sector and prepare our nation to reap the benefits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, while minimising digital divide and unemployment. Let me thank our ICT industry for continuing to invest in the South African economy. I am indebted to all those who are optimistic about our country, and are partnering with us in to connect 22 million South Africans in the next two and a half years. I am grateful to all the workers that make our sector tick. I thank the boards of our State-Owned Companies and their managers for always striving to meet their developmental mandates. I   thank our new Director General, Mr. Robert Nkuna and Team DTPS for improving the performance and governance. I thank the Chairpersons of Parliamentary Committees and members of the committees for keeping us on our toes to improve delivery. I thank my family and friends for their unflinching support. Lastly, allow me to thank our President, Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues and the African National Congress for their guidance in ensuring we take our country forward for the benefit of all our people. I thank you all.     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on May 25, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: May 25, 2017 @ 5:09 am Filed Under: Africa, Banking and Finance, Energy, English, Internet Communications Technology, MIL OSI, Open Source Intel, Republic of South Africa, Republic of South Africa Government, Security NEXT ARTICLE → Minister Enver Surty: Basic Education Dept Budget Vote 2017/18 ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE Minister Mildred Oliphant: Labour Dept Budget Vote 2017/18 About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts UN Secretary-General’s Message on Africa Day Minister Mildred Oliphant: Labour Dept Budget Vote 2017/18 Deputy Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams: Telecommunications & Postal Services Dept Budget Vote 2017/18 Minister Siyabonga Cwele: Telecommunications and Postal Services Dept Budget 2017/18 Minister Enver Surty: Basic Education Dept Budget Vote 2017/18 © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

The Surface Pro is exactly what Microsoft needs to boost sinking Surface sales Todd Haselton CNBC May 23, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share The Surface Pro is exactly what Microsoft needs to boost sinking Surface salesMore Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced its brand new Surface Pro laptop/tablet hybrid during a press conference in Shanghai on Tuesday. I had a chance to see the new Surface Pro in a meeting with Microsoft, and I think there's enough here to help the company boost its sinking Surface sales. A complete redesign, but a familiar look The new model has no number attached to it. Although it follows the Surface Pro 4, which was released in October 2015, it's just called "Surface Pro," rather than "Surface Pro 5." This suggests Microsoft is moving into a more regular cadence with the products, updating them regularly as Apple has done with its MacBook and iPad lines for some years now. It may also be trying to avoid confusion, as it now has several different products with the "Surface" brand attached to them, including two other laptops and a desktop. The new Surface Pro is a much more powerful machine with longer battery life -- Microsoft told me it should last up to 13.5 hours, or 50 percent more than the Surface Pro 4 -- and new features. It's equipped with Intel's latest seventh-generation Core processors, which offer more power and better battery life. These chips are not yet in Apple's MacBook or MacBook Pro, which are expected to get refreshed next month. That's a feather in Microsoft's cap. Unless you're buying the high-end model, you also won't find any fans, which means the machines are extremely quiet. Plenty of new features The kickstand, which sits flush with the device when not in use, now tilts down to a 165-degree angle, allowing the machine to be propped up on a desk for drawing with the Surface Pen. You can also use Microsoft's Surface Dial, first introduced with the Surface Studio desktop last year, which can be placed on the screen and used for anything from flipping through PowerPoint to zooming around 3D Maps and editing in Adobe Photoshop. The $99 Surface Pen, which is still bizarrely not included with the Surface Pro, is a must-have accessory. Microsoft doubled the levels of pressure supported by the device, which means you can draw and write more accurately, with penmanship that better reflects your handwriting. Users will also find much more accurate tilting and shading, allowing the pen to function like a real pencil in some applications. Unlike Apple, Microsoft kept a full-sized USB port on the side of the Surface Pro, which I appreciate. While I understand USB-C is the future, most people still own plenty of standard-sized USB gadgets, which means plugging in a keyboard or mouse will work without the need for an adapter. Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 keyboard was the first in the Surface series I could type on for extended periods of time. The new keyboard builds on that one with increased key travel for a more comfortable experience, though I did notice the keypad still has a bit of flex on it when I typed with force. The whole Surface Pro package is extremely familiar, despite these changes, which is a good strategy for Microsoft. I think people really enjoyed its previous Surface Pro 4 laptop, and believe sales slowed because consumers wanted something newer. A whole Surface family There's going to be some cannibalism going on within Microsoft's Surface family, however. When the firm introduced the Surface Pro 4, it didn't offer any other "Surface-branded" products. Now it has several, including the Surface Book, a high-end hybrid that competes most directly with Apple's MacBook Pro; the Surface Laptop, a lower-end laptop whose screen cannot be removed to use like a tablet; and the Surface Studio desktop. But I think most people should buy the Surface Pro. The Surface Laptop is targeted at the education sector and features a hobbled version of Windows 10 that will need to be upgraded by most users. The Surface Book is a fantastic machine and can be configured with a dedicated graphics chip for folks who need to edit videos or to play some light games. But it starts at $1499 -- almost double the price of the entry-level Surface Pro. Overall, the Surface Pro is the most versatile of the bunch and offers the best balance between price, portability and features. It's available for pre-order today starting at $799 (though the model we recommend you buy will set you back more than $1,500), and will start shipping on June 15.

Heading up Tuesday’s options activity, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) call options remained popular even as the shares continued to see fallout from confirmation that the company is not partnering up with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Elsewhere, Lowe’s stock slipped on poor April new home sales and is down sharply this morning as first-quarter earnings missed expectations. Finally, United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) surged ahead of a Commerce Department hearing that could weigh in on steel import prices. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Last week, AMD stock surged on reports that the company was partnering up with Intel to offer its graphics chips in future hardware pairings. The news had little to stand on, as AMD failed to comment in the following days. Then on Monday, AMD CEO Lisa Su put the nail in the coffin by stating at a J.P. Morgan conference that “We’re not looking at enabling a competitor to compete against our products.” AMD stock is down more than 17% since rumors of the tie up first began to dissipate, but options traders remain overwhelmingly positive on the shares prospects. On Tuesday, AMD saw volume top 208,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 74% of the day’s take. What’s more, the June put/call open interest ratio has dipped in recent days, falling to 0.84 from a reading north of 0.90 early last week. While AMD stock has struggled during the past month, the shares appear to be holding firm in the $11 region, giving investors hope of a rebound. In fact, peak June call OI totals more than 30,000 contracts at the overhead $12 strike, hinting that options traders, too, are looking for AMD to push higher in short order.

(AAPL) With Apple Pay Lawsuit Recent Posts: 10 High-Tech Graduation Gifts for 2017 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Takes on Apple With New Surface Pro Trouble Looms for Apple Inc. (AAPL) With Apple Pay Lawsuit View All Posts Yesterday, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) took the wraps off the new Surface Pro, the latest incarnation of its professional tablet that converts to a laptop. The new Surface Pro — it’s not called the Surface Pro 5 — gets the latest CPUs from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), a huge boost in battery life, new Type Covers, an improved Surface Pen and a $799 starting price. Source: Microsoft After the recent Surface Laptop reveal, it’s clear that MSFT has Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its sights. The battle for consumers and prosumers starts on June 15 when both the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop launch, worldwide. MSFT Announces New Surface Pro Microsoft’s Surface business was in the news in a bad way after the company’s last quarterly earnings report in April. Surface revenue for that quarter had dropped 26% to its lowest level in over a year. The Surface Pro 4 was a 2015 vintage device (as was the student-aimed Surface 3) and the Surface Studio — while an exciting and widely admired all-in-one PC — was an expensive niche product. The Surface Book was too expensive for mass market adoption. Questions were beginning to be asked about MSFT’s commitment to PC hardware. Adding fuel to that fire, Microsoft’s Surface chief went on record with Business Insider several weeks ago to say “there’s no such thing as a Surface Pro 5.” Turns out he was being literal. Yesterday, Microsoft took the wraps off of what would have been the Surface Pro 5, but is now simply called Surface Pro. Surface Pro Key Specs 12.3-inch PixelSense display 7th generation Intel Core “Kaby Lake” m3, Core i5 or Core i7 CPU 4GB, 8GB, 16GB RAM SSD option ranging from 128GB to 1TB Battery rated at 13.5-hours video playback 1.69lbs Core m3, 1.73lbs for Core i5, Core i7 Optional LTE Optional Surface Type Cover, Surface Pen, Surface Mouse Starts at $799 ($719 for students) Fighting Back Against the iPad Pro Microsoft clearly took the time to make sure its new Surface Pro addresses key areas where Apple’s iPad Pro has had the advantage. Although the new Surface Pro looks nearly identical other than slightly rounded edges, the company told The Verge that it contains around “800 new custom parts.” Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2017/05/microsoft-corporation-msft-new-surface-pro/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 10 Stocks That May Crash 20%+ 3 Stocks to Buy for a Breakout in 2017 7 Fund Picks for High-Energy Returns 3 Dividend Stocks to Buy for 12 Months of Retirement Income 3 ETFs for Scorching Small-Cap Gains 10 High-Tech Graduation Gifts for 2017 ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Editor's Picks 10 Hot Stocks That Could Crash 20% or More 3 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for a 2017 Breakout 3 Dividend Stocks to Buy for 12 Months of Retirement Income 4 Reasons Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a Terrible Short The 3 Biggest Risks Facing Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Most Popular The 7 Best “Comeback” Stocks to Buy for a Huge Second Half 7 S&P 500 Stocks That Will Drop by Double Digits 10 Best Mutual Funds for Retirement 3 Big Bank Stocks That Are Printing Money 3 Dirt-Cheap Index Funds to Buy Now 5 Dow Jones Stocks to Sell Now As the Trump Trade Fades Poll of the Day View and vote in our How confident are you about the U.S. economy under President Donald Trump? poll Partners ADVERTISEMENT About Us   ·   Press Center   ·   Resources   ·   Advisory Services   ·   Free Newsletters   ·   Free Reports   ·   Contact Us   ·   Advertise With Us   ·   Employment   ·   Privacy   ·   Terms and Conditions   ·   Disclosures and Disclaimers   ·   Media Sites RSS   ·   Sitemap More On InvestorPlace: Choose A Page About Us Press Center Resources Advisory Services Free Newsletters Free Reports Contact Us Advertise With Us Employment Privacy Terms and Conditions Disclosures and Disclaimers Media Sites Sitemap Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services, Inc.

The suspects were taken into custody early Wednesday morning (May 24)  in South Manchester as disclosed by the Greater Manchester Police. READ: Explosion Causes Fatalities At Ariana Grande Concert In Manchester On Tuesday (May 23), 22 year-old, Salman Abedi was named in connection to the attack. Abedi acted as a suicide bomber, killing himself at the scene, along with 22 others and injuring more than fifty people. Among the fatalities identified are Saffie Rose Roussos (8), Olivia Campbell (15), Bethany Callander (18), and Lisa Lees (43). While the police were investigating whether this was a group effort, ISIS came forward Tuesday (May 23) morning to confirm their involvement in the concert travesty. #ISIS releases English-language version of claim for #Manchester bombing pic.twitter.com/j8n6lHt1eQ — SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) May 23, 2017 U.K.’s Prime Minister Theresa May raised the country’s threat level to the highest of five levels, critical, indicating that another attack may be imminent. READ: 23-Year-Old Man Arrested In Connection With Manchester Arena Bombing In response, the police warns the public to expect to “see more armed officers” monitoring the streets. The Metropolitan Police Service released a statement which confirmed armed officers will be “working alongside their neighborhood and specialist colleagues on proactive operations and targeted patrols, both on foot and in vehicles.” To avoid the potential threat of predictability, the agency asserted that they’d rotate the number of officers, their posts and tactics. Metropolitan Police Service Commander Jane Connors explained that in order to deal with combatants  they aren’t afraid to use force. Even though it seems Manchester is gathering all their resources to protect their nation, there’s one thing they’re not too happy about. The Guardian reports that the country is incensed with the fact that U.S. officials were identified as the sources naming Salman Abedi as the suspected suicide bomber. In a tweet sent out Monday (May 22) evening, an ABC network news correspondent accredited a “U.S. senior law enforcement official” as their source to identifying a suicide bomber, while Reuters published the name of the bomber mentioning three U.S. officials as their source. READ: ISIS Takes Responsibility For Manchester Bombing As Parents Search For Missing Concertgoers Thomas Sanderson, The Director of the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, explained how irritated British nation was. “Suddenly you’ve got 10,000 reporters descending on the bomber’s house when maybe the police wanted to approach it more subtly,” he said. Sanderson continues to outline the threatening nature of the Trump administration’s hastiness to release sensitive information. “The UK and Israel are probably our two biggest sources of intelligence. Now they’re thinking, ‘Is this going to cause us damage every time we share?’ Then you have to calculate every piece of information.” The leak related to the suicide bomber comes after accusations the current administration revealed classified information, which apparently was from Israel, to the Russian foreign minister during a White House meeting. Recently, the administration’s speedy tittle-tattle manner in handling delicate information has stirred up confusion and banter on social media. “Mr. President we found 3 staffers who leaked classified info. Should we fire them immediately?” Trump: No. Let’s leak that we found them https://t.co/GYvmsFN5ML — Haley Byrd (@byrdinator) May 22, 2017 Who leaked the info to Lester Holt that Trump made the decision to fire Comey?

The Redmond, Washington-based company introduced the fifth version of the Surface Pro at an event in Shanghai, the first time it’s held the launch of a major product outside the US. Microsoft also announced a version of Windows 10 for use by the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises, ending a standoff over the operating system by meeting the government’s requests for increased security and data control. Surface Pro is the workhorse of the company’s computer hardware line. It’s the biggest seller among the Surface devices, a category that Microsoft created -- the two-in-one, or a tablet with a removable keyboard. Yet Microsoft’s Pro 3 and 4 are aging, and partners like Lenovo Group Ltd. and HP, Inc. have come out with their own Windows-based versions, that give Microsoft software revenue but take away hardware sales. Meanwhile Apple’s take on the category, the iPad Pro, has been stealing market share. Those factors contributed to a 26% drop in Surface sales last quarter. The new version should turn that around, said Yusuf Mehdi, who oversees marketing for devices and Windows. The device has 13.5 hours of battery life, a 50% improvement over the previous version, and runs Intel Corp.’s faster seventh generation Core chips. “We have shown it to corporate accounts already and the reaction has been very positive,” he said. “We are optimistic this will get a good start out of the gate.” The Pro will be available for pre-orders Tuesday starting at $799 and goes on sale June 15, the same day as the Surface Laptop Microsoft announced earlier this month. The device has a new kickstand that lets it fold almost flat to resemble a drafting table, similar to the pricier Surface Studio computer, and the Pro can now be controlled on screen by the Surface Dial device that Microsoft introduced with the Studio. CUSTOM WINDOWS Microsoft also announced customers for the Chinese government version of Windows 10, including the Chinese customs agency and the city government of Shanghai. This version of Windows 10 lets the government use its own encryption on its computers. A joint venture in China manages all the system updates and telemetry so no data leaves China, Terry Myerson, Microsoft’s Windows and Devices chief, said in an interview. The government can also remove features it doesn’t want like the OneDrive file-sharing service, or certain entertainment apps. The software is available only for government use and won’t be sold to any other Chinese customers, Microsoft said. Operating in China has been something of a minefield for US technology companies. Some are blocked, Microsoft is facing an anti-monopoly investigation and in January a law took effect that requires telecommunications and Internet companies operating in China to provide law enforcement with technical assistance, including decryption of sensitive user data, in any probe meant “to avert and investigate terrorist activities.” Myerson said the custom version of Windows fully complies with the company’s values. “We are aware this could be perceived as a sensitive issue but it’s quite appropriate for a sovereign country, within its own computer system and its own employees to have its own encryption systems,” Myerson said. LONG NEGOTIATIONS The product is the result of two years of work by the company and the Chinese government to resolve an impasse in which the government, citing security concerns, has refused to use either Windows 8 or Windows 10, blocking a key source of Chinese revenue for Microsoft. Microsoft also announced that it’s bringing its full lineup of Surface hardware to the Chinese market. Currently, it only sells the Pro models and the Surface Book laptop in the country. The company will also show a new Office app that lets a team of users create a digital whiteboard that they can all draw on simultaneously on different machines. -- Bloomberg E-mail | Print |     From / email :     To :     E-mail (required) :     Message :     Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.    MORE STORIES Microsoft unveils new Surface Pro to reverse declining sales Review: "Review: Samsung Galaxy S8+" Google AI beats master in ancient game of Go Market for pet wearables growing in China Vivo V5s: a slight improvement from Vivo's best-selling flagship model Apple plans laptop upgrades as Microsoft enters market HPE unveils computer made for era of Big Data’ Snapchat encourages UK millennials to vote WannaCry ransomware attack eases, hacking group threatens to sell code Eleven-year-old stuns experts showing toys can be ‘weapons’    MOST READ    MOST E-MAILED 1.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Microsoft Corporation's Unfair Apple Inc. iPad Call-Out Apple's iPad Pro and Microsoft's Surface Pro may seem like similar devices that can be compared directly, but this Fool argues that that isn't the case. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 24, 2017 at 9:15AM Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently announced an updated version of its Surface Pro line of tablet/notebook computer hybrids. Among other improvements, the new tablet line includes Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) seventh-generation Core processors, which offer significant performance and power efficiency improvements over the sixth-generation Core chips found in the previous Surface Pro 4 tablets. Microsoft also couldn't help comparing the performance of the new Surface Pro with Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL), claiming that it offers "1.7 times the compute of iPad Pro." Microsoft also said that the new Surface Pro delivers "35% more battery life than an iPad Pro." Image source: Apple. Of course Microsoft is proud of its new device -- and it should be, as it looks like a solid product -- but here's why this comparison isn't fair. A new iPad Pro is coming soon The reality is that Microsoft's new Surface Pro isn't going to be competing with Apple's current 9.7-inch iPad Pro for most of its life in the marketplace. Instead, it will have to compete against the upcoming 10.5-inch iPad Pro that's expected to launch at Apple's upcoming World Wide Developers Conference next month. The new iPad should include an all-new applications processor, which may be called the A10X Fusion, that delivers a substantial uplift in both computing and graphics performance over the A9X chip found in the current 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models. That uplift should be driven by both significant chip design advancements as well as a transition to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) new 10nm chip manufacturing technology, which should help boost efficiency and allow Apple to cram in more features and functionality than it would have otherwise been able to. I suspect that the computing performance of the new Surface Pro will look a lot less impressive next to the upcoming new iPad Pro than it does against the current, aging iPad Pro models. Not entirely comparable products Although both the Surface Pro and the iPad Pro are tablets and both are pitched toward "professional" use cases, the reality is that they are different devices. The iPad Pro tablets are still very much rooted in Apple's consumer tablet heritage, but they are endowed with "pro-friendly" features such as Apple Pencil support. These devices are thin and light, they're fanless, and they're designed to be used first and foremost as touchscreen devices. The Surface Pro lineup, on the other hand, has its heritage rooted in the traditional notebook personal computer. The device runs full-fat Windows 10, has full Intel Core i-series processors, and is, arguably, at its best when it's being used with traditional keyboard and mouse (or, in this case, trackpad) input. Yes, it has a touchscreen, and yes, it supports pen input -- and Microsoft does seem to put a lot of work into improving the pen experience with each generation. But if someone who's used to the iPad paradigm tried to use the Surface Pro like an iPad, he or she would probably have a negative experience. So a product like the Surface Pro and the iPad Pro shouldn't be compared on individual metrics such as battery life, performance, and so on. The real comparison from a consumer-facing perspective is ultimately one of usage model. Do consumers want tablet-first products that can also do double duty as so-called "pro" devices? Or do they want full-fat laptops that can handle traditional productivity software suites that can do double duty as a tablet and touchscreen device? That's a question that'll ultimately be answered in the years ahead.  Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The deal, which values ItzCash at $150 million, comes as digital payments gain traction in India after the government late last year scrapped old high-value currency notes and started promoting non-cash payment modes. Japan's SoftBank last week invested $1.4 billion in the parent of India's Paytm, which along with MobiKwik competes with ItzCash in the digital wallets business. ItzCash also offers remittance services, point-of-sale machines and allows customers to use cash to facilitate digital transactions at retail outlets. Ebix will acquire an 80 percent stake in ItzCash. ItzCash's existing investors - Matrix Partners, Lightspeed Venture and Intel Capital - will exit the company, ItzCash Chief Growth Officer Bhavik Vasa told Reuters. The remaining 20 percent stake in ItzCash will be held by the company's backers, India's Essel Group. Of the $120 million, Ebix has paid $76 million upfront, with the rest payable over three years. "Other than payments and money transfers, we will deepen our strength in providing insurance, investment products and loans to consumers and businesses," Vasa said. "These are the growth areas." ItzCash will look at replicating its model in other emerging markets, as well as tap Ebix's distribution channels to explore markets such as Australia and Brazil, it said in a statement. Paytm says it has more than 220 million clients using its e-wallet. ItzCash does not disclose a separate number for its e-wallets users, but says it has more than 75 million accounts overall. Digital payments are seen as a growing opportunity in India as smartphone and Internet use rises, even though millions of people, especially in rural areas, lack access to such services. Private players such as Paytm and ItzCash also face major competition from state-backed digital tools, which are luring users with facilities such as inter-bank transfers and payment services that can be used with a fingerprint.

Swaraj Singh Dhanjal ItzCash MD Naveen Surya said the payments firm already has a tie-up to sell insurance policies with two life insurance and two general insurance companies. Photo: Mint Mumbai: Ebix Inc., an international supplier of on-demand software and e-commerce services to the insurance and financial services industry, has acquired a majority stake in payments services firm ItzCash for Rs800 crore (approximately $124 million) from Essel Group and other shareholders. Ebix acquired an 80% stake in the company through a combination of primary and secondary share purchase. The transaction provided an exit to ItzCash’s existing venture capital shareholders Matrix Partners, Intel Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners. ItzCash, which provides services such as prepaid cards, bill payments and remittance, serves almost 75 million consumers and 1,500 plus companies on its integrated payments solutions infrastructure. The company processes 6,00,000 transactions per day. In financial year 2016-17, it processed payments worth Rs14,000 crore through its network. Ebix is present in more than 40 countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, New Zealand, Singapore, the US and UK. It powers multiple platforms across the world in the field of life, annuity, health, and property and casualty insurance, processing over $100 billion in insurance premiums annually. “With the youngest tech-savvy society, the largest middle class, a 1.3 billion population, a country committed to going digital and a growth rate of 7% plus, India is an emerging economic superpower today. We are big believers in the power of exchanges and thus have been keen to take an early position in India in terms of powering financial and insurance exchanges,” said Robin Raina, chairman and chief executive of Ebix. Founded in 2006, ItzCash, which started with digital payments, has over the years expanded into areas such as remittances, financial services, corporate solutions, point of sale (PoS) terminals and payment gateway. With the investment by Ebix, the company is looking to enter new businesses. “Having established our leadership across payments, remittances and corporate solutions already, we will deepen our foray in areas of credit, insurance, healthcare and investments. We will continue to invest in our distribution network and technology, providing a fully integrated financial exchange,” said Naveen Surya, managing director of ItzCash. The company has partnerships with Visa, RuPay, and MasterCard and banks such as HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and RBL Bank. It works closely with corporates such as Amway, DishTV, Flipkart, BookMyShow, Uber, OYO Rooms, IRCTC, Satin Creditcare Network and others. ItzCash already has a tie-up to sell insurance policies with two life insurance and two general insurance companies, he said, adding that more partnerships will be added. “Traditionally, we were always helping them collect payments, but now we are also helping them sell policies. Similarly on the credit side, we have relationships with tech-enabled lending businesses, and those too will be expanded rapidly,” said Surya. Other businesses such as PoS terminals and remittances will also see expansion. The company could also look at acquiring businesses to grow, he added. Surya said both parties would gain from this investment. “In Indian market, Ebix gets an extended financial services plus a payments play, while we get their support on technology. Also, for our payments and other services, the global markets have opened up,” he said.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Highlights of Trump’s cyber budget By Tim Starks 05/24/2017 10:00 AM EDT With help from Eric Geller, Martin Matishak, Bryan Bender and Nancy Scola THE CYBER BUDGET — There were plenty of cuts in President Donald Trump’s inaugural full budget request, but if he gets his way from Congress on a fiscal 2018 plan, a number of cyber programs will get a boost, as the whole team wrote for Pros. The Homeland Security Department’s cyber wing would get an increase. U.S. Cyber Command would, too. And there are pockets of funding throughout set aside for modernizing government computer systems, combating the challenges encryption poses to law enforcement and more. Here are a couple nuggets we left out of our story: Story Continued Below State Department: The budget request for State devotes $200 million to heading off breaches from malicious cyberattackers. It also earmarks $5 million for programs that “will help protect U.S. citizens and U.S. businesses from organized crime by strengthening national legal regimes to enable them to combat theft of intellectual property as well as cybercrime and related IT-enabled crimes.” DHS: The Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program — which help agencies fortify their cyber defenses — would see its funding leap significantly to $279 million, while DHS’s other major program to secure federal networks, the intrusion detection system Einstein, would go backward to $397 million. The reason is because Einstein’s current phase “is fully purchased and almost fully deployed, so we are now more in sustainment mode with that program,” said Chip Fulghum, the acting undersecretary for management. By comparison, Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation is still in the acquisition phase, Fulghum said. IT: There’s a full-throated vote of confidence in the budget proposal for the Modernizing Government Technology Act (H.R. 2227), the Rep. Will Hurd-championed bill that passed the House last week. That legislation would create a GSA-managed fund from which federal agencies could borrow to pay for upgrading "legacy" (polite talk for, "holy heck, that's thing's old and held together with duct tape and positive thinking") IT systems. It assigns $228 million to fill the fund, and optimistically describes the MGT Act as "moving in parallel" with the president's budget plan. Hurd told our friends at Morning Tech in a statement that he's "grateful for the widespread recognition" the United States needs its technology to be of this century. "But like all president’s budgets, there are still many steps to go before this funding becomes a reality," the Texas Republican said. For one thing, all White House budgets are aspirational. For another thing, some on the Senate side are still balking at MGT, in part over worries the standalone agency capital funds it would also create can get out of hand. Adds Hurd, "I am cautiously optimistic that Congress will continue to prioritize the safety and security of our digital information and infrastructure, and am committed to championing the initiative throughout the budget and appropriations process.” HAPPY WEDNESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

WOMEN RULE PODCAST: Fran Townsend, the former homeland security adviser for President George W. Bush, confirms that the Trump administration has approached her about replacing ousted FBI Director James Comey. In this week's must-listen episode, we hear directly from Townsend about being thrust into the middle of the controversial job search and how her candidacy for the job is “history-making.” Townsend joins two other prominent women from the Bush White House — Candi Wolff, assistant for legislative affairs, and Julie Cram, deputy assistant and director of the public liaison office — to reflect on their stints in the executive branch and offer advice for the current Republican administration.

Among them: Former CIA Director John Brennan exacerbated Trump’s woes by saying he worried about contacts he’d seen between Moscow and the Trump campaign, but gave Republicans some of what they wanted to hear by talking about cracking down on leakers. In other developments related to the Russia investigation, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said it would be inappropriate to publicly tell the Senate Armed Services Committee about the truth of news reports that the president asked him to state there was no evidence of Trump’s campaign colluding with Moscow. He did say, however, that it would be appropriate to speak to Senate Intel. Sen. Marco Rubio said Trump’s problems would get worse if he did indeed ask Coats and NSA boss Adm. Mike Rogers to back him up. In the meantime, the government's various probes are picking up, as a Justice Department official said the new special prosecutor’s office was “up and running,” while Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr said he was examining new ways to compel former national security adviser Michael Flynn to comply with a subpoena. COATS GOES DARK ON 702 — Coats predicted a dark future if Congress allows key surveillance programs to expire at the end of the year. Asked during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday if “it would be fair to say” there would “disastrous consequences” if lawmakers failed to renew the digital snooping efforts in Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Coats grimly agreed. “I believe it would, and I think a lot of Americans would die unnecessarily,” he said. Section 702 programs scoop up the internet chatter of foreign targets, but also collects the communications on an unknown amount of Americans, worrying privacy advocates who are trying to revise the provision when it is up for reauthorization at the end of the year. Coats’ dire prediction comes as the intelligence community looks to brief lawmakers on the snooping programs to “describe exactly what is done … and make sure the public itself is fully aware of the importance of the program, but also the privacy protections that have been put upon it and the oversight,” the intel chief told lawmakers. IDEAS FOR A STRONGER CYBER ALLIANCE — The military alliance NATO should work more closely with its cyber center of excellence in Estonia to develop digital defense policies, the head of U.S. Cyber Command said Tuesday. “Under the NATO framework, the center represents the positions of the members of the alliance that participate in the center,” said Rogers at a hearing of the House Armed Services emerging threats subcommittee. “I’d like to see if we can somehow more formally tie the center to NATO’s policy development. I think that could really accelerate some things.” Currently, the NATO-accredited center serves as an independent cyber research, policy development and training organization. Rogers said he and the head of U.S. European Command were exploring the idea of detailing a U.S. government representative to the NATO center “to more directly link with” its operations. “I’d also like to see what could we potentially do within the exercise framework that the alliance is starting to create in cyber now,” Rogers told lawmakers. “I’ve already extended invitations to them to observe and participate in our exercise framework, but I’d like to do the same thing, if I could, in the NATO arena.” He also said he wanted to explore building a cyber information sharing relationship with NATO as a whole, rather than maintaining duplicative channels with individual members. CYBER WARFARE BILL COMING — At the same hearing, Rep. Elise Stefanik, who chaired the House Armed Services emerging threats subcommittee gathering, announced plans to introduce cyber warfare legislation. The proposed bill — which Stefanik is working on with Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry and ranking member Adam Smith, as well as Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus Co-Chair Jim Langevin — would boost congressional oversight of “sensitive military cyber operations, including mandating prompt notifications to Congress in the event of unauthorized disclosures,” the New York Republican said during her opening statement. Stefanik vowed to work with Cyber Command and the Pentagon as lawmakers finalize the draft legislation “to ensure such notifications are responsive to our needs, but without adding undue reporting burdens on the Department of Defense.” WHITE HOUSE WANTS CONGRESS TO BACK ‘URGENT’ BRIT DATA-SHARING DEAL — The Trump administration is pushing hard for a first-of-its-kind data-sharing agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom that would permit their law enforcement agencies to more swiftly access the data of one of their citizens held on computer servers located in the other country. Tom Bossert, Trump’s homeland security adviser, told POLITICO the so-called U.S.-U.K. Sharing Agreement is “landmark in recognizing the 21st century digital landscape we are facing.” The proposed agreement is expected to be the subject of a Senate Judiciary Committee subcommittee hearing today that will include testimony from the deputy assistant attorney general, the U.K.’s deputy national security adviser, and Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer. “This authority includes a requirement that a foreign order not target any U.S. person,” Bossert told POLITICO. “It is meant to allow legal process on U.S. and British companies holding data associated with serious crimes and terrorism.” The proposal has bipartisan support on the Judiciary panel — including Sens. Lindsey Graham and Sheldon Whitehouse — but does not yet enjoy the level of appeal its backers are hoping for. “In order to accomplish this urgent requirement, it will require Congress taking the necessary legislative steps to allow it to happen,” Bossert said. "While we are starting with our closest ally, the framework may allow future expansion to other like-minded countries.” PAYING THE PRICE — Target on Tuesday reached an $18.5 million settlement with 47 states and the District of Columbia stemming from its massive 2013 data breach. In addition to the financial penalty, which will be distributed to the participating state attorneys general, Target promised to adopt a “comprehensive” cybersecurity program that is “reasonably designed to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality” of customer data. The company also vowed to hire “an executive or officer” with “appropriate” cyber experience to lead the program. The settlement for the 2013 breach — which affected more than 41 million customer accounts — is the largest multi-state data breach settlement in U.S. history. TWEET OF THE DAY — Amen. RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY — Top House Homeland Security Democrats want answers from the White House about whether it plans to launch an investigation of DHS’s main information sharing program as a ruse to distract from damaging news reports. … Rogers, the NSA chief, warned senators against legislation letting companies “hack back” against their attackers. … Coats, the spy chief, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that spy agencies could not yet confirm that North Korean hackers were behind the recent global ransomware campaign. … The EU cyber agency teamed with a group of tech companies to call for mandatory security rules for internet-connected devices.

Microsoft said the new Surface Pro delivers up to 13.5 hours of battery life on a single charge, a 50 percent increase over the Surface Pro 4 and 35 percent more battery life than the iPad Pro's advertised 10 hours. The notebook-tablet hybrid features Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors, including Core m3, i5, and i7 chips depending on the model. Microsoft says the high-end Surface Pro with a Core i7 processor is 2.5× faster than the Surface Pro 3 and 1.7× faster than the iPad Pro with Apple's own A9X chip. Surface Pro m3 and i5 models feature a new fanless cooling system, while the i7 model still has a fan with "improved hybrid cooling." The new Surface Pro has a refined design with cleaner lines and curved edges, a "visually softer" camera, and an improved hinge with a 165º range of motion allows it to be placed in Studio Mode like its Surface Studio desktop. It's also the lightest Surface Pro ever, starting at 1.7 lbs. By comparison, the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro weigh 0.96 lbs and 1.57 lbs respectively. The new Surface Pro continues to have a 12.3-inch display with 267 pixels per inch, compared to 264 PPI for both the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Microsoft says its custom PixelSense technology means that colors on the new Surface Pro will be "more vibrant, precise, and impactful than ever before." Other tech specs include up to a 1TB SSD, up to 16GB RAM, up to Intel Iris Plus 640 graphics, a USB 3.0 port, a microSD card reader, Mini DisplayPort, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The device runs Windows 10 Pro. The new Surface Pro is accompanied by a new Surface Pen with over 4096 pressure points, only 21 milliseconds of latency, and new tilt functionality. Microsoft says the new Surface Pen is over two times more accurate, with four times more pressure sensitivity, than the original Surface Pen. There's also new Signature Type Covers, now designed with Alcantara fabric for a "soft, velvety" feel. Microsoft pitches typing on the keyboards as "easier, more, comfortable, more accurate, better sounding, and easier to do without looking" than the 12-inch MacBook and iPad Pro. The new Surface Pro and Type Covers are available to pre-order today in the United States and select other markets at the Microsoft Store, Microsoft.com, BestBuy.com, and JD.com. The new Surface Pro will ship on June 15 in 25 countries. Surface Pro pricing starts at $799.99 in the United States. Surface Pro models with LTE Advanced will be available later this year. The new Surface Pen will be available in the coming weeks.

REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Files 1/2 left right A man exercises on a bus stop with hoardings promoting digital payments in Mumbai, India, January 27, 2017. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade/Files 2/2 By Aditya Kalra | NEW DELHI NEW DELHI U.S.-based software firm Ebix Inc will pay 8 billion rupees ($120 million) for a majority stake in Indian payment provider ItzCash, the companies said on Wednesday, the latest foreign investment in India's booming digital payments market. The deal, which values ItzCash at $150 million, comes as digital payments gain traction in India after the government late last year scrapped old high-value currency notes and started promoting non-cash payment modes. Japan's SoftBank last week invested $1.4 billion in the parent of India's Paytm, which along with MobiKwik competes with ItzCash in the digital wallets business. ItzCash also offers remittance services, point-of-sale machines and allows customers to use cash to facilitate digital transactions at retail outlets. Ebix will acquire an 80 percent stake in ItzCash. ItzCash's existing investors - Matrix Partners, Lightspeed Venture and Intel Capital - will exit the company, ItzCash Chief Growth Officer Bhavik Vasa told Reuters. The remaining 20 percent stake in ItzCash will be held by the company's backers, India's Essel Group. Of the $120 million, Ebix has paid $76 million upfront, with the rest payable over three years. "Other than payments and money transfers, we will deepen our strength in providing insurance, investment products and loans to consumers and businesses," Vasa said. "These are the growth areas." ItzCash will look at replicating its model in other emerging markets, as well as tap Ebix's distribution channels to explore markets such as Australia and Brazil, it said in a statement. Paytm says it has more than 220 million clients using its e-wallet. ItzCash does not disclose a separate number for its e-wallets users, but says it has more than 75 million accounts overall. Digital payments are seen as a growing opportunity in India as smartphone and Internet use rises, even though millions of people, especially in rural areas, lack access to such services. Private players such as Paytm and ItzCash also face major competition from state-backed digital tools, which are luring users with facilities such as inter-bank transfers and payment services that can be used with a fingerprint.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Zettar Transferred 1 Petabyte of Data in Just 34 Hours Using AIC Servers CITY OF INDUSTRY, Calif., May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — AIC announces the successful completion of a landmark, 1-petabyte transfer of data in 34 hours, during a recent test by Zettar that relied on the company’s SB122A-PH, 1U 10-bay NVMe storage server. As organizations find themselves creating, storing and working with ever-increasingly larger files and sets of data, it becomes imperative to come up with new solutions to speed up the transfer of information. Exascale computing will be essential for maintaining the nation’s prestige, advancing sciences, and improving the economic well-being of the society. For context, an exabyte is equivalent to 1,000 petabytes. Any company that has high performance computing requirements stands to benefit from the equipment used in the recent 1-petabyte transfer test. Whether working with a content delivery network, big data, data centers, cloud service providers, or as a backup solution provider, you need a new solution for faster data throughput in order to remain competitive. A wide range of industries will need to take advantage of exascale computing, oil and gas, media and entertainment, life sciences, defense and intelligence agencies, to name just a few. Newly emerging fields such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, digital transformation, and intelligent enterprises are no exceptions. Four of AIC’s SB122A-PH 10-Bay NVMe 1U storage servers were used in the test, along with 16 DC P3700 U.2 1.6TB NVMe solid-state drives from Intel’s Non-volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG). AIC’s SB122A-PH is a commodity server that is symmetrical in architecture design, enabling it to deliver better performance than other servers currently on the market. The test sent data on a unique 5,000-mile loop that goes from the US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science (SC)’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) in Menlo Park of California, Sunnyvale of California, El Paso of Texas, Houston of Texas, Nashville of Tennessee, Atlanta of Georgia and back to SLAC/Menlo Park. This is the world’s only 5,000-mile 100Gbps loop available and has been established by the Energy Science Network (ESNet) for the SLAC (Zettar’s efforts since 2015). ESNet is operated by the DOE’s SC. It runs a state-of-the-art 100Gbps national backbone, which connects DOE SC laboratories together and to the other parts of the Internet. Transparency is critical when it comes to evaluating high-speed data transfer milestones like the recent successful 1-petabyte effort. The test performed by Zettar is likely the only one in the world whose results were publicly viewable (and can be seen on the ESNet’s Network portal. „Zettar is more than capable of handling multiple PBs of high speed data transfers weekly and is a founding member of the exclusive and elite ‚Exascale-ready Club,'” said Dr. Chin Fang, Founder & CEO of Zettar Inc. „To be admitted in the first half of 2017, an organization or team must be capable of using a shared, production, point-to-point WAN link to attain a production data transfer rate that is equal or greater than 270PB-km/hour.” About AIC: AIC is a leading provider of both standard OTS (off-the-shelf) and OEM/ODM server and storage solutions. With expert in-house design, manufacturing and validation capabilities, AIC’s broad selection of products are highly flexible and configurable to any form factor, standard or custom. AIC leads the industry with over 20 years of experience in mechanical, electronic, system-level engineering as well as a dedication to innovation and customer satisfaction. Headquartered in Taiwan, AIC has offices and operations throughout the United States, Asia and Europe. About Zettar: Zettar Inc. delivers scale-out, petascale-proven data transfer software, a reference design for a data transfer cluster, and a burst buffer reference design. Together they are the foundations of a highly efficient petascale-proven data transfer solution today.   The critical burst buffer design leverages the industry leading AIC SB122A-PH 1U 10-bay NVMe storage servers.  Zettar is a US National Science Foundation (NSF) funded startup in Palo Alto, California.  Zettar collaborates with the US DOE SC National Laboratories and ESNet.

With a new strategic partner, ItzCash has now become a payment solutions exchange from a prepaid wallet and payment company, he added. Currently, ItzCash focuses on payments, remittances and corporate solutions. It entered into PoS solutions after demonetisation. However, with Ebix, it plans to foray into credit, insurance, healthcare and investments. “With the new funding in place, we plan to enter into new business areas and segments within the financial sector. Besides, we are planning to expand our reach both in India as well as to the countries where EBix has a presence,” Surya said adding that the idea is to venture into Brazil to start with. Ebix is present in 40 countries including Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, UK and US among others. “We are the only profitable company in the payment space today. Besides, with new businesses and expansion, we expect to grow at 50-60 per cent CAGR for the next couple of years,” said Bhavik Vasa, Chief Growth Officer at ItzCash. “With the youngest tech-savvy society, the largest middle class, a 1.3-billion population, a country committed to going digital and a growth rate of 7 per cent plus, India is an emerging economic superpower today,” said Ebix Chairman, President and CEO Robin Raina.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Zettar Transferred 1 Petabyte of Data in Just 34 Hours Using AIC Servers Organizations around the world are working with ever larger data sets than before. Transferring huge amounts of information at a rapid pace will be critical to Exascale computing. AIC's SB122A-PH, 1U 10-bay NVMe storage server was part of the hardware used by Zettar during this important data transfer milestone. CITY OF INDUSTRY, Calif., May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- AIC announces the successful completion of a landmark, 1-petabyte transfer of data in 34 hours, during a recent test by Zettar that relied on the company's SB122A-PH, 1U 10-bay NVMe storage server. As organizations find themselves creating, storing and working with ever-increasingly larger files and sets of data, it becomes imperative to come up with new solutions to speed up the transfer of information. Exascale computing will be essential for maintaining the nation's prestige, advancing sciences, and improving the economic well-being of the society. For context, an exabyte is equivalent to 1,000 petabytes. Any company that has high performance computing requirements stands to benefit from the equipment used in the recent 1-petabyte transfer test. Whether working with a content delivery network, big data, data centers, cloud service providers, or as a backup solution provider, you need a new solution for faster data throughput in order to remain competitive. A wide range of industries will need to take advantage of exascale computing, oil and gas, media and entertainment, life sciences, defense and intelligence agencies, to name just a few. Newly emerging fields such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, digital transformation, and intelligent enterprises are no exceptions. Four of AIC's SB122A-PH 10-Bay NVMe 1U storage servers were used in the test, along with 16 DC P3700 U.2 1.6TB NVMe solid-state drives from Intel's Non-volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG). AIC's SB122A-PH is a commodity server that is symmetrical in architecture design, enabling it to deliver better performance than other servers currently on the market. The test sent data on a unique 5,000-mile loop that goes from the US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science (SC)'s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) in Menlo Park of California, Sunnyvale of California, El Paso of Texas, Houston of Texas, Nashville of Tennessee, Atlanta of Georgia and back to SLAC/Menlo Park. This is the world's only 5,000-mile 100Gbps loop available and has been established by the Energy Science Network (ESNet) for the SLAC (Zettar's efforts since 2015). ESNet is operated by the DOE's SC. It runs a state-of-the-art 100Gbps national backbone, which connects DOE SC laboratories together and to the other parts of the Internet. Transparency is critical when it comes to evaluating high-speed data transfer milestones like the recent successful 1-petabyte effort. The test performed by Zettar is likely the only one in the world whose results were publicly viewable (and can be seen on the ESNet's Network portal. "Zettar is more than capable of handling multiple PBs of high speed data transfers weekly and is a founding member of the exclusive and elite 'Exascale-ready Club,'" said Dr. Chin Fang, Founder & CEO of Zettar Inc. "To be admitted in the first half of 2017, an organization or team must be capable of using a shared, production, point-to-point WAN link to attain a production data transfer rate that is equal or greater than 270PB-km/hour."

Blockchain update: R3, the consortium of banks looking to build a blockchain platform for the financial services industry, secured $107 million in its largest fundraising to date. About half of the money came from 43 financial institutions — including Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, UBS and HSBC — as well as Temasek, the Singaporean state investment company, and Intel Capital, the technology giant's venture capital arm. Employees of Fidelity, the mutual fund giant, can now use bitcoin to pay for their lunch in the company cafeteria, "a mark of the determination of Abigail Johnson, the company's chief executive, to position the asset manager as a digital currency pioneer," the FT said. Speaking at Consensus, a bitcoin-themed conference in New York, Johnson said the company has made investments in several startup bitcoin businesses and partnered with various universities to explore possible uses of blockchain.

Like your first student car, for those without trust funds (chip on shoulder established) your first car manages to get you going, but it does not come with any of the bells and whistles that accompany those cars we wish we could have—instead of the sound system, we have a Shox speaker connected to our phone, our air-con is breeze and that sound in the engine wasn’t there yesterday. However, car metaphors aside, the H270 Gaming Pro Carbon presents itself as a motherboard with an edge, both good-looking with some extras in the form of DDR4 speed boost and DMI bandwidth courtesy of a minor upgrade from the H170 chipset. With a price point close to R2500, the MSI H270 Gaming Pro does flirt around with becoming an indulgent non-overclocking motherboard, but then again it is a full size motherboard with Crossfire support and space for two NVME M.2 slots, so the price does somewhat forgive. However, anyone with two rocks to knock together know that the presence of AMD’s Ryzen and AM4 platform makes the current crop of H270 motherboards a very difficult sell. So, now that we’ve started her up, let’s go for a little spin. Carbon Emissions Demo models are usually your best bet for bang for buck, they come with everything that makes the car matter, and none of the fluff—MSI take the H270 Gaming Pro Carbon down this familiar bare-bones route. The extras are humble, with the only thing getting your revs up is a Mystic LED strip extension cable and some cable labelling stickers. Aesthetically the low-key colour scheme of silver, matte black and carbon-fiber vinyl heatsinks does make a winning combination in a motherboard market of black/{insert any colour} scheme we find. Once you engage the underlying Mystic lighting RGB LEDs, the colours morph the board into something elegant. Spacing on the board was, as expected of an ATX, very accommodating. Manoeuvring large coolers or fan connectors onto the board was without any hassle. My only, and continual gripe with MSI, is their inane power/reset headers—for the love of my sanity, name them properly. Also, if you’re going to include a DEBUG LED notification system, don’t put it right next to the 24-pin power connector. I know most people who buy the board won’t really utlise it, but it’s not the easiest thing to see when you have a 24 Pin connector in the way. The large plastic I/O shield, although great for commanding your attention and diffusing your LED lighting, is a bit big—if you’ve got to attach your 8-Pin CPU power and you have a tall cooler in the way, things can get, er, sweary. Although, if you have Donald Trump hands, you should be fine. MSI have included their PCI-Steel armor and EMI shielding, although only for one slot since most users of a H270 motherboard likely won’t populate the second slot. Also, MSI’s H270 is only AMD CrossFire supported, not NVIDIA SLI supported. Where MSI have ensured power user status is in the storage options, including 2x M.2 NVME slots for those wanting extra fast storage capabilities. They even went ahead and coated one slot in Steel Armor, apparently since it protects against rampant EMI (electro-magnetic interference). Pro-tip: contemporary electronics must pass stringent EMI tests to even be allowed to bring products to retail. Although great marketing, saying they are reducing EMI is disingenuous—they are required to meet very stringent EMI standards. In any case, shiny steel is shiny and it does suit the overall theme MSI has going for the board. Also, since it’s the newer H270 chipset, both are Intel Optane ready—only if you’re using a Kaby-Lake CPU—a Skylake CPU, although it will work in a H270 motherboard, will not be able to make use of this feature. Audio technology has always made some noise with motherboards, and the Audio Boost 4 tech on the MSI board is no different—Realtek ALC 1220 5-channel CODEC, Nahimic 2, Chemi-Con capacitors and op amps for headphones, make the audio capabilities of the H270 Gaming Pro Carbon well looked after. The IO port has the general things you’ll usually see, such as USB 3.1, HDMI, DVI and one Type C USB 3.1 port—although instead of using industry colours, I do like that MSI use their own red colours on some of the IO ports. The two USB ports above the HDMI port are VR boost enabled, which apparently means they’ll have a stronger and consistent signal to a connected VR headset. The H270 chipset, as we all should know by now, is the less expensive mainstream chipset, with less bandwidth and no overclocking capabilities. For that reason, most H270 boards are cheaper as they don’t need to cater to accommodate higher end features. Often, though, vendors will offer some such benefit to gamers or overclockers as value-add. These usually don’t make it down the line to their cheaper counterparts, but we know redesigning marketing material is more expensive, regardless of its actual usefulness. Take, for example, MSI’s DDR4 boost—something of a pointless feature on a chipset that limits the speed of your memory to 2400MHz, a speed many a kit will be able to punt out without much sweat, let alone an extra boost. Regardless, it’s about branding and perception, and for cheaper boards, that might shore up some perceived value—although simply getting a cheaper Z170  board would actually make more sense here. BIOS and Software: Buckled Up MSI’s ClickBios 5 is unchanged from their past motherboards with the Advanced and Easy layout being intuitive for the novice. Although the primary reason for tapping “Del” at POST is to get access to the overclocking knoblets within the BIOS, since we’re dealing with a H270 chipset, overclocking is pretty much null. The only thing really left to do in the BIOS is create some fan profiles, gawk at the lovely motherboard representation, tweak the RAM speed to 2400MHZ and adjust the RAM timings. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Once you’re in windows, MSI give you all the apps you’ll never need for this particular chipset, meaning you’ll have access to temperature readings, fan settings, DDR4 timings and “OC profile” which, as you guessed, does absolutely nothing. There is nifty mouse and keyboard software (Mouse Master and Gaming Hotkey) to create some hotkey profiles, macros and adjust DPI. So for those gamers who may be on a tighter budget and have to make do with less fancy peripherals, MSI offer some taste of customisability. The problem, however, is that the MSI software is not housed under one digital roof. There just seems like a lot more bloatware is installed, most likely because there is different software controlling things that could easily be included under one unified piece of software. System Setup and Benchmarks Having recently reviewed the ASUS Z270G, we have a Kaby-Lake board to test up against the MSI H270 Gaming Pro Carbon, as well as my trusty Z170 based Gene VIII and 6700K. Skylake: ASUS Z170 RAMPAGE Gene VIII Core i7 6700K @ 4.5GHZ 4x4GB G-Skill DDR4 @3200MHz Samsung 850 Evo 250 + OCZ Vertex 4 256GB Windows 10 X64 Anniversary Edition NVIDIA Drivers 378.66 (GTX1060 3GB) Kaby-Lake: ASUS ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING + MSI H270 Gaming Pro Carbon: Core i7 7700K @ 4.5GHZ/ 4.4GHz 4x4GB G-Skill DDR4 @3200MHz/ 2400MHz OCZ Vertex 4 256GB Windows 10 X64 Anniversary Edition NVIDIA Drivers 378.66 (GTX1060 3GB) To get the H270 board to perform as fast as it could, I did manage to tweak the stock RAM settings to 2400MHz (13-13-13-32), so that did provide a bit of a boost to some synthetic benchmarks, such as XTU and Cinebench, but non-existent gains to gaming based benchmarks. Synthetic Benchmarks This slideshow requires JavaScript. Gaming Benchmarks This slideshow requires JavaScript. Thanks to inability to get the CPU clockspeed higher, and lower RAM speed, the MSI H270 Gaming Pro Carbon just edges in under the other motherboards. Of course, this is totally expected. The difference between the motherboards is less pronounced in gaming, although the H270 board still comes out slower overall. Conclusion and Final Thoughts: Stuck in the mud? It’s difficult to recommend spending over R2000 on a motherboard with limited upgrade-ability on a chipset that is a slight improvement over last years offerings. Usually I’d qualify that statement with some value proposition, namely that overall, it’s a cheaper system than the Z270 motherboards, has many of the non-power user features and up to date technology, such as M.2 slots and dual GPU capabilities. If this was 18 months ago, that would totally be the start of this conclusion, since the H170 and the MSI H270 Pro Gaming would be running riot for sub R2500 motherboards. However, in a post-Ryzen world, I cannot wholesale recommend any Intel board that’s incapable of overclocking, when AMD has boards, like the MSI B350 Tomahawk, in the same price range that are capable of overclocking, with CPUs like the Ryzen 1500X, a quad core hyperthreaded CPU that simply is faster than comparatively priced chips from Intel. As a category, the H270 chipset is definitely flirting with obsolescence, as AMD have more affordable boards and overclockable chips that eat away at the performance/watt/price category of an H270 based gaming system. Last Updated: May 24, 2017 MSI H270 Gaming Pro Carbon Summary The MSI H270 Gaming Pro Carbon is a good motherboard if you're team Intel, but buying the H270 platform potentially locks you into an EOL range from Intel, so your money might be better spent waiting for the next platform from Intel or shift to AMD this generation. 6.5 TagsHardware ReviewmotherboardMSIMSI H270 Gaming Pro CarbonReviewtech Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Pinterest Share on Linkedin Share on Tumblr Want more stuff like this?

First impressions of Dolby Atmos Sound System Chris Hall24 May 2017Laptops Huawei Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Huawei has unveiled the MateBook X, its attempt to muscle in on the thin and light laptop space, rivalling devices like the Apple MacBook or the Asus ZenBook 3. There's a number of firsts that you totally expect from Huawei: really thin bezels give you a 13-inch display in the space you'd normally find a 12-inch, it's incredibly thin at 12.5mm and it also will run Intel's Core i7 processors with no fan, thanks to "space age" cooling technology. The MateBook X also introduces something called Dolby Atmos Sound System and it's promising to totally change audio on your laptop. What is Dolby Atmos Sound System? There's two parts to that name, there's the Dolby Atmos part that you recognise from home cinema or movie theatres and then there's the Sound System part tagged on the end. This is potentially confusing: Dolby Atmos is all about creating an immersive sound space that differentiates itself from common or garden surround sound by adding height: it's being able to place a sound objects above you that really defines the Dolby Atmos experience. We've seen a slight dilution of that brand over the early parts of 2017. The move into mobile devices like smartphones sees Dolby Atmos branding, but not delivering the experience in the way you would expect if you've see it in the cinema. Dolby Atmos explained: What is it and how do I get it? So Dolby Atmos Sound System isn't exactly the same thing. It has some of the same aims - creating a greater stereo separation and the ability to create and place sonic object effects, but it isn't the same as a full home Atmos system that will have sounds moving around behind your head, like you're sitting in a sound bubble. Dolby says that it's about making the sound experience better than it has been before, but accepts that it's not going to be the same as sitting in a Dolby Atmos cinema. How does the Dolby Atmos Sound System work? In the case of the MateBook X, the key is that Dolby got to work with Huawei early on in the design process. This means that Dolby could have more input into the design of the speaker drivers, how they were located and housed within the new Ultrabook, as well as the grille design. Dolby told us that in many partnerships of this type, the audio company is handed the near-finished product and asked to make the sound better, meaning that they have very little real input. Pocket-lint Dolby Atmos Sound System is both a hardware and software solution. It relies on the speaker hardware as well as the software processing to create the effect, with Dolby saying that the MateBook X has bespoke speakers, with two motors each, meaning they can drive more air and create better audio effects - as well as producing sound beyond what you'd expect from a compact notebook. On the software side, you get a control panel will let you switch between different sound modes -  dynamic, movie, music, voice and game - as well as letting you personalise the experience. Software is important because it's managing the whole process and using the stereo speakers the virtualise the immersive effects. How good does Dolby Atmos Sound System sound? First impressions are good. We've not had long to listen in too much depth, but the demos we've experienced create a noticeable immersive effect, the sort of thing you'd expect from a surround sound system, albeit not having rear channels or the sense of a vast soundscape that a good Atmos system will create. The demos we listened to were at very high volume and things sounded a little shrill, at the high end, but watching the opening scene of Max Mad: Fury Road, the whispers were swirling around us when sitting in front of the MateBook X. Subsequently we've watched a number of movies and found a definite widening of the sound stage, if not quite as impressive as the original demos. For a 2.0 system in the MateBook X there's surprising depth to the sound quality, so listening to music is pretty good and switching sound modes can make a difference: music is a little flatter than movie, for example. Pocket-lint On the MateBook X is you turn the speakers up full volume there's a still a lot of distortion that destroys the experience and playing bass-heavy tracks will do the same: Dolby Atmos Sound System isn't a magic bullet in that sense, it still has limitations. Dolby is also promising a great headphone experience and we assume that having a Dolby Atmos Sound System laptop will mean you can get greater separation and more delicate handling from movies, for a more immersive experience - of course you need movies that will deliver that degree of separation. Again, the volume levels on offer far exceed what we'd be able to listen to through headphones, so on the MateBook X, it might be pushing a little too powerfully. Will Dolby Atmos Sound System be coming to other devices? Yes. It made its debut on the Huawei MateBook X, but at the launch event, Dolby closed its section of the presentation by saying that it was looking forward to seeing the spread of Dolby Atmos Sound System. Dolby is presenting Atmos Sound System as something that can be used by OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to improve the performance of their audio offering. It's on the MateBook X and MateBook D, but we're sure we'll see it appearing in other devices soon enough.

President Donald Trump is expected to retain Marc Kasowitz as private attorney on matters related to the Russia investigation, sources familiar with the decision told NBC News Tuesday. Kasowitz has represented Trump in the past. Fox Business and ABC News earlier reported that Trump was expected to retain Kasowitz in relation to the Russia investigation. And the Washington Post reported on Monday that Trump was close to choosing outside counsel in the probe. The expected move comes less than a week after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed a special counsel, former FBI director Robert Mueller, to oversee the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election. More from NBC News: Trump asked top Intel officials to push back publicly on Russia probe Ex-CIA chief: 'Interactions' between Trump campaign, Russia Trump to Pope after Vatican meeting: I 'won't forget what you said' Rosenstein appointed the special counsel amid mounting criticism following Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey earlier this month. Meanwhile, former Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Democrat, joined Kasowitz' law firm in 2013 — and Lieberman is under consideration by Trump to replace Comey as FBI director. Trump said on Friday that he is "very close" to choosing an FBI director and said then that Lieberman was his top choice, but no decision has been announced. Trump has denied any collusion with Russia in the alleged interference in the presidential campaign. Last week the president said he is the target of a "witch hunt." U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia was involved in a covert campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton and help Trump win. Trump and other Republicans have said they believe Russia was involved in the hacking of Democratic institutions, but that the alleged interference did not affect the outcome of the election. On Tuesday, former CIA Director John Brennan appeared before the House Intelligence Committee and said he believes Russia "brazenly" interfered in last year's presidential election and that he knew of contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials. Brennan added that he is not sure whether "collusion existed" between the campaign and Moscow, but the interactions were enough that he believed the matter warranted an FBI investigation. During the campaign, Kasowitz sent a letter to the New York Times demanding a retraction for an Oct. 12, 2016 article about two women who said Trump touched them inappropriately in the past. The letter called the article "libelous" and "reckless" and "defamatory." The New York Times refused. David E. McCraw, vice president and assistant general counsel for the newspaper, said in a response that the they "published newsworthy information about a subject of deep public concern" and added that if Trump disagrees "we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight."

RELATED ARTICLES: Tokyo Freight receives 58 Volvo tractor heads | Schmidt Heilbronn opens $5.44m Gulf HQ in KIZAD | EMC delivers 27 Zetros trucks to Suhail Al Mazroui Honeywell has announced a technology called Connected Freight that gives shippers and logistics companies sweeping abilities to monitor shipments of high-value or sensitive equipment or goods in real-time, helping to guard against damage and theft. Honeywell’s system was developed in collaboration with Intel and third-party logistics companies, and uses tags affixed to pallets or individual objects to provide detailed information about the condition of critical freight while in transit. The cost-effective sensor tags can sense a range of environmental conditions, including temperature, humidity, pressure, shock, vibration and tilt. The data that is captured is then relayed by a mobile gateway placed inside the truck or container to cloud platforms. The system can also alert manufacturers if high-value equipment has been damaged while being loaded or unloaded. The cloud can also store data for compliance and audit needs, and provide predictive and reactive analysis, such as which routes to avoid. “Honeywell is developing a range of Connected Supply Chain solutions that leverage technology and data to make supply chains more efficient, better able to adapt to rapid change, and in turn, support the Middle East’s economic growth,” said Edmond Mikhael, GM for Honeywell SPS in the Middle East. “Cloud-based solutions provides shippers, logistics providers and retailers faced with a host of costly freight challenges, such as theft, damage, spoilage and delays, with detailed analytics. This enables customers to plan, anticipate and react immediately to incidents that occur during shipment.” Connected Freight was introduced during Honeywell Safety and Productivity Solutions’ launch event, as being developed with three third-party logistics companies: DHL, Expeditors and Kuehne + Nagel. “After assessing our internal supply chain needs and the needs of the industry, we’ve customised Intel’s Connected Logistics Platform technology to deliver an IoT offering that solves real logistics problems,” noted Chet Hullum, GM for Industrial Solutions at Intel. “Thanks to data accessibility, shippers and carriers will be able to establish a more reliable supply chain network by having deeper visibility and information on shipments.” Page: 1 LATEST MIDDLE EAST CONSTRUCTION PMV / NEWS Dubai FM firm issues statement after fatal bus crash PDO inks $35m worth of deals with Omani firms UAE: $3.2bn solar power plant to be built in Abu Dhabi BKT showcases its port and earthmoving product in Dubai EMC delivers 50 Mercedes-Benz trucks to Transgulf Readymix Honeywell launches Connected Freight system to monitor goods in transit NFT delivers 10 Potain tower cranes to Royal Atlantis Residences site in Dubai Egypt: Genie GTH-4018 telehandlers assist Suez Canal project Terex updates Demag AC 100-4L with IC-1 Plus control system UAE: Al-Futtaim Motors opens 3S Toyota Material Handling facility Advertisement HOME NEWS Business Projects Materials Design MEP PMV Facilities Management Human Resource ANALYSIS Business Projects Materials Design MEP PMV Facilities Management Human Resource INTERVIEWS Projects Materials Design MEP PMV Facilities Management Human Resource COMMENT Business Projects Materials Design MEP Pmv Facilities Management Human Resource IN PICTURES Events In The News Projects Reader's Pictures Site Visits VIDEOS SPECIAL REPORTS Sectors Projects Country Report Most Influential Suppliers Big 5 Saudi Build Saudi Pmv Show CW Awards Top 10...

Well, actually it depends. Unlike the traditional ways of franchising and merchandising, co-branding can [involve] crossover[s] combining two distantly-related products, like Nike+Ipod bringing sports and music together. Co-branding has been catching more eyeballs of both media and consumers in China as well as in other countries. After all, who could argue with playing Lego toys with Batman minifigures therein, meeting Marvel heroes in Shanghai Disneyland, getting extra bonus[es] or even plane ticket[s] with a credit card jointly launched by China Guangfa Bank and China Southern Airlines, or licking a KFC Cremia ice cream out of a Shiroi Koirito cone? As for the two brands, co-branding is usually a win-win strategy with half [the] marketing expense but doubled exposure. However, as appealing as it is, most co-brandings do not last as long as the other traditional licensing types. Intel processor's co-branding with Dell and HP computers is an exception, but this is mainly because [a] processor alone does not serve any function and is hard to be advertised on its own. As compared with co-branding and merchandising, franchising conveys a business model more than [the] mere licensing of IP rights. Along with the attendant trade marks, design patents, know-how and other IP rights, a franchisee is always required to take the business pattern set up by the franchisor so that goods or services of consistent quality and style are secured. For example, a consumer entering 7-11 would expect the food to be not only clean and healthy, but also 7-11-styled, not a burger or fries like McDonalds, although the latter is of equally good quality. Accordingly, franchising is adopted in business[es] like restaurants, beauty salons and supermarkets more often than other types of licensing, where consumers would expect goods and services to be alike or similar. Merchandising is an old and long-established form of licensing, which is still very active in China today. We can see little girls wearing T-shirts or dresses with different images of Elsa from Frozen every day, and it is reported that Disney has profited much more from merchandising Frozen characters than selling movie tickets and DVDs. When items like mugs, plates, clothes, caps, towels are added with sports teams, universities, well-liked characters, popular stars or trade marks, sales will be instantly boosted despite…the premium price as compared with the same goods without licensed IP rights. The key [to] merchandising is the IP rights per se are so popular that consumers are willing to pay extra. To sum up, it is hard to say one type of licensing precedes the other in popularity in China. It really depends on which sector the business is in and what [cooperative] relationship the parties can build. What are the pros and cons of the main types of licensing? On one hand, when two renowned companies are together in co-branding, they share resources, marketing expenses and even risks while enjoying individual profit margin increased by sales volume. On the other hand, if anything negative from either side happens, both brands will be affected. And two separate brands tend to have different missions and visions, which makes co-branding more likely to fail or be short-lived than other types of licensing. For example, one brand may prefer to advertise the co-branding more to increase sales, while the other brand may think too much advertising of the co-branding would dilute its own brand, and such difference may lead the co-branding to end. For a franchisor, franchising is a cost-effective and risk-less way to expand business, as the franchisees typically assume costs and risks. And to avoid loss of investment, local franchisees would do diligent [research] to open up new markets for the franchisor. In…decades [past], many foreign companies have built up their presence quickly in China by franchising. Successful examples in China include KFC, McDonalds, 7-11, Hilton, Sheraton, and Super 8 Motel…However, much cattle, much care. With the rapid growth, which is a trait of franchising, a franchisor needs extra efforts to keep the train from [running away]. Otherwise, adverse experience from one hotel in China may stop a customer from booking another hotel sharing the same brand in US. Although profit margin[s] can be enormously increased by merchandising, IP right owners [should] pay more attention to the quality of merchandised items, as products of poor quality may not only decrease the popularity of the merchandised IP rights, but also do harm to reputations built up [over] years. When merchandised products are in large volume[s] and differ in type…quality control can be a real challenge. And target markets may vary a lot with different merchandised IP rights. For example, it is never a good idea to sell Red Sox souvenirs in New York. Each coin has two sides. [The] [p]ros and cons of each type of licensing [should] be considered before a decision is made. What are the most important issues for licensors to consider? First, licensors need to decide if the license [will] be exclusive, non-exclusive or sole, and whether sub-licensing is allowed or not. This is ordinarily based on the relationship [and the] business strategy. Second, although there is no so-called "naked licensing" in China. China['s] Trade Mark Law does require licensors to supervise the quality of licensed goods and services. And licensors would be held jointly liable for [any] problem caused by [poor] quality of licensed goods and services. Besides quality control, the licensors may also want to have control over the…use [of] the trade mark, the design of packaging and decoration, the prices and the distribution channels, so as to protect the trade mark from dilution, degrading (especially when the licensed trade mark is associated with "[higher] end" [goods]) or other possible harm. Last but not least, licensors [should] consider requesting the licensees to cooperate in actions defending the licensed trade marks. For example, licensees' help in collecting evidence is essential [in defending] the mark in non-use cancellation[s]. What are the most important issues for licensees to consider? First and foremost, licensees [should] always review and evaluate the trade mark to be licensed before licensing. Is the ownership of the licensed trade mark clear and stable? Is there any risk of being accused of infringement? Will the profit and other business benefits be good enough for royalties? Second, although record[ing] of trade mark license[s] [are] not mandatory [under] China['s] Trade Mark Law, it is prudent to have the license recorded with [the] Trade Mark Office (CTMO) anyway, which will not only defend the licensees from third parties…but also save time for licensees in future possible inspections. If the licensees decide to [record their license], it shall be noted that the term of license shall not exceed the valid period of the trade mark registration, and the licensed goods/services shall not go beyond the registered ones. And [this should] be re-filed whenever there is any change in the term of license, contents of licensed goods/services or ownership of the licensed trade mark. [Third], licensees shall consider whether the license [will] be kept valid after [the] ownership of [the] licensed trade mark is changed. [The] Supreme Court has provided that [this should happen automatically], unless it is explicitly agreed upon otherwise in the license contract. However, if the licensees choose to keep the license after change of ownership, a clear clause in the contract may save time and money with the new owner of the licensed trade mark. And [if] the licensees choose not to keep the license after [a] change of ownership, the licensees shall consider what compensation [will] be made by the licensors who assign the licensed trade marks during [the] licensing period. Last, if the licensors record the licensed trade marks with…customs, the licensees shall request [that] the licensors list licensees and their import and export agencies as authorized users with…customs, which may [save] licensees from trivial [problems] in future. What are the key points for both parties to include in a licensing agreement? First, both parties shall include the type of license in the agreement, that is, whether it is exclusive, non-exclusive or sole. Second, quality control is a key point for both parties. Then basic and general issues like extent and scope of licensed rights, right to sub-license (or not), field of use, territory, manufacturing of products, design of packaging and decoration, payable fees, renewals, termination, consequences of termination, infringement and counterfeiting, miscellaneous provisions regarding governing law and jurisdiction are key points too. Each of the above points has to be considered thoroughly and addressed adequately. Take payable fees as an example. The agreement [should] address the following questions: How is the licensor to be paid? Lump sum or instalment? If the latter, guaranteed minimum royalty, or percentage royalty, or combination of both? If the latter two, should the licensee be required to explain how the royalties are calculated, and does the licensor have [the] right to audit? What is the payment term, annually or quarterly? Furthermore, obligations and responsibilities of both parties in special situations like change of ownership, bankruptcy are also key points to be included in the agreement too.

Par La rédaction de ZDNet.fr | Mercredi 24 Mai 2017 Suivre @zdnetfr Il y a un an, Intel annonçait sa volonté d'engager un important plan social conduisant à la suppression de 12.000 postes, soit 11% de ses effectifs afin d'économiser 1,4 milliard de dollars. La France n'a pas été épargnée puisque la direction a annoncé la fermeture à terme de cinq centres de R&D (sur un total de 7) débouchant sur la suppression de 750 emplois, soit quasiment les trois quarts des effectifs français du groupe. Seuls les centres de Saclay dédié au calcul à haute performance et celui à Bruyères-le-Châtel (big data) seront maintenus. Bonne nouvelle néanmoins, les deux centres à Sophia Antipolis et Toulouse qui fournissent des modems 4G dédiés aux smartphones, devraient être repris par Renault. Le constructeur automobile entend s'appuyer sur l'expertises des ingénieurs du fondeur en matière de solutions de connectivité embarquée, domaine stratégique pour le secteur. Selon les Echos, 400 salariés seraient repris sur 500. "C'est un vrai événement. Nous étions en lien depuis des mois avec les équipes d'Intel, nous les connaissons bien désormais, et nous sommes ravis d'intégrer des compétences aussi élevées", commente au quotidien Thierry Bolloré, le numéro deux de Renault. "Leur expertise sera clef dans les domaines de la connectivité automobile et le développement de la voiture autonome, que ce soit en termes de fiabilité, de sécurité ou d'expérience client", ajoute-t-il. "Le logiciel représente aujourd'hui 15 à 25 % de la valeur d'une voiture, et ce sera plus de 50% après 2020. Il faut maîtriser cet univers en interne".  C'est une bonne nouvelle pour l'emploi dans les nouvelles technologies dans le sud de la France. La région a été particulièrement impacté par les difficultés des fondeurs, en 2012, Texas Instruments annonçait un massif plan social et la fermeture début de son site de Villeneuve-Loubet (Alpes-Maritimes) implanté il y a 50 ans de cela. Au total, le fondeur a supprimé 517 emplois sur 609.   Sujet: Intel Suivre via: RSS Nous vous recommandons Contenus partenaires Digitalisation des banques : l'importance des nouvelles méthodes de travail, témoignage de BNP Paribas Les règles d’or de la sécurité dans le cloud Privacy by Design, kezako ?

Check out our latest reviews and buyer's guide on the top antivirus programs for your Windows PC or laptop. By Jon Thompson | 24 May 17 What's the best antivirus for Windows? > Bitdefender Total Security 2017 > Norton Security Deluxe 2017 > Kaspersky Total Security 2017 > McAfee Total Protection 2017 > ESET Internet Security 10 > Trend Micro Internet Security > AVG Ultimate > Avast Premier > Avira Free Security Suite 2017 > Panda Free Antivirus 2017 Jump straight to our full best antivirus list Your Buying Guide for the Best Antivirus in 2017 Why you need antivirus and why do you need it? Unless you’ve got some sort of security software installed, your Windows PC or laptop is vulnerable to viruses, malware and ransomware. The best solution is to install antivirus protection, and you'll be pleased to hear it doesn't have to cost you loads. Antivirus software detects, and then prevents, disarms or removes malicious programs or malware, often referred to as 'viruses'. Antivirus doesn't offer a perfect solution to the problem of malware, but it is a critical first step to securing your PC or laptop. To help prevent viruses infecting your PC you must install antivirus, and then regularly update your antivirus software. All the antivirus software reviewed here will update automatically.  But internet security software is no longer just about countering viruses. Although they still exist, viruses are arguably a minor part of the malware now prevalent on the web. More important now is security of personal data and protection from ransomware. Security exploits aren't about show-off hackers massaging their egos, anymore, but about monetising their malware.  The modern day criminal doesn't have to be a hard-line hacker, either. They can buy all the software they need, and millions of addresses, on the dark web or even on eBay, if you know where to look. You can buy everything from denial of service attack - with botnets for hire - to individual exploits. Custom attacks are available, where the code changes after only a dozen uses or so, making it very hard for Internet Security (IS) providers to block every new variant. Zero day attacks Although the primary concern is to block malware so it doesn’t install on your PC in the first place, there isn’t an internet security suite made which is 100 percent effective. Worthwhile IS and antivirus software should also detect so-called ‘zero day’ attacks, where the malware is so new it hasn’t yet been analysed or had ‘signatures’ built into IS protection routines. The speed with which these analyses are made is an important factor in the level of protection an IS suite can provide. Some companies now claim a turnaround of well under an hour, using information gained from their own customers about similar attacks. The cloud element in security applications is growing more and more important in speeding this process. So-called "next gen" protection using behaviour analysis and even artificial intelligence is also beginning to creep into some products. Newly-installed software can be monitored, looking for suspicious activity and can then be prevented from potentially damaging actions, such as changing registry entries, or installing as a browser add-in. Ransomware can also be identified by unexpected attempts to encrypt your files. So how do you test antivirus software? Malware is evolving faster than ever, but fortunately the latest generation of antivirus - or AV - is better equipped than ever to handle new threats. In recent years, the technology that powers AV software has changed dramatically. An AV package you purchased a few years ago was able to stop known viruses and other known malware, but brand-new, unknown viruses proved more difficult. Newer products do a better job of stopping them. For our antivirus tests we team up with Germany's AV-Test.org and the UK's SELabs, both highly respected independent security-software testing labs. Each rigorously tests AV products from a number of leading security companies. The multifaceted testing procedure looks not only at how well an AV product can detect malware using traditional, largely signature-based methods (that is, employing a database of known malware types), but also at how well it can block brand-new, unknown malware caught fresh from the wild. These companies also examine how well security products clean up after an infection if a piece of malware does get through. Every program in this list is worth your investment. The differences between the top few are relatively minor. The critical thing is to install one of these programs. Is free antivirus good enough? Our tests focus on paid-for and free AV products. Paid-for AV products usually offer better technical support and more comprehensive protection features than free programs, but free is free and some free packages can still give paid packages a run for their money. Internet security suites go further still, offering firewalls, parental controls, identity theft protection and more. Antivirus test scores Best antivirus 2017 UK: Best antivirus reviews Bitdefender Total Security 2017 RRP: £59.99 (5 devices); £49.99 (3 devices), 89.99 Buy from BitDefender Bitdefender Total Security 2017 is a comprehensive security package for Windows, Mac OS and Android, all managed from a central web portal. Its core technology regularly scores top marks in independent tests, and it now offers features that will protect users from new and emerging threats, such as ransomware. Bitdefender has a fine technical reputation. The 2017 version delivers the usual top drawer protection in a simple, no-fuss style, and carries plenty of genuinely useful features. It should be near the top of any family antivirus shopping list. Read our full Bitdefender Total Security 2017 review Norton Security Deluxe 2017 RRP: £49.99 (5 devices), US$89.99 Buy from Symantec Owned by Symantec, Norton benefits from its parent's technology and cloud support, including SONAR Protection, which detects malware by examining the behaviour of applications as they run. This is technically a "next generation" technology, widely tipped to replace traditional signature-based protection. The related Intrusion Prevention module also blocks attacks from threats on already infected computers. Web activity is protected by tools such as the integrated password manager, which helps secure your identity with one-click logons. There's also Browser Protection, which seeks to prevent malware exploiting known vulnerabilities. However, Microsoft's secure Edge browser is not completely supported. Web downloads are also analysed, and after scanning, a report on their safety pops up. Performance tools include a disk optimiser, which defragments data on the disk to make access more efficient. This is something Windows already does, but apparently not consistently. Likewise, the File Cleanup facility will free up space from forgotten temporary files. This is especially a problem for computers where disk space is at a premium. Topping off the performance features are the startup manager, which enables you to delay some services so that you can log in faster, and a useful graph showing all major events by month, including malware detections, scans and alerts. Overall, this product has the feel of Symantec's impressive next generation business-oriented products, belying its parentage. Kaspersky Total Security 2017 RRP: £39.99 (1 device); £59.99 (5 devices), US$49.99 Buy from Kaspersky Lab Privacy from eavesdropping is the focus here. There's a secure browser to prevent web sites tracking you, and the Kaspersky Safe Money utility. Add all your banking and other financial web sites here, and click them when needed. If the frame around your browser turns green, you're secure. If it's orange, there's a problem. To prevent keyloggers intercepting your details, Safe Money also an on-screen keyboard. Included is a wide range of tools suitable for all kinds of users, from domestic to small business. Free participation in the Kaspersky Security Network means that any suspicious files are sent to the cloud for testing, thereby gaining the experience of millions of other users. Other nice touches include right clicking files to send them to the cloud for reputation checking before opening them, and the Software Cleaner that scans for unused applications you can safely uninstall. The default Trusted Application Mode means you can only install and run software that Kaspersky Labs knows to be safe, thereby preventing the family running dodgy downloads. The data vault facility should protect your files from ransomware, and is secured by NSA-approved AES-256 encryption. What is surprising is the lack of a dedicated anti-ransomware module given the maturity of the rest of the package. During the current epidemic, something keeping an eye out specifically for this form of attack would bring a certain peace of mind. McAfee Total Protection 2017 RRP: £79.99 (unlimited installs), US$79.99 (5 devices) Buy from Intel Total Protection is a big claim, and this product lives up to its promise on many fronts. Included in the cost is a subscription to Intel's True Key, which is basically a password manager. The difference is that it uses multi-factor authentication, including fingerprints or your own face. The major components to Total Protection are the antivirus scanner and web/email protection. The scanner is billed as award-winning and is certainly up there with the best of the signature-based scanners. Nowadays, however, more protection is required. Most threats come not from hackers directly infiltrating your network, but from unwise web surfing leading to drive-by infections, and from opening email attachments. The WebAdvisor tool scans downloads for malicious payloads, and identifies any suspicious URLs. Backing this is the associated anti-spam module, designed to keep your inbox free of malicious pink stuff. File Lock is a data vault like most others. It will password-protect your valuable files against stealthy Trojans, ransomware, and local prying eyes. The associated shredder will ensure that the files you delete stay deleted. There are options to shred the recycle bin, temporary internet files, or you can choose your own files. The seemingly misnamed Vulnerability Scanner regularly searches out vulnerable software and downloads the latest versions for installation. Finally, My Home Network gives you a thousand-foot view of your network, enabling you to see instantly if you have any unauthorised devices. Best of all, McAfee Total Protection gives you unlimited installations. ESET Internet Security 10 RRP: £39.99 (1 device); £54.99 (4 devices), US$59.99 Buy from ESET Immediately after installation, the initial scan promises to speed up subsequent scans. Our tests clearly show this to be very a dramatic improvement indeed. At first glance, the main interface seems sparse, apparently containing just vital protection for internet commerce and banking, and a very useful Home Network Protection tool. This scans your network and builds a diagram showing all active devices. If you see one you don't recognise, you may have a neighbour leeching your Wi-Fi. You can also scan your router for vulnerabilities, which should give you peace of mind given the rise of botnets consisting of domestic routers. Dig into the setup menu, and you discover protection such as blocking malicious and phishing web sites, spam blocking and email content checking, botnet protection in case you've become infected, and increasingly important web cam protection. The tools menu contains a plethora of ways to monitor and really get to grips with your security. You can monitor major application events (installations, etc.), running processes, file and network activity, and network connections. More importantly, you can submit unknown files for analysis before opening or running them. You can also download and run ESET SysRescue Live, which will scan the system for persistent threats such as rootkits. ESET mobile Security offering includes SMS and call filtering, and the anti-theft facilities include an alert being sent whenever an unknown SIM is inserted, thereby giving you a heads-up that your phone is in a stranger's hands before you realise it's gone. Trend Micro Internet Security RRP: £49.95 (1 device); £59.95 (3 devices), US$79.95 (3 devices) Buy from Trend Micro This is a mature offering from one of the oldest antivirus companies, and as such it has some nice touches beyond real-time protection. For example, Folder Shield specifically protects you from ransomware. Simply select a folder you wish to protect, and if the module detects that something unknown is trying to access your files, it will stop it. Protected folders have a shield logo added to them. At a time when everyone seems to be on at least one social network, security is more important than ever. Trend Micro has a dedicated module to check your security settings on Facebook, Google+, Twitter and LinkedIn to ensure that you don't over-share your details. It also keeps you safe from web tracking by advertisers. As with many other packages, there's a PC Health Checkup facility. This isn’t as detailed as others; the overall focus of the product is on online protection. Speaking of protection, it is possible to set Trend Micro's real time shield to "Hypersensitive", which means it aggressively eliminates program that may only pose a small risk of bad behaviour. Also very useful is the Data Theft Prevention facility. This stops hackers and spyware stealing sensitive data from your devices. It can also be used to stop your kids from sending personal information to others, thereby augmenting the usual parental controls. Surprisingly, the password manager is only a free trial, but this doesn't detract from an otherwise well thought out product for the social media age. AVG Ultimate RRP: £69.99 (unlimited devices), US$89.99 Buy from AVG If every internet security product has a focus to differentiate itself in a crowded market, then bundling AVG's System TuneUp tool with s AVG Internet Security in one package puts the emphasis firmly on system speed. Pretty much every aspect of Windows and its activities can be tuned, including visual effects, unused applications, and so on. You can also tune web browsing with Web TuneUp, and there's a Turbo Mode to really get the best performance out of your PC. You can also make applications "sleep" until needed so that they don't use any CPU until you want to use them. Compared to other packages covered here, Internet Security portion of AVG Ultimate seems a little sparse, but hidden away is an artificial intelligence component that can identify malware that isn't known to the AVG ThreatLabs team. A link scanner will keep you safe from dangerous web sites, and Real-Time Outbreak Protection uses crowd intelligence to give your protection a heads up on new threats that may be coming your way. Backing this protection is the Software Analyser that sniffs out suspicious behaviour to block zero day exploits. There are problems, however. The integrated VPN is actually HideMyAss. Despite seeming to be free, this is just a trial. Also, on a default Windows 10 installation, clicking the Web TuneUp button resulted in a message that the default browser (Microsoft Edge) is incompatible, and that it is only available for Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome. These are minor worries considering that with AVG Ultimate, you get genuine "next gen" AI protection, serious system tuning, and unlimited installs for your money. Avast Premier RRP: £49.99 (1 device); £94.99 (5 devices), US$69.99 Buy from Avast Software Avast Premier is the flagship home antivirus solution from this evergreen AV supplier. At first glance it looks pretty much the same as the free version, but contains some interesting tools focused on threat discovery and handling. Smart Scan, for example, not only looks for viruses, outdated software and browser plug-ins with bad reputations, but also reaches out to your network to check for threats on other devices. What's a mystery, however, is how it can tell there are "weak" passwords when some of mine are 16 characters long and all are stored encrypted. Of all the products tested, this is the only one with an inbuilt sandbox accessible by the user, enabling you to run suspect downloads in a safe environment to see if they produce malicious behaviour. At a time when it seems as if everyone is trying to infect you with ransomware, this could be a digital life-saver. Seeing as this is the full, paid-for version of Avast, there are some annoyances. The SecureLine VPN is only a 7-day trial, with further access billed on a monthly, yearly or bi-annual basis. Avast Premier also installs Google Chrome, however the Avast Online Security browser plugin it installs isn’t enabled by default, and isn't installed in Microsoft's new Edge browser. There's an inbuilt password manger that will also let you store notes, and a useful data shredder. You can also create and run a rescue disk to look for persistent threats, but if you're looking for a privacy-heavy solution, you'd need to look elsewhere. This baby is focused on malware, its identification and destruction. Avira Free Security Suite 2017 RRP: Free, Free Buy from Avira Performance is the focus of this product, and a system tune up is available at any time. It will scan for fragmented files that may slow your computer, and the paid version will even optimise your devices after scanning. The dedicated boot optimiser even draws a graph showing how startup changes over time. System scanning can be done in a surprising number of ways, including dedicated scans for all local drives, for removable drives, the My Documents folder structure, all running processes, and even for rootkit action. Unlike many paid-for security solutions, you can also set the priority of the scanner, which is great if you like to perform a full scan in the background. Backing local protection is the Avira Protection Cloud. Unknown files can be automatically sent to check them out against services such as Google's VirusTotal database of known malware signatures. The Avira Phantom VPN comes with 500MB bandwidth, and has a handy readout showing the percentage used. 500MB may not seem much, but used intelligently, it should be plenty. Not installed by default but equally free is the Scout browser, which promises to block harmful sites, protect your privacy, and defend against potentially unwanted programs installing themselves. It even claims to check prices to make sure you're getting the best deal when shopping online. Also included but not installed by default is a software updater, which will install all the latest updates for you. The mobile version covers the usual facilities such as theft control, but also has some useful features, such as alerts when a company that has your details is hacked. Overall, a very capable free package that genuinely gives paid-for solutions a serious run for their money. Panda Free Antivirus 2017 RRP: Free, Free Buy from Panda Security At first glance, Panda's Free Antivirus 2017 doesn’t seem to offer that much, but this is not the case. With a light footprint, this is a bare bones antivirus solution for people who either don’t need the "kitchen sink" approach of a full antivirus suite, or know enough about online security to be able to layer a solution of their own design covering password protection, VPN, parental controls, and so on. So, what do you get? Well, like all antivirus products there's real-time scanning as well as on-demand scans and these are configurable, including explicit protection for inserted USB drives. However, scanning can take time as our results show. A novel feature is the Process Monitor. Unlike the Windows Task manager, this gives you information about the nature of processes, which it rates as secure or otherwise. It also gives you the number of HTTP connections associated with each process, whether the image is signed (an unsigned "Microsoft" image is a sure sign of malware, for example), and where it was downloaded from (for confirmation of dodgy code). Click a process and you can see its details and also block it immediately from running ever again. Like some paid solutions, Panda can also block new executables until information about their reputation has been received from the cloud. Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

To a lesser extent, it will also go up against Apple's high-end, but shrinking, Mac computer business.  Huawei's Matebook X is a fanless notebook with splash-proof screen and combined fingerprint sign-on and power button, priced between €1,399 (RM6,727) and €1,699 (RM8,169). Its Matebook E 2-in-1 hybrid will run from €999 (RM4,803) to €1,299 (RM6,246) while the Matebook D with 15.6in display is priced at €799 (RM3,842) to €999 (RM4,803), it said.  Overall, PC market sales volumes dropped 8.3% in 2015 and a further 3.7% in 2016, according to research firm Gartner, which has predicted a flat outcome this year and increasing market consolidation through 2020.  "From Huawei's perspective, we see opportunities in the PC market's decline," Cheng Lei, senior marketing manager for the PC business, said in a phone interview of the cost-savings and design and manufacturing benefits it gets from its smartphone business.  Huawei, the world's top maker of wireless and fixed-line telecoms equipment, emerged two years ago as the world's No 3 smartphone maker after Samsung and Apple, displacing Lenovo, which remains focused on its computer business.  Huawei's new PCs all run seventh generation Intel microprocessors, Microsoft Windows 10 software and in-house developed software to automate data transfers between Huawei smartphones and its new computer models, Lei said.  Huawei said it aimed to offer the new PCs in 12 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, and the Middle East in early June.  On May 22, HP, the No 2 PC maker behind China's Lenovo and ahead of No.3 Dell, introduced three new consumer models with mostly similar hardware specifications that boasted short-term pricing discounts and a bundle of popular third-party software.  Long-term play  In recent years, the big three PC makers have grabbed most of the growth and market share at the expense other, declining brands, thanks to their diversification and strong position in the commercial PC market. Lenovo and HP each hold around 20 percent while Dell has a 15 percent share globally.  Business PC replacement demand remains stable, Gartner data shows, offsetting shrivelling consumer PC demand in recent years as users rely on bigger-screen smartphones and tablets and cloud data storage instead of new PCs for their basic computing needs.  "If you are in a good position in the business market, you will have more opportunities to increase share," said Gartner consumer and small business devices analyst Mikako Kitagawa.  Huawei plans to keep its PC portfolio simple at first, by focusing on premium consumers while putting off any decision on a move into commercial PCs. "We are now quite confident and will try to expand in new segments in a couple of years," Lei said.  "Our investment in the PC industry is not short-term," the Huawei executive said. "We will have a long-term investment, not only in marketing but in R&D (research and development)."  But Huawei, which has a history of subsidising its entry into new product markets with profits from its network business, two months ago pledged to scale back on heavy marketing in its phone division in favour of more profitable overall growth.  In March, Huawei reported flat net profits for 2016 of just over US$5bil (RM21.48bil) on revenue of more than US$75bil (RM322.27bil).  Huawei also must contend with a slowing smartphone market. Last year, phone shipments fell 1.6%, Gartner estimates, and while they are tipped for modest growth of 3.5% in 2017, they now count on replacements instead of new users.  A year ago, Chinese smartphone rival Xiaomi offered its first laptop aimed at mid-priced consumer users, priced around US$525 (RM2,255), in one of the most competitive segments of the business.  Gartner's Kitagawa said PC-dependent firms had struggled to continue to invest as unit volumes decline and profits shrink compared with the industry levels of 10 or 15 years ago.  "The new vendors already expect they aren't going to make a lot of money," she said. "They have a different mentality". — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Celcom now offers Walla passes for video and music streaming Google adds YouTube to suite of ad tools tracking retail sales Social media trolls spread rumours Facebook signs BuzzFeed, Vox, others for original video shows: sources Brazil appeals court rules Uber driver not entitled to benefits Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Couple whip up surprise win at cookout challenge Monaco sign Belgian midfielder Tielemans from Anderlecht Chew: Come to us for help advertisement Latest News Jury out on North Korea link to ransomware attack Fliers’ electronics get more screening in 10-airport test Xbox adds Netflix-style videogame subscriptions China’s DJI unveils US$499 drone that flies from your hand WannaCry hits Russian postal service, exposes wider security shortcomings Most Viewed in Tech China’s DJI unveils US$499 drone that flies from your hand Huge changes are likely for the new iPhone 8: reports Hackers are now using subtitle files to take over devices WannaCry hits Russian postal service, exposes wider security shortcomings Retailers can’t move fast enough to chase shoppers online Foreign firms fret as China implements new cybersecurity law Xbox adds Netflix-style videogame subscriptions Fliers’ electronics get more screening in 10-airport test Amazon Wants You: Retail giant turns to military vets as it looks for management talent Facebook signs BuzzFeed, Vox, others for original video shows: sources Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Glad you asked... 24 May 2017 at 08:01, Shahin Khan HPC blog Last week, Nvidia held its biggest ever GPU Technology Conference (GTC). The big walk-away is that GPUs are rapidly becoming an expected and standard component of computing, table stakes in many cases, across the computing platform. Big deal right there and hence the frothiness of much of the coverage. Before the conference, I shared the top-4 questions that I was hoping to get answered: This also shows how popular I am on twitter, with one retweet and three likes. Here’s a quick analysis of how the questions fared. Q1. What's next after P100? The P100 was only announced last year and it was quite a feat by itself. People are still clamoring for it if the company’s financial performance over the past year is any indication. So, slideware and a few macho specs about the future would have probably carried the day at GTC17. Would we get more? Well, NVIDIA did not disappoint. We saw actual silicon and detailed spec and real benchmarks: which is a very decisive answer to “so, what comes next?” question. The V100 (V for Volta) is coming by Q3 of this year and it’s a nice clear step above the P100 (P for Pascal). They follow Kepler and Maxwell, nicely ordered alphabetically. Overall, it’s about 1.5x faster than P100 except for Deep Learning kernels for which it is a whopping 12x faster on paper, thanks to the new Tensor cores that specifically target AI workloads. Overall, 5x faster than P100 is what is projected/claimed, which is a much more practical target. Weighing in at a robust 815mm2, oodles of flops of various kinds, and 300W, it’s big, it’s fast, and it’s hot, though it packs enough punch to be one of the most energy efficient chips out there for what it delivers, and it can be used in performance-first or energy-first modes to optimize for one or the other. Here’s a quick comparison: Remember that the taxonomy of computing speed goes from “on paper, but you’ll never see it”, to “guaranteed not to exceed, but if the stars are aligned you might see it”, to “possible, if you optimize things well”, to “typical, but it could be lower”. And in general, you’d better look at the minimum speed as much as you look at maximum speed. For the workloads that are fast emerging, and the optimized frameworks and system software that is available, GPUs and other forms of what we call High Density Processing (HDP) is the way to go. Our refrain these days is: digitization means lots of data, and making sense of lots of data increasingly looks like either an HPC problem or an AI problem. The chip targets that sweet spot. So what’s a tensor? A single number is a “scalar” (zero dimension, or “index”). A row of numbers is a “vector” (1 dimension, or index). A 2-dimensional row-column of numbers is a “matrix”. A Tensor is just a generalized definition of such mathematical objects, an n-dimensional object that follows specific transformation rules. In Deep Neural Nets (DNN), you get to have layers and layers of “neurons” with coefficients that must be calculated and aggregations that must be tracked, and all of that can be nicely abstracted into tensors. Tensors are common language in physics, relativity, fluid mechanics and such, but their use in AI make them fresh territory in IT verbal landscape. Pretty sure most of the URLs are taken already! And what about Moore’s Law? Nvidia bills the chip as providing a 5x improvement over P100/Pascal in peak teraflops, and 15x over the M40/Maxwell which was launched two years ago. Do the math and yep, it’s better speed improvement than Moore’s Law, in fact more than 4x better. Why/how is that, you might ask. And the answer is pretty much this: we used to gain speed by improving frequency, doing the same things at a faster clip and devoting more and more on-chip circuitry to helping one CPU be faster. Like building an ever more opulent palace. That all changed when multi-core and then many-core and now kilo-core chips came along. Instead of that palace, people started building condos and hotels. And as long as there are enough threads and tasks in your app to keep it all occupied, you get better throughput and faster turn-around. With 5,120+2,560+640=8,320 cores of various types, the V100 is an 8 kilo-core chip. Bytes are way ahead but, yeah, cores too can be counted like Bytes can. Q2. What's new on client side? Nvidia rolled out a new deskside beast, the DGX Station, which packs 4xV100s. At 1.5KW, you’d expect it to come with a big noisy fan, but the box is liquid cooled. Closed loop so you don’t have to call the plumber, but it makes it nearly noiseless. At about $70k, it’s not quite your average “client” machine, it’s more of a “laptop of the gods”! Personal AI Supercomputer is how it was billed. But it looks like a workstation and counts! We didn’t notice any news on a follow on to the GeForce® GTX 1080 Ti, Nvidia's flagship gaming GPU, based on the Pascal GPU. Q3. What's up with OpenPower? We still think the real battle in server architecture is between Intel’s in-house coalition and what has come to be known as the Rebel Alliance: IBM’s OpenPower industry coalition. Intel has its all-star team: Xeon Phi, Altera, Omni-Path (plus Nervana/Movidius), while OpenPower counters with a dream team if its own: POWER, Nvidia, Xilinx, and Mellanox (plus TrueNorth). The all-in-house model promises seamless integration and consistent design, while the extended team offeres a best-of-breed approach. Both camps are pretty formidable. Both had merits. And there is real differentiation in strategy, design, and implementation. Last year, the Rebels held their event with GTC. Not this year. And despite our continuing enthusiasm for some solid competition, and market checks that seem to indicate the Rebels are doing quite fine, we haven’t seen as much of OpenPower this past year as we had expected. So it was quite reassuring to see the V100 come with a way faster NVLink interconnect technology. The second generation NVLink moves data at 300 GB/s. That’s 6 links each at 25 GB/s, equalling 150GB/s with a 300GB/s total out + in data rate. What is also significant here is the improved scalability for multi-GPU/CPU configurations. NVLink supports CPU mastering and cache coherence with IBM Power 9 CPUs. That’s a pretty big deal and a nice boost for the Rebels. Q4. What's the plan to keep ahead of new AI chips? The competition in AI chips is heating up and we expect to see several new AI chips and architectures to show up in the coming months. They’re really optimizing for AI workloads which means lower-than-64-bit arithmetic and multiply-accumulate (MAC) instructions, multiple pipelines, separate integer and floating-point paths, related register/memory design, etc. No doubt, you noticed the new Tensor cores in the V100 and wondered what it is. Each tensor core can do 64 multiply-add ops per cycle. It multiplies 16-bit numbers into 32- bit intermediates and adds them to 32-bit numbers, resulting in 32-bit numbers. That's 2 FP ops per cycle in mixed precision. There are 640 of them (8 per streaming multiprocessor(SM) and there are 80 of those) all running at 1.455 GHz so 64*2*640*1.455=119+ TFlops, so that’s where the 120 Tensor TFLOPS comes from. Now, the P100 was pretty beastly for AI work and this just raises the game in a big way. Could you use even lower precision and make it go even faster? Yes, you could. But as you reduce precision, you’re going to need either well-behaved problems or more neurons and more layers to make up for it. And the V100 is still good for a lot of other workloads, which is a clear difference between it and the chips that go all the way with AI and, in the process, make themselves unsuitable for other workloads. Anything else? Nvidia also announced an immersive collaboration suite called Holodeck, showed off how deep learning an help out in complex ray tracing graphics to improve resolution, driverless car technology that can assist the driver, some cool work with AI software stack and containers, an updated DGX server now with 8xV100s, and HGX-1, a server for cloud computing that can easily vary the ratio of CPUs and GPUs that can be provisioned.

The new Surface Pro changes the naming convention that the company had been following since the launch of the first Surface device in 2012. The new device should have been known as Microsoft Surface Pro 5 according, but instead is only known as the Microsoft Surface Pro. The new Surface Pro is the latest device in the Surface lineup after the launch of Microsoft Surface Laptop, and joins the Surface lineup that includes the Surface Studio, and the Surface Book. The company has improved the device by adding 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake processors in addition to redesigned internals. The most important improvement that reaffirms Microsoft’s commitment to the surface brand is the improved battery life with estimated backup of up to 13.5 hours. The company claims that the latest device can give about 13.5 hours of battery backup, which, if true, marks about a 50 percent jump in battery life from Microsoft Surface Pro 4. In addition to the battery life, the new Surface Pro comes with a second generation hinge which will allow the device to be used in a ‘Studio’ angle at the 165-degree angle, same as the angle in Microsoft Surface Studio. Lisa Eadicicco for Time points out that “Some of Microsoft’s design choices with the new tablet are a sign that the company is aiming the device at the professional, creative and educational worlds.” The company has also improved the design of the processor by introducing a fan-less Core m3 and Core i5 designs, making them the quietest Surface Pro devices so far. The Core i7 version of the device will come with a fan to keep it cool under high temperatures. “I didn’t realize how many fanless devices I use until I spent an hour playing Civilizations VI on a roaringly loud Surface Pro 4, so I’ll be curious to see how good the passive cooling on the new Surface Pro might be, and whether Microsoft will throttle performance to keep the device’s temperature down,” says Alex Cranz for Gizmodo while taking about the new fan-less design. He went on to add, “To be sure, this isn’t a revolutionary redesign for he Surface Pro line. It’s a standard refresh. The faster chipsets and fanless design are welcome, but it would’ve been nice to see Microsoft embrace some more ambitious ideas this time around.” The second most important component that Microsoft improved on is the new Surface Pen with improvements in the pressure sensitivity of the pen with up to 4096 levels, reduction of activation force and ‘Tilt’ feature which detects the angle of the pen. The ‘Tilt’ feature is essential for artists as it enables shading and increases accuracy while inking. The pen will not come bundled with the new Surface Pro. Instead, it will be sold separately for $99 (roughly Rs 6,418). The new Surface Dial can now be used with the Surface Pro. Last but not the least, the company is also offering LTE versions of the new device available from later this year. Chris Matyszczyk from CNET states, “The computer itself is, indeed, a small step. The mood Microsoft is setting, however, is allowing small steps to accumulate into one big one.” He continues to elaborate the point that Microsoft is following a mature approach to gain credibility by adding, “Credibility is hard to achieve, especially after years of losing so much ground. This presentation, however, is another step in a very credible direction. Especially when Apple’s attempts to boost its laptop offerings have been, well, a touch labored.” Publish date: May 24, 2017 1:37 pm| Modified date: May 24, 2017 2:08 pm Tags: Microsoft, Microsoft Surface, Microsoft Surface Laptop, microsoft surface pro, Microsoft Surface Pro features, Microsoft Surface Pro India, Microsoft Surface Pro price in India, New Surface Pro, Surface, Surface Pro Also read Microsoft Surface Laptop with Windows 10 S leaks ahead of official launch First press renders of the Microsoft Surface Pro leak, expected to launch next week in China X Recommended For You New Microsoft Surface Pro vs Surface Laptop: Which one you should get Microsoft announces a new custom version of Windows 10 for China Microsoft Azure and Citrix partnership is helping customers to digitally transform, says Satya Nadella Microsoft makes the Surface Pro official; offers better battery, LTE and new processors Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software MateBook X is a Perfect Bounce Back Attempt by Huawei May 24, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Facebook Messenger New Update is All about Easy Access to What You Care About Apple Revolutionary iPhone will be Smaller Despite a Bigger Display, Reveal New Leaks The anticipation was high last year, when Huawei announced its MateBook lineup. However, it slowly faded off after being revealed that the products were being introduced as convertible. Now, Huawei is rebuilding that hype with its new range of MateBook devices, and this time, it seems like it’s up to the mark. At first place, Huawei has completely ditched the 2-in-1 factor by ditching convertibility and touchscreens. The new MateBook X is now essentially a pure laptop with aesthetics that follow the likes of top brands like the MacBook. The 13-inch device on the hardware front offers processing powers of Core i5/Core i7 processors from Intel, which is a huge upgrade from the less-powered Core m processors used in the last batch. The device also offers stunning 2K resolution with an aspect ratio of 3:2. Matebook X will also come out in RAM variants of 4 and 8 GB, and storage variants of 256GB and 512 GB SSD. Additionally, it will also be packed with other features like USB-C connectivity, Dolby Atmos sound system, and fingerprint sensors to name a few. Huawei also hasn’t parted ways with the original form factor of the MateBook series, and that role will this time be fulfilled by its MateBook E laptops. The 2-in-1 touchscreen convertible features a similar design as that of the original MateBook, but with improved processing power and a 2K display. Apart from that, Huawei is also offering something for the wider audience in the form of MateBook D. The 15-inch device will have a Full HD display along with decent spec-sheet that includes RAM support of up to 16 GB, storage support of up to 1 TB via hard drive, and option to boost your gaming with the addition of Nvidia GeForce 940 MX graphics card. Pricing of the new devices are yet to be revealed. Huawei will be shipping the first batch of its new MateBook devices as early as summer this year.
