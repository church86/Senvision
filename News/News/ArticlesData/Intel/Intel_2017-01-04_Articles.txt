Video provided by AFP Newslook Crowds gather to see a BMW concept vehicle at the BMW Group news conference Wednesday at CES in Las Vegas. (Photo: Walden Kirsch/Intel Corporation) LAS VEGAS — Not that long ago, checking in on the state of self-driving car technology meant asking Google's engineers how they were doing. The search company was virtually alone on the autonomous car highway. But in the last four years, that road has gotten crowded. The Consumer Electronics Show has served as a leading indicator of the growing interest in self-driving tech, eventually welcoming to what traditionally was a gadget-fest more than a dozen automakers. Two years ago, Ford CEO Mark Fields even delivered the keynote, a spotlight previously reserved for the likes of Bill Gates. This year, CES, which wraps here Sunday, again puts a spotlight on the mounting competition between not just the automakers but also the suppliers vying to provide the high-tech components that allow vehicles to navigate through a world of obstacles. It's clear now that engineers are able to make cars drive themselves. The bigger issue is how to scale this technology in a way that finds it both culturally embraced and scientifically sound — and is cost effective. As tech companies such as Nvidia, Intel, Harman join major auto brands such Audi, BMW and Volvo — 500 auto-tech companies large and small came to CES this year — in showing off their chips, sensors and smart cars, one has to wonder if this is a winner-take-all contest or if we're creating competing standards that could delay the arrival of a self-driving future. "There's a lot of desire to be the ones who can get there first and monetize this market for self-driving cars and it's causing almost a frenetic activity across the automotive industry, both from automakers and from tech companies," said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. If the various self-driving car booths here had a singular mission, it was to showcase how much safer the driving world can be thanks to technology. Delphi's Mary Gustanski explains the display inside a self-driving Audi SUV in Las Vegas.  (Photo: Mike Snider, USA TODAY) Auto parts supplier Delphi Automotive gave reporters rides in a 2017 Audi Q5 SUV. Its self-driving system was developed with sensors made by Mobileye and chips from Intel that automatically avoided a collision without input from its driver. "I see the potential for zero accidents and mobility for all simply because drivers have been taken out of the transportation equation," said Doug Davis, who leads Intel's automated driving group. Many automakers have set an eventual goal of zero deaths in their vehicles, remarkable considering that 30,000 die each year in the U.S. and more than a million worldwide. The competition to produce technology that can help car companies reach that milestone is intensifying quickly. AT&T, Intel, Nvidia: latest names in self-driving AT&T announced at CES that it was working with Delphi and Ford on improving vehicle communication with other cars and infrastructure. AT&T is also building a self-driving test center in Michigan with the American Center for Mobility. Intel and Mobileye are working with BMW to deploy 40 self-driving BMWs by the second half of 2017, the companies said here Wednesday. Intel, which announced that it plans to invest in high-definition mapping-firm Here, also is developing autonomous driving hardware and software platforms that could serve as a standard for other innovators to adopt. Meanwhile, Intel competitor Nvidia announced at CES Wednesday that it had landed Germany's ZF Group as its first customer for a car-computing platform powered by its chips that boasts both machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. Big names in the chip game such as Qualcomm and AMD are also in the hunt. "We are going to see cars become the next major platform to battle over for the semiconductor makers," said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research.

"It is by far the hottest area in terms of tech," O'Donnell said. In Harman's demonstration area at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, the company showed off all the various aspects of autonomous vehicles, including smart ride-sharing cars that adapt the car's settings, display and personal audio zones based on riders' profiles.

Also on display was cybersecurity software to protect your car from hackers. Harman's partners in its autonomous car-tech quest include Apple, Daimler Chrysler, Google, IBM and Microsoft. All this collaboration would seem to bode well, but the truth is even those deeply enmeshed in the self-driving car world believe there are many miles to be driven before the masses enjoy this breakthrough. "No one company can do everything," said Dinesh Paliwal, Harman CEO and Chairman. Even though, "the autonomous car is almost here, we are 10 to 15 years out from the day when you have the majority of the cars with smarts that interact with each other through the cloud." In the meantime, expect auto-tech breakthroughs to trickle down into new vehicles in the form of increasingly sophisticated driver-assist features, just as driver-assisted parking and automatic braking have so far. USA TODAY Toyota car gives driver an artificial intelligence buddy And along the way, some companies may fall to the wayside, as did some in the transition from traditional cell phones to today's smartphones. "The next 10 years is going to be as influential in the car and personal transportation world as the smartphone has been in the past ten years," Autotrader's Brauer said. "You are going to see companies disappear because they can't adapt quickly enough." O'Donnell agrees and expects the industry to coalesce around multiple approaches. "It's an exciting area and it’s clear no one owns it. Frankly, it's big enough there may be multiple players."

PSA: Nope, Intel did not acquire Bitcasa Posted Jan 5, 2017 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story A prize for “real-world cryptography” was given to programmers behind AES and the Signal app CES seems to be making some bloggers a little trigger happy with posting. Just a little while ago VentureBeat published a story claiming that Intel had acquired Bitcasa, a cloud storage company that had shut down operations last year. We’ve confirmed directly with Intel that this is not the case, however. “Intel did not acquire Bitcasa,” an Intel spokesperson tells TechCrunch. The information does raise a question though: has someone else acquired it? The farewell note on the homepage from Brian Taptich, the former CEO of the company, seems to imply that it is definitely looking for a buyer — and may have already been acquired: We have no doubt that Bitcasa has found the right home to fulfill a mission that has driven the company from its 2011 beginnings – to eliminate the storage and computing limitations of your connected devices, however small, in the most secure and efficient way possible. We remain optimistic that, before long (and though you may not realize it), Bitcasa’s technology will yet contribute significantly to fulfilling this mission. We’re asking around and will update this post as we learn more. Bitcasa was launched at Disrupt in the Battlefield in 2011, entering the market at a time when Dropbox and Box where just getting on a roll and everyone was getting excited about the potential of the cloud. That business model has proven to be challenging for more than just Bitcasa, with Dropbox seeing a drop in its own valuation and Box seeing ups and downs as a public company as it looks for profitability. Bitcasa had raised just over $20 million, with investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Horizons Ventures.

Intel's Project Alloy is a self-contained VR headset. Image: lili sams/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-01-05 21:11:51 UTC LAS VEGAS — It's no secret Intel is investing heavily in virtual reality.  Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich reiterated the company's commitment to pushing VR forward with Project Alloy, the company's self-contained VR headset reference design, during CES 2017 on Thursday.  SEE ALSO: Here's when Intel's standalone wireless VR headset will arrive I've tried every major VR headset and many of the lesser known ones, so I jumped at the chance to try out Alloy. It's important to remember that the Alloy headset I tried was a prototype reference design. Intel's not going to produce the headsets itself. Instead, its hardware partners will use the existing reference design model and design their own. The first of these headsets will arrive by Q4 of 2017, the company says. That said, the headset is a lot bulkier than it looks in Intel's official images. That's not surprising since the headset contains more computing bits than, say, a mobile VR headset like the Samsung Gear VR, which is really just a plastic shell since the entire VR experience is powered off the attached smartphone. Image: lili sams/mashable The head strap is not too different from the one on the PlayStation VR. Instead of using velcro straps like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, Project Alloy has a plastic hoop that sits on your head, almost like a crown. The design also serves a second purpose: to hold up the front-heavy portion of the headset where the Intel processor, vision processor, RealSense cameras, display and lenses are housed. Even after adjusting it, the headset kept falling down over my eyes and I had to hold it up with one hand several times during my demo. My hope is the headset gets significantly lighter by the time actual headsets based off Alloy launch. Project Alloy is pretty big and bulky Image: lili sams/mashable But I can't knock the hardware for being unfinished since it's just a prototype after all. So what's it like to try out a "merged reality" experience that makes the real world a part of the virtual world? Not too bad, actually.  The game demo I tried out was the same one that Intel showed off during its CES press conference on Wednesday: Project Alloy let's users see each other, cable-free and transforms rooms into immersive gaming arenas #CES2017 #MashCES pic.twitter.com/Bqtmxnx02H — Raymond Wong 📱💾📼 (@raywongy) January 5, 2017 Using the outward-facing RealSense 3D depth cameras, the headset was able to scan the roughly 15- x 15-foot room I was standing in and detect the furniture and objects inside as well. I was given a wand-shaped controller and told my objective was to shoot the drones out of the sky. It wasn't a technically complex demo and the drones weren't hard to take out. What makes Project Alloy unique isn't the mere fact that it's a self-contained VR headset, but that its cameras can scan the objects in your room and make them a part of the game. The headset scans the furniture and objects in the room and maps virtual textures over them make them a part of the VR world. Image: lili sams/mashable So for example, the table in the center of the demo room turned into a generator inside of the VR world and I could walk around it without bumping into it. And the sofa turned into a storage container.  It sounds like a great idea at first until you realize that there's no way to tell the difference between real objects that are now a part of the game world and completely virtual objects.  I prefer a holographic experience, like the kind with HoloLens, where virtual objects are mapped on top of real objects and you can still see them. Though I was a little underwhelmed with Project Alloy, there's no denying that the headset is a glimpse at what's in store for VR headsets. Right now, VR headsets can generate these massive immersive digital worlds, but they're pretty dumb when it comes to actually understanding your physical surroundings. Alloy will help make them smarter.

Can't wait to share the future of VR tech at #Intel press conference. #CES2017 pic.twitter.com/EeRlw6ztdT— Brian Krzanich (@bkrunner) January 4, 2017 The Intel press conference is going to be in VR -- and there are barf bags #CES2017 pic.twitter.com/XNw2cPMJEY— James Martin (@Jamesco) January 4, 2017 An Oculus Rift headset was on every seat for those in attendance, and as a safety measure so was a sick bag, just in case the virtual world was too much for some. Once under way, Intel boss Brian Krzanich led the audience through a series of new experiences Intel believes will change how we all use the technology. (John Locher/AP) One of which was a live sports event streamed in virtual reality for the first time – sitting court side at an NCAA basketball game using the firm’s VOKE VR technology. It’s been used by the NBA in the past for television coverage and 360 replays, but this is a huge step forward. There was something of a landmark moment during the press conference too as the 250 people in the audience became the first to at the same time independently perform an industrial inspection of a building. (John Locher/AP) Using VR, a solar power plant in Moapa River Indian Reservation was inspected. Not satisfied with these eye-catching experiences, Intel also announced plans to work with computer firm HypeVR to create content for Intel’s one-in-all wireless VR system, Project Alloy. (John Locher/AP) So while 2016 might have been all about the big three of HTC, Oculus and PlayStation, Intel appears to have its sights firmly set on being the big name in VR in 2017.

After all no one likes spending $1,000 on a new gadget only to find out that next year’s model is many times an improvement, right? However Intel thinks that they might have a solution to that problem. Making the announcement at CES 2017, Intel has taken the wraps off a device called the Compute Card. This is a credit card-sized computer that packs the guts of a computer inside of it, or at least the main components which according to Intel, include an “Intel SoC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity with flexible I/O options”. While this won’t be used for upgrading your computer or smartphone, Intel envisions that it could be used to help upgrade devices like smart refrigerators, smart kiosks, security camera solutions, IoT gateways, and more. All users have to do is swap out their existing card for a newer model and they’ll be good to go. While you will still need to spend money, it could be cheaper than buying the entire device again. Modular computer upgrades aren’t a new concept, although for some reason they haven’t really taken off yet. Several years ago Razer tried to introduce a similar concept for desktop PCs called Project Christine, but it seems that OEMs weren’t quite as eager to get on board, but hopefully the Intel Compute Card will succeed where Razer failed.

Shares Kaby Lake. (That's 'Kaby rhymes with baby' if you're wondering, according to my press contact over at Intel, though I've heard it called 'Cabbie' Lake by more than a few folks.) Intel's 7th Generation Core processors are now available for everything from 2-in-1 devices to laptops to full blown desktops. And what do you get with the new generation of parts? My Kaby Lake overview covers that, but the main story for desktop users is that Kaby Lake increases the clock speeds and clock speed range of Skylake. This is thanks to refinements in Intel's 14nm manufacturing process, and if you're wondering how much junk is left in the trunk, that's what I'm here to explore. Intel has had unlocked 'enthusiast' processors for a while now, but users interested in a budget-friendly option have generally been left out. The Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition is the one exception, a chip that could overclock well but which was hobbled by a pure dual-core configuration and limited L3 cache. Intel is trying something new with Kaby Lake, bringing out a Core i3 K-series part that supports overclocking. The only problem: it's priced too high to really qualify as a budget option. The Core i3-7350K costs $168 (for 1000 units, so it'll be a bit more at retail initially), compared to the i5-7600K ($242) and i7-7700K ($339). There are other potential options as well, which I'll return to in a minute. Before we get any deeper, anyone new to overclocking needs to understand a few things. First, overclocking results are never 'guaranteed,' so even if everyone and their dog is able to run at 5.0GHz, you might get a dud chip that tops out at 4.8GHz. Trust me on this: it happens, and it's not the end of the world. That goes double now that we're looking at overclocks that amount to around two percent more performance for every 100MHz. Second, if you screw up your chip via overclocking (which is pretty unlikely these days, unless you shove too much voltage down its throat), it's on you—the default warranty doesn't cover overclocking (though you can purchase a protection plan if you want to). Or you can buy a boutique PC that comes factory overclocked. The third point is where things start to get a bit nebulous. Overclocking depends on many factors, including your particular chip, but also your motherboard, CPU cooling, and even less obvious factors like memory and power supply. Basically, don't skimp on most areas and you should be fine. I'm not doing anything exotic here, so if you want to see results with liquid nitrogen (LN2), sorry. Instead, I'm looking at the sort of overclocks most people will go after with a good closed-loop cooler. Let's talk about the test platforms a bit. Meet the hardware I have Corsair's 280mm Hydro 115i closed-loop liquid cooler for the CPU, which should provide ample cooling for most users. For overclocking, I erred on the side of aggressive cooling and set Corsair's Link software to 'Performance' mode rather than 'Balanced' or 'Quiet.' However, I do have to note that the current version of Link doesn't detect Kaby Lake processors—it doesn't show or monitor CPU temperatures, so I had to set fan speed manually. MSI's Z270 Gaming M7 Overclocking Hardware MSI Z270 Gaming M7 Core i7-7700K Core i5-7600K Core i3-7350K Corsair Hydro H115i Corsair Dominator Platinum 2x8GB DDR4 GeForce GTX 1080 FE Samsung 960 Pro 512GB Samsung 850 Pro 2TB Corsair Carbide Air 740 Corsair RM650X Asus Z170-A ASRock Z170 Gaming K6 Core i7-6700K Corei i5-6600K Core i5-6400 On the motherboard front, I'm using MSI's Z270 Gaming M7 for the KBL parts. This is a board that sits near the top of MSI's 'mainstream' Z270 line, with their 'Godlike' line of motherboards designed for those who want to take things to the next level (LN2), but pricing makes those an extremely niche product. The M7 features RGB lighting, auto-overclocking support that can try for up to 5.2GHz if you crank the dial to 11 (no, it didn't work for me), and a nice collection of other features like triple M.2 slots. I've done limited testing with a few other motherboards, including MSI's Z270 Gaming Pro Carbon and Z270 Tomahawk, and overclocking results were similar. The same goes for testing with Asus's Strix Z270G Gaming. There are some practical differences in features and even performance, due to differences in the BIOS/firmware, but so far overclocking hasn't shown any major gaps between modest parts like the Tomahawk and higher end offerings like the Gaming M7. For Skylake comparisons, I've used two different motherboards. First is my standard testbed for Skylake, with Asus's mainstream Z170-A motherboard. The second board is ASRock's Z170 Gaming K6, which supports BCLCK overclocking of non-K processors. This feature was present, then disabled at one point, but now it's back. That makes Intel's i5-6400 and i5-6500 potential options for overclocking as well, if you're willing to go with the ASRock board. Incidentally, word on the street is that Intel isn't very happy with ASRock and others for providing this functionality, and some boards that once had non-K overclocking ended up disabling the feature. I definitely wouldn't count on Z270 boards to support non-K overclocking, but I guess we'll have to wait and see. Anyway, the ASRock Gaming K6 using the latest P7.20 BIOS still works with an i5-6400, a $185 true quad-core part, meaning an extra $15 compared to the i3-7350K. That adds a third Skylake comparison point to the overclocking charts. Overclocking settings There was a time when overclocking required a certain amount of finesse and skill. These days, you can get 98 percent of the maximum performance with very little thought or effort. Adding faster RAM and manually tweaking timings might be interesting for a small subset of users, but most enthusiasts are content to adjust the CPU multiplier, resulting in 100MHz steps (or 50MHz on some AMD CPUs). This is the approach I took here, tuning the multiplier and voltage and running some stress tests to find a stable result. Here's the high-level overview, with some additional notes below. The Skylake chips are pretty straightforward. Both the i7-6700K and i5-6600K managed to run stable at 4.7GHz. 4.8GHz was almost stable, but a few tests would occasionally lock up, even with additional voltage. The i5-6400 is a different beast, where you can't adjust multiplier but have to tweak the BCLCK, and in the process you need to disable some of the power saving features like SpeedStep and C states. I was able to hit 160MHz BCLCK with a 27X multiplier, yielding a decent 4.3GHz clock speed. There are drawbacks (like idle power, which is about 30W higher than most other Skylake/Kaby Lake CPUs), but it ends up being a very capable chip. It also ends up with the highest overclock, in terms of percent increase over stock—4.3GHz being nearly 40 percent higher than the 2.7-3.3GHz the chip runs at stock. For the X99 chips, there are more options available, like per-core overclocking on Broadwell-E parts. I decided not to try for the final 1-2 percent performance increase and just apply the same overclock to all cores. I know that in testing, the i7-6950X appears to have three cores that could go higher (they're typically 5-10C lower during stress testing than the other cores), but that will vary by chip. Finally, we have the three Kaby Lake processors. I had hoped to hit 5.0GHz on Kaby Lake, but I only managed that with the i7-7700K. Depending on yields, this could be the result of binning (the best chips become i7-7700K while lesser chips become i7-7700 or i5-7600K for example), or it could just be luck of the draw. The i3-7350K and i5-7600K both ended up at 4.9GHz, coming up just short of the hallowed 5GHz land of milk and honey. Interestingly, the i3-7350K with an inexpensive cooler (an old Intel boxed air cooler from a Haswell or Ivy Bridge chip, believe it or not) could still run fine at 4.8GHz, which is something to keep in mind. The higher power draw of quad-core parts will require something more, however. I have to admit to being a bit sad that all three Kaby Lake samples I tested topped out at 4.9 or 5.0GHz. Either I got a bit unlucky, or the 14nm+ process is only good for an extra 200MHz or so with overclocking. With MSI's board actually shooting for 5.2GHz via auto-overclocking, it got my hopes up. Still, this is the first time I've had an Intel chip running at 5.0GHz fully stable. I've been stuck in the land of 4.x GHz going back as far as the Pentium 4 days Intel has added a new feature with Kaby Lake that factors into overclocking—or rather, they brought over a feature from Broadwell-E and Xeon processors. AVX instructions can use more power and create some instability with overclocking, so Intel added an AVX offset multiplier. The values start at 0 and go down (negative), and when the CPU runs AVX instructions the multiplier will drop by the specified amount. In practice, this didn't matter on any of the CPUs I benchmarked...except for the i5-7600K, where I set AVX offset to -1 in order to successfully complete y-cruncher without throttling or other errors. Anandtech's overclocking testing offers a bit more detail on AVX offset, but they weren't able to surpass a 5.0GHz overclock, either. Careful, those pins are fragile! Overall overclocking performance As with the main Kaby Lake overview, I have limited performance results when it comes to gaming. I've done a bit of testing with i7-5930K and confirmed that the increased CPU core counts on Haswell-E and Broadwell-E don't do much for gaming performance, so I'll only report gaming performance for the Kaby Lake and Skylake parts, while I'll show the full suite of CPUs for non-gaming tests. Here are the non-gaming results—note that this is a gallery of slides, so click the small arrows for the individual results. (If you want to see non-overclocked performance, you'll have to look at the main Kaby Lake piece, but I'll discuss the overall performance improvements below.) Image 1 of 10 Image 2 of 10 Image 3 of 10 Image 4 of 10 Image 5 of 10 Image 6 of 10 Image 7 of 10 Image 8 of 10 Image 9 of 10 Image 10 of 10 What's the best overclocking chip? If you're talking about the potential for improved performance, that's easy: it's the i5-6400, where performance increases an impressive 35 percent thanks to the 160MHz BCLK. Is it fair to include a non-K CPU in the charts? You can be the judge, but obviously it makes the value proposition for the i3-7350K very questionable. It also explains why Intel doesn't want to allow BCLCK overclocking on non-K processors, since it eats into the potential market for K-series chips. For the officially overclockable CPUs, the largest increase in performance is the i5-6600K, improving by nearly 20 percent. The i3-7350K comes next, with a 17 percent improvement. The i5-7600K performance is up 15 percent, followed by the i7-6700K at 11 percent, and finally the i7-7700K at just 8 percent. That's pretty much what you'd expect from the base clock speeds—the higher the stock clocks, the lower the potential improvement from overclocking. Looking at the individual performance charts, the three Kaby Lake chips all do great at single-threaded performance, since they have the highest clock speeds and are otherwise the same architecture as Skylake. In other words, if you never want to mess with overclocking, Kaby Lake's clock speed improvements are a nice little bump, but there's little new overhead for overclocking, so the year-old Skylake chips can make up for the speed difference. There are a few tests that clearly favor Intel's architecture over AMD's Bulldozer (y-cruncher for example), but AMD's chips are mostly here as a point of reference—Ryzen will be the real comparison come March. AMD does do pretty well in the VeraCrypt and 7-zip tests, though.  Gaming overclocking performance Image 1 of 16 Image 2 of 16 Image 3 of 16 Image 4 of 16 Image 5 of 16 Image 6 of 16 Image 7 of 16 Image 8 of 16 Image 9 of 16 Image 10 of 16 Image 11 of 16 Image 12 of 16 Image 13 of 16 Image 14 of 16 Image 15 of 16 Image 16 of 16 I don't have current gaming results for all of the processors (yet). That allowed me to fit both the stock and OC numbers into a single chart, which gives a nice view of the full range of performance options. And what we learn isn't too surprising, though the i3-7350K results might raise a few eyebrows. Even at stock, the i3-7350K ends up just 15 percent slower than the fastest overclocked CPU for gaming—in overall performance, at least. Moving to the individual games, Hitman (DX12) is the best result, followed by Ashes of the Singularity. Both improve performance by 40-50 percent moving from stock i3-7350K to overclocked i7-7700K. Total War Warhammer and Civilization VI also show significant gains, at least compared to the i3-7350K. But if you're running any decent CPU, including the overclocked i5-6400, the benefits of moving up to a 'faster' processor are pretty limited. There are also plenty of games where your choice of CPU makes virtually no difference, even with a GTX 1080—look at The Division and The Witcher 3, for example, and Deus Ex, Doom (with Vulkan), Far Cry Primal, and Rise of the Tomb Raider aren't much better. Battlefield 1 single-player also doesn't need a ton of CPU, though the multiplayer game is a lot more demanding. Overall, unless you have a relatively slow CPU (like the stock i5-6400 or i3-7350K), overclocking isn't going to net you a lot of extra performance in games. That's not too surprising, since even in CPU limited situations we don't normally see overclocking help by more than 10-15 percent, but if you're wondering where the bottleneck lies in your gaming PC, look first to the graphics card, second to RAM and storage, and third to your CPU and platform would be my advice—unless you're running a very old/slow CPU. Closing thoughts Kaby Lake is clearly better/faster than Skylake, but while it might be a statistically significant improvement, it's not generally going to be practically significant—especially for gaming. Overclocking doesn't really change the story, as the new chips generally get an extra 200-300MHz compared to Skylake, which in practice amounts to 3-4 percent more performance at best—and in games, not even that. It's great to see all three chips in the 4.9-5.0GHz range, even without a ton of effort. But will the added performance typically be noticeable? No. What about the new entry-level K-series chip, the i3-7350K? It's sort of a cool and novel idea, and it can certainly handle games. However, the price makes it a less attractive option. The i5-6400 with the right motherboard is one obvious alternative, and even if you're not doing non-K overclocking, I'd generally recommend looking at a Core i5 processor rather than the i3-7350K—the i5-6500 goes for $190 online, and runs about 10-12 percent faster (at stock) than the i5-6400 for example. The problem with the i3-7350K is that, in pursuit of saving $20 or so (relative to the i5-6500), you're getting a processor that needs a Z270 motherboard to shine, and in many tasks the additional cores of the i5 will still end up delivering a better overall experience. You could buy an i5-6500 or the new i5-7500, pair that with a less expensive H170/H270 motherboard, and run stock, all for less money than an overclocked i3-7350K plus Z270. In other words, where the Pentium G3258 was interesting primarily thanks to its ultra-budget price, the i3-7350K ends up being far too close to better CPUs to catch my interest. If you're not already running Skylake and were thinking about building a new system, short of waiting for AMD's Ryzen to come out (current ETA is March for retail availability), Kaby Lake gets you another 200-300MHz—stock and overclocked. Don't forget that the K-series CPUs also need a decent aftermarket heatsink, which can add another $30 to $100 depending on how high-end you want to go.  Overclocking is easier now than it's ever been, but the potential gains have shrunk to the point where running stock doesn't mean you give up on a lot of 'free' performance.

Mesa 13.0.3 Is Out with Multiple Fixes for RadeonSI and Intel ANV Vulkan Drivers GO The Intel i965 graphics driver also received various fixes Jan 5, 2017 23:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  After teasing users with the Release Candidate development version of Mesa 13.0.3 3D Graphics Library just before the Christmas holidays, Collabora's Emil Velikov announced today, January 5, 2017, the availability of the final release of Mesa 13.0.3. As you can imagine, Mesa 13.0.3 is the third bugfix/stabilization update to the Mesa 13.0.x stable series, bringing a total of 55 fixes for many of the included graphics drivers and libraries, among which Intel ANV Vulkan, Intel i965, and RadeonSI are the most notable. Mesa 13.0.3 3D Graphics Library is coming five weeks after Mesa 13.0.2. Among the changes, we can notice that some memory leaks were plugged from the Intel ANV Vulkan driver, a tess+GS hang workaround was added for VI dGPUs to the RadeonSI driver, which now always restores sampler states when unbinding sampler views. Also, unit tests were added for copy propagation pass to the Intel i965 driver. "Mesa 13.0.3 is now available. This series we have multiple fixes for [Intel] i965 and RadeonSI. The ANV driver has extra smoke testing fixes and memory leaks have been resolved," said Emil Velikov, Software Release Engineer working for Collabora, in today's mailing list announcement, from where you can download the latest archive. It's coming soon to a distro near you Mesa 13.0.3, which is now the most advanced stable version of the 3D graphics library we rely on for Linux gaming and running various OpenGL applications, should soon make its way into the stable software repositories of your favorite GNU/Linux distribution, that, of course, if you haven't already switched to the Mesa 13.1-git. Below you can find attached the full changelog if you are curious to know what exactly was patched or added in this release, and we're also providing you with a download for the source archive if you plan on compiling Mesa 13.0.3 3D Graphics Library yourself. However, this is a recommended update for all users running Mesa 13.0.2 or a previous version.

Devindra Hardawar, @devindra 01.05.17 in Gadgetry Comments 2160 Shares Share Tweet Share Save If you really think about it, "smart" devices today can also count as computers. They have processors, memory and other hardware similar to what you'd find in a PC. But the problem with embedding computing hardware in devices like TVs and refrigerators is that they'll quickly grow obsolete. Simply put: to get a faster TV, you have to buy a whole new one. Intel is hoping to change that with Compute Card, a new platform for credit card-sized modular computers that can easily be swapped in and out of smart devices. The idea is that when new Compute Card hardware is available, you should be able to just plug it into your TV or refrigerator. They include Intel SOCs (system-on-chips), memory, storage and networking capabilities. "Device makers simply design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then utilize the best Intel Compute Card for their performance and price needs," the company wrote in a statement. "This reduces the time and resources needed to design and validate the compute block and helps speed up innovation to bring the power of intelligence into an ever wider range of devices." Given just how powerful mobile hardware is becoming, and the ongoing problem of smart devices becoming obsolete, it makes sense for Intel to pursue the Compute Card. It's also teamed up with the likes of Dell, HP, Lenovo and Sharp to develop the platform, and its early hardware partners include Seneca Data, Infocus and others.Click here to catch up on the latest news from CES 2017.

To meet the needs of gamers everywhere, Asus refreshed its lineup of Republic of Gamers laptops, and they all come with the latest Intel processors and Nvidia graphics cards. The GX800VH is full of drool-worthy components. One GeForce GTX 1080 wasn't enough, so Asus dropped in two in SLI. Along with a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor, those components produce a lot of heat, so Asus equipped this laptop with its Hydro Overclocking liquid-cooling system and thermal dock. The 4K display is an 18" IPS panel with G-Sync support. The MechTAG keyboard is equipped with mechanical switches and customizable Aura RGB LED lighting effects. Asus's G752 and G701 laptops are slightly more modest machines, if laptops with unlocked Intel Core i7 processors can be called that. In both machines, Asus pairs the processors with DDR4 memory clocked at 2800 MT/s. Both models sport displays with 120Hz refresh rates and G-Sync support. The G752 packs a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 card and uses Asus's 3D Vapor Chamber tech for GPU cooling. The G701 steps things up a notch with a GeForce GTX 1080. The company is also updating its smaller gaming laptops. Asus's 15" GL502 and 17" GL702 can be fitted with CPUs up to a Kaby Lake Core i7 model. Buyers will also be able to choose between Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1070 or GTX 1060 cards. Both laptops are equipped with 120Hz, G-Sync-toting displays. The last two Asus ROG laptops to get the Kaby Lake treatment are the GL553 and GL753. Those machines also get upgrades to Intel Core i7 CPUs and a choice of GTX 1050 Ti or GTX 1050 cards.

Thursday, January 5, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Intel Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake Review Mark Walton (Hacker News): The Intel Core i7-7700K is what happens when a chip company stops trying. The i7-7700K is the first desktop Intel chip in brave new post-”tick-tock” world—which means that instead of major improvements to architecture, process, and instructions per clock (IPC), we get slightly higher clock speeds and a way to decode DRM-laden 4K streaming video. There are apparently power consumption improvements, however. Dan Luu: Dear linkbait authors, I’m pretty sure Intel is trying. If you look at research $, they appear to be trying exponentially harder over time. Marcel Weiher: We are in an effective post-Moore’s law world, and have been for a couple of years. Yes, we can still put more transistors on the chip, but we are pretty much done with single core performance, at least until some really big breakthrough. […] Most of the things that go into squandering CPU don’t parallelize well, so removing the bloat is actually starting to become cheaper again than trying to combat it with more silicon. Lloyd Chambers: [There] are at least a few reasons why the Intel ‘Kaby Lake’ release is significant: Improved graphics performance. My understanding is that the Kaby Lake ‘H’ series supports 32GB memory, thus making a MacBook Pro with 32GB of DR 23000 DRAM possible. But whether the power draw is viable on a laptop is unclear (meaning what we could expect from Apple, given the rationalizations seen with the Nov 2016 MacBook Pro). The i7-7920HQ 3.1 GHz (turbo boost to 4.1 GHz, 4 real CPU cores) might be suitable for a MacBook Pro. The i7-7700K 4.2 GHz (turbo boost 4.5 GHz) shoudl be suitable for an iMac. This perhaps is the “standstill” point—that’s only 5% faster than the 4.0 GHz iMac 5K that sits on my desk today—at the cost of a 95 watt TPD. Paul Haddad: Every PC manufacturer today announced Kaby Lake updates. I’m guessing Apple will wait until at least April to announce a MacBook with one.

At first glance, it's easy to mistake the modular computer for a credit card or smart card. It's so thin, it could be easy to lose. But it's a full blown computer, crammed with a 7th Generation Intel Kaby Lake processor, memory, storage, and wireless connectivity. It's so small, it can't accommodate USB-C or other ports to power up or connect to displays. The Compute Card will work only after being plugged into a slot of a larger device, much like smart cards. Here's the bad news: It's not targeted toward PCs. However, we hope Intel will eventually make them for PCs, and there are hints the chipmaker could. The idea of a super-small computer is exciting, and it could solve some problems. For example, computer upgrades could become easier. The Compute Card is targeted at the commercial market, and it could be slotted into all-in-one devices, digital signs, smart devices, robots, drones, and other products. Businesses will be able to add a whole PC into products that otherwise have minimal computing power. That very model could be applied to upgrading PCs. The Compute Card could make PC upgrades simple by just plugging the card into a slot into a computer case. You wouldn't need to go out and buy a whole new PC just to get the latest processors and components. There are many modular PCs available today in the form of mini-desktops from companies that include Acer and Lenovo. Users can add features by connecting blocks to the desktop. It's an economic way for PC buyers to get the features they need at a reasonable price. Intel will start shipping the Compute Card in the middle of this year. The company sees it as a plug-in computer for a plethora of smart devices starting to invade homes and businesses. Potential uses could include smart devices like refrigerators, smart light bulbs, security cameras, and air conditioners. The card could also be used in smart kiosks and internet of things gateways. Intel is working with companies like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Sharp to build specialized slots into devices. Many of them are PC makers, and they may try to build the slots into PCs. The partners will take "advantage of the simplified design, ease of serviceability, and user upgradeability of the Intel Compute Card," Intel said in a statement. It won't be sold directly to consumers and is only available for partners, an Intel spokesman said. Had this product been released last year's CES, it could've been marketed as a PC. Intel has since put more emphasis on IoT, and it hopes to sell billions of chips that go into smart devices. Intel targets its Atom chips at IoT devices, and this is the first time it is targeting Kaby Lake chips at devices in the emerging IoT category.

Credit: Samsung More like this ARM PCs with Windows 10 get a new start with the Snapdragon 835 chip Qualcomm awakens and hopes to crush Intel at its own game The top 10 PC technologies and trends to watch in 2017 Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Microsoft wants a go-to Chromebook competitor, and it may be getting one in upcoming Windows 10 PCs with ARM chips. Those Windows 10 laptops and tablets could look something like Samsung's latest Chromebook Pro and Plus announced at CES. The attractive 2-in-1s have 12.3-inch screens and are targeted at those who do most of their computing online. In a way, Samsung's new Chromebooks share some features with new Windows PCs announced at CES. They have cool features like 2400 x 1600 pixel touchscreens and USB-C ports, which are also in the latest Windows 2-in-1s with Intel's Kaby Lake chips. While Google plots a Chromebook attack on Windows 10, Microsoft could be using Chromebooks as a blueprint for its "cellular PCs," or thin and light laptops that are always connected to the Internet. The new category of laptops will have Qualcomm's new ARM-based Snapdragon 835 chip, which was also announced at CES. Microsoft and Qualcomm last month announced they would work on building the cellular PCs. The Snapdragon 835 chip will give Windows 10 laptops a bevy of features so users can do most of their computing online, much like on Chromebooks. The Snapdragon 835 boasts integrated Wi-Fi 802.11ad, integrated LTE and Bluetooth 5. Those features aren't integrated in x86 chips. Snapdragon 835 also marks a return of ARM chips to Windows PCs. The most recent outing with Windows RT was a disaster, but Microsoft has since refined its approach. Windows RT was targeted at iOS and Android, and ARM-based Windows 10 PCs are aimed at Chromebooks, analysts said. Chromebooks and ARM-based Windows 10 devices will share many traits, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. The first ARM-based Windows 10 PCs, which are due later this year, will be entry-level systems for basic applications and online services. You won't be able to do run intense applications, which still require the more powerful x86 chips, McGregor said. Windows 10 laptops with Snapdragon 835 will be thin, light and offer long battery life, said Cisco Cheng, a Snapdragon evangelist at Qualcomm. It'll run the full fledged Windows OS, and offer the connectivity options never before seen in PCs, Cheng said. For now, Windows 10 on ARM seems a big improvement from Windows RT, which was plagued with usability and application compatibility issues. Microsoft and Qualcomm learned from their mistakes, and tried to rectify the issues. But a larger question remains whether an ARM-based Windows 10 laptop will offer the price and usability compared to Chromebooks, said Jack Gold, principal analyst at J. Gold Associates, in a research note. Many Chromebooks are priced under US$200, and the first ARM-based Windows 10 device may not be that inexpensive. That's because the Snapdragon 835 is an expensive chip, Gold wrote. Nevertheless, Microsoft wants to compete on equal terms with Chrome OS and Android in both mobile and PCs, and a Windows 10 laptop with Snapdragon 835 is one way to do so, he wrote. PC makers haven't announced Windows 10 laptops with Snapdragon 835, but want to test the hardware. There's some caution after the failure of Windows RT tablets, but PC makers find ARM-based Windows 10 PCs intriguing as more data moves to the cloud and the lines blur between laptops and mobile devices. Microsoft tried to replicate the Chromebook model with Intel-based x86 chips by offering free versions of Windows 8 -- called Windows 8.1 with Bing -- to PC makers a few years ago. PC makers built low-cost laptops with basic processors and minimal storage, much like Chromebooks, but the strategy failed. Google also has positioned Chrome OS as a replacement for Windows, but that hasn't worked out so far. Chromebooks are more effective when connected to the Internet, and have limited offline capabilities. Windows, on the other hand, is a full-fledged OS. It was smart of Microsoft to extend the Windows 10 to ARM, Gold said. Putting all eggs in the x86 basket was dangerous for Microsoft, and with ARM as a partner, it has more flexibility in how to conduct business. Chromebooks already run on both ARM and x86 chips. Samsung's latest Chromebook Pro has an ARM processor, while Chromebook Plus has an x86 chip. For ARM, being both in Chromebooks and Windows 10 will expand its footprint in devices. Its dogged focus on mobile is paying off, McGregor said. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Twitter Facebook Intel's Compute Card mini-computer is so small that you may lose it Intel's Compute Card is the smallest and thinnest computer the chipmaker has ever made Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 06 January, 2017 07:28 - - - - print email Comments You've perhaps never seen a full-blown computer smaller than Intel's amazingly thin Compute Card, announced for the first time at CES. At first glance, it's easy to mistake the modular computer for a credit card or smart card. It's so thin, it could be easy to lose. But it's a full blown computer, crammed with a 7th Generation Intel Kaby Lake processor, memory, storage, and wireless connectivity. It's so small, it can't accommodate USB-C or other ports to power up or connect to displays. The Compute Card will work only after being plugged into a slot of a larger device, much like smart cards. Here's the bad news: It's not targeted toward PCs. However, we hope Intel will eventually make them for PCs, and there are hints the chipmaker could. The idea of a super-small computer is exciting, and it could solve some problems. For example, computer upgrades could become easier. The Compute Card is targeted at the commercial market, and it could be slotted into all-in-one devices, digital signs, smart devices, robots, drones, and other products. Businesses will be able to add a whole PC into products that otherwise have minimal computing power. That very model could be applied to upgrading PCs. The Compute Card could make PC upgrades simple by just plugging the card into a slot into a computer case. You wouldn't need to go out and buy a whole new PC just to get the latest processors and components. There are many modular PCs available today in the form of mini-desktops from companies that include Acer and Lenovo. Users can add features by connecting blocks to the desktop. It's an economic way for PC buyers to get the features they need at a reasonable price. Intel will start shipping the Compute Card in the middle of this year. The company sees it as a plug-in computer for a plethora of smart devices starting to invade homes and businesses. Potential uses could include smart devices like refrigerators, smart light bulbs, security cameras, and air conditioners. The card could also be used in smart kiosks and internet of things gateways. Intel is working with companies like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Sharp to build specialized slots into devices. Many of them are PC makers, and they may try to build the slots into PCs. The partners will take "advantage of the simplified design, ease of serviceability, and user upgradeability of the Intel Compute Card," Intel said in a statement. It won't be sold directly to consumers and is only available for partners, an Intel spokesman said. Had this product been released last year's CES, it could've been marketed as a PC. Intel has since put more emphasis on IoT, and it hopes to sell billions of chips that go into smart devices. Intel targets its Atom chips at IoT devices, and this is the first time it is targeting Kaby Lake chips at devices in the emerging IoT category.

Until Intel took (mostly) everyone into a room at CES 2017 and told them to put on an Oculus Rift headset. The virtual reality keynote was an opportunity for Intel to showcase three areas they expect virtual reality to become increasingly prevalent: sports and live entertainment, tourism and, of course, video games. And that meant telling everyone - or at least the press and industry folk who lined up early enough to get inside the conference - to pop on the Oculus Rift in front of them. As far as Intel is concerned, VR can play a major factor in three things: travel, work and play. The travel pitch was pretty simple: imagine you could look and move around your next holiday spot, the hotel room you're going to book, the monument you'd like to go visit. So to demonstrate, Intel fired up a VR experience of flying over the desert, complete with jumping out of a helicopter while wearing a wingsuit. The people in the conference weren't wearing wingsuits, but it was pretty good to see a few queasy reactions. The next part required the co-founder of Hype VR, Ted Schilowitz. While video has enjoyed jumps in fidelity, resolution and quality over the years, it's still predominantly a moving image shot from a single camera, a single perspective. Hype VR and Intel's answer was a high-def video from a Waterfall in Vietnam, viewed through the Rift. The kicker with Hype VR's technology was the ability to move around the physical space in the video, without distorting the perspective or point of view. That theme revolved throughout the conference: being able to control the perspective, to become the cameraman. Perhaps the strongest theme of the keynote was Intel's alignment with real-world sports, both through a deal with La Liga to introduce their 360-degree video technology to three stadiums, and a live broadcast of a college basketball match. The trick with the live basketball match in VR was the ability to look around and choose different camera perspectives. It wasn't a free-roaming camera like one would hope, and when Intel first cut to the game it was half-time (leaving viewers with bugger all to see beyond warmups). The live feed - which took about 40 seconds to beam simultaneously to all the headsets in the conference - was truly live courtesy of a platform called Voke. Voke's currently available for the Samsung Gear VR, and is scheduled for release for the Oculus Rift at the end of the year. Krzanich added that the content available won't just be limited to sports, but music and other forms of live entertainment as well. It's hard not to see it as a future route for pay-per-view content, especially when broadcasters have the ability to overlay statistics and information throughout. As far as work is concerned, Krzanich pitched the idea that virtual reality could be a way to reduce the danger associated with hazardous jobs. Intel then streamed 4K, 360-degree live video from a drone inspecting solar panels, a job that would typically be done by a human. While it wasn't the smoothest feed, it was also pretty functional. The idea is that VR could be used in these situations to scope out hazardous work, or for use in search and rescue missions where conditions make it too problematic for a helicopter and crew to investigate. Intel also showed off the work they've been doing on Project Alloy, their open-source HMD first announced at the Intel Developers Conference last year. All of the sensors and processing power is done in the headset itself, using Intel's RealSense technology and a Kaby Lake Core i7 CPU. There's no word on how it matches up to a Rift or Vive that relies on far beefier hardware - but Intel said they would begin productising Project Alloy by the end of the year. Image: Twitter (@intel) Apart from the promise of a VR headset that doesn't have wires and is hooked into something with more processing power than your smartphone, Intel also pulled off a neat trick with "mixed reality". It's basically a fancy term for scanning the space around you and incorporating that into the environment into the headset, which gets around VR's current problem of not having enough space in your living room to move around. As an example, the stage opened up and showcased two people wearing Alloy prototypes in a faux living room. The couches were transformed into bunkers that could be used for cover in-game, which is wonderful encouragement to leave large objects lying around every now and again. Nobody in the crowd got to get hands-on with Project Alloy, but that was besides the point. The demo, much like the whole keynote, showcased ways in which VR might actually have a role in our day to day lives. The technology behind VR has come an awful long way. But from a gaming perspective, developers are very much still figuring things out. Many titles are little more than short experiences, rail shooters and short experiments lasting no more than a few hours at most. It's still very disposable. But being able to watch live sport, or a concert, or the live feed of a drone, isn't. It's something we already do every day, and will continue to do going forward. The conference helped give VR a place in our lives that made sense, and that was the cool part. The technology is almost there, but what we don't have yet is purpose. It probably still won't happen by the time 2017 comes to a close, especially when you factor in the capabilities of Australian internet. But it's not far off.

Intel unveils Compute Card, a credit card-sized compute platform Posted on 6-Jan-2017 09:44. | Filed under: News : Internet of Things. Intel is announcing a new modular compute platform called the Intel Compute Card, along with a range of partners who will be working with Intel to help accelerate the ecosystem of solutions based on the Intel Compute Card. The new platform is squarely aimed at the Internet of Things projects, enabling more smart and connected devices. The Intel Compute Card is being developed with that in mind, to transform the way compute and connectivity can be integrated and used in future devices.   The Intel Compute Card has all the elements of a full computer, including Intel SoC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity with flexible I/O options so hardware manufacturers can optimize for their particular solutions – from interactive refrigerators and smart kiosks to security cameras and IoT gateways. Intel Compute Card’s modularity and flexibility allows for internal or external integration with certified devices via a compute card slot. Companies will be able to extend capabilities for devices such as digital signage and kiosks, All-in-Ones, smart TVs and appliances   Device makers simply design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then utilize the best Intel Compute Card for their performance and price needs. This reduces the time and resources needed to design and validate the compute block and helps speed up innovation to bring the power of intelligence into an ever wider range of devices.   Intel is working with a wide range of partners who share our vision that the Intel Compute Card could significantly change the way they and the rest of the industry design and productise a wide range of solutions in the near future. These partners are working to develop products that can take advantage of the simplified design, ease of serviceability and user upgradeability of the Intel Compute Card. Intel is proud to be working with leading global partners, including Dell, HP, Lenovo and Sharp, to bring this vision to reality. In addition, Intel is working with a range of regional partners who are all looking to bring unique solutions to their respective markets. These early partners include Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk and Pasuntech.   The Intel Compute Card will be available in mid-2017 and will come with a range of processors options, including the latest 7th Gen Intel Core processors.   More information: http://www.intel.com/ComputeCard...

Intel says virtual reality will replace need to go on holiday World’s biggest computer chip firm says future of travel is in VR from our living room sofas  Share  Comments Bylee bell 10:35, 6 JAN 2017 Technology Audience members react to a virtual reality experience during Intel's CES press conference  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Intel, one of the world’s biggest computer chip companies, has claimed that virtual reality (VR) will replace the need for us to physically travel the world in the future. Announced during the firm’s keynote at CES 2017 , Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said the merging of digital and physical worlds to create amazing immersive experiences, will change the world of travel. It has echoes of Total Recall, the 1990 action movie directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, in which people can buy memory implants of vacations, including those to Mars. “Why do we travel? We want to explore and have adventures and have experiences we've never had; exploring world around us,” Mr Krzanich said. “But VR makes it possible to have these experiences like you’re really there while being in the comfort of your living room. With VR, we're offering a variety of ways to enjoy immersive travel.” Audience members use virtual reality headsets to experience a series of travel, work and play situations The company gave Oculus Rift VR headsets to over 260 reporters in the crowd to back up its statements, taking them on a journey from the comfort of a hotel conference room. In the first VR demo, Krzanich showed the audience what it’s like to jump off a cliff and parachute through a desert valley. The next demo took us to a waterfall in Vietnam, with the audience engaging in what Krzanich called “the world’s first walk-around video experience”, using the firm’s volumetric video technology. Read More Trouble sleeping? These gadgets promise to help you get a good night's kip in 2017 This experience allows you to walk around while a high fidelity video was playing and experience it like you are really there. The video moves with you and allows you to travel and move through the space of the video concept with a VR headset. Powered by Intel partner and computer vision software company HypeVR, the result is incredibly realistic, as instead of just being able to look around in 360, you can peer inside and behind moving objects. Brian Krzanich, Intel chief executive officer, displays the Project Alloy all-in-one virtual reality headset Intel explained this is possible because every single pixel in the scene is mapped in space, and looks ridiculously realistic as it’s not CGI, it’s real, captured material where every single frame is 3GB per frame, taking masses amounts of computing power. Kranich said it is Intel’s goal to deliver this kind of content to many more locations around the world, making it possible to see holiday destinations while walking around your living room.

To finish off the VR conference, the Intel CEO also used the VR headsets to show off the future of sports viewing. With VR, Intel is bringing live sports to audiences at home like never before. Audience members watch the Villanova-Butler NCAA basketball game on virtual reality headsets This is been made possible thanks to Intel’s acquisition of VOKE VR in November last year, a firm that had previously presented sports content including highlights of NFL games in VR. From the Oculus Rift headset, we were able to experience VOKE’s 180-degree courtside views of a basketball game, live in Indianapolis. Read More CES 2017: Samsung unveils a TALKING fridge and a TV that texts you when the football's on The experience includes a score board and choices of different camera angles what you select by hovering over different camera view buttons. You can then view the game like you are really there. And that’s exactly how it feels, like you've been dropped courtside. Intel said it will be among the first technology companies to enable this live sports experience on multiple VR devices, and said the option to view VOKE VR content on Oculus Rift will be available to all later this year. Intel's press conference on Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017, in Las Vegas “Viewers get to decide their point of view,” Krzanich said. “So you’re going to decide, do you want to be on the 50 yard line? Do you want to be courtside at a basketball game? Do you want to be behind the basket to watch the next slam dunk? Do you want to be in the goalie’s position? All of that is possible.” Read More Best TVs of CES 2017 - including LG's 'wallpaper' TV, Samsung's QLED and Sony's glass speaker screen Intel believes this is the future of how we will view sports, giving us an opportunity to go to games that we’d never been able to before. “This is the future of spots,” Krzanich added.

Cannon Lake, which is the successor to “Kaby Lake”, will be an entirely new architecture and the first 10nm process. The smaller the fabrication process of a chip, the less power and heat it generates, opening the door tosignificantly better performance and improved battery life. It's the first time Intel has changed its process size since 2014's "Broadwell" chips. Intel image of first Cannon Lake laptop Krzanich demonstrated a Cannon Lake laptop on stage but did not detail any of the specifications or expectations of the new architecture. It's very early days, so expect a growing volume of information as 2017 wears on. It's not surprising Intel didn't reveal much about Cannon Lake. After all, it only just finished launching Kaby Lake, and the vast majority of laptop manufacturers are heavily pushing new Kaby Lake kit. To reveal how much better Cannon Lake might be would probably hit sales. We'll have more on this as we get it. 0 shares Read Comments Charles Spiegel January 5, 2017, 12:52 am New architecture?

(Credit cards are 0.76mm thick.)Photo by Intel How often do you buy a new TV or smart fridge? (Probably not often.) But how quickly do your appliance's smarts go obsolete? The Intel Compute Card -- a credit-card shaped PC just announced at CES 2017 -- is a stab at making upgrades for big, bulky devices far more easy. While it's not quite small enough to fit in your wallet (it's thicker than five cards stacked together), it is a full-fledged Intel computer with a 7th-gen Intel Core CPU, memory, storage, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity all packed into a slottable, swappable cartridge form. (It uses what Intel's calling a "USB-C plus extension connector" to provide USB and PCIe data connectivity along with both HDMI and DisplayPort video signals to the devices it goes inside. I guess Intel's Thunderbolt, which does the same thing, couldn't quite fit.) 5 Intel's pocket-sized Compute Card will update your IoT devices Intel doesn't necessarily see you slotting this into your existing computer -- it's more likely to appear in (what are currently) harder-to-upgrade devices like smart TVs, refrigerators and other appliances, cars, digital signs and kiosks. "Device makers simply design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then utilize the best Intel Compute Card for their performance and price needs," writes Intel. If this sounds familiar, you might be thinking of the Intel Compute Stick -- but that device is quite a bit different. 50 All the cool new gadgets at CES 2017 Intel tells CNET it will make the Compute Card and slots itself, but that a whole host of partners are currently exploring the best way to use it, including HP, Dell, Lenovo, Sharp, Seneca, DTx, InFocus, TabletKiosk and Pasuntech. The Compute Card should be available in mid-2017, says Intel. You can read more about Intel's connected car ambitions in my colleague Stephen Shankland's piece here.

Skip to main content PC Games news and reviews from PCGamesN.com Reviews Hardware About Intel|4 January 2017 Intel Core i5 7600K review: Kaby Lake’s overclocking hero and new gaming king By Dave James If I’m being honest the new Kaby Lake launch has been a bit of a damp squid. I’m aware that’s not the traditional phrasing, but the new Intel Core i7 7700K bears more relation to a soggy cephalopod than it does a firecracker. As ever though, for us gamers, it’s the cheaper Core i5 which is arguably more interesting and the i5 7600K right now is looking like the go-to Kaby Lake chip for gaming. A good solid state drive can make a big difference to your machine’s performance, so check out our guide to the best SSDs for gaming. I rarely give a pair of fetid dingo’s kidneys about a new Core i7 unless it’s got more cores in it than a boozy West Country cider. And so it has come to pass with the new Kaby Lake Core i7 - it’s a frickin’ yawn-fest. A CPU generation’s K-series i5 however is still able to deliver almost identical levels of gaming performance but for a significantly reduced price. And the same is true here, with the 7600K at $243 (£230) being over $100 cheaper than the 7700K. Click on the jump links below to get to your favourite techie bits quick. Intel Core i5 7600K benchmarks Intel Core i5 7600K performance Intel Core i5 7600K verdict Intel Core i5 7600K specs As it’s a Core i5 processor the big difference between it and the i7 is its lack of HyperThreading. Intel’s HyperThreading allows a single CPU core to process two threads simultaneously, giving it greater multithreaded grunt than it would normally possess. That means, while the Core i7 7700K is able to effectively operate with eight virtual cores, the Core i5 7600K has to make do with only four actual cores. If you’re doing a lot of CPU-intensive media work, such as image manipulation or video/3D rendering, those extra processing threads make a huge amount of difference, but when you’re talking about gaming, not so much. We may be living in a world where games consoles have many, many CPU cores but still our games benefit most from having really good single-threaded throughput. That’s why AMD’s previous processor architecture foundered so badly - Bulldozer hedged its bets on a multithreaded future which still hasn’t quite happened - and why Intel still rules the roost in terms of the best CPUs for gaming. Like the i7 Kaby Lake chip, the i5 7600K has also had a relatively healthy speed bump over its predecessor. The Skylake version runs at 3.5GHz out of the box, with a 3.9GHz Turbo, while this Kaby Lake chip starts at 3.8GHz and Turbos up to 4.2GHz. Straight away that gives the new chip an advantage. Though the same could be said for the rival Kaby and Skylake i7 chips, and look how that turned out… Elsewhere it’s much the same story as with the previous generation’s i5. It’s still rocking a 91W TDP, 6MB of cache and the same socket and memory compatibility configuration. As it’s a Kaby Lake chip though it does come with the new media engine inside it, which means you can now stream 4K content from Netflix to your PC. If you get the upgraded Netflix sub, have a 4K monitor and remember to use the Edge browser.  The Edge browser. The one Windows keeps telling you to use. No, it’s not Internet Explorer. Well, it kind of is. Anyway, it’s the only one that’s allowed to talk to Netflix’s 4K catalogue, so just use it for that and don’t blame us. The i5 7600K also has some CPU graphics silicon inside it too, but we’ve all got graphics cards in our PCs, right? So we can pretty much ignore that right now… Intel Core i5 7600K benchmarks   Intel Core i5 7600K performance Inevitably the straight CPU performance of the Core i5 7600K is off the pace compared with the much more expensive, eight-threaded i7 7700K, but because of its relatively high out-of-the-box clockspeed it’s mighty close in terms of single-threaded grunt. That higher clockspeed also means it’s got the jump on its i5 6600K predecessor.  Those single-threaded performance numbers here are key when you shift focus to the gaming performance of the 7600K. Because the i5 performs so closely to the i7 when it’s prioritising a single thread the gaming frame rate difference is, to all intents and purposes, invisible. Even in the CPU-aware DX12 and Vulkan APIs it’s difficult to discern any variation in gaming performance. The synthetic Time Spy DirectX 12 benchmark does though highlight the disparity on the CPU side, with the i5 7600K showing a much lower CPU score than the i7 7700K. Maybe when games are built from the ground up for DX12 the differences will become more stark in frame rate terms, but until then why would you, as a gamer, need an i7? There are, however, obvious differences when it comes to the relative storage performance of the two CPUs. When plumbed into the system’s PCIe bus the sequential speeds are almost identical, but when you look at the random write performance there is a drop-off with the i5. The Core i5 7600K is also a touch slower in terms of compressing and unpacking a mixed media folder. Where things get more exciting is in the overclocking stakes. This is more like it. This is what we were hoping for from the 14nm+ lithography of Kaby Lake. Without the HyperThreading of the i7 7700K our Core i5 7600K blasted past the 5GHz mark with ease. Our sample ran all the way up to a rock-solid 5.1GHz, only tapping out when we pushed it up towards 5.2GHz - and even then it was still booting. Looking at the 5.1GHz Time Spy benchmark you can see the differences between the two Kaby Lake K-series chips really shrink down. That is though all at the expense of the thermals. Realistically you’re not going to want your expensive silicon to be running at 99°C for long… That’s where features like the Overclocking Temperature Control in the Asus TUF Z270 Mark 1 motherboard really comes into its own. Intel Core i5 7600K verdict The Kaby Lake generation isn’t going to set the world alight the way some of Intel’s previous chips have done. Rather than Process>Architecture>Optimisation it’s seeming a little more like Process>Architecture>Flog horse. The tertiary optimisation phase of Intel’s CPU release cadence is more about consolidation than anything else; certainly not innovation. But the Core i5 7600K still has more about it than the superbly uninspiring i7 7700K. The price is right, the gaming performance is there and it’s able to overclock like a champ. Sure, if you’re sitting on an i5 from any of the last couple of generations you’re not going to gain much from making the upgrade switch, but if you’re starting from scratch then the i5 7600K is great place to build from. You can bet there are going to be some impressive pre-overclocked full rigs released with the 7600K at their hearts. The caveat here though is that if you’re starting from scratch I’d personally be sitting on the fence to wait and see what AMD’s Ryzen CPUs are going to deliver when they finally launch. Normally that technological wait-and-see approach means you're always waiting for the next big thing, but these times are unprecedented - AMD could genuinely bring something worthwhile to the CPU table, and very soon too. The eight-core, 16-thread chip is likely to go head-to-head with the i7, and there’s also going to be an i5-rivalling quad-core, eight-thread Ryzen which could well give the 7600K a real run for its money. But AMD’s Ryzen is still a largely unknown quantity. We’ve seen the demos, the leaked benchmarks and the marketing hype, but until we can put the Intel and AMD chips up against each other on our own test bench I won’t be satisfied. What we do know though is that if you were looking to build an affordable, but high-end, gaming PC right now, you’d want to be sticking a Core i5 7600K inside it. And overclocking the nuts off it too. Intel| Hardware| CPU| Try these free to play games ?

My original Z170 stock-clocked scores vs. the 7600K's Z270 numbers show Cinebench R15 results of 162 against 178 and 582 against 658 for single threaded and multi-threaded performance. The X264 v5 encoding numbers are 14.98fps vs. 16.15fps. The overclocking numbers are 4.8GHz and 5.1GHz for maximum stable OC frequency. Having that extra headroom and slight efficiency/temperature improvements of the 14nm+ architecture (and essentially similar pricing) makes the 7600K the overall better CPU. 1 Reply using your Steam account 29 BJDUK 1 Week ago Aiming to buy a new PC, but doing so during CES... 0 Reply using your Steam account 139 Dave James 1 Week ago Hehe, yeah it just keeps throwing out little nuggets that make you go 'oh, hold on, if I just wait...' 1 Reply using your Steam account Sign in Intel Core i7 6800K reviewIntel Core i7 7700K reviewIntel Core i5 7600K reviewIntel Kaby Lake - all you need to knowBest CPU for gaming Clicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About January 15, 2017 Hands On With The First Open Source Microcontroller 144 Comments by: Brian Benchoff January 5, 2017 2016 was a great year for Open Hardware. The Open Source Hardware Association released their certification program, and late in the year, a few silicon wizards met in Mountain View to show off the latest happenings in the RISC-V instruction set architecture. The RISC-V ISA is completely unlike any other computer architecture. Nearly every other chip you’ll find out there, from the 8051s in embedded controllers, 6502s found in millions of toys, to AVR, PIC, and whatever Intel is working on are closed-source designs. You cannot study these chips, you cannot manufacture these chips, and if you want to use one of these chips, your list of suppliers is dependent on who has a licensing agreement with who. We’ve seen a lot of RISC-V stuff in recent months, from OnChip’s Open-V, and now the HiFive 1 from SiFive. The folks at SiFive offered to give me a look at the HiFive 1, so here it is, the first hands-on with the first Open Hardware microcontroller. Before I dig into this, I must discuss the openness of the HiFive 1, and RISC-V in general. Free Software and Open Hardware is a religion, and it’s significantly more difficult to produce Open Hardware than Free Software. No matter how good or how Open the design is, the production of the first Open Source microcontroller will generate far too many comments from people who use the words ‘moral imperative’ while citing utilitarian examples of why Open and Libre is good. You should ignore these comments, but not just because these people have only read the back cover of the Cliff’s Notes for Philosophy For Dummies. The Openness of the HiFive 1 and RISC-V The biggest selling point for RISC-V chips is that there are no licensing fees, and this microcontroller is Open Source. This is huge — your AVRs, PICs, ARMs, and every other microcontroller on the planet is closed hardware. You can’t study the silicon. If we’re ever going to get a completely Open Source computer, it has to start somewhere, and here it is. With that said, this is an Arduino-compatible board with an FTDI chip providing the USB to serial conversion. If we had a facepalm emoji, we’d use it here. An FTDI chip is not Open Source, and they have designed drivers to break chips that aren’t theirs. The design files for the HiFive 1 were made with Altium, a proprietary and non-Free software. This was the best picture for this section of content. Will Stallman ever say the HiFive 1 is Free as in speech? Absolutely not. Instead, the HiFive 1 is an incrementally more Free microcontroller compared to a PIC, ARM, or AVR. There will be people who will argue – over the Internet, using late-model Intel processors with Management Engines — this is insufficient to be called Free and Open Source. To them, I will simply link to the Nirvana fallacy and ask them to point me to a microcontroller that is more Free and Open Source. Let’s not cut down the idea of an Open Source microcontroller because it’s not perfect on the first release. Hardware Teardown So, what’s in the HiFive 1? The spec sheet is simple enough, the datasheet is complete enough,  although there are some caveats: Microcontroller: SiFive Freedom E310 (FE310) CPU: SiFive E31 CPU Architecture: 32-bit RV32IMAC Speed: 320+ MHz (the stock frequency seems to be about 256 MHz, this can be changed) Performance: 1.61 DMIPs/MHz Memory: 16 KB Instruction Cache, 16 KB Data Scratchpad Other Features: Hardware Multiply/Divide, Debug Module, Flexible Clock Generation with on-chip oscillators and PLLs Operating Voltage: 3.3 V and 1.8 V Input Voltage: 5 V USB or 7-12 VDC Jack IO Voltages: Both 3.3 V or 5 V supported Digital I/O Pins: 19 PWM Pins: 9 SPI Controllers/HW CS Pins: 1/3 External Interrupt Pins: 19 External Wakeup Pins: 1 Flash Memory: 128 Mbit Off-Chip (ISSI SPI Flash) Host Interface (microUSB): Program, Debug, and Serial Communication Basically, the HiFive 1 is the SiFive FE310 microcontroller packaged in an Arduino Uno form factor. The pin spacing is just as stupid as it’s always been, and there is support for a few Adafruit shields sitting around in the SDK. There are no analog pins, but there are two more PWM pins compared to the standard Arduino chip. The Arduino Uno and Leonardo have 32 kilobytes of Flash, while the HiFive 1 has sixteen Megabytes of Flash on an external SOIC chip. The HiFive 1 supports 3.3 and 5V I/O, thanks to three voltage level translators. The support for 5V logic is huge in my opinion — nearly every dev board manufacturer has already written off 5V I/O as a victim of technological progress. The HiFive doesn’t, even though the FE310 microcontroller is itself only 3.3V tolerant. It should be noted the addition of the voltage level translators add at least a dollar or two to the BOM, and double that to the final cost of the board. It’s a nice touch, but there’s room for cost cutting here. Other than that, the only other chip of note on the board is the FTDI FT2232HL, a well-supported but most certainly not Free and Open Source USB to UART chip. This is a two-port chip that provides programming, serial, and debug connections simultaneously. Getting Started With The HiFive 1 The folks at SiFive realize documentation and SDKs are necessary to turn a chip into a development board. To that end, they have a bare-metal SDK and support for the Arduino IDE. The board itself comes with a bootloader, and when you plug the HiFive 1 into a USB you get the equivalent of the Blink sketch from the Arduino. Yes, you too can have Open Source blinkies. What a magical time to be alive. Right now there are two methods of programming the HiFive 1. The Freedom E SDK, and the Arduino IDE. The Arduino IDE appears to be dependent on the Freedom E SDK, so either way, you’ll have to get the SDK running. Right now, the SDK only works under Linux (and OS X, and possibly Cygwin), but support for Windows is coming. For Linux users, the getting started guide is more than sufficient, although it will take quite a while (at least 30 minutes) to build all the tools. Once the Freedom E SDK is installed, support for the Arduino IDE pretty much falls into place. You’ll have to futz around with the Boards Manager, but with a few clicks, you get something fantastic. You can blink an LED with Open Source Hardware.  Actually Programming the Thing Blinking an LED is proof enough this can be programmed, but what about the vast SDK we had to install before getting the Arduino IDE working? Here, too, it’s pretty easy to get the SDK up and running: For this example, I simply changed the ‘hello world’ program shipped with the SDK to a ‘hello Hackaday’ program, compiled it, and ran it. Yes, someone as dumb as me can compile and upload a program to the HiFive 1. This Stuff is Still New, Okay? Before receiving the HiFive 1, I originally planned to benchmark this dev board against other small, common dev boards. The SDK comes with a Dhrystone program, making this the obvious choice. The results were not good, but this isn’t a reflection of the power of the FE310 microcontroller. Allow me to present the shocking infographic you should not pay attention to: Ignore this infographic This test used this Dhrystone Arduino sketch with the Arduino Micro, HiFive 1, and the Teensy 3.6. As you would expect the Arduino Micro performed poorly (but still ten times faster than a mainframe from 1988), and the Teensy 3.6 was extremely fast. According to this benchmark, the HiFive 1 did terribly at barely twice the computing power of the Arduino while running 16 times faster. If this benchmark was accurate, it would immediately spell the end of the RISC-V ISA. The above benchmark is not accurate, and the poor Dhrystone performance was due to incorrect assumptions about the timer’s frequency. I plopped this problem up on the SiFive forums, and a patch was available in a few hours. What does the real benchmark say? That’s a fast microcontroller. RISC architecture is gonna change everything. I love this test. Beginning this review, I originally planned to run a few benchmarks on an Arduino, a Teensy, and the HiFive 1, throw together a graph and spend a hundred or so words on the results.  I got so much more. Right off the bat, we can see the HiFive 1 is fast. Really, really fast. Right now, if you want to build a huge RGB LED display, you have one good option: the Teensy 3.6. If you need a microcontroller to pump a lot of data out, the Teensy has the power, the memory, and the libraries to do it easily. In this small but very demanding use case, the HiFive 1 might be better. The HiFive 1 has more Flash (although it’s an SPI Flash), it has DMA, and it has roughly twice the processing power as the Teensy 3.6. This could be very, very cool, and I can’t wait to see the real life examples of how much the HiFive 1 can push out of its pins. There’s your hundred word review on the performance of the HiFive 1 based on synthetic benchmarks. However, getting this benchmark working revealed far more about the state of the HiFive’s software, and how much support SiFive is throwing at it. Admittedly, I do have a very early version of this board, and the CrowdSupply campaign for the HiFive 1 was only funded last week. No one would expect one of the three demo apps shipped with a newly released board with a mature architecture to be completely broken (unless it’s an Allwinner chip, but whatever). Very few people would expect the devs to get a patch out in less than 24 hours in response to a random person on a support forum. All of this circles back to a single observation on the HiFive 1: It’s new. The HiFive 1 and all RISC-V microcontrollers don’t have a vast market share, user base, or decades of work behind them. However, the SiFive team seems to be taking their work seriously. They’re fixing the problems they have, and they’re constantly pushing out new documentation. This is great, and a very good indication of how much support the RISC-V chips from SiFive will have. Chips As A Service I should note that the folks at SiFive aren’t in the business of building RISC-V Arduino boards. They’re in the business of making chips for people. This is custom silicon we’re talking about here. The easiest parallel to draw is between SiFive and OSH Park. These companies don’t have their own manufacturing capability; the value is in connecting end users (engineers, startups) to manufacturers. OSH Park connects you to a board house that really knows purple, and SiFive connects you to a chip fab. In the case of the FE310, that’s TSMC. For anyone who wants silicon you can study, this is great. No, it’s not as simple as sending a board off to a fab house, but it’s a start. The fact that SiFive chose to start with Open Hardware is great, and we can’t wait to see the other hardware made with their sweat and hydrofluoric acid. Update: You can already get your hands on the RTL for the SiFive chips if you want to run the cores on your own FPGA. It’s a Beginning At the base level, the HiFive 1 is a powerful microcontroller with a lot of Flash, with support for hundreds of Arduino libraries. That’s great, and alone this might be worth the $60 price of admission. However, the big story here is the Openness of the HiFive 1. Is it completely open? No. the HiFive 1 itself uses an FTDI chip, and I’ve heard rumor and hearsay the FE310 chip has proprietary bits that are ultimately inconsequential to the function of the chip. A strict interpretation of Open Hardware will not allow this board to be called Open Hardware. Those who advance this interpretation are dumb, and to counter this argument I will quote the man himself: …We need to distinguish levels in the design of a digital product (and maybe some other kinds of products). The circuit that connects the chips is one level; each chip’s design is another level. In an FPGA, the interconnection of primitive cells is one level, while the primitive cells themselves are another level. In the ideal future we will want the design to be free at all levels. Under present circumstances, just making one level free is a significant advance. – Richard M. Stallman, Free Hardware And Free Hardware Designs A design that fails to be completely Open does not deserve to be grouped with designs that are explicitly closed. Nevertheless, this is the best we have so far, and it is only the beginning. We’re going to have more microcontrollers that are more Open, but until then, the HiFive 1 is actually a pretty cool board.

I had to do a double-take at that second performance graph, though… at first I was thinking “oh, with the fixed test it’s still only half as powerful as a Teensy?”, before I realized that the green and purple bars had switched places. Report comment Reply daid303 says: January 5, 2017 at 2:10 pm While it is showing great performance. It is a bit apples vs oranges. As the chips run at vastly different frequencies. Score per Mhz is: AVR: 0.631 Teensy: 1.239 HiFive: 1.557 Which also isn’t a really good comparison. But it still comes out on top. Next interesting metric, MIPS per Watt. Report comment Reply Traumflug says: January 6, 2017 at 3:45 am As soon as you show me an ATmega or a Cortex-M0 running at 260 MHz I’ll perfectly agree. Until then, achievable clock frequencies are part of the performance equitation. Report comment Reply H3g3m0n (@H3g3m0n) says: January 8, 2017 at 12:52 pm I would prefer to see a RISC-V underclocked to M0 speeds and blowing the MIPS per watt out of the water myself. No reason we can’t have the best of both worlds ☺ Report comment Reply MINIMAN10000 says: January 6, 2017 at 7:24 am I second the interest in MIPS per Watt. But I still think HiFive having more MIPS per cycle while simultaneously having a higher frequency is still impressive. Both metrics are interesting and useful in their own way.

Report comment Reply Tucson Tom says: January 5, 2017 at 10:21 am I guess I just miss the point with open hardware, whereas I have been fully on board with open software for a long long time. The only “open” I need from hardware is good documentation. Report comment Reply ehud42 says: January 5, 2017 at 10:53 am The article covered the a good reason for “open” hardware – licenses. An open hardware design can be fabbed by anyone. This means: lots of (potential) competition around manufacturing to drive cost down. When mainstream manufacturers stop producing, design can easily (from a legal/copyright/license point of view) be sent to someone else to produce a custom run. The other reason is presumably “open” means a better chance at looking into the guts at what makes it tick. This is a bit strawman, as I certainly won’t audit hardware, but someone might. “open” should mean nothing hiding behind NDAs and protective fuses. So, no clever NSA inserted firmware, etc. Report comment Reply Ostracus says: January 5, 2017 at 11:07 am https://counterespionage.worldsecuresystems.com/the-great-seal-bug-part-1.html I think the “Great Seal Bug” demonstrated, one shouldn’t underestimate the cleverness of the intelligence community.

Report comment Reply awjlogan says: January 5, 2017 at 1:06 pm Yes, that’s the rub here and I think software people often don’t appreciate the costs and logistics involved in getting hardware made. You don’t get a chance to go roll out a bug fix or update after release, and you don’t get your money back if it all goes wrong. There’s a very limited number of fabs in the world, and a very limited number of competent designers so competition will be low. Fabs won’t be falling over themselves to compete, even for 1M units. Contrast that with the software world where the barriers to market are essentially zero. I certainly support the effort but, as an aside, can a chip outsourced for manufacture ever be considered totally secure/open? If the fab were lent on by a large agency, for example, to put in some backdoors after design submission, the end user wouldn’t know about unless they had physical access to the die and the time to go through all the logic. Possibly a contrived scenario, but you don’t have the same transparency as compared to software where you have everything visible to you.

If you are deep into tin foil hats and/or worrying about your terrorist cell getting uncovered then I see the point of looking for back doors. But for purposes of being able to “screw with stuff”, which is what open source is all about for me, the issue is that I don’t have a semiconductor fab here in my garage. So for me an FPGA is the only path to “open hardware”. Report comment Reply Steven Gann says: January 5, 2017 at 7:01 pm The difficulty of manufacture doesn’t diminish the value of open source hardware. Frankly, I avoid compiling open source software at all costs, but I still prefer using open source software. Report comment Reply awjlogan says: January 6, 2017 at 12:06 am I think it does though, particularly for semiconductors. The beauty of open software is that anyone can get involved, and it’s possible to rapidly iterate through versions and ideas with zero added cost, other than time, no NRE costs, and those changes can be instantly spread across millions of users. The design of hardware is inherently much more conservative: it has to be correct first (ideally!) time, each run typically has substantial NRE costs, and getting a new design out is intrinsically physical. Further, the cost of the tools used to design semiconductors place it far out of reach of the vast majority, even if they did know how to use them. Open sourcing your projects is one thing, maybe you’d spend £100s, maybe £1000s for more complex designs, but for semiconductors at chip scale you’re talking £Ms. Report comment mac012345 says: January 6, 2017 at 8:16 am In fact ARM license costs are so low that open hardware like risc-V are mostly irrelevant cost-wise. The real advantage is to have an opensource core you can modify at will on the ISA level, which is something you can’t do on a std arm core. Report comment Reply MadMike says: January 6, 2017 at 10:50 am “The real advantage is to have an opensource core you can modify at will on the ISA level, which is something you can’t do on a std arm core.” This is a bit misleading. Yes you can technically modify the ISA, but unless you have millions upon millions of dollars to spend you will never get to actually use those changes. Calling it the first open source mcu doesn’t sound right to me. OpenCores have had fully open designs for a long time. While a slightly more open design is certainly a step in right direction, let’s not call it something it’s not. What the world desperately needs isn’t yet another open source ISA. Instead it’s massive reductions in semiconductor fab costs. Report comment daid303 says: January 5, 2017 at 2:14 pm Audit is not the only reason to look at the guts. We recently had a pretty nasty encounter with an I2C slave chip, which would randomly lock up the bus. And it is a major problem for us. We contacted the manufacturer (NXP). However, the end result is “we also do not know why this is happening. Try to add a delay at point X, maybe then your problem is gone” Insight in the chip would give us a chance to actually find the root cause instead of random guessing and hoping for the best.

This is a major reason why SMBus was developed in the first place, because the lack of timeout functionality seriously hampers the reliability of I2C. The only way a slave actually clock-stretches is if it’s doing some kind of external activity, which means there’s always a possibility for something to go horribly wrong.

Report comment RandyP says: January 5, 2017 at 11:41 am TL;DR: It seems to me that open hardware offers many of the same benefits as open software, although to (at present) a much smaller group of people. My 2¢: Yes, but how often is the documentation good enough? And isn’t the advantage of anything open that anyone can contribute to debugging it? Anyone with the know-how can look at the design and offer input on how to fix or improve it. Or fork it and make it themselves, with the help of orgs like HiFive and OSH Park etc. And it seems like you get the same potential security benefits from open hw that you do with open sw, in the case of eventually building a fully open computer. If each chip can be independently vetted, you know that none of them are doing things under the covers that you don’t want them to do. Of course I suppose one big difference here is that the set of people who can develop software is vastly larger than the set of people who can develop a microcontroller. So it’s harder to get that large number of independent reviewers. But there again, actually having a working open hardware design can also be a teaching tool for those of us who learn best by seeing examples.

Modern processors are made in such volume that it makes sense to run them in the most cost-effective process, which seems to be 28nm right now. That works great when you are making millions of parts. This part, on the other hand, is made using a 130nm process (roughly 20 times bigger, and a lot more power). You will never see parity on power until this part is made using a more modern process. However, power and IPC are not really the goals here — openness is.

Report comment Kevin Harrelson says: January 6, 2017 at 10:05 am A larger process generally DOES mean a higher power process. There are tricks that you can do to minimize this (power islands, voltage/frequency scaling, etc.). So, a larger process, properly designed, can indeed be lower power than a smaller process where they did not put in the effort. However, all things being equal, smaller = lower power. Well, lower DYNAMIC power. This is the power that scales with frequency. Simply stated, power, is related to charging and discharging of gate capacitance. Smaller geometry = smaller capacitance, and shorter wires from source to destination. Simply physics. Where smaller geometry hurts, however, is in leakage. That is the amount of power consumed just by applying voltage to the power pins, even in the absence of a clock. There are techniques to control this, however, such as using transistors with different threshold voltages. You do have a point about some chips using larger geometries. Microchip, which you mentioned, (and who I currently work for), owns some of their own fabs. However, these tend to be older ones with larger geometries. There can be cost savings going with your own fabs vs. sending work to places like TSMC and UMC. However, my point still, in general, stands. The cheapest transistors are right around the 28nm mark. However, this assumes a relatively large design. You need a certain amount of space for the IO ring to handle all of the pins on the chip. Simply stated, the number of IO pads determines the minimum size of your chip. Even if transistors shrink, the pads that wire-bond machines have to hook wires up to are not shrinking. So, shrinking your geometry will not reduce your die size below that point (that is called “IO bound”). In that case, going to smaller features will not save you money. Note that the cheapest transistors being 28nm is just for manufacturing. That does not include the design cost. For smaller volumes, larger transistors can be much cheaper just do to the decrease in mask costs. Report comment gh0stwriter88 says: January 6, 2017 at 10:24 am As you say a larger geometry may also be less IO bound and thus cheaper as not all designs need that many transistors… my point earlier was that going to a smaller geometry does not guarantee lower power… neither does doing lots of tricks guarantee that you can beat a smaller unoptimised geometry … in short making generalizations and assumptions are bad. I think things will get more interesting ones optical interconnects become more of a thing…. making designs less IO bound.

I am not so glad of the FTDI they have used, but I am hoping that they get rid of it as soon as they can. I can only see this hurting them in the short come. FTDI has done way to much damage to us. And me as one of the victims, they cost me hundreds of dollars and a lot of time and made me look like a fool on the phone, and I had nothing to do with them But buy reputable manufacturers Items that had fake chips in them some how. I am really looking forward to getting my hands on one or two of them when they get rid of that chip.

But if the license is not honored, then you get into trouble with such a claim. Besides: has the problem of ‘no copyright for hardware’ been solved yet? Copyright is still the foundation for OSS, but can it be for OSH?

And I DID NOT waste 79$ on device that promise to be MCU but does not have single analog input (not even comparator’s that even old 80′ MCU have) so disappointment was complete. Instead I rush and buy me some ARM Cortex M7 Nucleo-144 STM32F7xx boards to play with, for just a fraction of price that HiFive1 costs, and I get so much more. Promise of 500DMIPS is nothing special in today’s hi-performance MCU arena, even 6-7$ ESP32 can deliver that and it also have very “distinctive” Xtensa LX6 DPU arhitecture :) I keep some 8x SN74F181 4bit APU-s ( and rest of logic IC needed) so that one day I may use to play and make my homebrew CPU and then it will be true OPEN DESIGN for me :) Until then Raspberry Pi’s can “wipe the floor” with HiFive1 and for 1/2 price it is solution with 2-3000 DMIPS CPU and 57(125)MHz bit-banging all digital GPIO’s that is much better and proven working alternative. p.s.

How fast this Dev. can access and change its GPIOs (regardless of its pure digital nature), how fast it can bit-bang or do ring-osculation over its pins? 2. How it performs in SP i DP Arithmetic and with required that need FPU/DSP functions. 3.

Simulation is nice but real silicon is another thing. I purchased this board just to have an education system to learn RISC-V development at the bare metal level. And I purchased this board also to make a contribution to the Open Hardware movement. HiFive is just a starting point, and worthy to be supported.

This is a total mess of confusion. We have a board and it has *something* to do with an open source micro-controller???? OK what’s the board – it’s either a si-five of a hi-five. I did read what it was and these two thing are impossible to confuse NOT!!!!!!!!! OK, then what’s the micro-controller – well it’s one of the above, I think it’s a hi-five cos that the name used. BUT wait hi-five is just an organisation or something and the micro-controller is NOT si-five or hi-five and si-five just an instruction set architecture that is open source and not the micro-controller per-say. And if you google for the hardware architecture of this implementation then you find that the haystack is full of needles relating to the the Instruction set *architecture* and not the hardware architectural so you are looking for one specific needle in a tone of needs instead of a haystack. Then you find some PDF’s embedded into some web pages but the print is too small to read and you want to have a quick look for the number of GPIO’s but there is no really really basic pinout so instead you have to scroll through pages of hard to read print of the pin *descriptions* to try to keep a mental tally of the GPIO’s. Seriously …. Good – HTML web page that has been converted FROM a PDF Fair – PDF available for download Crap – Embedded PDF’s Good – Documentation that has an overview and basic information at the start Fair – Documentation that has basic information close to that start Crap – Documentation that has no overview so you don’t know if it’s about a uC or South African desert crabs. Good – Names that make it clear what they are. Fair – Names that give some idea about what they are. Crap – Names that are so similar that it’s inherently likely that you will confuse them and are so non-descriptive that you don’t know if they an organisation, hardware implementation, or micro-controller Good – Not poisoning your competitors namespace. Fair – Poisoning your competitors namespace after they poison your namespace. Dumb as Fu(k – Poisoning your own name space. With what I did find when I looked because this chip might be good for hardware control (3Dx) – Good – Chip that has good performance even perhaps to run a simple OS Fair – A bit of a limitation with RAM – no bigie for hardware controll Bad – Arduino Uno form factor with not enough GPIO Seriously I hope this project does well but I seriously doubt it will because of the tragic use of namespace – hey guys – the internet – it’s real you know.

Report comment Reply chango says: January 6, 2017 at 6:33 am Sadly that’s never going to happen. NRE on silicon is pretty large, and any manufacturer is going to want special sauce in the peripheral set to lock you into their SoC line. Case in point: ARM Cortex-M had us all convinced that a common core standard and some standards for libraries would save the world from SoC vendor lock-in. It did succeed in causing more manufacturers to shy away from proprietary tools. But there’s still no such thing as second sourcing ARM SoCs. Report comment Reply zerg says: January 6, 2017 at 12:17 pm Do you and your open source buddies have millions at your disposal to ensure this doesn’t happen. Remember fabbing the chip is very expensive. BTW there are 3rd party manufacturers that still manufacture those micros that have been obsoleted by their OEM’s. So far releases like this are irrelevant. The small business owner who wants to sell a low cost product can’t afford a crippled micro that sells for $50 or so.while they can buy a ARM micro for the less than the cost of a soda. I’ll get interested when it has the same peripheral set as a M3 ARM and on board flash and is price competitive with the offerings from ARM and Microchip. Right now this micro is for fashionistas and social posturing. Report comment Reply Greenaum says: January 5, 2017 at 7:36 pm The FTDI chip isn’t really relevant. It’s just a way of getting a dev board out into the world quickly. They can surely replace it with something else when they’ve got the time to work on that. Considering this is brand new silicon, FTDI is a good idea, since it’s use is known and understood, as opposed to the Chinese knockoff thing cheap Arduinos use. Using the FTDI means they’ve got a known-good USB interface, so it’s less likely to hit them with some obscure bug down the line, which might have happened with some other USB interface. Best to get everything else on the board as reliable as possible, while the silicon itself is still a new design. For now it’s not relevant, what’s relevant is the new chip itself. In a little while, I’m sure they can change it for something cheaper, from a company less hated and evil. And if they don’t, some enterprising Italian can do it instead, because it’s open hardware.

They did some extremely user-hostile actions, and the only way to stop it happening again is to make sure the PR fallout is long-lasting. It also serves to warn off other manufacturers who may have considered doing similar things. That doesn’t necessarily mean they should be boycotted forever, but it’s history that shouldn’t be forgotten.

Lot’s of debate on the value of open hardware. First, yes, it will probably be a long time if ever before we can ever fab chips at home meaning the same kind of easy user modifications that happen in software are unavailable as a fabbed chip. You can still do that in FPGA though and I would expect that good changes which are shared upstream would eventually make it onto a fabbed chip. Second, that’s not the only value of open source. I like open source software because once something reaches some critical mass of ‘community’ size it or something totally compatible with it is likely to be around for a very very long time. I like my Linux that still has drivers for the old crap parts piled in my garage and can still read the filesystems on the storage devices. I like my programs that can still read the files I wrote as a kid with no artifacts due to imperfect conversions. You only get support with closed stuff so long as there is a strong monetary incentive for a company to continue supporting it.

Report comment Reply Nick Sargeant says: January 9, 2017 at 5:41 am What I would like to see is an open source credit-card format processing engine, that behaves somewhat like an INMOS Transputer of old that I could build up over time with an array of cards to be my own parallel processing machine. I met Parsytec at CeBIT in Hannover many years ago when they were demonstrating a PowerPC based machine to replace their T800 engine. I think they intended to go with T9000, but that failed to arrive. Maybe what sold me on it was the fantastic industrial design they had – it really did look the biz (google for the Parsytec Power Xplorer). That and they were a PowerPC customer (albeit Motorola, and not IBM) when I was in IBMs OEM division, trying to sell bits of IBM technology to other companies. Given that was 20 years ago or more, they were hampered by available technology in terms of the resources that could be made available to each node (like 32MB RAM for instance). We could do hundreds of times better now with lower cost, less energy required and hopefully slightly more mature software tools. I always thought that if we standardised on a card format, I could just add to it over time as technology matures, relegate first generation cards to I/O operations and control computers, have a reconfigurable fabric of engines that could address real-world HPC-style problems, like cracking genomes, or providing radiologists with computer aided detection of possible cancers in DICOM imaging.

So, if someone could make a serious and thorough review of that device (Dev.board, SoC, ports etc.) its operation, architecture in a proper technically minded way?

Origin PC's custom, professional overclocking will push your Kaby Lake chip past 5GHz Overclockers, start your engines. Brad Chacos (PC World (US online)) on 06 January, 2017 04:00 0 - - - - print email Intel’s new Kaby Lake desktop processors may not be huge improvements over their Skylake predecessors in terms of raw speed, but they’ve got it where it counts in one enthusiast-friendly area: overclocking. Before Kaby Lake’s launch, two PC makers and a motherboard vendor told us that the chips overclocked to the vaunted 5GHz milestone with shocking regularity. Now the high-end custom PC builder Origin is putting its (and your) money where its mouth is. Origin’s has offered professional overclocking as a $75 option in its systems for a while, and now the builder is touting that Kaby Lake desktops chips will go up to—and potentially over—the 5GHz barrier. Hot, hot, hot, hot damn. Intel’s chips haven’t hit such lofty heights since the Sandy Bridge days and the Core i7-2600K. Since then, Intel’s processors usually tap out around the 4.5GHz mark. While the current wording for Origin’s professional overclocking doesn’t guarantee a set frequency due to the silicon lottery—promising only that “Origin PC’s award winning system integrators will overclock your processor and squeeze out every last megahertz” with every overclock “stringently tested and benchmarked for ensured stability”—the company must feel darn confident to market that 5GHz number in big, bold numbers in a press release. And that confidence is underscored by Origin’s free lifetime 24/7 tech support for every system it sells. Gordon Mah Ung The Origin PC Chronos. Backing up Origin’s boldness, Asus separately told PCWorld that “through rigorous testing, ASUS engineers have fine-tuned a profile that allows Kaby Lake CPUs to overclock to 5GHz with an 80 percent success rate” on its motherboards. Falcon Northwest also sent us a small form-factor PC that ran rock-solid at 5GHz—which let the four-core Core i7-7700K match a six-core Broadwell-E “Extreme Edition” chip in performance in Cinebench’s multi-threaded benchmark, and beat all comers in single-threaded performance. Maybe Origin isn’t so crazy after all. Kaby Lake overclocking could be the Real Deal, folks. Enthusiasts, start your engines—and grab your liquid-coolers.

It includes all the elements of a typical PC, including Intel SoC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity with flexible I/O options. Intel is working with a range of partners who can optimize Compute Card for their particular solutions – from interactive refrigerators and smart kiosks to security cameras and IoT gateways. Just slightly longer than a credit card at 95mm x 55mm x 5mm, and with a range of processor families in the works, the Intel Compute Card offers an optimal solution to power everything from entry-level to full featured host devices. Intel has mentioned that all latest Intel processors up to 6W can be built into Compute Card. Device makers simply design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then utilize the best Intel Compute Card for their performance and price needs. For example, consider you have bought an expensive OLED TV with a dual-core processor, 2GB RAM and 500GB storage. After two years, if you need 4GB RAM and 1TB storage, instead of replacing your OLED TV, you can just remove the existing Compute Card and replace it with a powerful new one. Features: Includes built-in integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® wireless connectivity. Save on engineering and design costs with a standardized I/O interface designed to support multiple devices. Equipped with a range of processors, including 7th Gen Intel® Core™ vPro™ processor, to handle the toughest computing needs. Low wattage computing with cooling integrated in the dock. Whether installed internally or inserted externally, the compute card remains secure via an integrated locking mechanism. Reduce the number of SKUs to manage through compute card enabled devices. Scale quickly when demand dictates. Simply add a compute card to any certified device to increase its compute capabilities and lifecycle. Hardware replacement is as simple as swapping the existing compute card for a new one. Intel is working with a wide range of partners who share their vision and these partners are working to develop products that can take advantage of the simplified design, ease of serviceability and user upgradeability of the Intel Compute Card. Intel’s global partners include Dell, HP, Lenovo and Sharp. In addition, Intel is working with a range of regional partners like Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk and Pasuntech. The Intel Compute Card will be available in mid-2017 and will come with a range of processors options, including the latest 7th Gen Intel Core processors.  Intel will reveal more details about Compute Card and its pricing in 2Q 2017.

(Photo : Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images) The future is bright for Macs after Intel introduced their 7th Gen Intel Kaby Lake processors some of which are suitable for future Mac desktops and MacBooks.  The Intel Kaby Lake processors for desktops offer reasonable performance and this has been proven true since its release August last year. Users have seen how promising it was, especially its video engine, which is the main focus of the processors without a big impact on battery life. As for Intel Kaby Lake processors future use on Macs, Intel said that the new chips will increase its performance delivery by up to 20 percent in gaming notebooks and 25 percent for desktops, 9to5 Mac reported. The following Intel core chips and U-series chips will surely make its way to the future MacBooks and Mac desktops:  Intel Kaby Lake processors with Intel Iris Plus graphics  Intel Kaby Lake processors with Intel vPro technology  Intel Xeon processors for mobile workstations  H-series chips for high-performance laptops and battery life  Y-series chips made for detachable with focus on high-performance and battery life  S-series for desktop systems Meanwhile, the U-series chips are designed for ultra-thin notebooks and 2 in 1 convertibles that will enhance productivity and creativity without sacrificing the battery life. Unlike any other processors, the U-series processors can provide up to 10-hour battery life. This year's Intel Kaby Lake processors are optimized to meet consumer's expectations and needs. The processor's major update is on video decoder/encoder block, then there's improvement on the Speed Shift technology which was originally introduced by Skylake, a feature that allows the CPU to complete tasks as fast as possible, PC Gamer reported. What's more interesting is the fact that the new Intel chips will support Optane memory which will make the system faster with limited trade-offs from a system perspective said the director of mobile platform marketing at Intel, Karen Regis.

Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Advanced Micro Devices is taking a swing at Intel with its new Ryzen desktop processors, and it’s going after Nvidia with its new Radeon Instinct artificial intelligence processors. After playing catch-up for years, Sunnyvale, California-based AMD is back on the offensive. Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, and Raja Koduri, senior vice president of AMD’s Radeon Technologies Group, hope that their efforts will reinvigorate competition in the computer industry. The Ryzen desktop computer chips, which use AMD’s Zen core designs, will debut in the first quarter. And the new Radeon Instinct machine intelligence chips will debut during the first half of 2017. AMD says the Ryzen chips are 40 percent faster per clock cycle than the previous generation, and Su is confident that it will beat Intel’s fastest desktop processors on a variety of fronts. And she’s still confident that 2017 will bring great things for the company, and that “AMD is back.” I sat down with Su and Koduri at an AMD event in Sonoma, California. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview. Above: AMD’s new Ryzen processor brand. Image Credit: AMD VentureBeat: It looked to me like phasing the graphics strategy in here—you’ve taken care of graphics, and now you’re taking care of AI. Is it a kind of one-bite-at-a-time strategy? Lisa Su: We view graphics as very strategic over the next five to 10 years. When we started with the road map, it was, “Consumer graphics is very important. It’s a core user base for us.” That was Polaris this year. But, no question, our plan was always to compete across the entire graphics end-to-end space. The next phase is compute and making sure we have a very competitive hardware and software platform. VB: Was that a resource allocation strategy? Raja Koduri: We definitely have graphics as a focus, a continued focus, a lot of investment on that side. But on the compute side, we had to build up infrastructure. That enormous software stack I showed you, we’ve been working on that. To go to market we needed the right software stack. The timing is now. It all happened to coincide with having the MI25 and the Vega architecture. The pieces are falling together for us in 2017. We have a lot of work to do in graphics still. We haven’t taken care of it. We have a lot more opportunity, if you look at the size of the market and the dollars that are still there. We have a lot more to grow in graphics alone. Compute is exciting, though. It’s great that we finally have a compelling software stack that goes along with our hardware. VB: These look like great accomplishments, Zen and Vega. Do you know yet how good they’re going to be for you, though, given the competitive picture? Does this possibly take us back to the days of Opteron, when AMD had a competitive advantage? Or do you have to wait and see where Intel and Nvidia will come in? Su: Let me comment on Zen and Raja can comment on Vega. We know what the competitive market is like, very well. We believe, whether you’re talking about desktop or servers, there are portions of the market that are not served well by the products that are there today. I absolutely believe we’ll grow share. We’ll see how much we grow as the products roll out. But we feel very good about where we are. Above: Radeon Instinct. Image Credit: AMD Koduri: We definitely know where we are right now, and the competitive trajectories. We always count on competition executing well. The great thing that you’re seeing in the 2016 momentum, and also going into 2017, is that we’re competing and fighting in every segment. We’re not leaving any segment to the competition. That’s how we think about 2017. We’re going into every segment. The excitement with Vega is that we’re getting back into the high end of the graphics segment. In 2016 we didn’t have any coverage there. VB: It looks like you have a very competitive product in the same space as Nvidia. Do you think you’re going to come to care as much about things like self-driving cars as Nvidia does today? Is that a little further down the road? Koduri: Like I say, we definitely care about all applications of machine intelligence. Our approach is going to be different. We’re not going to take Nvidia’s approach. Our approach will be very focused on key customers and key enabling of those customers. The amazing thing, is that the technology we’re building to scale for the data center, 90 percent of those same things are required for machine intelligence in the auto industry. There’s some additional stuff in terms of qualifications, robustness of the hardware, some certifications and all that we’ll have to do on top of that. But the base infrastructure is there. We want to go into these markets in a very focused manner. AMD, in the past, had many great initiatives. One of the things Lisa keeps us grounded on is, how do we go and execute on a vertical, enable a customer, and then go on to the next one? Rather than going too broad and not having enough focus and enough resources to execute. Above: AMD promises Vega architecture for graphics will scale. Image Credit: AMD VB: We’re probably a little ways away from design announcements? You showed some people with products, but they’re not necessarily — Koduri: On the cloud hyperscale on the compute side, you saw some of the — our current partners have announced their stuff. It’s in their cycle that we announce. We have a lot of good engagement and momentum going on. We’ll see some interesting announcements in 2017. But yes, we’re just going public with our initiative. We’ve been doing a lot of background work and you’ll see the momentum in 2017. Su: You should expect that we’ll have customer design announcements in 2017. VB: Do you see the amount of investment that’s gone into both sides, graphics and Zen, as basically the same? Are these equally ambitious projects as far as manpower? Su: You’re asking me which child I love better, and I’m sitting next to one of them. [laughs] For sure, we’re committed to high performance road maps on both the CPU and the GPU side. I will say, incremental investment in graphics is higher right now. You look at the explosion in the graphics market. It almost has a rebirth going on, not only in terms of consumer but also professional, and now in the data center as well. The incremental investments in graphics around the software and the platform that Raja was talking about are critical for us. Above: AMD’s Ryzen debuts for desktops in the first quarter of 2017. Image Credit: AMD VB: Was it the same years-long effort to get to this point for you guys? Was it coordinated, or did they just happen to appear at the same time, the CPU and GPU? Koduri: To some extent the same core technology, processor technology, drives both CPU roadmap and GPU roadmap. It’s not coincidental in that sense. A new CPU architecture and a new GPU architecture that leverages the CPU node come together in close proximity. I’d say that’s more a factor than anything else. When there’s a new technology node, all of us are excited, CPU guys and GPU guys. We all try to get something new. Su: It’s also fair to say that the data center focus has become a clear priority for us over the last couple of years. Having both the CPU and the GPU road map optimized for compute was very important. Koduri: That’s a huge thing, like I said on stage, that we’re finding with customers, the amount of excitement between the server CPUs and our capabilities there paired up with GPUs. Our customers are telling us, more than us telling them, what the value is there. It’s rare to see that level of excitement from our customers. VB: Qualcomm had their announcement this week as well, with Snapdragon desktop and laptop SKUs at some point. It’s another interesting avenue of competition. Koduri: Right. Hardware is hot again.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich talked about automated driving, 5G technologies, VR and merged reality technology. He narrated a series of pre-recorded and live VR experiences as 250 people in the audience sat wearing HMDs. Autonomous Driving and 5G Intel plans to buy 15 per cent of the Here digital maps and location services business. On the subject of navigation and transport, Intel and Mobileye will work with BMW to prepare a fleet of about 40 autonomous BMW cars. These vehicles will be used to demonstrate the advances in autonomous driving achieved by the partners. Intel's 5G plans also include automobiles. It introduced Intel GO, a scalable car to cloud system to enhance automated driving. Automakers will be able to implement Intel GO even before 5G networks roll out. Finally, on the topic of 5G, Intel announced the world's first global 5G modem supporting both sub-6GHz bands and mmWave spectrum. This compact, low-power chip kit delivers gigabit speeds and ultra-low latency. It will help 5G connected cars make faster decisions, we were told. Virtual Reality News Conference Intel provided its crowd with 360-degree, 4K video streamed video on their HMDs. The crowd all got to watch a live industrial inspection of a 2,000-acre solar power plant in the Moapa River Indian Reservation. Sending the imagery to the Intel conference was a drone loaded with Orah 4i high-definition cameras and a low-power, high-latency computing solution. Krzanich also showcased the first demonstration of a YOKE VR live sports event streamed with Intel’s virtual reality technology. Intel's Project Alloy all-in-one merged reality solution will hit the market via various OEMs from Q4 this year. For content Intel has partnered with HypeVR, a computer vision company focused on developing ultra-high-resolution live action VR capture and playback with six degrees of freedom. Intel's HypeVR tech collaboration enabled a live action VR exploration of the Ban Gioc waterfall, "one of Vietnam’s most breathtaking natural sights". Cannon Lake demo, Moore's Law "flourishing" Perhaps of most interest to PC enthusiasts was the live on stage demonstration of a Cannon Lake powered PC system. The system utilised one of Intel's 8th generation processors built on the 10nm process. Krzanich introduced the device by saying "for those who are wondering if Moore's Law is alive, is 10 nanometres going to be here, the answer is absolutely yes." On stage the prototype 2-in-1 PC system was demonstrated running and playing a TV commercial featuring Jim Parsons and Michael Phelps. Intel pledged to begin shipping Cannon Lake chips later this year. Intel has only just released Kaby Lake desktop processors and motherboard chipsets. Remember, rival Qualcomm launched its 10nm Snapdragon 835 SoC earlier this week, with devices packing the chip expected to ship before H1 is out.

AMD reveals an army of Ryzen PCs and AM4 motherboards Watch out, Intel. AMD's hotly anticipated Ryzen processor is coming in for landing. Brad Chacos (PC World (US online)) on 05 January, 2017 15:00 0 - - - - print email So far, everything AMD’s shown of its hotly anticipated Ryzen processors hint that they’re the company’s most competitive new CPUs in a long, long time—chips poised to bring the fight back to Intel at the high-end of computing. No processor launches in a vacuum, though. At CES 2017, AMD set the stage for Ryzen’s Q1 2017 launch by revealing 16 high-end motherboards that use the new unified AM4 socket, CPU coolers built for those boards, and another 17 “extreme performance” pre-built PCs designed around Ryzen. I’m scheduled to meet with AMD about these new AM4 motherboards and system designs tomorrow morning, so stay tuned for an update with more pictures and hands-on impressions. For now, let’s dig into what AMD’s already unveiled. AM4 motherboards Both Ryzen and all of AMD’s other new APUs fit into the same motherboard socket, AM4. (Hallelujah!) But those AM4 motherboards won’t all use the same chipset: A more affordable APU system might pair with a motherboard that has modest features, whereas a Ryzen-based PC is likely to require more robust technologies. To that end, AMD’s releasing the X300 and X370 desktop chipsets for Ryzen systems. AMD An ASRock X370 AM4 motherboard. You’ll want an X300 motherboard in a tiny mini-ITX machine, and an X370 in a full-size PC. Both support all of the recent tech being baked into AM4—dual-channel DDR4 memory, NVMe and M.2 SSDs, USB 3.1 Gen 1 and 2, you name it. At CES, AMD will show the following Ryzen boards and APU-focused B350 and A320 desktop motherboards from its partners: ASRock X370 Taichi, ASRock X370 Gaming K4, ASRock AB350 Gaming K4, and ASRock A320M Pro4 Asus B350M-C Biostar X370GT7, Biostar X350GT5, and Biostar X350GT3 Gigabyte GA-AX370-Gaming K5, Gigabyte GA-AX370-Gaming 5, Gigabyte AB350-Gaming 3 and Gigabyte A320M-HD3 MSI A320M Pro-VD, MSI X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium, MSI B350 Tomahawk, and MSI B350M Mortar So far, I’ve managed to get my hands on MSI’s two AM4 motherboards while at their booth today, and the X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium proved particularly noteworthy. It largely follows the design cues of MSI’s high-end Titanium enthusiast motherboards for Intel’s Kaby Lake chips—and that’s a good thing! AMD’s FX processors have lagged behind Intel systems in terms of feature support for a while now, so it’s refreshing to see the latest and greatest technologies on an AMD motherboard. Brad Chacos MSI’s X370 and B350M motherboards in the flesh, or something. AM4 coolers New motherboards do mean new CPU cooler brackets. AMD’s working with 15 vendors on an array of third-party AM4 cooling solutions, but right now, they’re only naming a handful. Noctua Noctua’s NH-D15. Noctua’s highly regarded NH-D15 and its thinner cousin, the NH-U12S, will both become compatible with AM4 motherboards, and EK Waterblocks—beloved by enthusiasts who dig custom hardline liquid-cooling—will release AM4 products as well. If you prefer your liquid-cooling of the dead-simple closed-loop variety, Corsair’s H60, H100i, and H110i will also support AMD’s new platform. Of course, you can also expect to see AMD’s own quiet Wraith cooler make the jump to AM4—especially considering that AMD’s public Ryzen demos featured it. Ryzen PCs AMD A Ryzen-powered PC from Cybertron. Finally, AMD has teamed with boutique PC builders from around the globe to show off Ryzen “dream PCs,” as the company calls them. The lineup ranges—you’ll find an assortment ranging from practical systems to the most exotic, tricked-out builds imaginable. I’m looking forward to checking out some of these firsthand in the morning, but in the meantime, here’s the full list of partners who’ve built Ryzen rigs. (U.S. folks will recognize Origin, CyberPower, Maingear, Cybertron, and iBuyPower.) Caseking CSL – Computer CyberPower PC Cybertron PC IBUYPOWER Icoda (Korea) iPason Wuhan Komplett LDLC Maingear Mayn Wuhan Medion AG Mindfactory Oldi (Russia) Origin PC Overclockers UK PC Specialist Don’t worry if you’ve noticed that the PC makers on this list are of the more specialized variety. AMD says it expects AM4 computers from all the top PC manufacturers when Ryzen launches sometime later this quarter. And nope, AMD still hasn’t said anything more specific about when that is.

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

The German automaker will put 40 of its 7 Series sedans on the road and train them to drive in urban areas, Klaus Froehlich, BMW’s head of development, said in an interview. The goal is to apply the gathered data toward producing the iNext, which will supplant the 7 Series as the BMW brand’s flagship model and be capable of full autonomy four years from now. Automakers and technology companies are rushing to form partnerships to compete against the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which has clocked 2 million self-driving miles on public roads, and Tesla Motors Inc., with 1.3 billion miles of data from Autopilot-equipped vehicles. BMW is appealing to other carmakers to adopt its approach to help shoulder research costs, speed development by sharing data and ensure they don’t become also-rans. “Those who reach the finish line before you will have their tech become the basis of standardization,” Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s co-founder and chief technology officer, said in an interview. “This is why sharing is important.” BMW will be following Uber Technologies Inc. and Volvo Cars in putting autonomous cars on the road, with the latter two companies partnering on test vehicles in Pittsburgh and Arizona. Other carmakers have been reluctant so far to heed BMW’s call for adopting its platform. Rival Daimler AG has said it prefers to develop its own technology. Mobileye shares rose as much as 4.4 percent to the highest intraday in three months and traded at $42.12 as of 1:12 p.m. in New York. Costly Technology Enabling vehicles to navigate without human input through cities requires them to see and understand complex situations more like people do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye brings expertise in cameras that model the surroundings while Santa Clara, California-based Intel wields computing capabilities to power artificial intelligence. The companies released details Wednesday in conjunction with CES 2017, the consumer-technology show in Las Vegas. “If everybody would use the same network, it will be best,” Froehlich said. “At the beginning, I think only premium cars will be able to afford such technology.” Carmakers could participate by buying sensors to install in their cars, or go deeper with equipment that helps crowd-source data from an autonomous-vehicle fleet, said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of Intel’s Automated Driving Division. While Munich-based BMW’s main target is individual car owners, the technology will be available for ride-sharing fleets as well, Froehlich said. Auto manufacturers are pushing into so-called mobility services like car-sharing and ride-hailing to counter alternatives to private vehicle ownership.

Google, which separated its self-driving car project into a new unit called Waymo last month, plans to start a ride-sharing service using semi-autonomous minivans made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV as soon as the end of 2017. VW is rolling out Moia, a new division that will focus on ride-sharing. Revenue from car-sharing is projected to surge more than sevenfold to 4.7 billion euros ($4.9 billion) by 2021, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group Inc. Robo-taxis will make up 40 percent of automotive profits by 2030, more than selling vehicles to individuals, according to consulting company Roland Berger.

In fact, it produced the first Chromebooks all the way back in 2011. Every other major PC manufacturer has jumped on board since then, but Samsung’s have remained among the best options. Now, six years later, Samsung has another first. It’s the first to introduce a Chromebook built from the ground up with Google Play in mind. This initiative, which brings Android apps to Chrome OS, has rolled out as a beta program for a select few models. But Samsung’s Plus and Pro are the first to release with Google Play from the start. Our hands-on time with the Chromebook Pro was very favorable. We like its quality design, high-resolution display, and beefy hardware. But there’s more going on here than just a nice Chromebook. These new systems throw fresh fuel on the fire of competition between ARM-based processors, like those found in phones, and Intel’s x86 chips, found in most Windows laptops. Undercutting Surface Alanna Cotton, the VP of Mobile Computing at Samsung, was careful not to position the new Chromebooks as a direct Surface competitor. She said the focus is on “targeting the Chrome OS lover, who loves ease and simplicity,” but she also admitted the new models are ideal for students and mobile professionals, not least of all because they include an active digitizer stylus. That stylus, shown in demo photos, will be called on to do the same tasks users ask of their Windows 2-in-1s. Cotton spoke to this, saying the pen “works how they work, from classrooms, to the meeting room.” She spoke, both on and off stage, about how it might be used by students to take notes, or by artists to sketch out a concept. Brad Bourque/Digital Trends It’s easy to see why Samsung wouldn’t want to take Surface on directly. The Chromebook Pro and Plus sell for far less, and have less capable hardware. But for certain people – especially the mentioned students and mobile professionals – these Chromebooks fill a similar role. Samsung itself describes the system doing many of the same tasks as a Surface Pro. They would even have a direct Surface competitor, if Microsoft hadn’t abandoned it. Remember the vanilla Surface? It started as an ARM-based system running Windows 8, then transitioned to an Intel x86 processor with the Surface 3, before going out of production. Microsoft couldn’t figure out how to make it appealing without jacking up the price. Making good on ARM’s threat to x86 Apple’s release of the iPad sent real shockwaves through the PC ecosystem. The following CES was clouded by speculation that “Wintel” systems – Windows laptops powered by Intel hardware – might be threatened. Microsoft pulled out of its CES booth a couple shows after, which only encouraged naysayers. Samsung’s Chromebook Plus shouts ‘anything you can do, I can do cheaper.’ Yet the predicted doom never came to pass. PCs sales haven’t been great, but tablets haven’t roared in behind them. Microsoft and Intel remain strong. The threat of ARM-powered computers has come to nothing. But that doesn’t mean the competition is over, and devices like the Chromebook Plus and Pro are exactly the devices that could make this struggle interesting again. It’s ironic, because this device can be had with either. The $450 Chromebook Plus has an ARM chip of Samsung’s design, while the price for the Intel-powered Pro version hasn’t been announced. While Samsung admits the Plus will lag the Pro in multi-tasking and certain demanding workloads, the weaker sibling may end up being the system to get. Think it over. The Plus and Pro run the same apps. The Plus and Pro have the same 2,400 x 1,600 display. They have the same ports, same battery, same keyboard, same touchpad, same stylus. Sure, the Pro may be singing “anything you can do, I can do better.” But many looking to buy a laptop will instead hear the Plus shout “anything you can do, I can do cheaper.” Chromebooks have been met with favorable reception so far, but they haven’t entirely caught on because they lack broad app support, and lack advanced features like a stylus or high-resolution display. The Chromebook Plus addresses these problems. If others take Samsung’s lead, we may see serious competition between Chrome OS and Windows laptops by the end of 2017 – especially in the arena of budget laptops, which is what most people buy.

Andrew Cunningham - Jan 5, 2017 5:00 pm UTC Enlarge / A concept render of Intel's Compute Card. Intel reader comments 104 Share this story Ars at CES 2017 I have seen the future: Alexa controls everything Sim racing hits the big time with the $1 million Vegas eRace BMW concept car interior puts holographic controls at your fingertips Taking a ride in Nvidia’s self-driving car Concept-i is Toyota’s friendly future View more stories Intel mostly missed the boat on smartphones, but the company is trying to establish a firm foothold in the ever-broadening marketplace for connected appliances and other smart things. Intel's latest effort in this arena is its new "Compute Card," a small 94.5mm by 55mm by 5mm slab that includes a CPU and GPU, RAM, storage, and wireless connectivity. The thinking with the Compute Card is to separate the smarts of various computers and appliances—all-in-ones, smart TVs, fridges, digital kiosks or signage screens, commercial equipment—from the rest of the hardware. You might want to keep a TV around for the better part of a decade, but the processing hardware inside it could start to feel slow three or four years in. With the Compute Card, one could simply eject the old card and slide in a new one instead of replacing the whole thing. Intel hasn't given us specific information about the specs and speeds of its first Compute Cards, but you can expect the fastest ones to approach the performance of high-end fanless laptops like Apple's MacBooks. Intel told us that processors with a TDP of up to 6W could fit inside the Compute Cards, which covers both low-power Atom chips like those that powered early versions of Intel's Compute Stick to full Core M and Y-series Core i5 and i7 CPUs like the ones you find in laptops. Intel says that the card uses a variant of the USB-C port called "USB-C plus extension" to connect with the systems it's plugged into. That connector gives devices direct access to the USB and PCIe buses as well as HDMI and DisplayPort video outputs. The company considers the Compute Card to be a replacement of sorts for the Compute Stick, which Intel says will probably disappear from its roadmap in 2018 or so. The issue with the Compute Stick from Intel's perspective is that its input and output ports were unnecessarily limiting—it could only connect to HDMI ports and could only accept a limited number of USB inputs. The Compute Card can be slid into a wider variety of enclosures that can use all kinds of ports and display interfaces, and Intel says the Card will also offer a large array of performance and storage options, unlike current Compute Sticks. Further ReadingIntel’s Core M Compute Stick is an actually usable computer with caveats While these cards could conceivably solve the hardware end of the problem for some smart devices, the software side is still a big question mark. As x86-based PCs, Intel told us that the Compute Card will be able to run Windows and Linux and any other operating system you can currently run on a low-end PC. Depending on the operating system they use, it may still be up to OEMs to provide software updates for Compute Card-based appliances, and they'll also need to figure out the best way to reload that software on new Compute Cards if users try to upgrade them by themselves. Intel will be revealing more information on specs, availability, and pricing in June of 2017, and the cards themselves will be available in "mid-2017." Intel's Compute Card partners, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Sharp on the computing side and Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk, and Pasuntech on the commercial side, will all be making their own announcements and releases separately.

OPM tells DC-area feds how to plan for Inauguration Day Samsung, one of the largest exhibitors at the show, is offering demonstrations of its boat racing, air show and other virtual-reality experiences in chairs that move around. Hyundai is offering VR demos for people to experience what it’s like to ride in an autonomous car. Advertisement Also drawing crowds are flashy concept cars like the Toyota Concept-i, with doors that flip up and a 3-D display inside. Polaroid is showing off its Cube+ Wi-Fi camera with a bizarre display of rotating — but fake — monkeys wearing the camera. Camera images are displayed in a live feed above. It’s a nod to the monkey-shaped stand that Polaroid sells for the Cube. On the TV front, LG wowed with an OLED 4K display tunnel, which people enter to see the new technology. One of the longer lines on the floor was at MyCharger’s Power Up bar — which offered a free MyCharger along with what appeared to be green beer. It’s actually regular Sam Adams in a green dye-infused cup. CES takes place over several, sprawling venues in Las Vegas. About 165,000 visitors are expected by the time it closes Sunday. ___ 2:45 p.m. Sometimes, it takes incentives to persuade people to change their habits. Mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay still aren’t widely used, in part because it isn’t difficult for shoppers to pull out a plastic card at the cashier. Samsung tried to address that by offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent — redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. At a CES panel Thursday, Samsung executive Nana Murugesan said that since the launch of Samsung Rewards in November, daily usage of Samsung Pay has nearly doubled, while the number of users who make purchases almost daily more than doubles each week. The company hasn’t specified the number of users and transactions, though analysts say it’s still a small compared with cash and cards. ___ 1:55 p.m. Is Alexa spying on you? It’s a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Comcast’s Derrick Dicol likens it to people getting used to sharing their banking information online. ___ 1 p.m. T-Mobile says unlimited plans will be the only option for new customers even though they are more expensive than some of its old, limited plans. The company had said in August that it was phasing out its other plans in favor of just an unlimited plan. On Thursday, T-Mobile said those limited plans won’t be sold anymore starting Jan. 22. Existing customers can keep their current plans. While some existing customers could switch over to the $70-a-month unlimited plan and save money, others would pay more. Most customers who just pay for one or two lines or who have a lower-data plan — 2 gigabytes per line — would save money by sticking to what they have. And T-Mobile’s unlimited plan isn’t exactly unlimited. If the network is busy, T-Mobile may slow speeds on customers that used more than 28 gigabytes. ___ 12:15 p.m. Beauty brands L’Oreal and Karastase want to make bad hair days a thing of the past. The two companies teamed up with tech company Withings on a Hair Coach brush that uses a microphone, gyroscope and other sensors to monitor how fast and how hard a person is brushing. An accompanying app recommends how to brush for optimal quality and minimal breakage and split ends. It can also take into account hair-influencing factors like heat or humidity and even discern if hair is wet or dry. The “smart brush” has been garnering buzz at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Vincent Nida, worldwide general manager at Paris-based Kerastase, says one of the top beauty queries online is consistently about taking better care of your hair. The battery-powered brush starts collecting data when a user begins brushing. The smarts may seem like overkill considering the price of the brush — $200. By contrast, Amazon sells brushes for as little as $1. But Nida says you’re getting a high-quality brush “even if you don’t have batteries or you don’t connect it to your cell phone.” The Hair Coach brush is due out in mid-2017. ___ 11:05 a.m. Who needs a keyboard? Dell is introducing a new way to interact with your computer. The Dell Canvas 27 is a 27-inch glass surface that sits flat on a desk in front of a monitor. The touch surface is where a keyboard would normally be. Various widgets are available to manipulate items on the monitor. The Canvas also comes with a pen for sketching and creating. Dell envisions people using the device to edit photos and video, work on music and even work with financial tables. The goal is to replace clutter generally found on a desk. Instead of working with paper on a desk, just use the touch surface. The device launches in the spring and is expected to cost less than $2,000 — or around $3,000 with the monitor included. Lenovo has a similar concept in last fall’s Yoga Book. It’s a laptop that replaces the keyboard with a touch screen for both typing and doodling. But the screen is smaller, measuring 10 inches diagonally. Dell announced the Canvas at the CES gadget show on Thursday. Tom Holland, star of “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” also stopped by to introduce two Dell products — a tablet and a gaming laptop — that will appear in the movie. ___ 10:15 a.m. Smartphones can do almost anything, but how about molecular physics? An Israeli startup has embedded a molecular sensor called Scio in a new smartphone that can analyze any material — whether that’s the nutritional content of an apple or a person’s body fat. Consumer Physics’ scanners use infrared light to analyze molecular structure. The startup has been developing them for a few years, but this is the first time it’s embedded in a mobile device — one from Chinese phone manufacturer Changhong. Is that a little too much science to carry around in your pocket? Consumer Physics CEO Dror Sharon says knowledge is power. He explains, “When we go out and buy stuff, eat stuff, drink stuff, we think we know what’s in there, but we have no clue.” Pricing and availability for the phone will be announced Friday at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas. ___ 9:30 a.m. Apple’s app store closed 2016 with 2.2 million apps, an increase of 20 percent from 2015. Apple says New Year’s Day 2017 was the biggest day ever for app store purchases — people bought nearly $240 million of stuff in the digital marketplace. Nintendo’s “Super Mario Run” was the most downloaded app worldwide on both Christmas and New Year’s Day. The app is free to download, but it costs a whopping $10 to play the full version. In what should surprise no one, “Pokemon Go” was the year’s most popular app. The game peaked over the summer, when hordes of people prowled real-life locations to catch digital pocket monsters through its innovative augmented reality interface. Other popular apps included Sweat With Kayla, a workout app, and Procreate, a painting and sketching app. The milestones were announced as the CES gadget show in Las Vegas formally opened, though Apple has no official presence there. ___ 8:20 a.m. Intel thinks the future of virtual reality is skydiving in the desert, watching live sports from a ringside seat and cringing as zombies attack — all powered by Intel chips. Wednesday’s demo featured leather chairs, Oculus sensors and headsets — and a barf bag, signaling this was not an ordinary press conference. One demo was a live feed from a 360-degree camera attached to a drone inspecting solar panels in a desert. Intel was showing how the technology could be used in a work environment. A more exciting live feed showed a college basketball game between Butler and Villanova. Travel experiences took viewers to a waterfall scene in Vietnam and a skydiving experience in the Moab Valley. A trailer for “Arizona Sunshine,” a VR game, made viewers jump as zombies lunged for them. No one — noticeably — made use of the barf bags. CEO Brian Krzanich acknowledges that some people are questioning whether VR is going anywhere. He adds, “I hope these experiences give you a taste of where it’s going.” The CES gadget show in Las Vegas formally opens Thursday after two days of media previews. ___ 7:10 a.m. Amazon doesn’t have an official presence at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas but its Alexa voice control software seems to be everywhere. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its suite of smart-home appliances, including a stove and refrigerator. With that capability, someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as Amazon’s Echo speaker. Jason Mathew, senior director of global connected strategy for Whirlpool, says voice is “the most natural way to interact with a product.” Other gadgets that include Alexa: Sensory and OnVocal are both launching headphones that incorporate Alexa. Simplehuman is announcing a voice-activated trash can. And GE Lighting is launching a table lamp that includes Alexa software. Amazon has an edge on the market for now because its software has been out longer, but Google’s and Apple’s systems are catching up. Mathew says “Amazon is the most mature, but we expect to offer other options in the future.” Topics: Business News Lifestyle News Technology News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Business News » The Latest at CES:… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Fed Photo of the Day Photos of the amazing, moving, important and amusing things happening in the federal community.

Gordon Mah Ung (PC World (US online)) on 06 January, 2017 02:35 0 - - - - print email You know Optane offers a thousand times the switching speed of an SSD. You know it’ll work with Intel’s newly announced Z270 chipset and Kaby Lake CPUs. And now you know what it’ll look like. A day before CES officially kicks off, Intel shared a couple of pics of its highly anticipated Optane non-volatile memory drives. Intel Pricing, availability, and even capacity weren’t released with the photos, but the initial drives are expected to be 16GB and 32GB in size. They’ll be used with Intel’s Rapid Storage Technology to cache hard drive performance. SSDs are already being used to cache hard drives with RST, but the question is how much of a difference it’ll make using Optane drives instead of today’s SSDs. The capacity is certainly far lower than where Optane is expected to eventually be. Using a 3D memory technology codeveloped with Micron, Intel has said since its introduction that it would eventually offer capacity exceeding today’s SSDs while approaching system RAM in performance. Future iterations could even go into DDR4 memory slots too. Today though, this is about as close as we’ll get to Optane for consumer use. Top 10 Things to Love about Surface Pro 4 More from Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

But we might have just found our favourite. Razer has been using the tech show in Vegas to show off its Project Valerie system: laptop that packs in three, yes three, 17-inch 4K displays. Each 17.3-inch 4K IGZO display is equipped with Nvidia G-SYNC variable framerate tech and 180-degree Nvidia Surround View gaming. Related: CES 2017 And for the creative types out there, Razer's provided 100% Adobe RGB colour accuracy and what it's calling "the greatest amount of screen real estate ever assembled in a single computer". So, how does Project Valerie manage to include three displays while still being called a laptop? Well, as Razer explains, the concept design uses an "automatic deployment mechanism" which means each display mechanically slides out of the side of the main screen, once it's folded open. “The complexities of a traditional multi-monitor setup are a thing of the past with Project Valerie,” said Razer co-founder and CEO Min-Liang Tan. “Equally important, the power of a desktop computer and graphics capabilities of three top-end monitors are included in the system. There is no shortcoming in the way of performance in the face of its amazing portability and features.” Running the graphical side of things is an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080, and the impressive laptop exceeds the minimum hardware requirements for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. The concept design includes a unibody CNC aluminum chassis which measures 1.5-inches thick and weighs less than 12 pounds (5.4kg). Razer's also included its thermal management system which uses custom-designed fan and dynamic heat exchangers paired with a vapour chamber to maximize heat dissipation. On top of that, the company has added its "Ultra-Low-Profile" mechanical switches, which means key presses are registered with 65 grams of force, so it should feel like using a full-size mechanical keyboards. Of course, there's no guarantee this will ever make it to market. Project Valerie is currently a working prototype and there doesn't seem to be any plans to put it into production. But, we're hoping Razer goes ahead with this one, frankly because it looks really cool.

ADVERTISEMENT The American tech firm has confirmed its Project Alloy "merged reality" headset will be turned into a consumer product later this year. "We're planning to productise project Alloy by Q4 of 2017 with some of our top OEM partners," Krzanich said on stage at his firm's CES 2017 press conference. Read more This car headrest monitors your brain waves to stop you falling asleep at the wheel This car headrest monitors your brain waves to stop you falling asleep at the wheel By Matt Burgess Intel first revealed Alloy in August 2016 at its developer conference in Silicon Valley. At the time Krzanich showed off what he called an "all-in-one virtual reality solution". Intel says its headset works in "merged reality," where it combines objects in the real-world with those the wearer sees on the screen of their headset. Ever since it was unveiled, Intel said it would not be directly manufacturing the device. Instead, development of the headset will be done by those outside the company. "We're committed to making Project Alloy an open platform," the CEO said in Las Vegas. He added that Alloy is "progressing very well" and that his firm believes its capabilities are what the future of virtual reality Krzanich said: "VR today requires a fairly complex set-up. It requires sensors to understand where you're at, it requires a tether to a pretty high-end computer". ADVERTISEMENT Read more Death to the dashboard: AR windscreens in cars could make driving safer and easier Death to the dashboard: AR windscreens in cars could make driving safer and easier By Matt Burgess Intel The headset created by Intel is completely wireless and uses depth sensors to turn physical spaces into virtual worlds. On stage at the technology show Krzanich and colleagues demonstrated how the headset works. In a purpose built living room two people wearing the headsets were able to walk around the space and play games on the screens of the device. Intel's software turned objects in the room into objects of the same size in a VR world and the walls of the room were transformed into an alien space scene. ADVERTISEMENT Using internal cameras and motion sensors in the headsets the two players were able to move around the room and fire virtual weapons at attacking aliens. At the core of Intel's Project Alloy is its RealSense technology. First released in 2014, it is able to 3D scan a room in real-time and has since been used to help service robots navigate buildings. An example of how it can be used to blend the physical and digital worlds can be seen in RealSense's first integration into mobile phones.

We round up the rumours about new iMacs, including the theory that new iMacs will feature AMD Radeon Polaris graphics chips and might even be VR-ready. Latest: Tim Cook hints at the future of the Mac desktop, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac by Ashleigh Macro | 12 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will Apple release new iMacs in the UK? Will Apple update its iMac desktop line to add Intel Kaby Lake processor chips, and what other specs, design changes and new features should we expect in the next generation of iMacs? How much will the new iMacs for 2017 cost? Apple last updated its iMac line on 13 October 2015, bringing Retina-class screen resolution to the smaller Macs for the first time and equipping the larger models with new Skylake processor chips. Before that, you had to go back more than two years - if you don't include the cheaper iMac which Apple launched in June 2014 - to the last proper new iMac update, in September 2013, when Apple added Haswell processors, new graphics, next-gen Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options. (For more information on that update, read our review of the 2013 iMacs.) So much for Apple's iMac updates over the past few years. Right now we're looking ahead to the next iMac launch - what we hope will be an early-2017 iMac update. In this article we round up all the speculation about Apple's next iMac update: when new iMacs will be released in the UK, new iMac prices, tech specs and new features to expect, any leaked photos and videos that appear online, and all the other new iMac rumours that are fit to print. Updated, 22 December 2016, with comments from Apple CEO Tim Cook about the future of the Mac desktop Read next: Where to buy iMacs in the UK | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iMac deals UK New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Launch date When will new iMacs come out? Early in 2017, we hope, but we had been confidently expecting an iMac update in late 2016 and that came to nothing. (A contact told us, under condition of anonymity, that the Mac Pro would be updated before the end of November 2016, and we reasoned that it would make sense for Apple to announce at least a minor update to the iMac at the same time. But the year ended with no word on new Mac desktops.) The Best Buy leak discussed in the processor section of this article, which emerged at the start of October 2016, strongly suggests that the retailer has had advance warning of an imminent launch and posted a listing slightly too early by mistake - although it's also possible that this was a speculative listing created on the basis that it would probably be needed at some point. New iMac 2017 release date: Apple CEO hints at future of the iMac In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important.  A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell.  New iMac 2017 release date: What does previous launch history tell us? The last iMac update was in October 2015. Apple's yearly cycle is built around three major press events: autumn - usually September (new iPhones and iPads); spring - usually March (new iPhones and iPads, sometimes MacBooks and watches); and summer - usually June (WWDC - operating system updates, and occasional hardware). But that doesn't mean the company stays quiet the rest of the year. Mac updates can be folded into the big three events, but they're often launched at their own smaller launch events. The iMac update in 2015 got its own announcement, a few weeks after the iPhone 6s reveal. But bear in mind that, unlike the yearly or event twice-yearly update events we're used to for iOS devices, desktop Mac refreshes have frequently come several years apart. WWDC 2017 (which will take place in June next year) is therefore a possibility, and we may have to wait even longer than that. New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Specs We'll add leaked details about the tech specs of the new iMacs to this section as we hear them. Here's what we know so far. New iMac 2017 specs: Processor Apple skipped Intel's much-delayed Broadwell processors and went straight from Haswell to Skylake for the 2015 update. Skylake uses the same 14nm manufacturing process as Broadwell, but brings even greater CPU and GPU performance, along with reduced power consumption. But what chips will appear in the next set of iMacs? Clearly that will depend on their launch date and the hardware that's available at the time. After 2015's Skylake, the next round of Intel processors, which started going into mass production in late 2016 and is still being rolled out, is Kaby Lake; this will be followed by Cannonlake (Cannonlake was due to be next, but it's been delayed until the second half of 2017). Then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019, for those who enjoy this sort of thing. Kaby Lake uses a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake, but Cannonlake switches over to a more accurate 10nm process. If Apple does manage an iMac update before the end of 2016 the machines could feature Kaby Lake processors, but remember that Apple skipped Broadwell and delays are common in the chip sector - so we're not banking on anything. Intel started shipping its Kaby Lake processors in July 2016, and the chips offer support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. It's therefore now possible that Apple will squeeze Kaby Lake chips into the next iMac update, but by no means guaranteed, given Apple's past behaviour. Some of the Kaby Lake chips aren't expected to ship until very late 2016 or more likely early 2017, so be prepared for a wait. Read more on MacRumors. Processor models The specific model of Kaby Lake processor we're expecting to appear in the next iMac is the i7-7700. And as luck would have it, Tom's Hardware has got hold of what they understand to be a pre-release sample of that chip. Naturally they promptly overclocked it and put it through rigorous speed tests. Those speed tests found that the i7-7700 (or rather the i7-7700K - the K in the name denoting that the clock multiplier has been unlocked to allow for overclocking) was capable of 4.2GHz under normal circumstances, and 4.8GHz when overclocked. Serious speed which, as BGR observes, would give the new iMac bragging rights over the rival Surface Studio, launched before the relevant Kaby Lake chips became available. Micosoft could always launch an updated Surface Studio with Kaby Lake, of course, although that might hack off the early buyers. Evidence for Kaby Lake Back in October 2016, the US retailer Best Buy leaked a listing for a new iMac, and it had a Kaby Lake chipset - a "7th Gen Intel Core i7 processor". As Technobuffalo points out, this isn't necessarily genuine: an employee could have created this as a placeholder until official information is available. But slip-ups of this kind more often happen because a retailer has been given advance warning of an imminent launch and somebody sets it live too early by mistake. We'd say - based on this and other clues - that a Kaby Lake iMac is looking like a decent bet for launch in the near future. In November 2016, further evidence emerged that sheds light on the prospects of a Kaby Lake iMac. Intel briefly made documents available on its website, intended for PC manufacturer partners rather than consumers, that detail specs of new Kaby Lake processors - and Anandtech spotted and grabbed them. The documents detail 11 new processors, including seven i5 chips and three i7s; 10 of them are designated for desktop use and one is for worktop. There's still no sign of the Kaby Lake laptop processors we expect to use as part of a MacBook Pro update in early 2017. AMD processors We expect Apple to choose Intel-based CPUs, but there's a chance AMD could also make an appearance in certain iMac models. With the new AMD Zen processor, we hope to see the CPU make an appearance in a lot of high-end machines, given its tremendous processing power. The new processor boasts 8 cores and 16 threads - a massive amount of raw processing power. Given the suggested price tag of the Zen CPU, we expect it either to be in the top-spec iMacs or be an upgrade option. The inclusion of other AMD processors is also not far-fetched, as we still see it being an option for cheaper iMac models. New iMac 2017 specs: Graphics chips It's believed that Apple's next generation of iMacs (or its higher-specced models, at least) will feature graphics chips from AMD's Polaris set, which were announced at the start of 2016. WCCF Tech reports that AMD won the contract last October but was only able to get confirmation from additional sources in April 2016. The contract is for two chipsets: Polaris 10 (previously known as Ellesmere) and Polaris 11 (previously known as Baffin), and WCCF Tech says these processors will appear in "new desktops and notebooks from Apple, which the company plans to bring to market later this year". With the MacBook and MacBook Air having recently seen updates, and the Mac mini highly unlikely to incorporate a discrete graphics unit, the remaining candidates are the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro. MacRumors reasons that the power range of these chips makes Polaris 11 a strong fit for the MacBook Pro, while Polaris 10 suits the iMac. The Polaris chips offer improved graphics performance compared with previous generations (as much as twice the speed per watt) and potential reductions in both power consumption and waste heat. They are built using a 16nm or 14nm FinFET production process, compared to 28nm on AMD's earlier chips, which means that the chip maker can fit more transistors in a given space (which makes the chips ideal for ultraportable laptops and ultraslim desktops - the latter fitting recent iMac designs) and, because the transistors are closer together, less power is needed to move a signal across them. Apple's current iMac line-up features AMD Radeon graphics chipsets as standard in the 27-inch models. The 21-inch models come with integrated Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics. Read next: New Mac Pro rumours | New Mac mini rumours New iMac 2017 specs: Virtual reality Talking about graphics architecture can be a little dry, but the Polaris rumour discussed above has a sexier element to it: VR. AMD has consistently talked up its Polaris graphics chips as a way of bringing VR within the reach of a wider market of PC users. At present Macs are basically unusable for VR, as we discuss in our articles Can you use Oculus Rift with Mac? and How to use a Mac for VR, and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey specifically cited underpowered Mac GPUs as the reason why the company was focusing on Windows: "People have said, 'Why don't you support Macs? So many people have Macs.' It's true. A lot of people have Apple hardware, especially in the laptop space. But the GPUs in those, they're not even close to what we're pushing for our recommended spec." But adding Polaris GPUs to the iMac could change Luckey's mind. AMD's Roy Taylor thinks the company's new GPUs are about to massively expand the available market for VR. "AMD has just completed the shrink to 14nm [with Polaris]," he said. "This means we can produce GPUs that will run the minimum spec of VR at a lower cost, in larger volume, consuming less power and running faster. That means in the second half of this year and going forward, more people will be able to run those headsets." Visit WCCF Tech for more info. VR remains a niche topic in tech - the number of people actually willing to shell out for the whole shebang remains small, even if casual gamers who try the Vive or the Oculus Rift tend to love it - but it gets a lot of press at the moment. And it can't be nice for a company that prides itself on the quality of its products to hear them disparaged as "not even close" to being up to a task. As Jim Lynch on CIO colourfully phrases it, "As far as VR goes, it's not something that I have paid much attention to, but it certainly couldn't hurt for Apple's computers to be able to do it adequately... If VR lights a fire under Apple's rear end and gets the company to put out a pro version of the iMac, then it will be a good thing for all users." New iMac 2017 specs: Flash storage We'll repeat our hope, expressed this time last year while waiting for the 2015 update, that Apple makes flash storage standard across the entire range of iMacs. At present the 27-inch iMacs get a Fusion Drive by default (Fusion Drives are a high-performance hybrid blend of flash and conventional storage) and the 21.5-inch models can add them as a build-to-order option for an extra £80. We think it should be offered as standard in all Apple's desktops. The current 21.5-inch iMac range is crippled somewhat by its hard drives, which are a lot slower than the flash drives used in all of Apple's laptops - to the extent that Mac laptops with similar processors will perform noticeably better than the equivalent iMac because of their faster SSD drives. Read next: Best external SSD flash drives for Mac New iMac 2017 rumours: Could the iMac replace the Mac Pro? In our roundup of rumours about the next Mac Pro, we discuss the possibility that Apple is planning to wrap up that line - and one way such a move could work is by ramping up the top spec of the iMac line so that it meets the needs of professional users, rendering the Pro irrelevant. TechRadar has speculated about the specs of a theoretical 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling. All of this is certainly a possibility. But while the Mac Pro doesn't appear to be tearing up trees commercially, it was never a line that was about making money. The Mac Pro is a flagship product, a niche offering and a positioning exercise - a way of reassuring Mac buyers that Apple is still a company that makes products for pro users. In some senses it's like the Apple Watch Edition: a glamorous, unnecessarily expensive aspiration point that passes on some of its stardust to the more affordable diffusion lines below.

Video provided by AFP Newslook Crowds gather to see a BMW concept vehicle at the BMW Group news conference Wednesday at CES in Las Vegas. (Photo: Walden Kirsch/Intel Corporation) LAS VEGAS — Not that long ago, checking in on the state of self-driving car technology meant asking Google's engineers how they were doing. The search company was virtually alone on the autonomous car highway. But in the last four years, that road has gotten crowded. The Consumer Electronics Show has served as a leading indicator of the growing interest in self-driving tech, eventually welcoming to what traditionally was a gadget-fest more than a dozen automakers. Two years ago, Ford CEO Mark Fields even delivered the keynote, a spotlight previously reserved for the likes of Bill Gates. This year, CES, which wraps here Sunday, again puts a spotlight on the mounting competition between not just the automakers but also the suppliers vying to provide the high-tech components that allow vehicles to navigate through a world of obstacles. It's clear now that engineers are able to make cars drive themselves. The bigger issue is how to scale this technology in a way that finds it both culturally embraced and scientifically sound — and is cost effective. As tech companies such as Nvidia, Intel, Harman join major auto brands such Audi, BMW and Volvo — 500 auto-tech companies large and small came to CES this year — in showing off their chips, sensors and smart cars, one has to wonder if this is a winner-take-all contest or if we're creating competing standards that could delay the arrival of a self-driving future. "There's a lot of desire to be the ones who can get there first and monetize this market for self-driving cars and it's causing almost a frenetic activity across the automotive industry, both from automakers and from tech companies," said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. If the various self-driving car booths here had a singular mission, it was to showcase how much safer the driving world can be thanks to technology. Delphi's Mary Gustanski explains the display inside a self-driving Audi SUV in Las Vegas.  (Photo: Mike Snider, USA TODAY) Auto parts supplier Delphi Automotive gave reporters rides in a 2017 Audi Q5 SUV. Its self-driving system was developed with sensors made by Mobileye and chips from Intel that automatically avoided a collision without input from its driver. "I see the potential for zero accidents and mobility for all simply because drivers have been taken out of the transportation equation," said Doug Davis, who leads Intel's automated driving group. Many automakers have set an eventual goal of zero deaths in their vehicles, remarkable considering that 30,000 die each year in the U.S. and more than a million worldwide. The competition to produce technology that can help car companies reach that milestone is intensifying quickly. AT&T, Intel, Nvidia: latest names in self-driving AT&T announced at CES that it was working with Delphi and Ford on improving vehicle communication with other cars and infrastructure. AT&T is also building a self-driving test center in Michigan with the American Center for Mobility. Intel and Mobileye are working with BMW to deploy 40 self-driving BMWs by the second half of 2017, the companies said here Wednesday. Intel, which announced that it plans to invest in high-definition mapping-firm Here, also is developing autonomous driving hardware and software platforms that could serve as a standard for other innovators to adopt. Meanwhile, Intel competitor Nvidia announced at CES Wednesday that it had landed Germany's ZF Group as its first customer for a car-computing platform powered by its chips that boasts both machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. Big names in the chip game such as Qualcomm and AMD are also in the hunt. "We are going to see cars become the next major platform to battle over for the semiconductor makers," said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research. USA TODAY Nvidia aims to spread Google AI through home USA TODAY Faraday Future's electric car gets a face and a name: FF 91 Samsung, too, became a major player in car connectivity and autonomous driving with its November $8 billion acquisition of Harman, which has its own auto tech expertise and relationships with automakers. "It is by far the hottest area in terms of tech," O'Donnell said. In Harman's demonstration area at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, the company showed off all the various aspects of autonomous vehicles, including smart ride-sharing cars that adapt the car's settings, display and personal audio zones based on riders' profiles. Harman's holographic augmented reality display proof of concept for autonomous vehicles on display at the CES in Las Vegas.  (Photo: Harman) Another self-driving car Harman showcased offers riders a fully-immersive IMAX-style projection and sound system. Also on display was cybersecurity software to protect your car from hackers. Harman's partners in its autonomous car-tech quest include Apple, Daimler Chrysler, Google, IBM and Microsoft. All this collaboration would seem to bode well, but the truth is even those deeply enmeshed in the self-driving car world believe there are many miles to be driven before the masses enjoy this breakthrough. "No one company can do everything," said Dinesh Paliwal, Harman CEO and Chairman. Even though, "the autonomous car is almost here, we are 10 to 15 years out from the day when you have the majority of the cars with smarts that interact with each other through the cloud." In the meantime, expect auto-tech breakthroughs to trickle down into new vehicles in the form of increasingly sophisticated driver-assist features, just as driver-assisted parking and automatic braking have so far. USA TODAY Toyota car gives driver an artificial intelligence buddy And along the way, some companies may fall to the wayside, as did some in the transition from traditional cell phones to today's smartphones. "The next 10 years is going to be as influential in the car and personal transportation world as the smartphone has been in the past ten years," Autotrader's Brauer said. "You are going to see companies disappear because they can't adapt quickly enough." O'Donnell agrees and expects the industry to coalesce around multiple approaches. "It's an exciting area and it’s clear no one owns it. Frankly, it's big enough there may be multiple players."

View Latest Posts >>> What really happened to Hitler and the Third Reich Nazi High Command? By Preston James, Ph.D on January 5, 2017 Did Hitler Escape Germany and is the New FOURTH REICH Alive and Well? Greg Hallett Over the years, I have come into contact with numerous very interesting individuals in my research on the endemic high level government corruption. One such individual is Gregg Hallett, a well-known previously very successful architect from New Zealand, a man who exposed corruption in New Zealand and had to flee to Europe and the UK because of serious harassment by Law Enforcement and Intel. Greg is the modal example of how a well educated, well respected professional can became a Truth-seeker, and then became transformed into an international anti-corruption Truth-warrior, all because of high level corruption that impacted his life. While working as a professional architect in New Zealand, Greg refused to accept abuse by a corrupt system and then fought back with every resource he had to expose it. Initially he had hoped that higher government and Law Enforcement authorities would clean it up. Instead he found out the higher you go the more corrupt they are. After bucking the corruption endemic to the system in New Zealand, and moving to Europe to escape all the murder attempts, he began to investigate the source of this corruption which had also overtaken and occupied England. Ever since his journey as a Truth-seeker he has paid an enormous personal price for his research and activism. The real miracle here is that Greg is still standing and some mysterious force always seems to protect him and keep him just barely getting by. His story is quite remarkable to say the least. Greg is my friend and I have a lot of respect for him and his work. His research has shown that the current Queen of England is an imposter and he has laid this all out in well documented form in his excellent books. Greg Hallett has authored a number of revealing books based on high level MI-6 Intel and from his own sources. My favorite and one of his most well-known is Hitler was a British Agent. This is a remarkable book based on very high level Intel from a highly ranked insider he came to know. Before Greg had to leave New Zealand due to serious harassment by Intel and Law Enforcement for bucking the crooked system and expecting justice, he became good friends with a man he called “the Spymaster”. The Spymaster was a former very high ranking MI-6 man but who had apparently retired in New Zealand and came to know Greg. It may be that Greg Hallett was chosen to serve as a “drip” to leak out historical information by a certain oppositional but high ranking power faction in the UK through MI-6. Greg has written some excellent books on hidden history and some of the Intel behind his books is stunning to say the least. These books are filled with historical data almost impossible to find in any library even with years of deep research. I have read his excellent classic the Blackmailers Guide to New Zealand and it seems to be quite accurate. For anyone living in New Zealand and wants to know how things are really run behind the scenes, this is a must read. Hitler I don’t agree with Greg’s views in regard to the life of Jesus associated with claims of the Merovingians, but with everything else. Greg’s writings about corruption in New Zealand, the heritage of the Royals, and what happened to Hitler are accurate. And as time goes on his claims about what happened to Hitler at the end of WW2 in his book are being progressively corroborated bit by bit, especially by declassified Intel documents in the UK and the USA. This man the Spymaster gave Greg frequent high level briefings on high level Intel, how things really work behind the scenes in new Zealand and inside England too. Greg was given a great deal of Intel not known generally, especially about how Hitler was rescued from Germany and by whom, and who the Queen really is and where she came from. Hitler didn’t die in the Bunker. According to Greg Hallett’s account, Hitler left two murdered doubles in the bunker (one that was his and another Eva Braun’s) and then fled through a tunnel system to a float plane to eventually end up in Spain. From Spain, he may have been taken by ship or submarine to South America to one of the Nazi enclaves (there were a number of them in some areas with large German populations). Or he may have remained in Spain. Certainly there is some reason to believe that Hitler was considered irrelevant at the end of the war because, two years before it ended, special agreements were negotiated with the Allies, specifically US and England Intel, jointly without his input. The best evidence I have been made privy to so far is that Hitler probably died in 1950 in Spain at a Catholic Church rectory while retiring as a gardener growing roses. How interesting it is that some insiders believe that Angela Merkel is the actual daughter of Hitler and Eva Braun. She certainly looks a great deal like him. If true this would certainly explain a lot about her counter-intuitive efforts to “Globalize” Germany by bringing in so many foreign immigrants, an obvious effort to destroy Germany’s language, culture and borders. _________ Secret Intel Agreement Two years before the end of the war, a special secret agreement was negotiated with General Kammler and American and British Intel. Churchill had convinced FDR that the war had to be extended until at least 5 years in order to gain enough land and booty to pay the settlements required by the Bank of International Settlements which came into being in 1930. According to the secret rules of conquest and war after 1930, the winner of any war has to pay to rebuild the nations they defeat. This was passed as a means to prevent the recurrence of the punitive Treaty of Versailles which devastated Germany and led to the rise of the Nazi regime. Plus Churchill had been instructed by the City of London (COL) leaders that he needed to make sure the supply lines into the Work Camps in Germany, and other countries were bombed to increase the death rate for Judaics so that this would serve as more powerful propaganda later on as the Zionist slave state of the New Israel was created. General Kammler was head of the special weapons programs of the Nazis that was responsible for developing super high tech weapons and anti-gravity craft that was reputed to have been shared by the Vril Girls. The Nazis also had a recovered crashed Alien ET UFO that had crashed in Bavaria in 1922 during a powerful thunder storm. Bormann was the Nazi’s business agent, and he prepared Gold stashes in other nations as a back-up plan when he felt certain that Germany would be defeated. Kammler was made privy to this and they formulated a very crafty back up plan to create Nazi SS enclaves throughout South America, Australia and Canada, with armed bases in South America and one in Antarctica (New Schwabenland). Kammler’s and Bormann’s deal negotiated with the allies was this. Operation Paperclip became a reality based on these secret, very sensitive negotiations. Top Nazi Intel officers and those scientists working on ultra-high technology being back engineered from Alien ETs would be given complete immunity if they did three things: 1>The Nazi scientists working on rocketry and anti-gravity craft would be brought into the USA and would be employed at a living wage and would be expected to continue their Alien ET research and advanced rocketry. This eventually led to a bifurcated space program, with the rocket-based system for public consumption, and the secret anti-gravity programs becoming deeply buried inside certain Defense Contractor special access, unacknowledged “need to know” deep-black and beyond-black programs. In Germany, as the program was being transferred to a special unit of the Allies, General Kammler had all his top officers not essential to the program shot in cold blood. This give one an idea how cold-blooded Kammler really was; and he was of the same cloth as Borman, Skorzeny and most other top Nazi insiders who had taken a blood oath to the Reich of the Black Sun. The anti-gravity craft programs had already been bifurcated from the rocketry programs in Germany, and the plan was to continue this bifurcation as cover for the anti-gravity craft programs. >2 Gehlen and Muehler would transfer their spy system embedded inside the Soviet Union to US Intel and would develop a complete cold war strategy for the City of London Banksters. This eventually resulted in the Nazi takeover of American Intel, and the creation of the CIA after the UFO crashed at Roswell NM that sent the American Military into a tailspin. Roswell was leaked on purpose and then covered up to create a crisis in American Intel and the US Congress so that there would be sufficient motivation to pass the Draconian and unconstitutional National Security Act of 1947. >3 Some Nazis would be allowed to occupy South American nations as long as they agreed to provide security systems for the puppet dictators that served the needs of the big American Corporations which needed to oppress the populace and keep cheap access to their natural resources. Those who want more information on the secret Nazi technology can read the fine works by Joseph P. Farrell, an Oxford educated expert of Nazi high technology. _________ South America and Antarctica USS Sennet 1946 Operation HighJump The German base in New Schwabenland in Antarctica was not included in the negotiations because the Allied Intel did not have good substantiation about it. It has been decided that later on after they had developed a good relationship with the Nazis under Operation Paperclip, they would ten press to be a part of that and share in those secrets. But this did not happen and the Nazis were resistant to provide any meaningful information about this even suggesting that the Nazis at this underground/underwater base in Antarctica had formed an alliance with Alien ETs already living there and had gone renegade even from the Nazi high command in South America. In 1947 Admiral Byrd ran a secret naval armed expeditionary force called “Operation Highjump”. Aircraft were deployed and shot down and at least one ship allegedly sunk. Byrd returned to America closed lipped, but while in Argentina had told a reporter that the force they battled with could fly from pole to pole rapidly. This is where good accounts crease and only speculation remains. Sources deep inside American Intel have rumored that another expeditionary naval force was sent back in 1952 and deployed nuclear devices against this Nazi underground base. Allegedly some kind of negotiated truce agreement was formed to be able to do research in Antarctica, but the Alien ET base with co-opted Nazis was to be left alone. It is unknown if the US’ Secret Space War program formed in 1947 later formed a cooperative effort with these Antarctic Alien ETs reputed to be “tall Whites”, and believed to be tolerant of Anglos and Americans and willing to cooperate on mutual interests — like defeating the Dracos which were reputed to hold an iron grip on world banking and most of the Satanic secret societies. _________ Enter the Israelis, Cutouts for the COL Zionist Rothschild Khazarian Mafia (RKM) Banksters After the end of WW2, in the early 1950’s when the Zionists inside the COL Banking system became concerned that the Nazis could become too powerful, they devised a plan to weaken them and bring them into the official COL fold. And the Israelis convinced the COL Bankster councils that in order to create the New Israel on confiscated Palestinian land, they needed to create massive anti-Nazi propaganda as a means to mind-kontrol Judaics enough to get massive worldwide support for Israel. The long term plan of the COL Banksters which has always been associated with a Draconian, Satanic Cult and high Freemasonry had always believed that they needed to occupy Jerusalem, where Satan would then be seated as world ruler as soon as they completed their Globalist NWO Agenda. The top Nazi generals had not wanted to go to war in the first place, they believed that they could take over the world economically in time. But Hitler had been mind-kontrolled to believe he could stop the Bolsheviks, partner with England and then take over and rule the whole world. The team that rescued Hitler from his Bunker was run by Ian Fleming, a man later murdered at the orders of Allen Dulles for writing his book about Dulles, The Man With The Golden Gun. Paperclip scientists in America According to this narrative supplied by the Spymaster, Hitler was a British Agent, deeply mind-kontrolled at Tavistock Institute. He was told that the plan was for Germany to stop Russia and that Britain would join forces and together they would take over the whole world. The proof of this lies in two events: First Hitler’s counterintuitive release of the Allies trapped at Dunkirk (he could have won the war right there). Second, his sending Rudolf Hess to fly into Britain to finalize his expected alliance between Germany and England. Why England turned on him is an interesting question. Was it a ruse right from the start or did the group running England change their minds about Hitler because of his new view on Banking which was counter to theirs? And there is the group “Sharkhunters” that has traced Hitler’s escape to South America and claims to have a lot of evidence. Jeff Rense has broadcast numerous excellent programs and articles by Sharkhunters on Rense.com.  I am not familiar with their all their claims about Hitler’s escape but they have done a lot of research. And then there is the recent history Channel series Hunting Hitler. They may disagree on dates and specific living locations for Hitler post WW2, but they all agree that he survived the end of the war. The man who knows the most about what happened to the Nazis and their Third Reich in general after WW2 is the noted investigative journalist and top selling author Jim Marrs, who has written an excellent, well-respected book, The Rise of the Fourth Reich. And of course there is a lot of misinformation that has been planted on the Internet and broadcast and published to mislead researchers as deception and cover. Here is what I think happened to Hitler from my best sources. Over the years in my profession I did meet and get to know some very high level individuals, some high level Intel. You can take this information for what it is worth (informed rumors), but I believe it is valid. Do your own research and diligence and you will probably come to a realistic conclusion. In 1943 two years before WW2 ended, General Kammler met in secret with British and American Intel and negotiated a deal. He agreed to surrender all his Vril high technology and advanced weapons at the end of the war in exchange for complete immunity and guaranteed jobs for 9,000 of his technicians, scientists and engineers working on these systems inside America. He had been told that the Allied High Command would be continuing the war for another two years for economic reasons but that there was no way Germany could ever make its high tech weapons operational. Another similar deal was made with the General running the Nazi atomic bomb program. They had already successfully fired one off before the end of the war but were short plutonium. That deal negotiated with the allies resulted in the transfer of the German Plutonium and detonator designs and prototypes to the Allies at the end of the war and the nuclear material was used in one of the nuclear bombs dropped on Japan. The person that inserted the detonators in the bombs that were used to attack Nagasaki and Hiroshima just happened to be a woman (not generally known, but I have met her son). Martin Bormann During WW2, the Nazi top command (specifically Bormann who was the real leader of Germany and the Nazis) lost all confidence in Hitler and started making secret arrangements to transfer Gold and valuable artwork all over the world, to Spain, to South America, to Australia, to New Zealand, and even to America and Canada. Bormann was planning to create a new Fourth Reich that would eventually rule the world and result in a Globalist NWO one-world government. Bormann believed that the USA and England were so impressed with the Nazi Intel methodologies and their technology and weapons development programs they could slowly infiltrate and take over both nations. And the USG brought both Gehlen and Muehler mover to build their Intel system in order to counter the new Soviet threat. Gehlen sold the idea to the USG that he had completely penetrated the Soviets at all levels and had a strong spy network in place there and in all satellite nations. Over time there is good anecdotal evidence that the Bormann Plan to covertly build the Fourth Reich was successful and there is reason to believe that it merged with the City of London Globalist plan to build a NWO with a one-world government. Bormann met in secret with the Russians in Switzerland (where he made the deal with the Allies) and formulated plans which accepted the defeat of the Third Reich, but would replace it covertly with the new and secret Fourth Reich. At the end of the war, Bormann and his fellow top Nazis, some who were in uniform and many were industrialists (not just in Germany but all over the world) had a great deal of gold and valuable artwork amassed during WW2. With this vast fortune Bormann and his closest business associates were able to buy major blocks of controlling stock in about 750 of the largest International corporations (oil companies, pharmaceuticals, defense contractors, etc.). Aerial Los Alamos Bormann also had formed close associations with numerous dictators in South America and started providing security services to them, and he did this for the nation of Egypt too. Colonia Dignidad was used as a base for this and to run special “Boys from Brazil” breeding programs, an interrogation center, and as a base to build a large narcotics cartel which later formed a partnership with the Mossad and the CIA (a three way partnership). Hitler stayed away from Colonia Dignidad and was kept out of all Fourth Reich matters. He was told it was for his own protection, but the truth was Bormann felt he was incompetent and deranged. The Israelis were beginning to understand that pushing the “hunt for Nazis” all over the world was great press and help increase their ability to get funding from the US Congress and was a great help politically in Israel. The South American dictators were protecting the Nazis because they trained and ran their security and their deaths squads to keep the peasants in line. But this drive in Israel to hunt every last Nazi down was creating major pressure and Israeli diplomats were busy negotiating with the US State Department to make some kind of deal to get access to these Nazis hiding in South America. A deal was cut and Otto Skorzeny was involved. He found out that the Israelis had put out a contract to assassinate him and were closely on his trail, but that they might be willing to make a deal. So Skorzeny made a deal through intermediaries. He would provide some wetwork for them and provide them information. In exchange he would be allowed to live in America and would also work for American Intel. Bormann supposedly died of stomach cancer in about 1950. His first death then was faked by huim and he allegedly really died sometime between 1955 and 1965. Hitler allegedly died of stomach cancer in 1950 in Spain, living in a Catholic Church home. I think that both of these were assassinations by Skorzeny as a part of a deal made with the Israelis. Plus the Fourth Reich that Bormann set up became completely corporatized, except for the strong Nazi element inside NATO known as Gladio which was responsible for staging terrorist acts for the City of London. The new Fourth Reich Corporate conglomerate decided to get rid of the old Nazis and go completely three piece suit. Through various deals, the dictators protecting them were displaced and the Nazi strongholds in South America were demolished. I believe that Skorzeny poisoned both Bormann and Hitler after that action was approved by this Fourth Reich Directors. Those that were not murdered were discredited and prosecuted, especially those at Colinia Dignidad. So now we have an essentially Nazi/Mossad hybrid system running all security and Intel for the City of London Banksters and their private world Banking System, all of which takes orders from those that hijacked the Vatican, the Jesuit Superior General. And currently this Fourth Reich, a large secret group of major corporations produces oil, pharmaceuticals and has a very large clothing company that displays the swastika in a mildly disguised form. They also run some major defense corporations and are reputed to have complete control over the whole Secret Shadow Government, all Secret Space War matters, including the two main space war groups, and all their 140 Deep Underground Military Bases (DUMBs) inside the USA, the four corners area, and many DUMBs all over the world, even in Norway. As an aside, there are many inside MI-6 that believe that Eva Braun and Hitler had a daughter and that daughter is Angela Merkel. Hitler probably lived in South America until things got too hot because of the Israelis and was moved back to Spain, where he lived as a retired man gardening. I never heard what became of Eva Braun, other than her daughter Merkel was sheep-dipped and propelled to the top. The question of what and where is the Fourth Reich today is an interesting one and quickly involves a great deal of esoteric topics, like what happened to the Nazi base in New Schwabenland (Antarctica), was the Nazi an occult organization at its center based on worship of the Black Sun? Did the Nazis have possession of crashed and recovered alien ET anti-gravity craft from Bavaria in 1922, and did they receive Alien ET technology directly from the Vril Girls? _________ Conclusion Just routine back-engineered technology My best sources have suggested that the Fourth Reich is alive and well today, but in different form, because it has formed an alliance with those who run the Vatican, City of London private Fiat world banking, the Israelis and the major defense contractors in America, especially the no-bid ones. Jim Marrs, the top expert on the Fourth Reich, would likely have a lot to say about all this. Some believe that it runs all American Intel and all US black projects including the US Secret Space War Program. This belief is likely well-founded. This new arrangement is not surprising because the folks that really run things inside the Vatican and the City of London do so according to the Roundtable design. Those with corruption and power are brought in, kind of like the Cosa Nostra Ruling Council for the New York Five Families, but only on a world scale. Thus, at this governing Roundtable can sit Israelis on one side; three-piece-suit Fourth Reich Nazis on the other side who still run the Gladio left behind army inside NATO; COL and Wall Street Banksters on the other side; and wealthy groups, like the Saudis, that serve as a major funding source for other Roundtable member groups who deliver protection and services for them. Ex Corde License plate (photo art) This Roundtable form of world government requires only that these group leaders serve that same God Lucifer (aka Satan or Baal) and are fully committed at least in appearance to the Globalist NWO Agenda of the top single world leader, the Superior general who represents the European Old Black Nobility and carries all the full world authority of the Mark of Cain for Evil Ruling over Evil. Occasionally a group may make a play to grab more power, and that may explain what has happened in the last US Presidential election. It is too soon to know for certain if this is what happened, and if so, who did it; but in time we shall likely find out. And some researchers claim that a new populist force within America and certain Intel groups has now made a powerful pay to re-balance the forces that sit at the Roundtable. If true, this is the first time in history that populism has emerged so quickly and so powerfully — and this must all be credited to the new unanticipated social effects of the worldwide Internet, the New Gutenberg Press. _________ The following link is tested and will play, although it looks ‘blank’: _____________ Related Posts: NEO – John Kerry’s Trip to the South Pole MK-Ultra Triple Play in Orlando (Updated) World War II myths fuel Western crimes Why Alex Jones Bashes Nazis Is the GOP Really America’s Domestic Enemy?

It would give the Us a hold on those nazis to shut up about the angloamerican role behind nazism and the WWs. But Greg Hallett is a mythmaker. No way AH was an agent but just a dupe. No way he would deliberately betray Germany. Not initially but gradually both AH and Stalin were cornered believing they had no option left but to fight. AH inspired by the British had already said too much for Stalin ever to trust him. And both were given signals from Britain to which they reacted in a logical manner. The British had an enormous skill in handling dupes and the nazis were mostly simpleminded people. Mayby M Borman and Schacht were more aware but they still were dupes. AH had a naive sortof romantic view of being chosen to carry out the racial superiority masterplan for the British empire resulting in his admired Germany being accepted as Britains partner. Log in to Reply Edward Longshanks  January 7, 2017 at 9:42 am Stalin was not enforced to fight by external reasons, but by internals. He understood Trotzky’s aspect of permanent revolution very well. Communism in one state, promoted officially by Stalin, does not work economically, proved by history. Stalin sacrificed many Million farming people to refinance his investments in the military. In 1939 the USSR was more armed than the rest of the planet, including the US, except the navies. About the intelligence of the British leaders we have not to debate. Who loses the greatest Empire, the planet has ever seen, and the status of the world reserve currency in 30 years, must be either insane or totally stupid. About evidence and assumptions i would like to draw your attention to the fact that major Allied files are still closed. I do not doubt Dr. James’ contacts, but i would feel better with published files and open archives. PeterAG  January 7, 2017 at 4:29 pm Edward Longshanks Britains Cecil Rhodes decided long before ww1 that the empire would/might need to move the capital to the US. The angloamerican establishment exposed only through Carroll Quigleys work was the vehicle and most of those Hitleradmirers who fail to grasp his role as a dupe also usually havent absorbed Quigleys important revelations. Ever wondered why allied files are still closed? Right, among other reasons because of the decisive cornering of both Stalin and Hitler. Mannerheims spies have revealed the part about how Hitler was cornered. Rakovsky whos credibility is admittedly uncertain claimed that Britain told Stalin he would have to fight the nazis alone unless he occupied Poland. But that is in perfect agreement with Britains wish to foment the eastern war so it makes sense. Rakovsky also made many claims about the financiers and bolshevism which have been confirmed in archives captured from Grand Orient. It is confirmed in official sources that Britain tried to make France sign a stated lie about Stalins unwillingness to ally with France and Britain against Hitler but France refused. It was indeed Britain who stalled their deal forcing the M/R pact. Edward Longshanks  January 6, 2017 at 3:56 pm Dr. James, i watched again all those Antarctica Vids, always an exciting story. But i think, all your interested readers know them already and the conclusions behind, taken from the moon to Miguel S. But it unfortunately seems that no one (including me) from this community has enough money for an expedition following the course of Admiral Byrd. With some luck a few of those 5.000 US navy guys under Byrd’s flag could still live and not afraid to tell you/us the truth.

Was there ever a time when a fetish was made of inheritance of the throne of England – of anywhere ? The world is generally ruled by the ‘mailed fist’, the magnate with the largest personal treasure to buy mercenary troops, finance wars, etc. Henry I of England raced back to England from France, and more specifically to Winchester, to get his hands on the national treasure before his brother, Robert, could get it. Same family, but there have always been usurpers, haven’t there ? Heck William I usurped the throne from Harold, and the Saxons had usurped it from the Britons. I read a while back that the technically legitimate heir to the throne – I think, living in Germany or perhaps Holland – when asked about it, couldn’t have cared less. He evidently had a realistic understanding tha there was an enormous weight of recent history that rendered such a technicality irrelevant. And I dare say he realised his life wouldn’t be his own if he did accede to the throne.

Thanks for filling in a lot of the details in your article! The U.S. military intel were aware of the goings on with the crafts the Germans were working on and of course wanted in and that is why the Paperclip round up happened. It went two directions: 1.

There has been a long time joint alliance with ET’s at the base in Antarctica which is now completely off limits. The real reason John Kerry flew down for a visit was not climate change. Buzz Aldrin had a heart attack because he saw something he was not prepared for… Antarctica, Nazi scientists, Nordic ET’s, Draco reptillians, Secret Space Program, Lost continent of Atlantis, Department of the Navy, (many were killed and the rest chased out) pyramids, underground cities…. all tied together.

The Windsor were not the first family who cheated the throne of England. The Brits did it themselves with William of Orange….They like it so much to be ruled by foreigners. Trakkath  January 6, 2017 at 11:58 am You know the difference between rightful and unlawful ? And the difference between a stolen title and a rightful title ? Abbass  January 5, 2017 at 6:51 pm Some of this is accurate seeming but actually there isn’t really any debate about what happened with Hitler and he died in Argentina. The FBI records proving their knowledge of it hace even been released on FOIA. See “Hitler in Argentina” by Harry Cooper. I’ve seen Snopes trying to debunk it too, which actually doesn’t do any such thing. Log in to Reply Trakkath  January 5, 2017 at 6:55 pm What about disinfo by a foreign gov force like the FED ? Edward Longshanks  January 6, 2017 at 4:26 am Abbas, i like those articles of Dr. James and others. The point is the lacking evidence. The real story behind is not where Hitler died or not, the real story deals about our personal wishes. All speculators about those stories have the deep whish in the most inner personality, that Hitler had survived. But i doubt it. No one doubts Goebbels suicide and the killing of his wife and children. Do you think Hitler was less brave than his most loyal comrade in the question of suicide? Do you think that Hitler would let his best comrade behind? Other NS leaders we could call cowards, because they hoped for mercy despite they knew it better. In January 1942 the NS leadership knew that the war was lost and they will have to die. Preston James, Ph.D  January 6, 2017 at 7:28 pm Where Hitler finally retired and died is not so important as is the survival of the Third Reich and its transformation into a secret mega multi-national group of corporations that formed alliance with it enemies and other organized crime groups. This is the corporate model for the NWO, rule by a coalition of large international corporations that control govts. It is called super-fascism, the merger of the govt with corporations but where the corporation coalition stacks and hijacks each govt to serve as their secret puppet. Right now the best approximation of the Roundtable or Coalition is G7, where they all share Intel and agents among their member govts. Attempts were made to expand this to G20 but so far they appear to have failed.

ManCavePatriot  January 5, 2017 at 3:21 pm The CIA [Catholics In Alliance] is nothing more than the sectarian ‘confessional booth’ for the Jesuit Vatican. Mr. Hallett exposed the Windsors/Guelphs as imposters to the Royal throne by researching the rightful heirs of Edward III to an Australian businessman. All of this mental masturbation doesn’t change the reality that confronts us. “Might Makes Right”. Log in to Reply Edward Longshanks  January 6, 2017 at 3:53 am Do not be so sure about the Jesuits. Pope Francis is the first jesuit on the throne. This move shows us the desperation of the catholics. The Jesuits were often used as in Japan, but often forbidden. This BBC documentation is really nice, but the German Windsors sit in Buckingham palace. Your conclusion “Might Makes Right” is totally correct, but not a news. Law is made for the weak. In Germany we have many small groups, called “Reichsbürger”, they want to prove the illegal status of Germany. But legel or illegal is never the question. The question is who is empowered with the executive (police/army) forces. Who owns a military option, the rest is in reality not worthy a debate. Trakkath  January 6, 2017 at 11:36 am When was the “Reichsbürgerschaft” invented ? Was it 1934 ? Bevor 1918 you were “Bürger” of the part of germany you lived in like Bayern, Preußen, Herzogtum Brausnchweig, Herzotum Hannover etc. There was no “Reichsbürgerschaft” So guess who the “Reichbürger” are Trakkath  January 6, 2017 at 11:43 am @Edward So if someone for example a “Neusiedler” enters your home and holds a gun to your head and takes over your house and grounds you would never question the legality ? Tell more fairy tales, but to others. Edward Longshanks  January 6, 2017 at 11:43 am Trakkath, i do not think so. The Reich (untypically for Germans) was founded again at the end of the French-Prussian War as the II. Reich 1871. Edward Longshanks  January 6, 2017 at 11:48 am [ Editor’s note: This comment is off topic. ] Trakkath, the debate is insofar useless, because law is never decisive. Trakkath  January 6, 2017 at 11:56 am BTW the term “Reichsbürger” is the same fighting cry like “Nazi”, Antisemite” etc after the Nazi-accusation don´t work anymore. Guess why there is war to defend against “executive Power” forced by foreigners.See take over of Washington DC by the Crown and the resulting revolt against it. And no, the Reichsbürgerschaft was invented by Adolf. You should read the STAG and the RUSTAG 1913 to see the difference. Much luck with the Neusiedler in germany if you own a house and ground. Edward Longshanks  January 6, 2017 at 3:44 pm A.H. made the difference between Staatsanghöriger and Staatsbürger, in English is no different translation, poor lads.

Much talk about it was in Russia, too. The skull did not belong to Hitler, Martin Bormann escaped to Brazil or Argentina. Gold of Reich. Antarctic station and everything else. I think that Hitler and Bormann would be found by Jews or Soviets. Or there would be people who’d betrayed them for money and sensation. Or the only way to hide – only if USA helped. US and British troops so hurried to enter Berlin to capture German documents and scientists! But all military generals in the West told, that to take the Berlin is impossible- it was stronghold. Marshall Zhukov proved the opposite. And the haunting started – to capture technologies, scientists, top leaders of the Nazi. I do not think that the Germans collaborated with aliens. It’s a fairy tale. The same tale as aliens in Roswell. German scientists were really outstanding. Missile technology has allowed then the United States and the Soviet Union to conquer space. Much mystery has been associated with the Ahnenerbe – the mystical division of the Reich. A few months ago in the mountains of Adygea (the North Caucasus, where I live) was found the suitcase with the symbols of the Ahnenerbe. Inside were documents and two skulls, similar to the goat’s, but a strange anatomy. Now it is studied. Many grief Reich brought to my country, but we have broken the backbone of the Hitler’s military machine.

He got 2 medals for it, wounded and bravery. After the WW1 he could not bear it, in reality he became a kind of pacifist. It is the same, with Mr. Putin. For Mr. Putin, war is the last possible decision he makes. He wants always peace. Hitler had no use for any war at all. But from the point of view of the Germans he must promote the interests of Germans in the former eastern provinces.

Log in to Reply Edward Longshanks  January 5, 2017 at 9:08 am I like those stories, very exiting. The problem we face in your stories is that you mix up well known historical facts, some obviously clandestine facts with funny allegations. The Nazis never demanded to rule the planet, this is Allied propaganda as Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction or an evil Mr. Assad. Interested people have simply to read Mr. Irving’s publications, to get an independent insight about the historical events. About the clandestine events, it is to mention, that we have Admiral Byrd’s interview and we know that some German submarines are lost/missing in the precise accounting of the Germans and not so precise accounting of the Allies. My personal problem is that i met once one of the adjutants of Hitler, who was commanded by the Führer himself, to wear him out of the bunker, to burn him and his wife. I assume that Mr. Irving met the same guy. Hitler wanted to avoid to share the fate of Mussolini. And i met several times a bearer of the Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross, a lieutenant, who escorted with 2 Panther tanks Martin Bormann with others out of the Reichskanzlei, when Hitler decided to remain there. This lieutenant witnessed the death of Bormann, when he walked aside of one of the tanks. He was shot by German partisans. I recorded his statement some 18 years ago. Both guys were absolutly honourable and correct veterans.

And as i remember Bormann’s skull was found in Berlin. Moustafa Eker  January 5, 2017 at 9:05 am As of 1942 or 1943, the tide of WW2 was turned against The Nazis, and The Nazis were divided into two parts: Reinhard Gehlen’s Nazis that plan to end the war and Adolf Hitler’s Nazis that seek to wage the total war. By collaborating with the allies of WW2, Gehlen’s Nazis decided to put an end to WW2, and during the war -probably until the mid of 1945- they began an operation against Hitler and his Nazis. And Karl Eglseer, Eduard Dietl, Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels and a few more -and maybe a lot more- Hitler’s Nazis were murdered by Gehlen’s Nazis, under the cover of suicide or accident. This was the first intelligence operation of Gehlen’s Nazis -will be called later Gladio-. When finally Adolf Hitler was killed by them, the Nazi Germany had to be defeated by the allies of WW2. Along with the ending of WW2, Gehlen and his Nazis started to serve Khazarian Mafia and their royal family called British Royal Family. Hence UN, NATO, and EU were founded by Gehlen’s Nazis to control and to monitor the world. Gehlen’s Nazis never were put on trial or they testified against Hitler’s Nazis in Nuremberg. The Nuremberg trials and the next period, the Cold War-and beyond- were the anti-Hitler propaganda prepared by Gehlen’s Nazis. The real criminals were Gehlen’s Nazis, not Hitler’s Nazis! Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  January 5, 2017 at 10:07 am I think you are on to something here Moustafa Eker. Gehlen was a very crafty man who appeared to be able to infiltrate and hijack all American Intel. Of course he had help from Prescott Bush and the Dulles brothers who were closeted secret Nazis apparently. Edward Longshanks  January 5, 2017 at 10:27 am Moustafa, this makes not so much sense. Read the biography of Admiral Canaris. Canaris, a smart guy, chief of the Abwehr, was an enemy of Hitler and supported several opposition members and paid for it. But the point is, that he became more reluctant and dissociated himself from the revolteering officers. He checked very early his Allied connections via the Switzerland, what will happen, if they would dispose Mr. Hitler? The answer was, unconditional surrender. This was the insight, Churchill repeated in public. The Allies did not care about Hitler. They cared about Germany and its destruction. Hitler’s comment about the Stauffenberg assassins was very clear for everybody…. stupid, untaught officers. And i have to state, that you have no idea about the circumstances at the end and after the war in 1945. In the fate of Himmler you see the result of collaborating without useful knowledge. The Sovjets shot SS-guys and suspected political officers on the spot. Prisoners of war and Civilians were deported to Siberia. 14 Million poeple escaped the Red Army to the Tri-zone, 2 Mio. of them died on the escape. The Sovjets as the Allied kept all guys busy in Western (Eastern) intelligence obervance or advanced technologies, planes, missiles, nuclear science…etc. The western Allies managed it more comfortable. Millions of common soldiers died in the Rheinwiesen camps. Important guys were prisoned in former concentration camps as long as their fate was not decided. Edward Longshanks  January 5, 2017 at 10:30 am Intelligence guys as Gestapo Müller, Gehlen and the scientists in advanced technologies, as von Braun, were not asked, they were simply deported. They were happy not to become executed. Gehlen was paid since 56 by the CIA and not the opposite. Moustafa Eker  January 5, 2017 at 12:26 pm Thanks for the interest and comments. None of Gehlen Nazis were tried or convicted for the war crimes. And furthermore they testified against Hitler Nazis, in Nuremberg Trials. (An obvious example; Walter Schellenberg). Gehlen’s Nazis defected to Khazarian Mafia and their royal family called British Royal Family, and so served their profits. UN, NATO, and EU are organizations that protect and defend such global profits and focus NWO. All of Hitler’s Nazis were tried or killed. But Gehlen’s Team sold the accumulation of all knowledge of Nazis and gained wealth and power. That’s probably true story but has no direct evidences and clues, unfortunately. Sorry. Some of Gehlen’s Nazis here; Heinrich Rupp Walter Schellenberg Wernher von Braun Licio Gelli Emil Augsburg Willi Krichbaum Hans Globke and Intelligence squad of The Operation Paperclip and -as you know- Reinhard Gehlen Regards. M.E. Edward Longshanks  January 5, 2017 at 2:37 pm Those guys were used, because they had the knowledge about the Sovjets, the US did not had. Since 56 the Germans nust pay the Gehlen service themselves and were allowed to use some intelligence for themselves. It is a crazy exchange of the circumstances. German bombers destroyed the US?

Intel and New Balance Announce RunIQ Android Wear Smartwatch with Atom CPU GO It is now available for pre-order for $299.99 Jan 5, 2017 16:00 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  New Balance, one of the world's major sports footwear manufacturers, and Intel have teamed up for the release of a smartwatch aimed at runners, the RunIQ. The smartwatch is now available for pre-order for $299.99 via New Balance's online store, and it will be launched worldwide at New Balance brick and mortar stores, online, and other select retailers on February 1. The RunIQ smartwatch was completely designed by Intel to provide improved functionality for runners. The wearable syncs with STRAVA, which allows runners to connect and share workouts with a global community of athletes without a smartphone via built-in capability. Since it runs Android Wear, the smartwatch allows users to sync, store and listen to playlists downloaded from Google Play Music. Obviously, it features built-in GIP for tracking course, pace and distance. Just like many other smartwatches out there, RunIQ comes with a heart rate monitor, as well as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. According to Intel, the battery should offer 24 hours of typical use or up to 5 hours of continuous life with GPS and hear rate monitoring. Play Video Users will also be able to track run time and intervals with a dedicated one-tap LAP button. They can also reply to smartphone notifications when connected to a smartphone or Wi-Fi on the fly. Hardware-wise, RunIQ is powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor, coupled with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of storage. It also features a 1.39-inch AMOLED display, as well as accelerometer, gyroscope and optical heart rate monitoring (OHRM). “From professional athletes to everyday consumers, Intel technology is reinventing the boundaries of computing to evolve the way people get fit, stay active and improve their personal performance. Though partnerships with industry leaders and experts, Intel is creating smart and connected products that allow partners to put design and function first to improve everyday experiences,” reads Intel's press release.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (6 Images) #CES 2017#RunIQ smartwatch#Intel smartwatch#Android Wear#New Balance smartwatch subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it RunIQ smartwatch (6 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Meet “Vapor,” Misfit's First Touchscreen Smartwatch Asus ZenWatch 2 and ZenWatch 3 Updated with Latest Security Fixes, New Features Samsung Might Launch a Smartwatch with Foldable Display Google to Launch Two Flagship Android Wear 2.0 Smartwatches in Early 2017 It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Debian GNU/Linux 8.7 "Jessie" Live & Installable ISOs Now Available for Download - Exclusive Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs 6 photos    RunIQ smartwatch New Android APKs imo APK: Updated January 15th, 18:31 GMT AndroDumpper APK: Updated January 15th, 18:29 GMT MCPE Master APK: Updated January 15th, 18:27 GMT SuperSU APK: Updated January 15th, 18:24 GMT Geekbench 4 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:20 GMT Xbox Beta APK: Updated January 15th, 18:17 GMT Action Launcher 3 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:14 GMT Reader comments Qualcomm Says Nokia Phone Caught on Video at CES Is a Reference Design Device more on: Nokia 8 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Intel 5G Modem, as the device has been called, has a new 5G transceiver paired to its baseband chip, which enables both sub-6Ghz and mmWave capabilities - on which 5G depends. It incorporates 3GPP 5G NR (new radio) technology, including lower latency frame structures, advanced channel coding and massive MIMO, which the company says will help deliver faster connectivity and improve responsiveness. In a blog post, Aicha Evans, VP and GM for the communications and devices group at Intel, said: "Our goal is to support both early trials and to lay a foundation enabling accelerated development of products that will support the 3GPP NR specification and help drive global adoption of the 3GPP 5G standard. "The new Intel 5G Modem is laying the groundwork for new devices capable of enhanced broadband speeds to satisfy media-hungry users." In addition to public media consumption, Evans also cited more practical uses of 5G, including providing super-fast connectivity to autonomous cars, search-and-rescue drones and smart city infrastructure. "Of course it’s the 'unknown' part of 5G’s story that’s most thrilling in my mind," Evans said. "With the right technologies in place and reliable platforms on which to test them, the opportunities to innovate, invent and launch products and services are virtually unlimited." Intel 5G Modem is expected to be distributed as samples in the latter half of this year and move into production "soon afterwards".

The game replaces pre-scanned furniture and other objects with video game scenery in virtual reality. The headset includes technology that allows it to track users' hands and where they are without any external sensors. Scroll down for video  The headset (pictured) includes technology that allows it to track users' hands and where they are without any external sensors, and is able to turn users' living rooms into a 'merged reality' game WHAT PROJECT ALLOY CAN DO  Project Alloy was first unveiled at an Intel keynote speech in August last year. CEO Brian Krzanich said the system will allow users to: 'Pick up your real-world tennis racket in your living room and step virtually onto the court at Wimbledon.  'Surge backward or forward, reach up or down, sway to the left or right — enjoy fully 6 degrees of total freedom in your movement.  He also said it could put people into the middle of a concert, and even: 'Stand on the stage with your favorite band and feel the love of the fans from their point of view.' He added that users could: 'Experience a sporting event, a concert or a film scene from any point of view — and from any position.  'Walk onto the field and right into the goalie box, or join the huddle, looking over the quarterback’s shoulder to see the calls before they’re played.   The technology, demoed at this week's CES 2017 in Las Vegas, will be licensed to manufacturers toward the end of 2017, according to Intel Chief executive Brian Krzanich. Presenting the latest prototype at the CES event yesterday, Mr Krzanuch explained that the headset does not need to connect to a separate PC or power source. It has a battery and computer built directly into the device.  Two players wearing the headset then demonstrated on stage what the technology could do. The headset created a virtual replica of the room using scanned furniture, which Intel calls 'merged reality'. During Intel's demo, bookcases and coffee tables were digitally replaced by video game scenery of a similar size and shape. The replica scenery was designed to fit the game the players were demoing, using their headsets to virtually decorate the room as a futuristic space shuttle. The headset itself will not be manufactured by Intel, but the company will instead offer the technology to other tech companies to build their own products from.

Share this article Share Project Alloy was first unveiled in August last year, but the newest prototype gave the technology its most advanced showing yet. Back when it was first announced, Intel projected that Project Alloy would bridge the gap between Virtual Reality headsets, such as the Oculus Rift, and 'Augmented Reality' headsets, such as the Microsoft HoloLens, which projects holographic data onto the wearer's field of vision. The technology, demoed at this week's CES 2017 in Las Vegas, will be licensed to manufacturers toward the end of 2017, according to Intel Chief executive Brian Krzanich Presenting the latest prototype at the CES event yesterday, Mr Krzanuch explained that the headset does not need to connect to a separate PC or power source - it has a battery and computer built directly into the device During his opening keynote at the 2016 Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveiled Project Alloy, describing it as an 'all-in-one virtual reality solution' made from the ground up. 'Merged reality delivers virtual world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before – and makes experiences impossible in the real world now possible,' he said. The firm announced it was also working with Microsoft to use the same 'holographic engine' its HoloLens uses, which will be part of Windows 10 next year. 'Next year, we will be releasing an update to Windows 10, which will enable mainstream PCs to run the Windows Holographic shell and associated mixed reality and universal Windows applications,' Microsoft's Terry Myerson said. 'The Windows Holographic shell enables an entirely new experience for multi-tasking in mixed reality, blending 2D and 3D apps at the same time, while supporting a broad range of 6 degrees of freedom devices.'  'With most VR and AR technologies available today, it’s challenging to merge physical, real-life movement and environments with simulated virtual objects, environments and actions, Mr Krzanich wrote in a post explaining the new system. Two players wearing the headset then demonstrated on stage what the technology could do. The headset created a virtual replica of the room using scanned furniture, which Intel calls 'merged reality' During Intel's demo, bookcases and coffee tables were digitally replaced by video game scenery. The replica scenery was designed to fit the game the players were demoing, using their headsets to virtually decorate the room as a futuristic space shuttle 'When it comes down to it, today’s virtual reality isn’t really that virtual. 'You often need a complex set of consoles, multiple sensors and cameras, and hand controllers. 'Merged reality delivers virtual-world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before — and makes experiences impossible in the real world now possible.' 'Through merged reality, see your hands, see your friends … see the wall you are about to run into,' the firm said. 'Using Intel RealSense technology, not only can you see these elements from the real world, but you can use your hands to interact with elements of your virtual world, merging realities. ' That means you can 'cut the VR cord,' allowing a free range of motion with 6 degrees-of-freedom across a large space. 'This, combined with collision detection and avoidance, enables the user to utilize physical movement to explore a virtual space,' Intel says.

Segway’s first robot launches to developer partners Posted Jan 5, 2017 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Better Ventures closes $21 million fund to back the next Tesla or Patagonia Segway’s moving along with its plan to develop its robotics capability, with the launch of its developer edition Loomo robot, the first robot it created and demoed last year at CES. The robot combines a domestic bot with a Segway personal transport, tackling last-mile transportation as well as addressing a host of other in- and around-home uses. Loomo has autonomous capabilities and self-balancing, with an Intel RealSense depth sensor on board, along with an advanced camera and other tools for navigating its surroundings. It’s also outfitted with various connection technologies, a microphone array for voice input, and speakers for two-way communication with users. The Segway Robotics team selected its initial department partners from a large applicant pool numbering in the “thousands,” the company says, who were selected from applicants to its Developer Program, which was announced at Intel’s Developer Forum in Shenzhen this past April. Developer concepts include both hardware and software, and in addition to the Loomo SDK, Segway will offer its partners a bay that allows adding on hardware accessories. Developer kits will start rolling out to partners early this year, with the first to receive including BMW, Intel, MIT Smart Center and Stibo Accelerator. Segway chose the companies because of the range of opportunities they’ll be building with Loomo, which include autonomous driving for BMW; personal robotics and depth capabilities for Intel; medical and elderly care for MIT; and enterprise and consumer safety and retail for Stibo Accelerator. A lot of companies this year, especially automakers, are demonstrating personal transportation solutions including electric scooters and portable shuttles to help address last-mile mobility for users who might be faced with mobility problems. Likewise, there’s a keen interest in personal and home robotics from both big and small companies. A robot that has the potential to combine both successfully would likely be a popular option both with potential partners looking to supplement their own transportation solutions and with companies focused on addressing the opportunities that come along with an aging global population, so it’ll be interesting to see what this group of developer partners comes up with in terms of building out Loomo’s list of abilities.

It is produced by Segway Inc. of New Hampshire. The name "Segway" is a homophone of "segue" (a smooth transition, literally Italian for "follows").

The chipmaker announced a high-performance computing platform to provide processing power from vehicles to cloud-based datacentres. The company introduced Intel Go, automated driving technology based on Intel’s processor and field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips, which, it claimed, would offer an efficient balance of performance and power while meeting the automotive industry’s stringent thermal and safety requirements. Intel said the Go system would provide a scalable development and compute platform for critical functions in autonomous vehicles, supporting sensor data collection, driving policy, environment modelling, path planning and decision-making. The datacentre component of Go is based on Xeon and Xeon Phi server processors. It will be used to run the machine and deep learning training and simulation infrastructure required for the autonomous driving industry, said Intel. BMW Group will be responsible for the driving control and dynamics, evaluation of overall functional safety including setting up a high-performance simulation engine, overall component integration, production of prototypes and, eventually, scaling the platform via deployment partners.

The real value of autonomous vehicles could lie in industrial applications. We take a test drive around Milton Keynes to find out. Klaus Fröhlich, member of the board of management at BMW, said: “Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye. This partnership has all the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialise self-driving vehicles.” Fröhlich said that during 2017, BMW would be testing its fleet of autonomous vehicles in real traffic conditions in preparation to introduce the company’s first fully autonomous vehicle, the BMW iNext, in 2021. Mobileye said it would contribute its EyeQ®5 computer vision processor to the partnership. EyeQ®5, in combination with Intel CPU and FPGA technologies, forms the central computing platform to be integrated into each autonomous vehicle. EyeQ*5 is used to process and interpret input from 360-degree surround view vision sensors. Mobileye is also working with BMW to develop “sensor fusion”, which it said creates a full model of the environment surrounding the vehicle, using input from vision, radar and lidar sensors, which use lasers to measure distances. Audi also used CES to showcase its latest industry collaboration. The car company said it would be working with graphics processor company Nvidia to use the Nvida Drive PX platform in its autonomous car initiatives. The idea is to use a trained AI neural network running on Drive PX to understand the surrounding road environment, and determine a safe path to drive. Strategic partnership Also at CES, Renault unveiled a strategic technology partnership with OSVehicle, ARM, Pilot and Sensoria to develop an open source platform for autonomous vehicles. Based on the company’s Twizy electric vehicle, Renault has developed POM, a compact and lightweight electric vehicle with bodywork parts removed and an open source automotive platform. Available to startups, independent laboratories, private customers and researchers, the platform can be used by third parties to copy and modify existing software to create a totally customisable electric vehicle, the car company said. “Connected vehicles will enable new business models that deliver a broad range of choices and experiences for end-users,” said Richard York, vice-president of embedded marketing at ARM. “The automotive industry will increasingly focus on the specific functionality that owners want, such as comfort level and entertainment. By providing this platform, Renault is paving the way for innovation in these areas.” Tin Hang and Yuki Liu, founders of OSVehicle, said: “Sharing hardware platforms common to everyone is a new co-creative and horizontal approach that can disrupt this industry, significantly lowering costs and time to market.” SmartDeviceLink consortium Meanwhile, Ford and Toyota announced the SmartDeviceLink consortium, a non-profit organisation working to manage an open source software platform with the goal of giving consumers more choice in how they connect and control smartphone apps on the road. SmartDeviceLink aims to give consumers easy access to smartphone apps by using voice commands and in-vehicle displays. Adopting the open source platform gives auto makers and suppliers a uniform standard with which to integrate apps. Ford and Toyota said developers would benefit by being able to focus on creating the best experience for customers by integrating one linking system for use by all participating car makers. Shigeki Tomoyama, president of Toyota’s Connected Company, said: “Connectivity between smartphones and the vehicle interface is one of the most important connected services. Using SmartDeviceLink, we can provide this service to our customers in a safe and secure manner. We are excited to collaborate with many auto manufacturers and suppliers who share our view.” Ford AppLink software SmartDeviceLink technology is based on Ford’s contribution of its AppLink software to the open source community in 2013. Ford AppLink software is currently available on more than five million vehicles globally. It enables smartphone app developers to integrate their app functions with in-vehicle technology such as the vehicle display screen, steering wheel controls and voice recognition. With this new level of integration, drivers can enjoy their favourite apps on the road in an enhanced, user-friendly way. Doug VanDagens, global director at Ford Connected Vehicle and Services, and a board member of the consortium, said: “Consumers will win with new, innovative app experiences from increased collaboration and developer engagement.” Mazda, PSA, Fuji Heavy Industries and Suzuki are the first car maker members of the consortium. Elektrobit, Luxoft and Xevo join as the first supplier members, and Harman, Panasonic, Pioneer and QNX have signed letters of intent to join.

Share this article Share 23 shares Intel will offer its Intel Go computing platform that uses a variety of sensors and other data to power the brains of the car. Mobileye will be using its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor which gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localization.  Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing or autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. The BMW 7 Series (pictured) will be used as the platform for Intel processor and Mobileye computer vision technology during the trials  Last month, BMW revealed that it would test its driverless cars in Munich.  'There is a trained test driver behind the wheel of every car,' Klaus Buettner, BMW's Vice President in charge of Autonomous Driving said.  Uber's rapid growth has prompted BMW to consider how autonomous vehicles may help them accelerate their own push into pay-per-use transport. Software and technology companies like Lyft, Juno and Uber have shaken up the traditional auto industry business model of selling cars by offering customers an alternative to vehicle ownership through smartphone-based ride-hailing services.  Now traditional car companies are expanding their own ride-hailing schemes, while investing in self-driving technology. 'Ride hailing is nothing more than manual autonomous driving,' Tony Douglas, Head of Strategy for BMW's mobility services said.  'Once you dispense with the driver you have a license to print money.' BMW has already made significant progress expanding into the market for car sharing by introducing pay-by-the-minute services like ReachNow in Seattle, Douglas said. 'We had 14,000 people sign up in 4 days, in a market already served by Zipcar, Uber, Lyft and Car2go,' Douglas said. 'Someone else spent the money to educate the market and then we came in with a cool product. We will not be the largest, but we can be the coolest,' Douglas said.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 23 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

Credit: Blair Hanley Frank More like this Hands-on with Intel's Project Alloy untethered VR headset Intel eyes chips for mixed reality headsets Sony's PlayStation VR bests HTC Vive in headset shipments Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Intel is serious about bringing its Project Alloy untethered VR headset to the masses. On Wednesday, company CEO Brian Krzanich said at the company's CES press conference that it will be available in the fourth quarter of 2017. That will be roughly a year and a half after the company announced it at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. It’s still unknown how much a Project Alloy headset will cost, or even which company will make it. Krzanich said the headsets will be made available through Intel’s hardware partners, but didn’t provide details beyond that. Project Alloy is designed to provide a way for people to experience high-quality virtual reality without having to tether themselves to a computer. It also has front-facing cameras to analyze the environment that users are in and make that a part of the VR experience as well. VR enthusiasts have two options when it comes to headsets: either use a heavy-duty model like an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive tethered to a dedicated machine, or slot a smartphone into a mobile headset like Google’s Daydream View or Samsung Gear VR. Project Alloy is supposed to provide a middle ground. To make all of that work, Project Alloy packs an Intel processor, twin RealSense cameras, a battery, display, headphones and more into a single package that users can wear on their heads. Applications built to take advantage of Alloy can be set up in a mixed reality mode, to either overlay digital assets over a feed of a user’s surroundings, or replace those surroundings entirely with new digital imagery. An Intel demo showed two men playing a shooting game inside of a living room set, with their couch and armchair replaced in the game by other digital objects like a bunker. The HTC Vive and Oculus Rift each allow users to get up and move around while playing, but users are always at risk of tripping over cables, and must set up their rooms specifically to support the VR headsets. It’s not as though the rest of the VR landscape is sitting still, though. Oculus has also pledged to build a standalone Alloy-like unit.

Float64 Support For Intel ANV Vulkan Driver Revised Written by Michael Larabel in Vulkan on 5 January 2017 at 07:53 AM EST. Add A Comment Now that Igalia developers have landed their Haswell FP64 support and thereby hitting OpenGL 4.0 for these older generation Intel graphics processors, the latest Float64 patches have been sent out for the Intel Vulkan "ANV" driver. Samuel Iglesias Gonsálvez of Igalia submitted his third version of these patches for enabling Float64 support inside the Intel Vulkan driver. Float64 for Vulkan is similar to the FP64 extension for OpenGL: allowing double-precision floating-point data types. Back in December was an earlier version of Float64 for the Intel Vulkan driver. Even if you're not interested in doubles support for the Intel Vulkan driver, this support is a prereq for landing other code inside the Intel Mesa OpenGL driver that is needed to advance Haswell's GL level to OpenGL 4.1 and beyond. Samuel commented with today's patches, "Our plan is to land this patch series in master before sending ARB_vertex_attrib64 patches for HSW for review as they depend on some of the patches of this series." ARB_vertex_attrib64 is the current and only blocker for Haswell having OpenGL 4.1+ in their Mesa driver. This Float64 support for the Intel Vulkan driver though is for only Gen8 Broadwell hardware and newer. These latest patches can be found for testing on Mesa-dev.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | January 5, 2017 -- 06:26 GMT (22:26 PST) | Topic: Innovation Brian Krzanich, Intel chief executive officer, displays the Project Alloy all-in-one virtual reality headset at a company news conference on Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017, in Las Vegas. Walden Kirsch/Intel Corporation Intel is demonstrating at CES this week how virtual reality is ready to move beyond the realm of gaming, thanks to new capabilities like capturing and playing back live, high fidelity video. On January 4, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and his team outfitted hundreds of reporters with high-powered laptops, Oculus Rift VR headsets, and barf bags. Krzanich led his audience through both pre-recorded and live VR experiences that showed how VR could transform sports and entertainment experiences, as well as work. Using 360-degree, 4K video captured by a drone, the audience went through a live inspection of solar power panels. Krzanich gave examples of other work-related use cases for VR, such as search-and-rescue missions in the ocean or a forest. "It can save lives, it can save money and it can save time," he said. Turning to sports and entertainment, Krzanich demonstrated how Intel plans to use the VR capabilities it acquired with the startup Voke. The audience used their headsets to watch live video of an NCAA basketball game, giving the audience the same view they'd get from sitting in a seat at the game. Along with sporting events, the functionality could allow viewers to get any perspective they want of events like award shows or concerts. Intel will be bringing Voke VR to Oculus Rift later this year, making the company one of the first to enable live sporting events on multiple VR devices. "Viewers get to decide their point of view, viewers will get to decide what seat they have," Krzanich said. Intel is also partnering with the computer vision company HypeVR to bring volumetric video content to Project Alloy -- the reference design for an untethered VR headset that Intel unveiled last year. The chipmaker plans to "productize" Project Alloy headsets in the fourth quarter of this year, Krzanich said, with various hardware partners.

All VerticalseTransport Back to Home Intel, BMW self-driving cars to hit the roads in 2017 Increase / Decrease text size Hannah Williams 5th January 2017 0 0Shares 0 0 0 0 Add to favorites The companies will have a fleet of test BMW self-driving cars on roads in second half of 2017. BMW, Intel and Mobileye have announced that approximately 40 autonomous test vehicles will be released on roads by the second half of 2017. At CES 2017, the three companies revealed that the fleet of BMW 7 series cars will include advanced Intel and Mobileye technologies in global trials starting in the US and Europe. The partnership will see BMW take responsibility for all driving control and dynamics, evaluation of overall functional safety, overall component integration, production of prototypes and scaling the platform via deployment partners. Intel will provide the computing elements, from vehicle to data centre, while the company’s newly launched GO solution will also be integrated in the cars. Intel GO will provide a scalable development and compute platform for critical functions within the car, including sensor fusion, driving policy, environment modelling, path planning and decision. Intel will provide the AI, deep learning and simulation infrastructure required for autonomous cars with a broad range of technologies in the data centre. These include Intel’s Arria 10 FPGAs, Intel Solid State Drives and Nervana platform. Mobileye, meanwhile, will contribute its EyeQ5 computer vision processor. The processor identifies processes and interprets input from 360-degree surround view vision sensors and localisation. Mobileye will continually work with BMW to develop the sensor fusion solution, creating a full model of the environment surrounding the vehicle, using input from vision, radar and lidar sensors. Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel with Harald Krueger, CEO of BMW and Amnon Shashua, co-founder, chairman and CTO Mobileye NV All offerings from the included companies scale from individual integrated modules to a complete end-to-end solution providing a range of consumer experiences. Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development said: “This year our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle.” BMW’s iNEXT model will become the foundation for the company’s autonomous driving strategy, which will follow through with a range of automated models.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady AT&T announces global 5G modem, cites “5G Evolution” plans Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, January 5th, 2017, 05:54 Category: Hardware, iPhone, News, wireless AT&T is looking towards the world’s first global 5G modem. The company announced plans to test the world’s first global 5G modem to help test initial 5G spectrum deployments across the world. AT&T also announced their “5G Evolution” plans for 2017. The global 5G modem announced by Intel today reportedly achieves speeds “exceeding 5 Gbps” while maintaining ultra-low latency connections. Intel’s 5G modem is already compliant to multiple industry 5G specifications, along with being able to provide fallback to a 4G connection when needed. It can even interwork 4G/5G connections. Intel says they should begin testing the 5G modem in the second half of 2017, before going into production. AT&T stated that it’s aiming for a 1 Gbps speeds in 2017 at some cell sites using their 4G LTE-Advanced network, 5G video trials with DIRECTV NOW in the first half of 2017 to residents in Austin, 5G business customer trials that launched last fall in Austin, and additional 5G trials in a team up with Qualcomm Technologies and Ericsson in the second half of 2017. It’s been noted that there are distinct differences between the speeds offered by both Qualcomm’s and Intel’s modems where the iPhone 7 is concerned. Many users have stated that the Qualcomm chips on its modem allows for Ultra HD Voice, a feature which only wireless carrier T-Mobile currently supports. As 5G testing begins, it’s unknown as to which supplier or supplier Apple will side with where its next-gen iPhone is concerned. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Credit: Nvidia More like this Nvidia teases Volta GPU in next-gen Xavier self-driving car computer Intel's Go supercomputer for cars points to a PC-like horsepower race Nvidia's updated Drive PX 2 computer will drive autonomous cars Video Mingis on Tech: New year, new CES -- and new AirPods The race between two key chip makers to put self-driving cars on the streets is getting heated. And it's no less entertaining, involving the likes of BB8, a self-driving Nvidia car named after a droid in Star Wars, and the company's automotive supercomputer called Xavier, named after an X-men superhero. These two playfully named products are a big part of Nvidia's ambitious plans to put a fleet of self-driving cars on the streets by 2020. Nvidia is collaborating with Audi to develop these autonomous cars, which will be based on the Drive-PX computer. Nvidia's announcement comes just a day after Intel and BMW said they were putting 40 self-driving cars on the street by the end of this year. Those are test vehicles, but a big change from Intel's earlier plans to put the first self-driving cars on the street by 2021. But Nvidia already has the BB8 self-driving car test driving the streets of northern California. It also has been shown on the CES show floor. The BB8 autonomous car was taped cruising to a Starbucks, and the ride was shown in a video during Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang's keynote at CES. The car was riding the side streets, highways, making exits and recognizing signs and signals. The car automatically steered as a nervous looking man sat at the wheel. BB8 is an early prototype of what Nvidia calls an A.I. car, a glorified name for an autonomous vehicle. Cars are being equipped with powerful computers to make smart driving decisions and avoid accidents. Like with BB8, computers are helping cars recognize signals, objects, pedestrians, signs, terrain and other things in the line of sight. Intel and Nvidia are also competing in the race to plug more horsepower into cars. Intel on Tuesday at CES announced the Go computers for cars with up to 28 Xeon cores and 5G connectivity into vehicles, while Nvidia for the first time showed off its next-generation Xavier computer, which has eight ARM CPU cores and a 512-core GPU based on the next-generation Volta graphics architecture. It will succeed the Drive PX-2, which was introduced at last year's CES. Nvidia has also touted its technology called "A.I. co-pilot", which is a slightly intrusive but interesting technology to make driving safe for drivers and passengers. Instead of tracking the outside, the A.I. copilot would monitor the conditions inside a car. Here's how A.I. copilot works: Nvidia envisions the internals of the cars being equipped with speakers, cameras, microphones, lidar, radar and other sensors. The A.I. copilot could analyze data collected from all those sources to check the state of the driver. For example, the A.I. copilot may conclude a driver is sleepy based on sounds from the person and images of droopy eyes, which means it's time to stop driving. Huang said that the A.I. copilot is "looking out for you." It's still prototype technology. Intel and Nvidia are also aggressively chasing 3D mapping, which is important for self-driving cars to navigate. Mapping is considered especially important for self-driving taxis, like the ones being pursued by Uber, which need to establish routes between points. Nvidia said it was collaborating on 3D mapping with a company called Here, in which Intel acquired a 15 percent stake on Tuesday. Here's shareholders also include Audi, BMW and Daimler. Nvidia has also been working closely with Baidu, which is involved in mapping in China.

Intel expects to launch Project Alloy-based virtual reality headsets by year's end, allowing enthusiasts to move around a room without being tethered to a PC. The chip maker first showed off Project Alloy last summer at its developer conference, and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said during a Wednesday CES press event that it's "progressing very well." So well, in fact, that Intel expects to release Alloy headsets by the fourth quarter via its "top OEM partners." During the press conference, Intel equipped attendees with Oculus Rift headsets so they could check out VR scenarios powered by Intel technology. But at the moment, Oculus Rift must be tethered to a PC, which is not an ideal situation for VR games that require a lot of movement. Oculus parent company Facebook is working on that, but it was still early days for the social network as of October. At CES, two people wearing un-tethered Project Alloy headsets took to the stage to play a game in a mock living room. When the game was activated, the room turned into a space bunker, and the players were now firing weapons at invaders. As Krzanich noted, the setup was unique because both men could see and battle each other in the same scene. Typically, VR is a solo endeavor. There were no sensors in the fake living room, Intel said; players just had the headset and controllers, and Intel promised "seamless tracking" built into the device. "Everything is in the headset itself; you simply put this on, turn it on, and you're ready to go," Krzanich said. Those headsets include two RealSense cameras, integrated computing, vision accelerators, and batteries in a weight-balanced device. Pricing was not discussed, nor were any other details about which partners might participate. But Krzanich stressed that Project Alloy is an open platform available to anyone who wants to help bring VR to life. Check Out the Best Photos From CES 2017!

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming MWC 2017 GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: CES 2017 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Fitness News / New Balance teams up with Google, Intel and Strava for RunIQ fitness wearable New Balance teams up with Google, Intel and Strava for RunIQ fitness wearable by Richard Easton 05 January 2017 0 shares Read Comments At CES 2017, New Balance has announced its partnered with Google, Intel and Strava to create its first ever fitness wearable. New Balance is probably better known for its sports apparel but like Under Armour, the company is now making moves in the technology space. The company isn’t going it alone, though. It’s partnered with Google, Intel and Strava to create its first ever “made to run” smartwatch named RunIQ. The RunIQ will run Android Wear, although it’s not clear if it will launch with Android Wear 2.0 as is the case with Casio’s WSD-F20 that was also announced at CES. There's 512MB of RAM and 4GB of storage inside, and the RunIQ uses Intel's Atom Z34XX processor. You’ll also find all the usual sensors, including GPS and a heart rate monitor. New Balance is also promising “marathon distance battery life” while tracking a run. Standard use will only get you up to 24 hours of battery life, however, which is a little middling in this day and age. Other run-friendly features include a dedicated lap button and interval capabilities. On the launch, Rob DeMartini, President and CEO of New Balance said, “New Balance has a 110-year heritage of product development and innovation in the running category, and RunIQ represents our commitment to helping athletes achieve unparalleled fitness experiences” “A smartwatch for runners made by runners, RunIQ combines our expertise in running with the best engineering advances through breakthrough collaborations with some of the biggest players in the technological industry.” Related: Best running watches New Balance has said the collaboration with Strava will allow you to seamlessly upload and share workouts on the platform. In fairness, most running watches integrate with platforms such as Strava already. However, the partnership supposedly does stretch a little further, with New Balance creating something called the New Balance Global Run Club. It’s describing this as a digital and physical community powered by Strava. NB Run Club members will be able to use the platform to connect with other users and participate in group and individual virtual training programs. There will also be physical NB Run Club activities at New Balance stores, which sounds a lot like what Nike does with its own Nike Run Club activities. Related: Best Fitness Trackers The RunIQ is releasing on February 1st for $299.99 although UK pricing and availability isn’t currently known. New Balance is also releasing PaceIQ wireless headphones developed by Jabra. Considering how much we loved the Jabra Sport Pulse and more recently the Jabra Elite Sport, these could also be worth keeping an eye out for. These also come out on February 1st for $109.99.

Finance Search BMW to deploy 40 self-driving cars in US, EuropeAFP – Thu, Jan 5, 2017 11:29 AM AEDT Related Content View Photo BMW made the announcement of deploying 40 self-driving vehicles at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas jointly with US computer chip giant Intel and the Israeli-based auto technology firm Mobileye BMW Group says it will deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe. The German auto group made the announcement jointly with US computer chip giant Intel and the Israeli-based auto technology firm Mobileye at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Wednesday. "Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye," said BMW board member Klaus Froehlich in a statement, who said the tests would be a major step toward achieving a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021. "This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles. Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies -- manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies ? to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform." The companies said they plan to begin testing by the end of this year, joining autonomous vehicles from Google's Waymo, Uber and others being used in real-traffic situations. BMW Group will be responsible for driving control, safety and the production of the car platform. Intel will offer its Intel Go computing platform that uses a variety of sensors and other data to power the brains of the car. Mobileye will be using its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor which gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localization. "From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform," Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said. "That's why this partnership is breaking new ground. We have established a dedicated team with clear, shared goals and a culture of innovation and agility and accountability." Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing or autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years.

By Corinne Reichert | January 5, 2017 -- 00:24 GMT (16:24 PST) | Topic: Networking Chip giant Intel has announced its 5G modem at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2017 in Las Vegas, calling it a "milestone for the industry" as it will allow companies to develop and launch 5G solutions earlier than previously anticipated. According to Intel, the modem is the first to enable 5G trials anywhere in the world because its single chip supports both millimetre-wave (mmWave) and sub-6GHz spectrum bands, incorporating Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), beam-forming technology, and advanced channel coding. CES 2017 The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display Panasonic unveils 'human-like' companion robot Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' Voice is the next computer interface Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1 HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro Amazon revs Alexa everywhere strategy Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts See also: CNET's full coverage MIMO sends multiple channels of data at the same time, allowing users to have peak performances simultaneously, while beam-forming technology uses antenna arrays to steer a beam to where a user is. Intel's 5G modem should support speeds of over 5Gbps and ultra low latency, with Intel expecting it to be used initially in the home broadband, mobile, and automotive industries. The modem also integrates with Intel's 28GHz 5G Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit (RFIC), as well as its 4G XMM 7360 LTE modem for 4G/5G interworking. Intel also used its CES announcement to launch its 5G-ready GO platform, which is intended to help autonomous vehicles connect using cloud computing, with two GO development kits for its Atom and Xeon processors also announced. As part of the GO platform launch, Intel has partnered with BMW and Mobileye, and said it will have 40 autonomous cars on the roads by mid year. Intel also recently acquired 15 percent of digital mapping company HERE as part of its push into autonomous vehicles. Intel laid out its 5G roadmap during Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2016, saying it would be working with Nokia, Ericsson, LG, Verizon, and others on 5G network development, testing, and deployment. "5G represents a significant shift for these networks, and we think it's essential to get ready ahead of the curve," Aicha Evans, corporate vice president and general manager of the Intel communication and services group, said at the time. "We need to make sure we partner with everybody in the ecosystem, all of the trendsetters and the leaders, so there's an ecosystem we can roam and have a single worldwide view." Intel also used MWC to announce its Atom x3-M7272 wireless communication platform for "automotive applications capable of powering advance security features", as well as the Intel XMM 7120M LTE modem, which is aimed at Internet of Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) use cases. In December, Intel said it would be partnering with US telecommunications provider AT&T and Ericsson on a public 5G trial in Austin, Texas, in an effort to attain speeds of 14Gbps for 4K video using mmWave technology across the 15GHz and 28GHz spectrum bands. "This trial is a significant step forward. We're leaving the lab and heading into the field with a real-world business customer," Rick Hubbard, senior VP of networking product management at AT&T, said in December. "We expect mmWave technology to be an important part of 5G. The trial will help accelerate our 5G work by shedding new light on how the technology acts in a business environment." AT&T on Tuesday further announced that it will use the first half of this year to test its 5G network with DirecTV Now customers in Austin. The launch of Intel's 5G modem follows Qualcomm revealing the world's first commercial 5G modem chipset solution in October last year. Announced at the 4G/5G Summit in Hong Kong, the Qualcomm Snapdragon X50 5G modem, designed to enable field trials and early deployments of 5G networks globally with download speeds of around 5Gbps, supports operation in the mmWave spectrum in the 28GHz band, with 800MHz bandwidth support, and employs MIMO with adaptive beam-forming and beam-tracking technology. The solution includes the modem, SDR051 mmWave transceivers, and PMX50 power management chip. The modem can be used for 4G and 5G mobile broadband, along with fixed-wireless broadband devices, when paired with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and its gigabit-speed 4G modem. "The Snapdragon X50 5G modem heralds the arrival of 5G as operators and OEMs reach the cellular network and device testing phase," Cristiano Amon, executive vice president of Qualcomm Technologies, said at the time. "Utilising our long history of LTE and Wi-Fi leadership, we are thrilled to deliver a product that will help play a critical role in bringing 5G devices and networks to reality. This shows that we're not just talking about 5G, we're truly committed to it." Sampling for Qualcomm's Snapdragon X50 5G modem is slated to take place in the second half of 2017, with the first commercial products integrated with the modem expected in the first half of 2018.

Shares CPU School Want to know more about what makes your CPU tick? Our Processor Architecture 101 primer digs into many of the core concepts. For the past decade, Intel has been creating new CPUs based on their 'tick-tock' model, where each tick represents a new process technology (starting with 65nm back in 2006) and each tock involves a new architecture built on an existing process. With the Kaby Lake CPUs, Intel is officially moving away from tick-tock and embracing a new philosophy: process-architecture-optimization. The first two correspond to tick-tock, but that third 'optimization' stage is what's new, and Kaby Lake will be our first look at how this plays out. Here, 'optimization' means Intel is tweaking the architecture and refining the process technology. If you were hoping for big changes from Skylake, you're going to be disappointed. A huge chunk of the CPU die remains devoted to graphics duties, as well as the enhanced video decoder/encoder block. On the architecture front, the major update is an enhanced video decoder/encoder block that will handle 4K HEVC decoding/encoding. The new block is a fixed function implementation that supports the Main10 profile, which is becoming increasingly important for things like 4K VP9 YouTube videos. Using a fixed function design sacrifices flexibility for improved speed and efficiency, and Intel claims laptops with Kaby Lake processors will be able to provide up to 9.5 hours of 4K video playback—rather impressive, really. Intel also notes that encoding a one hour video into 4K HEVC can be done in twelve minutes. What if you're a gamer running a discrete GPU instead of using Intel's HD 630 Graphics on the processor? The new video decoder block is basically ignored and unused, making this a far less interesting feature for desktop users. There is a second architectural update, with Kaby Lake featuring some improvements to the Speed Shift technology introduced with Skylake. This allows the CPU to more quickly enter and exit higher clock speed states. It's the old 'hurry up and go slow' mentality, letting the CPU complete a task as quickly as possible so that it can then return to a low power idle state. Again, this is more interesting to mobile designs where the power difference between idle and load states is far more important. Everywhere else, the Kaby Lake architecture appears to remain unchanged from Skylake. It's a 6-wide superscalar architecture with the same number of pipeline stages. Internally, there are eight execution ports available. Unfortunately, Intel still hasn't disclosed any further details on pipeline length, but indications are it's somewhere in the 20-25 stage range. Intel's Kaby Lake uses a new 14nm+ process technology to improve clock speeds. Outside of these architectural changes, Kaby Lake appears to be largely the same as Skylake, with one qualification: Intel is tweaking the 14nm process, with a refined fin profile (the FinFET part of the process) they're calling 14nm+. Intel says 14nm+ will actually be less transistor dense than 14nm, with a larger fin pitch and reduced channel strain. The net result is that at roughly the same power requirements, Intel should be able to tack on a few extra hundred MHz in clock speed. If you're reading between the lines, many of the above changes are for laptops and similar devices, while desktop users are a secondary concern. In fact, I could argue that the last time we saw a true desktop-first architecture from Intel goes back at least to Nehalem/Bloomfield (CPUs like the i7-920 launched November 2008), and even that architecture was really a server design tweaked for desktop 'enthusiasts.' But Core 2 (early 2006) was a desktop-first design at least, and even the desktop parts derived from mobile and server designs can still be interesting. Kaby Lake desktop CPUs Today marks the official launch date of the desktop S-series 7th Generation Core processors—there are also notebook processors that aren't quite as exciting for us PC gamers. The big story today is new desktop processors, new chipsets, and some additional features. Here's the initial list of the S-series desktop processors: All told, there are 16 new desktop processors, though many won't be particularly interesting for our purposes—like the T-series chips that are more likely to be found in all-in-one systems, so that removes six of the CPUs from our radar. What remains is the usual collection of i7/i5/i3 parts—two i7, four i5, and four i3—and in a small break from tradition, Intel will have K-series (unlocked CPU multipliers for overclockers) for all three lines. The Core i7-7700K sits at the top of that stack, with a base clock of 4.2GHz, 200MHz higher than the Sylake i7-6700K, and the maximum turbo clock is 4.5GHz (300MHz higher than 6700K). That's officially the highest stock clock Intel has ever released, beating the i7-4790K by 100MHz. The i5-7600K is clocked a bit lower, 3.8GHz base and 4.2GHz turbo—and this is the first Core i5 part to ship with stock clocks that can break 4.0GHz. Finally, the Core i3-7350K is an interesting beast. Core i3 parts don't include Turbo Boost so they only have a single base clock speed, and in this case the 7350K tips the scales at an impressive 4.2GHz. For single-threaded performance, it will be pretty close to the 7600K and 7700K, though with less L3 cache. One thing worth mentioning is that Intel has no plans at present to release any desktop SKUs with Iris Pro or Iris Plus graphics—meaning, there will be no L4 cache/EDRAM desktop models. (We may see a future T-series part for AIO, though.) That's not too big an omission, considering many desktop users will have a separate graphics card, though I've always found it interesting that Broadwell (i7-5775C) with a decent overclock to 4.2GHz actually comes out ahead of most other CPUs when it comes to raw gaming performance. There's obviously a higher cost with the EDRAM module, but since it functions as both a high-speed cache for graphics and CPU workloads, it's actually somewhat useful—it would be much more useful than the more than one-third of the CPU die that's currently devoted to graphics many users will ignore, for example. But that's a topic for another day. With Intel increasing clock speeds by 300-400MHz on most models, my hope prior to the launch was that Kaby Lake unlocked processors would routinely hit 5GHz with overclocking. Not to jump the gun here, but that's pretty close to where my three samples landed. There's a potentially interesting debate between grabbing an i3-7350K with four threads and two cores compared to the i5-7600K with four threads and four cores (Core i5 parts omit Hyper-Threading while Core i3 includes it), which is something I'll be looking at in more detailed testing. Meet the 200-series chipsets Along with the desktop CPUs come new chipsets, the Z270, H270, B250, Q270, and Q250. The good news is that early rumors of Kaby Lake requiring the new chipsets proved incorrect, so potentially you could upgrade from Skylake to Kaby Lake with a simple BIOS update on the motherboard. That means the main draw of the 200-series chipsets will be new features, which consist of two updates. (I'll focus mostly on the Z270 compared to Z170, but the other models show similar updates.) First, Z270 now supports up to 24 PCIe Gen3 lanes, compared to 20 lanes on Z170. That in turn enables relatively easy support for up to three M.2 x4 slots, and many boards will include at least two slots this round. Second, and we really have very few details, all of the new chipsets are also "Intel Optane Memory ready." What exactly does that mean? Last year, Optane was supposed to be a new brand of SSD storage using Intel's 3D XPoint Technology, but those drives never came out. Now Intel is talking about Optane Memory as a chipset and CPU feature, which appears to be a new take on Intel's Smart Response Technology. SRT allowed the use of a small (8GB-64GB) SSD along with conventional HDD storage to provide a sort of hybrid storage architecture. Frankly, SRT never worked all that well in my experience, as the drive size was almost always too small (<32GB). It was better than a pure HDD solution, but pure SSD was better. Now that SSDs are going for around $0.25 per GB, the idea of a smallish SSD cache makes even less sense to me. On the other hand, if Optane Memory ends up hitting the peak ~4GB/s bandwidth of an x4 slot and doesn't cost too much, it might prove interesting. Intel hasn't said much more about Optane at this point, other than we should expect to see M.2 Optane Memory products later this year. Note also that there will still be Optane SSD products as well, which will likely come in larger capacities and function as normal storage rather than a storage cache. The requirements for now are a 200-series chipset and a Kaby Lake processor—Skylake CPUs apparently won't support Optane Memory. Kaby Lake Testbed MSI Z270 Gaming M7 Core i7-7700K Core i5-7600K Core i3-7350K Corsair Hydro H115i Corsair Dominator Platinum 2x8GB DDR4 GeForce GTX 1080 FE Samsung 960 Pro 512GB Samsung 850 Pro 2TB Corsair Carbide Air 740 Corsair RM650X  Kaby Lake performance overview It's an ill-kept 'secret' that the CPU is rarely the most important consideration when you're putting together a new gaming PC. The most critical factor is almost always your graphics card, followed by the CPU, then RAM, storage, and motherboard. But just because a CPU doesn't usually make a huge difference in games doesn't mean it can't have an impact in other tasks. I've run through a collection of CPU intensive workloads, and you can see how the three new K-series Kaby Lake processors stack up against a variety of other CPUs. The full specifications of the new Z270 testbed are in the boxout to the right, and it's an awesome build complete with just about everything you could want from a high-end gaming rig. The motherboard is the heart of any build, and MSI's new line of Z270 boards provides a variety of options. The Z270 Gaming M7 sits near the top of the stack, with RGB lighting, auto-overclocking support for up to 5.2GHz (that didn't work, it must be said—5.0GHz proved to be the stable limit), and three M.2 slots. It's the proverbial kitchen sink approach, with plenty of room for future expansion. Joining the Kaby Lake CPUs being tested is Nvidia's GTX 1080 Founders Edition—it's my baseline for graphics performance, though non-FE cards are usually a bit faster. Storage comes via Samsung's 960 Pro 512GB for the OS and primary applications, while my gaming benchmarks are all run off a 2TB 850 Pro. I used Corsair Dominator Platinum memory, with their RM650X power supply keeping everything humming along efficiently and quietly. Corsair's huge Air 740 case definitely takes up a large amount of real estate, but for a testbed where I'm swapping CPUs on a regular basis, not to mention GPUs and other parts, having a roomy and clean interior to work in can be a godsend. I love the division of the case interior into power/cables/storage on the one half (hidden from view) with the motherboard and lighting on the right, the result being a wonderfully open working space with ample room for cooling. And I needed the space, as I also used Corsair's large 280mm H115i CPU cooler to ensure good temperatures and overclocking results. Having tested plenty of CPUs in the past, I've learned that closed loop cooling makes swapping CPUs far easier than dealing with a large air cooler, though the Arctic Silver thermal paste still ends up being a bit messy. With the parts out of the way, let's see how this bad boy performs. Click through the slides below to see a range of CPU tests, including HWBOT and Cinebench. Image 1 of 11 Image 2 of 11 Image 3 of 11 Image 4 of 11 Image 5 of 11 Image 6 of 11 Image 7 of 11 Image 8 of 11 Image 9 of 11 Image 10 of 11 Image 11 of 11 I like the overall average performance as a quick look at what to expect from a CPU, as the results incorporate a reasonable collection of CPU tests, including one single-threaded test. All scores are equally weighted (using the geometric mean rather than a straight average). Since the tests skew heavily toward benchmarks that leverage multi-threading, it's not too surprising to see the i7-5960X nab the top spot, followed by the other Haswell-E and Broadwell-E chips. Thanks to higher clock speeds, the i7-7700K does beat out the i7-7600K by 6.8 percent, which is right where we'd expect—the base clock is five percent higher, and the max turbo clock is 7.1 percent higher. Looking at the individual results, all of the margins are similar: Kaby Lake i7-7700K is around 5-8 percent faster, with a margin of error of about one percent. Overall power use is a bit harder to judge, since I used different motherboards, but there's nothing really noteworthy. The i7-7700K idle power is within margin of error (2W) while the load power is slightly higher (8W while gaming), but nothing I'd consider unacceptable. There's also one 'gaming' benchmark here, the Civilization VI AI Benchmark, which has the AI play through five turns as fast as possible—it's one of the few instances where a game clearly benefits from multiple cores and higher clock speeds, though it doesn't scale much beyond four cores. I only have a limited set of results, but you can see that at the top, the i5-7600K actually slightly outperforms the i7-7700K, so Hyper-Threading in this particular test appears to be hindering rather than helping performance. One other note regarding Z170 motherboards: I tested the Kaby Lake processors in both my old Skylake testbed (Asus Z170-A) as well as in a new Z270 motherboard. I used MSI's Z270 Gaming M7 motherboard for the latter, and found that in most benchmarks the Z270 platform slightly outperformed the older Z170 platform. Most likely the Z170-A firmware isn't quite fully tuned for Kaby Lake compared to the Z270 Gaming M7—I noticed for example that overclocking on the Z170 board was quite problematic. On the other hand, the Skylake processors I tested generally performed best in the old Z170 motherboard, so make of that what you will. If you have a Z170 board and are considering a Kaby Lake upgrade, be sure to check for new BIOS/firmware as that can make a big difference. Kaby Lake for gaming I grabbed a large collection of games, including many DX12/Vulkan titles, to see if I could suss out any differences between the CPUs when it comes to gaming. There aren't many games that fully tax high-end CPUs, though a few (like Ashes of the Singularity) do. Unfortunately, most of the games I used in my last set of CPU tests (for Broadwell-E) have been updated multiple times, and Nvidia's drivers have gone through numerous revisions as well, so I'm in the process of testing the new suite of games on my collection of CPUs. Here are the results for the three Kaby Lake processors, compared with three Skylake systems. Image 1 of 15 Image 2 of 15 Image 3 of 15 Image 4 of 15 Image 5 of 15 Image 6 of 15 Image 7 of 15 Image 8 of 15 Image 9 of 15 Image 10 of 15 Image 11 of 15 Image 12 of 15 Image 13 of 15 Image 14 of 15 Image 15 of 15 For gaming purposes, Kaby Lake doesn't add much to the current state of the art. The i7-7700K is 0-2 percent faster than the i7-6700K, meaning no one would notice the difference. i5-7600K vs. i5-6600K is a bit better, showing a 0-4 percent improvement, but the overall average gain is still only one percent. Margin of error is one percent as well, so this really is a tie for gaming performance. I had hoped to find at least a few examples of games that would benefit more from a faster CPU, but even with fourteen modern titles (over half of which support DX12 or Vulkan), I'm not really coming up with anything. The advice of spending more money on your GPU and not worrying so much about the CPU continues to apply. The i3-7350K is more interesting, and this is the first time since I started with PC Gamer that I've had a chance to fully benchmark a Core i3 part. There's not nearly as large a performance gap between the i7 and the i3 as there used to be, thanks in a large part to the high clocks of the 7350K. In some games the i7-7700K is nearly 50 percent faster than the i3, but in other games performance is essentially tied with the i37-7350K. On average, the i7 beats the i3 part (at stock for both) by 16 percent. That doesn't seem too bad, but that result is heavily influenced by several games where there's a larger gap. Hitman and Ashes of the Singularity both show more than a 40 percent gain in performance, and Warhammer and Civilization VI are almost 30 percent faster. Shadow Warrior 2, GTAV, and Fallout 4 round out the list of large improvements with almost 20 percent higher performance, but at the other end of the spectrum The Division, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and The Witcher 3 show almost no benefit. Keep in mind that all of the performance tests are taken from single player, however. I know in testing Battlefield 1 that multi-player can put a larger strain on the CPU. Note that all of these tests were conducted using the fastest current consumer graphics card, the GTX 1080. If I were to switch that out for a mainstream GPU like the RX 480 or GTX 1060, everything becomes more tightly packed. Similarly, running all of the games at a higher resolution like 1440p or 4K would also move the bottleneck more to the GPU than CPU. There are other aspects of gaming that do show larger differences between the processors, like game and level load times being markedly longer on the i3-7350K, so ultimately I end up eyeing the Core i5 parts as the best overall choice for a gaming CPU. Business as usual, in other words—but it's interesting in some games that a Core i3 is now essentially indistinguishable from an i7. Kaby Lake overclocking Because Kaby Lake's focus on optimization means no major architectural changes, the higher clock speeds are really the star of the show, here. As you saw in the last section, real world performance compared to Skylake is essentially identical. Can overclocking change that? This is probably the biggest question around Kaby Lake for enthusiasts, so I'm dedicating a whole article to Kaby Lake's overclocking performance, with Core i3-7350K to i5-7600K to i7-7700K. Individual CPUs reviews and wrapping up Kaby Lake and the 200-series chipsets (Z270 in particular) are the logical progression from Skylake. Intel's 14nm+ process does appear to have improved clock speed range slightly, but that's the only real difference for desktop users, and even 10 percent higher performance in some cases isn't really enough to warrant an upgrade from the last generation or two. The biggest updates all hinge around whether or not you're interested in using the HD 630 Graphics, and if you're interested in gaming, the answer will be no, you're not. I'll be looking at HD 630 in more detail in a separate piece as well, including the video encoding/decoding aspect, but if you're using a discrete GPU you're basically stuck (unless you add a separate display hooked up to the integrated GPU ports). Much like Skylake before it, Kaby Lake is impressive and yet not. If Skylake wasn't enticing enough to warrant an upgrade from your current system, there's nothing in Kaby Lake likely to change your mind. Intel's 7th Gen CPUs are slightly faster than their 6th Gen counterparts, and prices haven't shifted, so if you're in the market for a new CPU anyway, Kaby Lake is the logical (Intel) choice. Or you can wait a couple more months to see what AMD's Ryzen brings to play, which is what I'd recommend doing. Look for full reviews and scores of the i3-7350K, i5-7600K, and i7-7700K soon, diving a bit deeper into the performance of each chip for gaming and general use.

Home Industry Technology Forget 4G, Intel & Qualcomm bring 5G connections to your smartphone, with 400 times the speed Forget 4G, Intel & Qualcomm bring 5G connections to your smartphone, with 400 times the speed New innovations are ensuring that users now move over slow internet speeds with 2G, 3G or even 4G connections. Global tech giant Intel has now announced that it will launch a 5G modem. By: FE Online | Updated: January 6, 2017 6:02 PM Intel’s new 5G modem will be known as ‘Goldridge’. Theoretically, this new modem will enable multi-gigabits of data transfer per second, on your smartphones. (Source: Intel) In the fast-evolving world of technology, how can internet speeds be slow? New innovations are ensuring that users now move over slow internet speeds with 2G, 3G or even 4G connections. Global tech giant Intel has now announced that it will launch a 5G modem. The new modem will be known as ‘Goldridge’. Theoretically, this new modem will enable multi-gigabits of data transfer per second, on your smartphones. The speeds will be so high that the company says, it can be used in other AI areas like self-driven cars and drones. Aicha Evans, corporate VP & GM, Intel’s Communication and Devices Group wrote in a blog, “As the leader of Intel’s Communication and Devices Group, I find 5G exciting not because of what we know about it, but rather what we don’t know about it.” According to Evans, 5G will enable ‘billions of things’ and become very smart. According to Forbes, the 5G modems will start sampling in 2017 and go into production in 2018. But Intel is not the first to announce the technology. Last year, in October, Qualcomm Technologies, a subsidiary of San Diego-based company Qualcomm Inc., had announced its plans to deliver the first Snapdragon X50 5G modem  by 2018. It was the first company to bring out a commercial modem for 5G network connections. The primary issue lies in the fact that one year appears to be too soon to launch such high-speed connectivity, as it is not easy. The 5G infrastructure, to get off the ground, will be a big problem for network providers. In the 28 GHz band, the 5G modem by Qualcomm will reportedly have to run on the millimetre wave spectrum, which right now does not transmit distances beyond a room. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X50 will be supported in the futuristic smartphones which will be built by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). A study by OpenSignal says that the global average download speed of 4G connections is 13.5 Mbps. Hence, if the 5G connection, with 800 MHz bandwidth support, can get the download speeds to 5 Gbps, it will be almost 400 times the current speed. Meanwhile, Evans in the blog wrote: “However, today’s communications systems weren’t designed to accommodate the massive bandwidth required to support such an evolution, or the ultra-low latency needed to allow devices or even vehicles to react to split-second events. This is why Intel’s 5G modem stands out: The modem’s baseband pairs with a new 5G transceiver that enable both sub-6 GHz and mmWave capabilities.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

It combines Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) into a cohesive experience, like Microsoft’s ‘mixed reality’ concept with its HoloLens. This headset does not require to be plugged into a computer (like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive) or put a phone inside (like Google DayDream or Samsung Gear VR). Instead, it has all the components required to deliver a VR experience and a camera pointing outwards for AR too. After roughly five months, at CES 2017, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has announced that Project Alloy will hit production by the end of 2017. As suggested by Engadget, Intel itself will not be making the headset, but will rely on “top OEM partners” to build the wearable. It was also stated that Project Alloy will be open source, so potentially any hardware maker could create it. The report errs on the side of caution with respect to if Project Alloy will truly take off, citing potential conflicts of interest from competing hardware makers. Either way, Microsoft had extended its support back in August - Project Alloy was said to support software giant’s Windows Holographic Platform. Windows 10 in 2017 was reportedly going to have support for this platform, so that the desktop operating system could be used with head-mounted displays like Intel’s Project Alloy ones and Microsoft’s own HoloLens.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas January 5, 2017 08:54 GMT Close CES: Voice control and AI to become major trends in household electronics Reuters Intel showed off some of the unique capabilities of its wireless "merged reality" Project Alloy virtual reality headset on Wednesday (4 January) at the ongoing CES tech show in Las Vegas. The chipmaking giant's CEO Brian Krzanich said the technology of the VR headset, which is currently in development, will be licensed to manufacturers by Q4 2017. Outfitting hundreds of reporters and analysts with high-powered laptops, Oculus Rift headsets and a paper barf bag, Krzanich guided the audience through a series of pre-recorded and live VR experiences including helicopter views of a solar power plant, the Nevada desert and a zombie apocalypse in the new Arizona Sunshine VR game. Intel also showed off the VR capabilities it obtained with the startup Voke it acquired in November that allows users to virtually watch a sports game by giving the audience a glimpse from courtside seats at a Villanova versus Butler NCAA basketball game. "There will be a host of content coming throughout the year," Krzanich said, including concerts and soccer games. "We truly believe this will revolutionise the experience for fans. You'll have the opportunity to go to games you never could before. "Viewers get to decide their point of view; viewers will get to decide what seat they have." Project Alloy was first unveiled at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco in August last year as an untethered, immersive experience that will be offered as an open hardware platform. The technology includes Intel 7th Generation processor, RealSense 3D depth cameras, a vision processor, a fisheye lens and sensors that allow users to experience VR whilst still being able to see and experience the real world as well. Catch all the latest CES 2017 news with IBTimes UK Krzanich said people will be able to use "merged reality" technologies for a wide range of uses besides gaming and entertainment, including transforming the experience of travel, productivity, work-related uses such as search-and-rescue missions as well as sports which can "save time, money and lives". Audience members use virtual reality headsets to experience a series of travel, work and play situations at Intel's CES 2017 conference on 4 January in Las VegasWalden Kirsch/Intel Corporation "The pace of technology improvement is accelerating faster than ever," Krzanich said at the conference. "Moore's Law is at the centre of this acceleration. Technology is extending far beyond consumer electronics, defining almost every aspect of our lives, and transforming industries." Intel also announced that it will partner with computer vision company HypeVR to bring volumetric video content to Project Alloy in 2017. "I believe virtual reality will be about far more than playing games," he continued. "I believe it will radically enrich people's enjoyment of sports and entertainment by transporting them into the middle of the action. "Yes, there's been some hype, as there often is with new technologies. But I truly believe virtual and merged realities are going to exceed our expectations. They are a new frontier for human experiences — and I think this will not just be a technology tweak, but instead a leap."

The maxim, which became known as Moore’s law, directed technology companies for five decades before reaching a crunch point last year. Physicists and technology giants alike said transistors had reached a point where it was no longer economically viable to make them smaller, bringing about the end of the law. But Intel’s chief executive Brian Krzanich has put an end to such fears with news the company will release a 10 nanometre chip in 2017. The tiny chip will be cheaper than its predecessor, Intel said, keeping Moore’s law alive. "I've heard the death of Moore's law more times than anything else in my 34-year career and I'm here today to really show you and tell you that Moore's law is alive and well and flourishing," Krzanich said. Brian Krzanich said Moore's law was not over Credit: Getty Images The news came as Intel opened the doors on its virtual reality project, which includes applications for the technology, content production and a headset. For Krzanich, VR is one of the most exciting uses of the faster processor coming this year. “Imagine in your living room being able to walk around the next hotel you’re going to visit, or visiting the event you’re going to,” said Krzanich in a demonstration of the VR uses Intel is working on at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Watch | Five iconic technology launches at CES 02:22 Some of the applications Intel is developing include live sports games in VR and monitoring remote areas, such as solar panel farms, through a live 360 video stream from a drone and a VR headset. The chipmaker has teamed up with La Liga to fit three stadiums with 360-degree cameras that will stream to 38 channels this year. “From the comfort of your home you could be transported to your favourite seat,” said Krzanich. “This is the future of how you’ll view sports. You’ll have the opportunity to go to games you’ve never been to before.” About | Moore’s Law He dismissed concerns that VR will never take off, and said Intel has “a lot more coming in the next few years” that will convert the sceptics. “It can save lives, it can save money, and it can save time,” he said. As well as creating content that works across VR headsets already on the market such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Samsung’s Gear VR, Intel has also developed its own hardware called Project Alloy. A wireless VR headset that doesn’t require any extra hardware to work, Alloy will be licensed to other companies and go into production by the end of this year. ces 2017 weirdest gadgets   Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Gadgets Virtual Reality CES Show more Technology latest 14 Jan 2017, 11:00pm Comment: Fake news on Facebook probably isn't that influential, until it bubbles out into the open James Carson Premium 14 Jan 2017, 3:04am Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton leaving after 13 years for top role at Snapchat firm 13 Jan 2017, 4:42pm Could buying Twitter and shutting it down be Mexico's answer to Donald Trump? 13 Jan 2017, 4:21pm Nintendo Switch to be released on March 3 at UK price of £280 13 Jan 2017, 1:07pm WhatsApp messages could be read by exploiting security backdoor 13 Jan 2017, 12:08pm The best tech of the week: from fat-detecting phones to a bot for keeping New Year's resolutions 13 Jan 2017, 11:04am Nintendo shares drop as high price of Switch console dismays investors Gallery 13 Jan 2017, 11:01am Gallery: From The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to Shenmue 3: the 40 most anticipated video games of 2017 12 Jan 2017, 4:25pm Nintendo Switch: 6 questions to be answered 12 Jan 2017, 12:59pm HTC U phone tells owners to wear extra clothes if it's cold 12 Jan 2017, 11:06am Peace sign selfies could let hackers copy your fingerprints 12 Jan 2017, 10:28am Facebook is working on ways to read thoughts, job adverts suggest 03:39 11 Jan 2017, 4:54pm Nintendo Switch: Price, release date and everything else we know 11 Jan 2017, 2:00pm Instagram to show more adverts by putting them in Stories 11 Jan 2017, 1:07pm Comment: Why are robots still so rubbish?

At a press briefing on Wednesday ahead of the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Intel teased the first version of its Project Alloy headset. Intel says the headset, which is expected to go on sale later this year, will feature a combination of virtual reality and augmented reality. This means that it is capable of featuring immersive video content as well as augmented reality in which it projects computer generated images on real-life settings. Intel plans to tap partners in making and selling the device. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich briefly showed off the new device on stage amid a press briefing that mostly occurred in a virtual reality setting. Upon arriving at the press briefing, media were presented with a black comfortable chair, an Oculus Rift headset, a laptop and a bag in case of possible nausea. For most of the briefing, Intel showed off how far virtual reality has come with 360 degree videos of a live basketball game, a live crossing to a drone flying over solar panels in Nevada and a video game featuring zombies. Below are photos of Intel’s press event. *Fin24 is attending CES 2017 on invitation from Hisense. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich addressed media about the company's VR ambitions.

Already having collected more than 20 media awards in the first weeks after launch, the MSI Trident is the pinnacle of small form factor, yet high performance PC gaming. Trident is characterized by an impressive console sized design that fits in any room, now upgraded with the Intel Kaby Lake chipset.     Furthermore under the hood, Trident 3 houses a customized GeForce GTX 1060 GAMING graphics card with performance levels far above its equally sized console counterparts. Whether it is in a VR environment or simply on the couch with friends, gamers are sure to enjoy smooth gameplay with the MSI Trident 3. The MSI Trident 3 is now available at official MSI resellers, starting at $899, depending on configurations.   Trident 3 features a customized MSI GeForce GTX1060 GAMING graphics card in ITX format, which overthrows any ITX reference card found in other small form factor PCs. Gamers can now enjoy the best in-game performance on a console sized PC.   Loaded with an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor combined with a GTX1060 graphics card, Trident 3 is ready to smoothly support the display of VR content on your VR device, such as the HTC Vive. MSI made it super easy to connect a VR headset by implementing VR Link, an HDMI-port on the front side of the system, supported by MSI's One-click-to VR software that automatically sets the system in its optimal VR settings.   By individually cooling the most important heat-generating hardware in the system through separated chambers, MSI found a unique way to keep the system as cool and quiet as possible. At times when performance really matters, Trident 3 is up to the task and delivers powerful gameplay without bothering gamers with noisy fans or overheated hardware.   For those who like to add a little personal touch to their system, MSI Trident 3 features RGB Mystic Light. By using the Mystic Light App or MSI's Gaming Center software, gamers can change the color and effects of the front LED lights on the system within an instant.   Recommended for You CYBERTRONPC ANNOUNCES SMALL FORM FACTOR SYSTEM WITH...

With summer in full swing but fall just around the corner, now is a better time than ever to start your search for the best laptop for college in 2017. But which style of college laptop is right for your degree and what your classes will demand? Your laptop is an essential part of school work, and will be used in a variety of ways including writing papers, taking online exams, collaborating with other students, reviewing the class syllabus and enrolling in courses. So whether you’re a student that just needs something basic to get you through the day or a parent that requires something a little more powerful, there’s no need to look further than our guide on the best college laptops in the business. Best Laptops for College Students 2017   Dell XPS 13 Apple Macbook HP Stream 13 Surface Book ASUS X551MA Ranking Best for a Computer Science Degree Best for a Creative Arts Degree Best Durable College Laptop Best for Design/Photoshop Best Midrange College Laptop Amazon Rating Display Size 13.3-inch 12-inch 13.3-inch 13.5-inch 15.6-inch Resolution 1920 x 1080 2304 x 1440 1366 x 768 3000 x 2000 1366 x 768 Processor Intel Core i5 Intel Core M3 Intel Celeron N3050 Intel Core i5 Intel Celeron N2815 RAM 8GB 8GB 2GB 8GB 4GB Storage 256GB 256GB SSD 32GB SSD 128GB 500GB Price $942.39 $1,269.00 $219.00 $1,399.99 $315.00 Buy Now Buy Now Buy Now Buy Now Buy Now Our Top Picks Best for a Computer Science Degree Dell XPS 13 The Dell XPS 13 laptop might be on the pricier side, but with that you get ultrabook performance. Price: $942.39 | Read Full Review: Dell XPS 13 Review | Features: InfinityEdge display, touchscreen, Intel i5-6200U 2.3 GHz Processor WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Dell XPS 13 puts portability and power in a punchy, flexible package. A little on the pricier side – though cheaper than the Surface Book – Dell’s XPS13 is entirely worth it, and is truly one of the best laptops for college students in price and tech specs. With a 13.3-inch Full HD Infinity display, 4GB of RAM, 128GB SSD, the XPS 13 is the perfect mix of power and flexibility that college students need from their daily driver. The Dell XPS 13 will be able to keep up with even the most demanding tasks, whether that’s using tools like Photoshop and AutoDesk 3DS Max, or programming software like Android Studio and Eclipse. The Dell XPS 13 is also the perfect entertainment machine. With its 13.3-inch Infinity display, it has one of the sharpest images you’ll see on a portable machine. It’s perfect for the media professional, but also great for watching movies, TV shows, and even doubles as a halfway decent gaming laptop. View on Amazon – $942.39 Best Creative Arts College Laptop Apple Macbook The Macbook first got cool on college campuses, and it still hasn’t lost its edge Price: $1,269.00 | Features: Force Touch trackpad, Retina display, 10hr battery life WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: No other laptop has the same “cool” factor as a new Macbook. Although Apple and its ubiquitous Macbook line of laptops may not be the dominant force among college students these days, the company still knows how to make a solid machine that goes the distance when it comes to software integration and unique hardware tweaks. Apple still makes the Macbook Pro in both 13″ and 15″ flavors, but unless you know you’ll be doing a lot of heavy rendering or running intensive applications, the regular 12″ model should handle nearly any job you can throw at it with ease. The inclusion of the Force Touch mousepad is perfect for students who need to navigate through a lot of content quickly and easily, while OSX continues to be the operating system of choice among departments dedicated to the creative arts. If you have to run OSX for your particular program, or just want a dependable all-around laptop that’s perfect for any kind of project, the Macbook is still king with college students everywhere. View on Amazon – $1,269.00 Best Durable College Laptop HP Stream 13 The HP Stream 13 is a low-end laptop, intended for basic tasks like paper writing and spreadsheet construction. Price: $219.00 | Features: Durable shell, 32GB of SSD storage, one-year subscription to Office 365 WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The HP Stream 13 wins on its raw ability to take a punch. If there’s one thing parents know about their kids, it’s how clumsy they can be when it comes to keeping their technology in one piece. The HP Stream is definitely the most durable (and colorful) laptop on this list, available in Cobalt Blue, Orchid Magenta, Violet Purple, and Horizon Blue. With a 13.3-inch display, an Intel Celeron N3050, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of SSD storage, the Stream 13 is decidedly low-end, making it one of the cheapest laptops for college on our list. But what makes the HP Stream 13 one of the best laptops for college students? It’s ultra portability and the fact that it comes with a free year of Office 365, something that costs almost as much as the laptop itself.

View on Amazon – $499.99 How We Chose the Best Laptops for College When looking for the best laptops for college students, we pulled from a wide range of options both in price and features to give you the broadest spectrum of options available. Just like every college student is different, so is the laptop choice that’s right for them. Some don’t need a lot of power and prefer portability over everything else, while others might require a machine that can render 3D models and watch lectures streaming online at the same time. Because laptops go everywhere with their corresponding college student, every choice we’ve made here is durable enough to stand up to punishment for all four years they’re earning their degree, but also light enough to slide into a backpack quickly and easily without any hassle. A laptop for college needs to boot quickly, run smoothly, and be able to run almost any program you can think of (in case next semester you decide you want to pursue VFX design instead of biochemistry). Ultimately the laptop that’s right for you or your kids will combine all the best aspects of a laptop into one complete package at a cost that’s manageable for your expectations. Key Factors to a Top Laptop For College Performance: There’s no need to overbuy in power. Find the right power for your needs. For instance, if you’re just picking up a laptop for writing papers, you might not need something with a large capacity SSD, a hefty processor, and 8GB of RAM..and with it a hefty price tag. Likewise, if you’re buying something for a Graphic Design or CAD class, you’ll likely need something much heftier than just 4GB of RAM and a dual-core processor. Find a laptop that meets your needs and sets you up for success. Portability: Make sure to purchase a thin and lightweight laptop. There’s nothing worse than carrying around a chunky laptop that’s awkward and heavy to lug around campus or to the library. It’s also good practice to make sure your laptop has a small footprint, allowing you to easily put it in most backpacks or carrying bags alongside textbooks and other study materials. Battery: Find a laptop with a good battery, preferably one that’ll last you all day and then some. For instance, the ASUS C201 has a battery that lasts up to 13-hours, giving you plenty of study time during the day and then some. While you might not need that much, it’s good to search for laptops that will last a little over three hours. Who Should Buy a Laptop for College Of course, you don’t have to be straight out of high school to be in the market for a new college laptop. Whether you’re unpacking your bags in a dorm away from home for the first time or returning after a long hiatus to finish up your master’s degree, buying a fresh laptop before classes start in the fall is always a solid investment. What classes you plan on taking, as well as the degree you’re pursuing should have an impact on the laptop you eventually choose to go with. If you need something sleek and powerful that can turn on instantly for rapid-fire notetaking, the Dell XPS 13 or Zenbook UX360AC should suit the job just fine. But, if you’re worried about spending a ton of cash on a laptop that not might last more than a few months without getting beer spilled in the keyboard, the HP Stream 13 and Acer C201 are cheaper, durable options that can weather any alcohol-related storm. Mistakes to Avoid When Buying a College Laptop Don’t make the mistake of buying the wrong operating system. Some school programs will specifically require either a Windows or OSX-based laptop (be sure to check your syllabus) for programs like Photoshop and Gimp. If your learning is strictly reading books, writing papers, and taking quizzes, then you might not need the aforementioned operating systems. In that case opt for a Chromebook, especially if all your activities will be Web based. Another thing to avoid is having too little RAM or hard drive space. The a solid laptop for students will have just enough storage capacity and RAM for studying, completing assignments, and play. If your degree program requires a lot of heavy duty software, find a laptop that has 4GB of RAM or more and a hard drive with 500GB of storage space or more. This will be enough to ensure that any software you throw on your computer runs smoothly without any hiccups.  And keep in mind that an SSD hard drive will increase speeds as well, especially start up time. And never buy at full retails.  As a student always be on the look for those student discounts, even if something already seems cheap! Most Important Features Hard Drive As far as Windows laptops go, and you don’t use many programs, look for a hard drive with a capacity of 256GB or higher. It’ll meet your needs and then some. If you’re a power user, look for 500GB or higher so there’s more than enough space for other content. If most of your activity takes place on the Web, then you might not need a hard drive larger than 32GB, which is just enough space for the operating system and storing a handful of documents offline. If possible, find a solid-state drive over a traditional hard drive. Performance and speeds will increase astronomically. RAM If you need to do anything more demanding than just using a web browser, find a laptop that has at least 4GB of RAM or more, ideally 8GB, especially if you plan on using programs like Photoshop. If you’re just using a web browser, look for a laptop with a minimum of 2GB of RAM. Your computer, whether it be Windows or Chrome OS, won’t even use that much, but it still ensures the speed and responsiveness of your machine. Alternatively, find a machine that you can upgrade the RAM yourself, which can save you money during the initial investment. Operating System It’s important to find the right operating system for your College program. If you’re in Computer Science or something that requires you to use Windows or Mac applications, it’s good to shy away from Chromebooks. If your studying takes place online and doesn’t require you to use any Windows or Mac applications, jump the gun and get a Chromebook. Processor A lower clocked dual-core processor below 2GHz won’t slow down your laptop if you’re using it for minor tasks like writing papers, browsing the web, watching media, and so on. If you’re in a degree program that has some demanding programs (e.g. Photoshop, Autodesk 3DS Max, and medical software), make sure you look for a quad-core processor with a clock speed of 2GHz or higher. Not only will it last you longer running these types of programs, but rendering and general speed will be a lot faster and more efficient than a dual-core CPU below 2GHz. At the same time, don’t overbuy in processor clock speed. For instance, there aren’t many differences between a quad-core 3.7GHz processor and a quad-core 3.9GHz processor. The only real difference is the much higher price tag. There’s little effect as far as processing power and efficiency goes. Display Finding a good display has much to do with the size that you’re comfortable with and need to work with. Whether it be 11-inch or 17-inch displays, they’re all good as long as they have a resolution of 720p or higher. Anything below that is often blurry and has very little clarity. You’ll want to make sure your display has a refresh rate of at least 60Hz to avoid any screen tearing or altered graphics when playing games and watching movies. The display you purchase should have built-in features for reducing eye strain, such as dimming the brightness or even having a feature for night use. This will help a lot as far as eye strain goes. Battery Some lectures can last over four hours in a single sitting, which is why you’ll want a laptop that can at least double up on two of those a day without needing a recharge. Most good quality laptops will have built-in power saving features that can stretch their life to 10 hours or more. You should be able to get a full charge in just two to three hours, allowing you to quickly get back to work whenever needed. Ports The best laptops for college students will have more than a single USB port. More manufacturers are headed towards just including one USB port, but it’s truly a hassle to deal with, as you can’t really plug in any extra peripherals or accessories without connecting a USB hub first. Make sure the laptop you buy has an HDMI, DVI, VGA, or Display Port. You never know when you might need to switch to a bigger screen, and having one of these ports will let you do that, with VGA being the most common for projectors you’d find in the average classroom. Which Best Laptops for College Students are right for you? Need something powerful that can handle the demands from Photoshop and/or CAD? Then the Microsoft Surface Book and Dell XPS 13 are laptops that are right up your alley. Alternatively, if you’re looking for something more humble for doing your everyday tasks at college and maybe a little media consumption when you have some time off, then the ASUS X551MA or HP Stream 13 are both laptops to consider. And, then there are Chromebooks, web-based laptops. Some are hesitant to jump on the Chromebook bandwagon, and might not consider them the best laptops for college students, simply because you can’t use Windows-based software on it. You might be surprised, but more often than not, we just don’t use the programs on Windows, strictly using web browsers like Chrome and Firefox for all of our computer use. Still not sure if these are the best laptops for college students? Then take a look at our laptops for college reviews, as they might just be able to help you make that final decision.

Intel shows off 10nm Cannon Lake chip, announces Project Alloy VR product plans Intel goes Vegas for its CES 2017 presentation. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 05 January, 2017 17:25 0 - - - - print email Intel pulled out the big guns at its CES keynote on Wednesday, equipping the venue with leather loungers that each had its own VR setup for attendees to use—a flashy way to prove that Intel's recent moves in the VR space were justified. But first, the company kicked off its presentation by demonstrating that its next-gen 10nm “Cannon Lake” Core processor was alive and well.  That’s important, as Intel’s current quad-core Kaby Lake chips have received mixed reviews from tech reviewers concerned that Intel had just revamped its existing 14nm process to add a few more megahertz. Cannon Lake moves to an entirely new process, offering the potential for a more dramatic jump. Brian Krzanich, Intel’s chief executive, demonstrated the new chip playing back a recent Intel ad. We can expect more info about Cannon Lake this upcoming summer, and a more formal unveiling will likely be timed with the Intel Developer Forum in late summer 2017. Focus on VR Cannon Lake, like the current Kaby Lake, represents an opportunity not just for content creation but for content to be experienced through the magic of virtual reality. The problem is that there really isn’t a good way to convey a VR experience, save for VR—2D video doesn’t do it, and neither does 2D images. But throughout 2015 and 2016, Intel quietly gobbled up VR technology companies, including Replay Technologies and Voke. None apparently grabbed the attention Kraznich wanted, however, so he arranged for the keynote hall to be outfitted with Oculus Rifts and played back several VR demos (including a live 360-degree video feed, via drone) to the assembled press. Two demos stood out. The first was HypeVR’s demonstration of stereoscopic VR, which rendered a pastoral scene from Vietnam with a 360-degree video loop playing back images of grazing water buffalo and a flowing river. But the objects in the video could be looked “around”—if I stood up, I could see more of the video behind the water buffalo in the foreground. It felt a bit artificial, though it did make the scene more visually interesting. Intel’s Voke technology feels more like a winner. In concept, it’s pretty simple: the broadcaster plants a 3D camera (or two) next to the action and lets the audience switch between them. In Intel’s demo, they floated a 3D scoreboard overhead with a live feed of a Villanova basketball game. Though the game largely took place in “front” of the camera, the VR headset still allowed me to focus on what I was interested in. The only drawback was that the game exposed one of the weaknesses of the Oculus Rift: the relatively low resolution, compared to the 1080p or even 4K feeds that sports viewers are used to. Pushing VR into the hands of Intel customers, however, appears to be critical for Intel’s future. Project Alloy, a simple “mixed reality” device that Intel disclosed previously, will be turned into a product, Krzanich announced. “We want this to bring the creativity and those experiences to where they need to be,” he said. He did not say, however, which manufacturers will make Alloy, or what the price will be, though they will ship during the fourth quarter of 2017. Microsoft has also tried to lure hardware makers to make their own augmented-reality devices, with more success: Asus, Dell, HP, and others have signed on to make them.

Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

Sign up now Menu ARN Xavier and BB8: Nvidia heroes drive ambitious autonomous car plans Xavier and BB8: Nvidia heroes drive ambitious autonomous car plans Nvidia says it is working with Audi to put self-driving cars on the streets by 2020 Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 05 January, 2017 17:32 - - - - print email Distributors Avnet Technology Solutions BMS Technology Dicker Data Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Synnex Comments The race between two key chip makers to put self-driving cars on the streets is getting heated. And it's no less entertaining, involving the likes of BB8, a self-driving Nvidia car named after a droid in Star Wars, and the company's automotive supercomputer called Xavier, named after an X-men superhero. These two playfully named products are a big part of Nvidia's ambitious plans to put a fleet of self-driving cars on the streets by 2020. Nvidia is collaborating with Audi to develop these autonomous cars, which will be based on the Drive-PX computer. Nvidia's announcement comes just a day after Intel and BMW said they were putting 40 self-driving cars on the street by the end of this year. Those are test vehicles, but a big change from Intel's earlier plans to put the first self-driving cars on the street by 2021. But Nvidia already has the BB8 self-driving car test driving the streets of Northern California. It will also been shown on the CES show floor. The BB8 autonomous car was taped cruising to a Starbucks, and the ride was shown in a video during Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang's keynote at CES. The car was riding the side streets, highways, making exits and recognizing signs and signals. The car automatically steered as a nervous looking man sat at the wheel. BB8 is an early prototype of what Nvidia calls an AI car, a glorified name for an autonomous vehicle. Cars are being equipped with powerful computers to make smart driving decisions and avoid accidents. Like with BB8, computers are helping cars recognize signals, objects, pedestrians, signs, terrain and other things in the line of sight. Intel and Nvidia are also competing in the race to plug more horsepower into cars. Intel on Tuesday at CES announced the Go computers for cars with up to 28 Xeon cores and 5G connectivity into vehicles, while Nvidia for the first time showed off its next-generation Xavier computer, which has eight ARM CPU cores and a 512-core GPU based on the next-generation Volta graphics architecture. It will succeed the Drive PX-2, which was introduced at last year's CES. Nvidia has also touted its technology called "AI co-pilot", which is a slightly intrusive but interesting technology to make driving safe for drivers and passengers. Instead of tracking the outside, the AI copilot would monitor the conditions inside a car. Here's how AI copilot works: Nvidia envisions the internals of the cars being equipped with speakers, cameras, microphones, lidar, radar and other sensors. The AI copilot could analyze data collected from all those sources to check the state of the driver. For example, the AI copilot may conclude a driver is sleepy based on sounds from the person and images of droopy eyes, which means it's time to stop driving. Huang said that AI copilot is "looking out for you." It's still prototype technology. Intel and Nvidia are also aggressively chasing 3D mapping, which is important for self-driving cars to navigate. Mapping is considered especially important for self-driving taxis, like the ones being pursued by Uber, which need to establish routes between points. Nvidia said it was collaborating on 3D mapping with a company called Here, in which Intel acquired a 15 percent stake on Tuesday. Here's shareholders also include Audi, BMW and Daimler. Nvidia has also been working closely with Baidu, which is involved in mapping in China. HP Elite Slice More from Dicker Data Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

Right before the start of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Intel takes the center stage by announcing its 2017 lineup. Unfortunately, not all of the 40 different processor models will be released right away. This led many to believe that the release of the much awaited iMac 2017 will also be affected. During Intel?s announcement at the CES opening event, the chip maker highlights at least 40 new processors in its lineup. Included in this lineup are the processors that will power the next generation Apple iMac all-in-one computer. READ ALSO: Apple MacBook Pro 2017 Coming Soon as Intel Prepares to Roll out New Processors It has been more than two years since Apple updated the iMac. The most prominent upgrade so far is its 5K Retina display for the 27-inch version. However, beyond that, the iMac still remains behind its competitors when it comes to new features. iMac (via apple.com) The latest addition in the all-in-one desktop market lineup this year is the Microsoft Surface Studio. It sports a 28-inch multi-touch PixelSense display encased in a sleek housing that makes it almost invisible. To date, the iMac still retains its standard, off-the-shelf, Retina display. Devoid of any touch features.

Unfortunately, the closest that they got is the tiny sliver of touch-enable OLED display on the MacBook Pro 2016. Even now, the Cupertino company has been so reluctant in featuring the touch feature on its line of Mac computers. With the upcoming new releases of Intel processors, Apple will again be forced to release an update of the iMac. However, anyone expecting to buy a new Apple desktop would have to wait a little further, possibly until the second half of 2017. READ ALSO: iPad Air 3 Release in Spring alongside iPad Mini 5 ? Tipster This is due to the fact that even though Intel has formally announced the Kaby Lake processors, availability is still far into the future. According to Mac Rumors, with around 40 new processors, only a handful is currently available in the market. It would still take a few more months before Intel could finally make the desktop grade processors for the iMac 2017 available to Apple. That being said, it looks like the first few months of 2017 would a bit dull for Apple fans. For more updates on the Apple iMac 2017, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

(Photo: AFP Relaxnews) A fleet of autonomous BMWs could be heading your way. The German luxury carmaker confirmed that 40 self-driving cars, co-developed with Intel and Mobileye, are taking to US and European roads this year. "Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye," stated Klaus Fröhlich, BMW's head of development at a joint press conference at CES in Las Vegas. "This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialise self-driving vehicles." When the partnership was announced in July 2016, the companies set themselves a hugely ambitious target of having not just an autonomous car, but an autonomous car platform that could be used by other companies, ready to go by decade's end. Yet just six months in, it appears that the project is on track. "We have made very good progress in designing a state-of-the-art solution for autonomous driving on both highways and in urban areas. The solution has been defined in a scalable manner to allow affiliate automakers to meet their unique needs," said Mobileye Chairman, Prof Amnon Shashua. It also means the iNext, BMW's fully self-driving car is also on schedule for its 2021 launch. "This year our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNext," said Fröhlich. According to Intel, the main obstacle that has been slowing down the development of autonomous vehicle technology is the huge initial costs involved. "From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. As well as a progress report, Intel confirmed at CES that it is taking a 15% stake in HERE. HERE offers global mapping and localisation services for vehicles and is currently owned by Audi, Daimler and BMW. With Intel on board the owners plan to develop high-definition maps that are detailed enough for autonomous driving. "A real-time, self-healing and high-definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle computer platforms," said Edzard Overbeek, HERE CEO. "As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate HERE's ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected." autonomous car bmw CES 2017 Consumer Electronics Show Recommended For You Complete List62nd Jio Filmfare Awards: Aamir's Dangal, Alia Bhatt Win Top Honours MUFC vs LFCZlatan Ibrahimovic Rescues Manchester United in Liverpool Draw The Next GalaxySamsung Galaxy S8 Revealed: Price, Specs And Everything Else You Need to Know Powerful!Ashamed to be Nominated For Baaghi: Amaal Mallik Slams Indian Award Shows Oops!Vin Diesel Calls Ranveer Deepika's Boyfriend And Her Smile Just Confirms It!

Tech Industry by Ben Fox Rubin January 4, 2017 8:46 PM PST @benfoxrubin Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Photo by James Martin/CNET As I walked into a ballroom at the Mandalay Bay casino, I could immediately tell that this was going to be a different kind of CES tech-show presentation from Intel. In front of each plush, black-leather chair in the audience, the chipmaker had placed a small table rigged with a high-powered laptop and an Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset. Workers directing the roughly 250 people there handed out barf bags as folks started sitting down and getting comfortable. Soon after, Brian Krzanich, Intel's CEO, took to the stage Wednesday to express his company's vision for the future of VR. "This is going to be fun," he said. Krzanich said he believes VR will soon help people travel to exotic destinations from their living rooms, allow workers in hazardous jobs to use VR headsets and drones to inspect bridges or work sites from afar, and enable people to play all kinds of immersive gaming. Intel is hoping to power a lot of these experiences with the help of its computing chips and Project Alloy, a cordless headset it plans to develop with its manufacturing partners. For now, though, Project Alloy won't be coming to market anytime, soon and VR remains a niche in the entertainment and gaming worlds. Plenty of other tech companies expect VR to gain momentum, with HTC, Oculus, Google and Samsung already offering up headsets. All together, they sold about 10 million of those headsets in 2016, according to analysts' estimates. And now folks are getting up to look around in VR.Photo by James Martin/CNET A few minutes into the show, the entire audience donned their VR headsets and Krzanich invited them to fly over the vast desert landscape of Moab, Utah. Just after that, we were in rural Vietnam, looking at a water buffalo, waterfalls and a river. What was even more striking about this scene was that viewers could look around or over objects -- a feature most VR content doesn't offer -- by standing up or leaning to the side. Once people in the audience started to realize they could see more by getting up, dozens of people did just that, standing up and looking all around them to get a fuller sense of the VR world they were visiting. Not done yet, Krzanich then brought the audience courtside to a live NCAA basketball game. As I looked around, I could look all the way to my right to see a graphic for scores and stats. In another demonstration, we flew over a massive array of solar panels in Nevada, using the live feed from a drone there. Last, we watched a trailers for a zombie apocalypse video game, with roving gangs of zombies grunting and shuffling their way toward us. By the way, I'm pretty sure no one needed to use a barf bag. 30 The wackiest, weirdest gadgets of CES 2017 Share your voice 0 comments Tags CES 2017 Tech Industry Computers Brian Krzanich Virtual Reality Intel Related Stories Snap ready to grow up: Hires Sony exec as chairman Airbnb packing in visitors for Trump inauguration weekend Foxconn considers building LCD factory in US, report says Here's how Tom Brady looks in Intel's 360-degree replay tech Close   Discuss: This is what it was like to be at Intel's...

On Wednesday, company CEO Brian Krzanich said at the company's CES press conference that it will be available in the fourth quarter of 2017. That will be roughly a year and a half after the company announced it at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. It’s still unknown how much a Project Alloy headset will cost, or even which company will make it. Krzanich said that the headsets will be made available through Intel’s hardware partners, but didn’t provide details beyond that. Project Alloy is designed to provide a way for people to experience high-quality virtual reality without having to tether themselves to a computer. It also has front-facing cameras to analyze the environment that users are in and make that a part of the VR experience as well. Right now, VR enthusiasts have two options when it comes to headsets: either use a heavy-duty model like an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive tethered to a dedicated machine, or slot a smartphone into a mobile headset like Google’s Daydream View or Samsung Gear VR. Project Alloy is supposed to provide a middle ground. To make all of that work, Project Alloy packs an Intel processor, twin RealSense cameras, a battery, display, headphones and more into a single package that users can wear on their heads. Applications built to take advantage of Alloy can be set up in a mixed reality mode, to either overlay digital assets over a feed of a user’s surroundings, or replace those surroundings entirely with new digital imagery. An Intel demo showed two men playing a shooting game inside of a living room set, with their couch and armchair replaced in the game by other digital objects like a bunker.

Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies — manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies – to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform.” The companies said they plan to begin testing by the end of this year, joining autonomous vehicles from Google’s Waymo, Uber and others being used in real-traffic situations. BMW Group will be responsible for driving control, safety and the production of the car platform. Intel will offer its Intel Go computing platform that uses a variety of sensors and other data to power the brains of the car. Mobileye will be using its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor which gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localization. “From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform,” Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said. “That’s why this partnership is breaking new ground.  We have established a dedicated team with clear, shared goals and a culture of innovation and agility and accountability.” Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing or autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years.

Is it time to sell? John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Jan 4, 2017 at 9:36PM Image source:  Nvidia NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock price came under selling pressure after a negative report from Citron Research was released listing six risks that "NVIDIA shareholders are discounting." Citron believes, because of these risks, the company's share price should trade at $90 as opposed to the more recent $110 to $120 range. Many of the risks highlighted in the report are focused on NVIDIA's business prospects in 2017. Foolish investors are focused on years ahead, if not decades. However, some of the points on competition, notably from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)could linger well past the next twelve months, if NVIDIA doesn't have a strong enough business to continue driving growth like we have seen recently. With that said, let's review Citron's report and address these concerns from a Foolish perspective. Growth and market share 1. Much of NVDA's growth has come from gaming and at AMD expense, as opposed to new total addressable markets. Right now, gaming is the company's largest segment, generating $2.7 billion out of the company's total $4.7 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. However, revenue from datacenters and automotive combined totals $893 million, and that has increased 90.4% over fiscal 2016's comparable period. These non-gaming segments could one day match the size of the gaming segment, if not exceed it. Either datacenters or automotive, or both, could grow to become multi-billion dollar businesses in the years to come. NVIDIA is applying its graphics technology to many areas of the economy, such as healthcare, manufacturing, deep learning, and self-driving cars. For example, the self-driving car market is a multi-billion dollar opportunity for NVIDIA. One estimate puts the autonomous car market at $42 billion by 2025. Tesla Motors is using NVIDIA's Drive PX 2 platform to power the autopilot system in all of its factory produced vehicles. In other areas, Facebook, Microsoft, Baidu, and Amazon are all using NVIDIA GPUs for artificial intelligence, data analytics, and high performance computing. Datacenter competition 2. There's significant competition from existing and emerging players (Intel Xeon Phi, AMD Radeon Pro, XLNX). Also, AMD is launching new GPU's for desktop and server in Q1 2017 and Q2 2017 For 2017, this could be an issue, but this shouldn't be a concern for a Foolish investor focused on the next ten years and beyond. Competition has always, and will always be present in the chip industry. Yet, competition has not stopped Intel and NVIDIA from doing very well for investors over time. Both companies have continued to thrive while competing with each other. The market is big enough for two or three players to do well. Intellectual property and Intel licensing revenue 3. If you believe that NVDA has embedded IP that makes it worthy of its premium valuation, you need to be aware that Intel already has access to this IP from a licensing deal with NVDA that ends this year 4. Attrition will have a significant effect on 2017 EBITDA. The original licensing agreement in 2011 required Intel to pay NVIDIA $1.5 billion over six years, or a few hundred million dollars per year. NVIDIA licensed its intellectual property (IP) to Intel to settle a patent infringement issue in 2011. Since 2011, NVIDIA's revenue has grown from $3.5 billion to over $6 billion. Cash from operations has grown from $676 million to $1.4 billion. With NVIDIA's business momentum across the board, NVIDIA should more than offset the loss of licensing revenue with additional growth from its various fast growing segments --  gaming, datacenters, and automotive. Despite Intel's access to NVIDIA's IP, NVIDIA has remained competitive. The partnerships it has formed with several technology companies reflects the value of NVIDIA's products, which is also demonstrated in its strong gross margin performance in recent years. Gross margin sustainability and competition 5. As Intel competition enters the fray in mid-2017, this competition should have a significant impact on NVDA's gross margins. NVDA is a fabless producer, with TSMC making all of its GPUs. Intel, on the other hand, is vertically integrated. TSMC makes a 50% margin on NVDA's business, to which NVDA adds another 80% gross margin of its own. Intel could charge 37% less for its chips and still generate 80% gross margins. 6. Competition from existing customers (Google's TPU, Apple) The concern expressed here is a price war in the industry, leading to lower margins. This is always a real risk in the short term, especially for the highly competitive chip industry. Long term, NVIDIA's gross margin should remain stable or expand even further. Gross margin has been expanding from the low 40% range to the high 50% range, NVIDIA has leveraged a single graphics architecture -- the layout design of a graphics card -- across all segments of its business. Moreover, NVIDIA's business model has shifted in recent years from a chip business to a differentiated specialty platform business. The nature of NVIDIA's platform business model is more software centered, and this has been driving higher gross margins. Businesses are not necessarily buying chips from NVIDIA, but a whole platform to solve a problem. For example, NVIDIA's Drive PX 2 is a platform that helps automakers solve difficult problems posed by the artificial intelligence aspects of autonomous vehicles. Automakers can scale Drive PX 2 to operate like a supercomputer, or use it for a simpler functionality. In order to scale it, companies have to spend more on software which creates a higher average selling price for NVIDIA. CEO Jen-Hsun Huang sees more upside to NVIDIA's margins long term as the company's non-gaming segments grow and as gaming platforms -- the PC and consoles -- advance in capability, leading to higher adoption rates of high-end GPUs. Bottom line NVIDIA's stock has had an amazing run in 2016. The valuation is looking frothy by conventional standards. Any hint of uncertainty or doubt could send the share price down and that is what is happening in response to the Citron report. The bottom line is Citron could prove correct in the next few quarters. But, if you're a Foolish investor focused on the next ten years, instead of the next six to twelve months, the return potential from NVIDIA's massive growth opportunities in datacenters and automotive -- not to mention further upside in the gaming segment -- could mean multi-bagger potential for NVIDIA. In other words, the potential reward well compensates for the risks. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. John Ballard owns shares of Nvidia.

Haaretz Jan 05, 2017 12:27 AM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon Israel to tap euro-bond market next week for first time since 2014 Israel expects to tap the Eurobond market for the first time in three years next week with a bond sale that sources said could be anywhere between 1 billion and 2 billion euros ($1.05 billion-$2.1 billion). Sources said that treasury officials would be going to London, Frankfurt and Paris early next week and if they determine that market conditions are favorable will go ahead with the offering at the end of the week. They declined to estimate the exact size of the offering or other terms. The proceeds will help fund the 2017 budget deficit, which is targeted at 2.9% of gross domestic product, but more importantly keep open channels with European investors. Israel last sold euro bonds in January 2014, a 1.5 billion-euro issue due in 10 years. It raised $1.5 billion in 10-year dollar bonds last March at 2.942%. Israel sovereign debt enjoys a relatively high A-plus rating from three main ratings agencies. (Moti Bassok) Mobileye, BMW, Intel partnership to put first self-driving cars on roads later this year Just six months after unveiling plans to collaborate on autonomous-driving technology, Israel’s Mobileye together with BMW and Intel said Wednesday that they would be putting some 40 self-driving cars on U.S. and European roads by the second half of the year. Speaking at a press conference at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show, the three firms said the BMW 7 Series cars would employ Intel and Mobileye technologies during global trials. “Our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle,” said BMW’s Klaus Fröhlich. Since the partnership was announced last July, the three said they had developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers from key integrated modules to a complete end-to-end solution.  Shares of Mobileye were up 2.9% at $42.35 late morning local time in New York. (Omri Zerachovitz). Treasury opposes sale of insurers to Chinese buyers, Bloomberg reports In remarks that could signal problems for Fujian Yango Group’s offer to buy Phoenix Holdings, an unnamed senior official said Israel’s treasury opposes the sale of insurance firms to Chinese investors, Bloomberg News reported. The officials didn’t rule out the possibility of exceptions but said Chinese companies didn’t have an established track record in managing long-term savings, like pension funds. The government is more inclined to approve Chinese investments in industrial assets, where pension money is not at risk, he said. Chinese investors have shown strong interest in Israeli insurers Clal and Phoenix, both of which are up for sale, but no deals have been completed and in one case regulators scotched a planned sale. Fujian Yango agreed to buy Delek Group’s 52.3% stake in Phoenix five months ago at a 1.95 billion shekels ($510 million at current exchange rates) but has yet to get regulatory clearance. Delek shares ended down 0.3% at  831 shekels, but Phoenix gained 2.8% to 13.05. (TheMarker Staff) Ormat Technologies to buy U.S. energy-management startup for $35 million Ormat Technologies said on Tuesday it was expanding from its core geothermal energy business into the growing market for energy-storage-and-demand technology with the acquisition of Viridity Energy. Ormat said it was paying $35 million for the Philadelphia startup and would pay out further money at the end of this year and in 2020 based on performance milestones. Founded in 2008, Viridity has developed proprietary software that helps utilities and big manufacturing firms better manage their energy usage. The energy-storage software sector is tiny right now, but a study by Navigant Research estimated it would grow to $3.4 billion by 2025 from $201.2 million last year. “Ormat will continue to provide services and products to existing customers, while expanding into new geographies and targeting a broader potential customer base,” said Ormat CEO Isaac Angel. Shares of Ormat, which said the deal would beginning generating positive operating income in 2017, ended down 1.5% at 204 shekels ($52.94). (TheMarker Staff) Tel Aviv shares gain moderately Tel Aviv shares rose moderately on Wednesday, led by rallying telecoms shares (see story on this page) and gains by Teva Pharmaceutics. The blue chip TA-25 index edged up 0.04% to 1,464.31 points, while the TA-100 added 0.2% to 1,287.77, on turnover of 1.43 billion shekels ($370 million). The TA-Com index rose 2.1% to 989.10 points amid anticipation of higher cellphone rates ahead, while volume leader Teva gained 1.5% to 146 shekels. But the gains were weighed down by declines of 4% for Mannkind to 2.44 shekels, which resumed a sharp decline after a failed clinical trial last week. Kenon Holdings dropped 3% drop to 42.16, capping a three-day loss of 8.2%, and Frutatom’s 1.8% decline to 200.50. The Jewish Colonial trust sold six million shares of Bank Leumi stock on Wednesday in mostly off-the-floor translation to a total of 100 million shekels. Leumi finished up 0.7% to 15.71 shekels.

TheMarker Jan 05, 2017 4:14 AM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon Amnon Shahua, chairman of Mobileye, left, Klaus Froehlich, member of the board at BMW, and Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO in Las Vegas, Nevada, January 4, 2017. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Israel to tap euro-bond market next week for first time since 2014 Israel expects to tap the Eurobond market for the first time in three years next week with a bond sale that sources said could be anywhere between 1 billion and 2 billion euros ($1.05 billion-$2.1 billion). Sources said on Wednesday that treasury officials would be going on a roadshow to London, Frankfurt and Paris early next week and if they determine that market conditions are favorable will go ahead with the offering at the end of the week. They declined to estimate the exact size of the offering or other terms. The proceeds will help fund the 2017 budget deficit, which is targeted at 2.9% of gross domestic product, but more importantly keep open channels with European investors. Israel last sold euro bonds in January 2014, a 1.5 billion-euro issue due in 10 years. It raised $1.5 billion in 10-year dollar bonds last March at 2.942%. Israel sovereign debt enjoys a relatively high A-plus rating from three main ratings agencies. (Moti Bassok) Mobileye, BMW, Intel partnership to put first self-driving cars on roads later this year Just six months after unveiling plans to collaborate on autonomous-driving technology, Israel’s Mobileye together with BMW and Intel said Wednesday that they would be putting some 40 self-driving cars on U.S. and European roads by the second half of the year. Speaking at a press conference at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show, the three firms said the BMW 7 Series cars would employ Intel and Mobileye technologies during global trials. “Our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle,” said BMW’s Klaus Fröhlich. Since the partnership was announced last July, the three said they had developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers from key integrated modules to a complete end-to-end solution.  Shares of Mobileye were up 2.9% at $42.35 late morning local time in New York. (Omri Zerachovitz). Treasury opposes sale of insurers to Chinese buyers, Bloomberg reports In remarks that could signal problems for Fujian Yango Group’s offer to buy Phoenix Holdings, an unnamed senior official said Israel’s treasury opposes the sale of insurance firms to Chinese investors, Bloomberg News reported. The officials didn’t rule out the possibility of exceptions but said Chinese companies didn’t have an established track record in managing long-term savings, like pension funds. The government is more inclined to approve Chinese investments in industrial assets, where pension money is not at risk, he said. Chinese investors have shown strong interest in Israeli insurers Clal and Phoenix, both of which are up for sale, but no deals have been completed and in at least one case regulators scotched a planned sale. Fujian Yango agreed to buy Delek Group’s 52.3% stake in Phoenix five months ago at a 1.95 billion shekels ($510 million at current exchange rates) but has yet to get regulatory clearance. Delek shares ended down 0.3% at  831 shekels, but Phoenix gained 2.8% to 13.05. (TheMarker Staff) Ormat Technologies to buy U.S. energy-management startup for $35 million Ormat Technologies said on Tuesday it was expanding from its core geothermal energy business into the growing market for energy-storage-and-demand technology with the acquisition of Viridity Energy. Ormat said it was paying $35 million for the Philadelphia startup and would pay out further money at the end of this year and in 2020 based on performance milestones. Founded in 2008, Viridity has developed proprietary software that helps utilities and big manufacturing firms better manage their energy usage. The energy-storage software sector is tiny right now, but a study by Navigant Research estimated it would grow to $3.4 billion by 2025 from $201.2 million last year. “Ormat will continue to provide services and products to existing customers, while expanding into new geographies and targeting a broader potential customer base,” said Ormat CEO Isaac Angel. Shares of Ormat, which said the deal would beginning generating positive operating income in 2017, ended down 1.5% at 204 shekels ($52.94). (TheMarker Staff) Tel Aviv shares gain moderately Tel Aviv shares rose moderately on Wednesday, led by rallying telecoms shares (see story on this page) and gains by Teva Pharmaceutics. The blue chip TA-25 index edged up 0.04% to 1,464.31 points, while the TA-100 added 0.2% to 1,287.77, on turnover of 1.43 billion shekels ($370 million). The TA-Com index rose 2.1% to 989.10 points amid anticipation of higher cellphone rates ahead, while volume leader Teva gained 1.5% to 146 shekels. But the gains were weighed down by declines of 4% for Mannkind to 2.44 shekels, which resumed a sharp decline after a failed clinical trial last week. Kenon Holdings dropped 3% drop to 42.16, capping a three-day loss of 8.2%, and Frutatom’s 1.8% decline to 200.50. The Jewish Colonial trust sold six million shares of Bank Leumi stock on Wednesday in mostly off-the-floor translation to a total of 100 million shekels. Leumi finished up 0.7% to 15.71 shekels.

Intel shows off new Project Alloy headset for “merged reality”, to ship in Q4 Posted Jan 4, 2017 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story LIVE from Sony’s 2017 CES press conference No sensors in the room, no cables, and vision processors strapped to your face, not the computer next to you: today, Intel showed off its first version of the Project Alloy headset, a new wearable computer that it describes as its foray into “merged reality” — a combination of virtual reality mixed with augmented reality. In this case, it will deliver both video content that will immerse you, and augmented reality that will project images of some of that content directly into whatever room you happen to be in. Project Alloy will start to ship in Q4 of this year, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced during a keynote at CES in Las Vegas today. This is a relatively quick turnaround for a headset and project that was only made public in August of this year. It’s one of many steps Intel has taken to position itself as a prominent player in wearable computing, which is one of the key areas where the company hopes to carve out a leading position as it attempts to move its business into the future of computing and away from legacy areas like PCs. The idea here is straightforward. Devices like the Oculus — which Intel is also using during the press conference, with a headset in each seat — rely on being tethered to a computing system (here they were attached to massive, heavy laptops); other services like Microsoft’s Kinect require physical hardware sensors to get their spatial bearings. The Alloy aims to put all of that kind of computing into the device itself. Each device will feature an Intel seventh generation Core processor, a vision processor, fisheye lens and sensors, two RealSense cameras and an on-device battery, and will be built in conjunction with a number of partners. Krzanich did not say who the partners would be, but the company has made several acquisitions and partnerships in the last year — they include buying immersive sports VR company Voke and a three-year content partnership with the Spanish soccer league LaLiga. Intel did not disclose the projected price of the headset, nor whether the first device would be a developer model or a fully-fledged consumer product. If Project Alloy was all about the possibilities of where VR and AR will eventually be going, the rest of the press conference was focused on trying to ground people in some real-world examples from today. At a time when many people still wonder if VR will ever take off amid the claims that there are not enough compelling use cases for virtual reality services, today Intel took people through a series of examples of where VR experiences could be relevant, and “save time, money and lives,” in the words of Krzanich, “solutions that we believe could bring value to the end user.” Each seat at the press conference today was a leather easy chair, with small tables in front of each holding a Razer Predator laptop (gaming company Razer being one of Intel’s big investments), Oculus headset, and motion sickness bag. This laid the groundwork for Intel to take us through a series of VR scenarios that included a look at a travel experience in Vietnam produced with HypeVR that took attendees to a remote, countryside waterfall and skydiving in Utah; and a basketball game, which you watched court-side. Perhaps the most notable was live VR footage shot from a drone hovering over a massive 2,000-acre solar power plant in the Nevada desert — implying some of the industrial uses for the headsets. The drone hovering over the solar panel was the first time that 250 people in one place had performed a live industrial inspection using 360-degree, 4K video, Intel said, making this the most technically challenging press conference it had ever run, but it’s not clear whether this is a one-off high water mark or new bar for what we will expect to see in all conferences of the future. In any case, it seems like the experience for users will continue to expand: Kzranich noted Intel projections that by 2020 the average person will generate 1.5 gigabytes per day of data, up from 650 MB today — but that computers will nonetheless continue to shrink to make this manageable. “Moore’s Law is alive and well today,” he said.  Latest from CES 2017 More CES 2017 BMW's prototype 5 series drives us around ZBoard is an electric skateboard that Two of Razer’s crazy concept laptops were Check out the real world version of the Check out Delphi's multi-layer in-car 10 of the coolest gadgets we saw at CES 2017 Ford CEO Mark Fields on mobility services Take a ride with us in a self-driving Audi Q7 At 50 years, CES is a show in transition Amazon and Nvidia won CES this year 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Intel Founded 1968 Overview Intel designs, manufactures, and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide.

Close share panel Image copyright Intel Image caption Intel's Project Alloy headset was announced last year - but the CES demo was brand new Intel has shown off a headset that can replace a room's pre-scanned furniture with more appropriate video game scenery in virtual reality. The capabilities of the firm's Project Alloy headset, currently in development, were demoed at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Chief executive Brian Krzanich said Intel planned to license the technology to manufacturers by the end of 2017. But one analyst said VR remained a difficult market to target. The headset does not require a separate PC or a connection to a power source - both computer and battery are built in, noted Mr Krzanich as he introduced the latest prototype. Two players in a mock living room demonstrated on stage how the headset could create a virtual replica of the room featuring scanned obstacles such as furniture. Intel calls this "merged reality". In the demo, the bookcases and coffee table were then replaced, digitally, by similar-sized scenery more suited to the game - a futuristic spaceship. Image copyright Intel Image caption The headset converted scanned objects into more appropriate bits of video game scenery Project Alloy was first unveiled in August last year, but this was its most advanced demo yet. "It was certainly interesting," said tech analyst Brian Blau at Gartner, who also praised the freedom offered by an "all-in-one" headset without a cable. However, he said it would have been even more impressive had the living room been scanned by the headset itself. "They did say [the room] was pre-scanned, so I was a little bit disappointed by that." Market share The device will not be manufactured by Intel, but instead it will offer the technology to other tech firms to build products around. Intel hopes this process will begin in the final quarter of 2017. But the project's success may rely on others being willing to make content for it. "They can enable all kinds of stuff but if it is not for the rest of those pieces they'll just have the parts out there," said Mr Blau. Image copyright Intel Image caption A demo of Project Alloy last year showed how the wearer's hand could be represented within the virtual world The firm also showed off a variety of other uses for a wide range of VR headsets - including high definition 360-degree video captured at a waterfall in Vietnam. Mr Blau said the use of volumetric video - which lets viewers peer around objects as though they were really present in the captured scene - was impressive. "It is something we won't really see en masse for a long time because of its heavy data requirements," Mr Blau added. Other chip makers besides Intel have been developing virtual reality headset technology. Nvidia, for example, has been working on software and processors to power computing-intensive experiences. AMD is developing its Sulon Q headset, which - like Project Alloy - incorporates a computer and battery onboard, meaning no need for tethers or cables. Image copyright AMD Image caption Chip maker AMD recently announced it's own Sulon Q VR and AR headset. There is some optimism around the potential for growth within the virtual reality market at CES. US unit sales of VR headsets are predicted to reach 2.5 million in 2017, according to a presentation at the trade show by the Consumer Technology Association. But during Intel's event, Mr Krzanich acknowledged that many were still unsure if the technology would become truly popular. "A lot of people are questioning is virtual reality going to take off, is it going to go anywhere?" he acknowledged .

"Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye," said BMW board member Klaus Froehlich in a statement, who said the tests would be a major step toward achieving a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021. "This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles. Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies -- manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies – to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform." The companies said they plan to begin testing by the end of this year, joining autonomous vehicles from Google's Waymo, Uber and others being used in real-traffic situations. BMW Group will be responsible for driving control, safety and the production of the car platform. Intel will offer its Intel Go computing platform that uses a variety of sensors and other data to power the brains of the car. Mobileye will be using its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor which gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localization. "From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform," Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said. "That’s why this partnership is breaking new ground.  We have established a dedicated team with clear, shared goals and a culture of innovation and agility and accountability." Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing or autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. rl/mdl © 1994-2017 Agence France-Presse AFP AFP Wired World Get overnight news and latest Daily Maverick articles Email Address First Thing (Mon - Sun 06:15, SAST) Afternoon Thing Mon - Fri 15:00, SAST) Info Thing (Special Events/Notices/Offers) Subscribe Do Not Miss Daily Maverick has suspended comments on the site.

The chip was created using 10nm process technology, meaning Intel is able to cram even more transistors into the same-sized processor manufactured using 14nm process technology. Essentially, the lower the number, the smaller the transistors become, creating more powerful, more power efficient chips. The reveal was made after Krzanich began talking about the new technology that is driving new experiences beyond the classic consumer electronic device. He said that powering all this innovation is Moore’s Law, which states that the transistors in a dense integrated circuit will double every two years. That pace actually slowed in 2012 with the introduction of 22nm process technology, pushing Krzanich to confirm that Intel’s progression slowed to 2.5 years. More: Intel crams its freshly baked seventh-gen CPUs into five new NUC mini PCs For the last several years there has been a lot of talk about the death of Moore’s Law — that transistors will only get so small. However, Krzanich said that Moore’s Law is not dead and that Intel’s Cannon Lake processor design is a perfect example. “Moore’s Law is alive and well and flourishing,” he added. The Cannon Lake device was a 2-in-1 PC sporting a screen that could bend back into a “theater” mode where the device sits on its connected keyboard and the screen stands upright. It was displaying a commercial on the screen along with a banner stating that the device in-hand is the first to sport a 10nm processor from Intel. “So for those who are wondering if Moore’s Law is alive, is 10 nanometers going to be here, the answer is absolutely yes,” he said. “And I believe Moore’s Law will be well beyond my career — alive and well and kicking.” Processors and products based on Intel’s Cannon Lake design are expected to ship before the end of 2017. Unfortunately, that is all Krzanich provided in regards to the 2-in-1 device and the embedded 10nm processor. However, he indicated that 10nm process technology will help evolve the current virtual reality market thanks to slimmer devices, better power efficiency, and better computing performance. Krzanich’s brief Cannon Lake tease seemingly confirmed a recently leaked roadmap showing Cannon Lake to arrive in late 2017. As previously reported, Cannon Lake will be based on Intel’s first-generation 10nm process technology. The chips will fall into Intel’s ‘U’ and ‘Y’ processor lineup packing two cores and GT2 graphics. The U variants will have a total power draw of 15 watts whereas the Y variants will only have a 5.2-watt maximum. According to the leaked slides, the Cannon Lake rollout will extend far into 2018 along with Intel’s Kaby Lake-U and Kaby Lake-H processors. The second quarter of 2018 is expected to produce Coffee Lake-H and Coffee Lake-U processors as well. The “H” variants will have six cores, GT2 graphics, and a power limit of 45 watts whereas the “U” variants will have four cores, GT3e graphics, and power envelopes of 15 watts and 28 watts. As previously stated, this was the first time Intel revealed a device with a processor based on its 10nm process technology. Unfortunately, we saw absolutely nothing in regard to performance or energy efficiency. Perhaps we will see additional teases throughout the show and within the next several months so we aren’t yacking about leaked slides and rumors. Also watch: Share

Runners can use the smartwatch to map workouts with a built-in GPS; track heart rate and pace; and get smartphone notifications. There is 24 hours of battery life with “typical use” or up to five hours of continuous life with GPS and heart rate monitoring. The smartwatch also features a 1.39-inch AMOLED screen; 512 MB of DRAM; and 4 GB of memory. All in all, it doesn’t feature anything spectacularly different than other smartwatches available on the market today. Photo via Intel. New Balance also today announced its own Bluetooth headphones made by Jabra called PaceIQ. Intel and New Balance first began working together last year, when Intel CEO Brian Krzanich talked about the smartwatch partnership during his company’s CES keynote. Intel is making a big push into sports, using its technology for motion-tracking devices, instant replay innovation, virtual reality, and more. The company is also investing in wearables, though it reportedly laid off a major chunk of its wearable group late last year.

Project Alloy is work in development that captures the notion that VR should be wireless, with all of the computing built into the headset itself, so that you don’t have to be tethered to a PC. “We are genuinely excited about Project Alloy and where this takes virtual reality,” said Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, during the event. He said Intel’s top original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners will start shipping Project Alloy in the fourth quarter of 2017. Above: Intel’s Project Alloy Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The tech has an Intel 7th Generation Core Processor, a vision processor, a battery wrapped around your head, a RealSense camera, and a fisheye lens and sensors. It’s an all-in-one “merged reality” technology that will let you roam around a room and experience VR. The demo showed two players wearing headsets in a room, playing a shooting game. They worked at the same time in the same virtual space. Krzanich said it was just the beginning of “unbelievable” VR experiences coming in the next few years.

Back in September 2016, Netgear announced one of the first NAS lineups based on Intel's Broadwell DE (Xeon D / Pentium D) platform. While the ReadyNAS 520 series used the dual-core Intel Pentium D-1508 SoC, the ReadyNAS 620 series used the quad-core Xeon D-1521 SoC. At the time of introduction, only 6-bay models were available in both the series. As part of the CES announcements, the ReadyNAS 520 series is expanding with 4- and 8-bay models. The ReadyNAS 620 series is getting a 8-bay model in addition to the existing 6-bay model. We will come back to the ReadyNAS 520 and 620 series later on in this piece. The major new product announcement in the ReadyNAS lineup is the ReadyNAS 420 series, which comes in 2-bay (RN 422) and 4-bay (RN 424) variants. Both are based on the dual-core Intel Atom C3338 SoC. Based on the Goldmont Atom micro-architecture, Denverton shows that Intel is committed to a cost-effective server solution based on the Intel Atom platform, while retaining Xeon D and Pentium D for solutions offering better performance at a premium. Note that the ReadyNAS 420 series comes with only Gigabit LAN ports, while the 520 and 620 series are equipped with 10GBASE-T ports. The specifications of the new members in the 520 and 620 series are provided below. An interesting aspect is the Bluetooth dongle, which allows IT administrators to quickly check up on the status of the NAS unit from a mobile device. Similar to the current ReadyNAS units, the new ones also deliver the advantages resulting from Netgear's adaptation of the btrfs file system along with a mdadm RAID management layer. Various backup and remote access strategies are supported with the ReadyDR and ReadyCLOUD packages. Despite the major focus on gearing up ReadyNAS solutions towards business use-cases, there is also support for prosumers interested in multimedia streaming - the ReadyNAS 620 series supports streaming and real-time transcoding of multiple 4K streams, while the 520 series supports streaming and real-time transcoding for multiple 1080p or a single 4K stream (based on the CPU capabilities). The current pricing of the various ReadyNAS models are specificed in the table below. Netgear ReadyNAS Pricing Table [ Q1 2017 ] Model MSRP ReadyNAS 420 Series   RN 422 USD 450 RN 424 USD 650     ReadyNAS 520 Series   RN 524X USD 900 RN 526X USD 1200 RN 528X USD 1600     ReadyNAS 620 Series   RN 626X USD 1700 RN 628X USD 2000 The RN 528X and RN 628X are available immediately, while the other new models (RN 524X, RN 422 and RN 424) are slated to become available later this quarter. Gallery: Netgear Expands ReadyNAS Lineup with Intel Denverton Atom Platform All models are backed up by a 5-year warranty, with multiple support options available (including next business-day parts replacement) - something attractive to IT administrators. In summary, Netgear has taken the lead in introducing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) NAS units based on the latest hardware platforms from Intel. The OS features and allied packages are very attractive to business users, despite other NAS vendors providing a OS with more features for prosumers.

Reply Shadow7037932 - Thursday, January 05, 2017 - link Not really an issue since these things will probably be out of sight in most cases. Reply drajitshnew - Thursday, January 05, 2017 - link Btrfs the file system of the future but The last I heard mdadm raid manager was seriously flawed wrt raid 5 & 6, and the btrfs group had decided to ignore the fix. Reply Michael Bay - Thursday, January 05, 2017 - link >no checksum >life of torture on loonix Of course btrfs would seem like an upgrade. Reply drajitshnew - Thursday, January 05, 2017 - link Also, I would like to know whether these NAS implement the CORE feature of btrfs -- CHECKSUMMING. Reply evancox10 - Thursday, January 05, 2017 - link Yes. I have a ReadyNAS 314 that uses btrfs, and it has an option to turn on checksumming. I can only assume the newer ones do too Reply horizonbrave - Monday, January 09, 2017 - link Netgear sorry but you failed again. I'll never buy your prosumer NAS units, they miss (like in the past) a small but fundamental detail: ECC RAM. It doesn't make any sense to use a beautiful file system like btrfs and it's cow feature and then not putting ECC RAM. People buy a premium for your products (which are good!) but you can't leave ECC behind. Not all consumers/prosumers are stupid. You could do it.. I don't need a pricy and powerful XEON cpu to have ECC with your units. I'll go the custom way with FreeNAS for half the price and with more OS offered features. It's been your miserable choice. Reply ganeshts - Monday, January 09, 2017 - link Did you even read the spec tables? 500 and 600 series have ECC RAM. 400 series doesn't. If you are that worried about ECC, and need a COTS NAS, choose one of the former. Of course, if you are building custom with FreeNAS, you can - these types of COTS units are meant for consumers and businesses that want something working right out of the box with minimal work, and where support is just a phone call away. The target market for COTS NAS units is way different from what you are thinking (and I can tell that from 6+ years of covering this industry about where these vendors are making the money from).

It announced a slew of new hardware and software solutions at CES 2017 including the holy grail – wireless PC-powered virtual reality. “Wireless is coming” and Intel is providing the technical knowhow to create extremely low-latency wireless virtual reality on the Vive. Using the new superfast WiGig standard this is set to solve one of PC VRs current biggest bugbears – being tethered to a rig. There’s no news on when an Intel solution will hit shelves yet, but the good news is that third-party TPCast will be selling its solution by the middle of 2017. This comes with a 6,000 mAh battery that powers the Vive for up to two hours and will cost $249 on release. Aside from wireless Vive VR, HTC announced the Vive Tracker. This new product is a little smaller than the Vive controller’s disc and is built from the ground up to work with Steam VR tracking. It enjoys the same accuracy as the headset and controllers, according to HTC. You can attach it to inanimate objects, like a baseball bat, to make them visible in a virtual reality. The aim here is immersion. The Vive’s controllers are great, but they don’t work for every application. Adding it to a baseball bat, for example, gives real heft the controllers just can’t provide. It is not just basic objects that it interacts with though. The tracker can be combined with more traditional gaming peripherals via USB and a screw on the bottom so it can be used with gun peripherals, for example. Six hours of battery life means you won’t need to charge it as often as the normal controllers. It’s not just about gaming, either. I tried out a number of prototypes including the Flaim Trainer, a haptically enabled fire training system for teaching fire-fighting techniques safely. Other demos included a machine gun, gloves and a camera peripheral. The tracking works surprisingly well considering these are prototypes, some of which were put together in as little as two weeks. Vive also announced the Vive Deluxe Audio Strap. The strap is a little more ergonomic, has a new cable management system that makes movement easier and built in on-ear headphones for an improved audio experience. It looks more than a little like the Oculus Rift’s audio solution, but that’s no bad thing. It’s one of the Rift’s best features. Both the Deluxe Audio Strap and Vive Tracker will be available from Q2 2017, while pricing will be announced closer to the time. It wasn’t just hardware that was unveiled. Software was front and centre of Vive’s CES press conference. Vive will be launching the world’s first virtual reality subscription service so customers can easily discover, choose and consume VR content for a “low monthly fee”. “Think of it as your Netflix for VR” explained the VivePort President, Rikard Steiber. That’s great if you have a HTC Vive, but the exciting thing is that the subscription service will be available to a wider audience. VivePort, Vive’s app store interface, will become platform agnostic, so you’ll be able to use it with other mobile, PC and console virtual reality HMDs. VivePort Subscription will be available from Q1 2017 and you can preregister for a free trial now. VivePort Arcade will also be released in Q1. This will let anyone from big multinationals to small independent cafes create VR arcades for consumers. The aim is to take the pain out of usage rights and paying developers for commercial VR use. HTC hopes this will enable room scale VR in pubs, shopping centres and cafes everywhere. 0 shares Read Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

Image: raymond wong/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-01-05 01:52:38 UTC LAS VEGAS — Intel gave everyone a status update on Project Alloy, the all-in-one, "merged reality" wireless VR headset that the chipmaker announced last year. As per Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Intel will "productize" Project Alloy by Q4 2017. The company's working with top device partners to help them create their own standalone headsets based off the Project Alloy design schematics. SEE ALSO: 7 tech innovations coming to your next smartphone At its CES 2017 press conference Wednesday, Krzanich said the company sees Project Alloy and the self-contained VR headsets from its partners as "the future of VR." That shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone following the current VR scene. At the low-end, there's mobile VR (Samsung Gear VR) and at the high-end, there are VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. But the latter require powerful gaming PCs to work.  Project Alloy-based headsets will occupy the middle-ground and provide the mobility of mobile VR and the visual and audio fidelity of high-end VR headsets. Intel says Project Alloy is the future of VR - an all in one merged reality headset #CES2017 #MashCES pic.twitter.com/MPeROVA02y — Raymond Wong 📱💾📼 (@raywongy) January 5, 2017 But more than just VR, Project Alloy VR headsets will bring with it experiences that blend VR with AR. Krzanich said one of the turnoffs of VR is that it's an isolated experience where the person wearing the VR headset is cut off from the outside world. Using powerful 7th-gen Intel processors, RealSense 3D depth cameras embedded on the front, a wide-angle fisheye lens camera and sensors, and a vision processor, Project Alloy users will get the immersion of VR while still being able to see the real world. Project Alloy let's users see each other, cable-free and transforms rooms into immersive gaming arenas #CES2017 #MashCES pic.twitter.com/Bqtmxnx02H — Raymond Wong 📱💾📼 (@raywongy) January 5, 2017 In the above video, you can see how two people wearing Project Alloy headsets can interact in the same room without bumping into each other. Furthermore, the RealSense cameras scan the objects in a room (like furniture) and map game textures over them to further make them a part of the gaming world. It's pretty wild stuff — assuming it actually works.

It is a fully untethered headset and it includes a 7th gen Core CPU, graphics, batteries, and sensors just like HoloLens. It also has two Intel RealSense cameras built into it allowing you to see the outside environment. Intel has built this as a reference platform for OEMs allowing them to create new VR/Mixed-Reality hardware powered by Windows Holographic.  Now at their presentation at CES Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced that the project is going well and  that the company is planning to productize the headset with OEM partners by the last quarter of the year. They also said they would bring applications such as HypeVR’s world tour VR experience app to the Project Alloy (and presumably Windows Holographic) hardware later this year. Windows Holographic is a component of the Windows 10 Creators update, and while we may have to wait till the end of the year to see Intel’s version of such a headset we can expect to see other OEMs deliver much sooner.

HTC hints at wireless VR with new Vive partners and accessories, including the Tracker that can track anything Turns out, wireless is the future of VR after all. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 05 January, 2017 12:47 0 - - - - print email If the HTC Vive has one flaw, it’s that tangle of cords that constantly threatens to trip you up. But thanks to a partnership with Intel, the promise of a wireless (yes, wireless!) HTC Vive is just over the horizon. You might have thought we knew everything there was to know about HTC’s VR headset: the hardware, it’s price, even a handful of cool launch titles. But HTC executives showed off some new additions to the Vive ecosystem at CES on Wednesday, including a new tracker and an improved audio accessory. They also announced a new partnership with Intel, and the launch of a wireless kit for the Vive developed by TPCast that will be available in the second quarter of 2017. HTC also plans to establish a monthly subscription service, a la Netflix, that will let users play a wide variety of VR games. IDG / Mark Hachman HTC’s Vive, with the new Deluxe Audio Strap next to a vanilla Vive in the foreground. According to HTC’s vice president and head of AR Daniel O’ Brien, 2016 was all about making virtual reality cool—and 2017 will be about building an ecosystem. “This was the coming-out party for VR,” he said. “2017 is about establishing the future.” Vive’s Tracker and Deluxe Audio Strap HTC was the first to make virtual reality “mobile”—not through a phone, but through the ability to move around a physical space and interact with virtual objects through a pair of controllers. For example, a Vive user can hold a controller in either hand, complete with a thumbstick and trigger, and simulate reaching for a backpack by putting their hand on their shoulder. The Vive Tracker adds another virtual object to the space. A little larger than a deck of playing cards, the Tracker serves as a placeholder of sorts for a third virtual object. HTC executives showed off how it could be built into a replica of a rifle, to mimic how a user could hold a virtual blaster to ward off aliens. The Vive Tracker is 10cm long, a bit smaller than the current Vive controller. It will have about 6 hours of battery life, executives said. Dotdotdash, a developer and partner of HTC’s, showed off how it used the Tracker as a virtual “camera” that the player could physically hold and snap “photos” of in-game scenes, complete with zoom and other effects. HTC will give away 1,000 Trackers in 2017 to developers, in much the same way it seeded entire Vive systems to get the ball rolling on content. IDG / Mark Hachman The Tracker can be used in a “gun” as well. HTC also promised an improved audio experience in the form of another accessory. Dubbed the Vive Deluxe Audio Strap, the new experience is about “convenience and comfort,” O’Brien said. The headset, which will replace the current audio portion of the Vive, will have another advantage: It will route the current cables out of the side of the headset, rather than the rear, which will hopefully make it a bit more comfortable for users, according to O’Brien. Unfortunately, HTC disclosed neither the pricing nor the availability of either the Tracker or the Deluxe Audio Strap. Both will ship in the second quarter of 2017, and the company will release the price closer to launch. Wireless future, wireless partnerships But cables are still cables, which is why HTC’s partnership with Intel to take the Vive wireless is intriguing. HTC didn’t say when the Vive would actually go wireless or what its price point will be, let alone what the performance would be like—it’s more of a prototype at this time. But the tether will actually be wireless, using a technology called WiGig. Intel has said previously that it sees tethered and untethered VR merging, and the high-speed WiGig connection makes that a reality. Previously, HTC partnered with wireless company TPCast, which announced that it would be providing a wireless upgrade module for existing Vive systems back in November 2016. That system will launch during the second quarter of 2017, executives said, for $299. The module will have a 6,000mA battery sufficient for 2 hours of use, according to HTC. Over the past year, HTC and its partners developed about 1,000 pieces of content, including games and other apps that can run on the Vive. But discovering them all can be difficult, especially with many of them requiring users to cough up a few bucks. Rikard Steiber, president of HTC’s VR app store Viveport, said that HTC will offer a monthly subscription for users to experience as much new content as they want. The price and launch date hasn’t been set. However, you can already play about 300 Vive games across a series of arcades in China. HTC’s goal is to expand that video arcade experience to about 5,000 different arcades worldwide by the end of the year.

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

The products on show aren't entirely new models – most feature largely the same specifications as last year's variants – but it's pleasing to know that prospective buyers will be getting the latest internals as early as this week. The Dell Inspiron 14 7000 and Inspiron 15 7000 are 14- and 15-inch variants of essentially the same mid-range laptop, and both now come with either an Intel 'Kaby Lake' Core i5-7300HQ or Core i7-7700HQ processor. The Inspiron 14 7000 is equipped with GTX 1050 graphics, while the 15 7000 gets either a GTX 1050 or GTX 1050 Ti, depending on how much you want to spend. Other hardware includes up to 16 GB of RAM, up to 512 GB of PCIe storage (in the 15-inch model), a 1080p display (upgradeable to 4K in the 15-inch model), and an array of three USB 3.0 ports. The Inspiron 15 7000 will be available on January 5th starting at $799, however Dell didn't reveal when the 14-inch model will be available or at what price. It's a similar story for the new Alienware line. All three Alienware laptops (the 13, 15 and 17) now come with an Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor inside. The Alienware 13 and 15 are also available with the cheaper Core i7-7300HQ, while the Alienware 15 and 17 can be configured up to an unlocked Core i7-7820HK. This is the same set of configuration options as before, except all Skylake CPUs are replaced with their Kaby Lake equivalents. Alienware hasn't ditched Nvidia's older GeForce 10 series GPUs across their line-up (the Alienware 17 still comes with a GTX 1060, GTX 1070 or GTX 1080, for example), but new entry-level models are now available with the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti inside. The Alienware 13 is the only laptop that has a GTX 1050 option, while all three can be kitted out with a GTX 1050 Ti. The inclusion of new entry-level models means that the starting price of all Alienware laptops are now slightly cheaper than before. The Alienware 13, 15 and 17 will now start at $999, $1,299 and $1,349 respectively, with new models arriving on January 5th.

Intel shows off new Project Alloy headset for “merged reality”, to ship in Q4 Posted Jan 4, 2017 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story LIVE from Sony’s 2017 CES press conference No sensors in the room, no cables, and vision processors strapped to your face, not the computer next to you: today, Intel showed off its first version of the Project Alloy headset, a new wearable computer that it describes as its foray into “merged reality” — a combination of virtual reality mixed with augmented reality. In this case, it will deliver both video content that will immerse you, and augmented reality that will project images of some of that content directly into whatever room you happen to be in. Project Alloy will start to ship in Q4 of this year, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced during a keynote at CES in Las Vegas today. This is a relatively quick turnaround for a headset and project that was only made public in August of this year. It’s one of many steps Intel has taken to position itself as a prominent player in wearable computing, which is one of the key areas where the company hopes to carve out a leading position as it attempts to move its business into the future of computing and away from legacy areas like PCs. The idea here is straightforward. Devices like the Oculus — which Intel is also using during the press conference, with a headset in each seat — rely on being tethered to a computing system (here they were attached to massive, heavy laptops); other services like Microsoft’s Kinect require physical hardware sensors to get their spatial bearings. The Alloy aims to put all of that kind of computing into the device itself. Each device will feature an Intel seventh generation Core processor, a vision processor, fisheye lens and sensors, two RealSense cameras and an on-device battery, and will be built in conjunction with a number of partners. Krzanich did not say who the partners would be, but the company has made several acquisitions and partnerships in the last year — they include buying immersive sports VR company Voke and a three-year content partnership with the Spanish soccer league LaLiga. Intel did not disclose the projected price of the headset, nor whether the first device would be a developer model or a fully-fledged consumer product. If Project Alloy was all about the possibilities of where VR and AR will eventually be going, the rest of the press conference was focused on trying to ground people in some real-world examples from today. At a time when many people still wonder if VR will ever take off amid the claims that there are not enough compelling use cases for virtual reality services, today Intel took people through a series of examples of where VR experiences could be relevant, and “save time, money and lives,” in the words of Krzanich, “solutions that we believe could bring value to the end user.” Each seat at the press conference today was a leather easy chair, with small tables in front of each holding a Razer Predator laptop (gaming company Razer being one of Intel’s big investments), Oculus headset, and motion sickness bag. This laid the groundwork for Intel to take us through a series of VR scenarios that included a look at a travel experience in Vietnam produced with HypeVR that took attendees to a remote, countryside waterfall and skydiving in Utah; and a basketball game, which you watched court-side. Perhaps the most notable was live VR footage shot from a drone hovering over a massive 2,000-acre solar power plant in the Nevada desert — implying some of the industrial uses for the headsets. The drone hovering over the solar panel was the first time that 250 people in one place had performed a live industrial inspection using 360-degree, 4K video, Intel said, making this the most technically challenging press conference it had ever run, but it’s not clear whether this is a one-off high water mark or new bar for what we will expect to see in all conferences of the future. In any case, it seems like the experience for users will continue to expand: Kzranich noted Intel projections that by 2020 the average person will generate 1.5 gigabytes per day of data, up from 650 MB today — but that computers will nonetheless continue to shrink to make this manageable. “Moore’s Law is alive and well today,” he said.  Latest from CES 2017 More CES 2017 BMW's prototype 5 series drives us around ZBoard is an electric skateboard that Two of Razer’s crazy concept laptops were Check out the real world version of the Check out Delphi's multi-layer in-car 10 of the coolest gadgets we saw at CES 2017 Ford CEO Mark Fields on mobility services Take a ride with us in a self-driving Audi Q7 At 50 years, CES is a show in transition Amazon and Nvidia won CES this year 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Intel Founded 1968 Overview Intel designs, manufactures, and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide.

This isn’t exactly the most specific launch window, but it does place the next generation of i-series notebooks inside the next 12 months. Better battery life, less power consumption, less heat, and better performance are on the way with Cannon Lake, Intel’s first 10nm architecture. According to Krzanich, Moore’s Law is alive and well. With 10nm chips, circuits will be formed that are just 10-billionths of a meter apart from one another. With the previous smallest architecture coming from Intel back in 2014 with Kaby Lake, Cannon Lake is right on time. Krzanich held aloft a laptop running with Cannon Lake onboard and promised that they’d ship the process before the end of the year. Intel’s chip was introduced this week at CES 2017, the same event series that played host to Qualcomm’s first 10nm announcement. The big difference between the two companies for implementation of this technology has to do with the mobility of their products. Intel’s hardware means better battery life and higher performance on notebooks and desktop computers. Qualcomm’s hardware focuses on how every tiny bit of space can mean a far better phone. Qualcomm is also making clear that they’re not just making their processors smaller – they’re using some of the newly available space to place a new digital Wi-Fi block. With the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, size is cut in half and power requirements have been cut by up to 60-percent (compared to their recent Snapdragon 820 SoC.) For more information on Qualcomm’s newest hardware, have a peek at our Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 lowdown from earlier this week. Intel also revealed their first 5G mobile data modem, the first Global 5G Modem in the world. This new hardware brings new sub-6 Ghz and mmWave capabilities as well as 3GPP 5G NR (new radio) technology. This new 5G RFIC is “expected to sample” by Intel in the first 6 months of 2017. Intel suggests that they’ll move into production shortly thereafter.

As he did so, he showed a number of live events in VR. Intel’s people began prepping the VR setup before Christmas, and it ran miles of wire through the press event room in doing so. Intel has a habit of doing big stunts at CES. In years past, Krzanich has had BMX cyclists on stage, drones, and a big floating whale in augmented reality. I’ll report back in a bit to tell you how this goes. Above: Intel had an Oculus Rift headset at every seat at its CES 2017 press event. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Intel had plenty of tech support people on hand, with big screen warnings to take your headset off if it makes you dizzy or disoriented. It’s a first for CES, though other companies have done something similar. Nokia had a press event in VR when it launched its Ozo VR camera. Laura Anderson, a spokeswoman for Intel, said, “This is the most technically difficult event we have ever done.” As Krzanich walked out on stage, he said, “We want to show you the future of this technology. What is driving this technology?” His answer, of course, is Moore’s Law, the prediction that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every couple of years. He said Moore’s Law is alive, and that Intel has operational chips that are built with a 10-nanometer process. He added that Intel plans to ship 10nm chips (where the circuits are just 10 billionths of a meter apart) by the end of 2017. Krzanich said that by 2020 the average person will generate 1.5 gigabytes of data per day. In the first VR demo, Krzanich showed us all what it’s like to jump off a cliff and parachute through a desert valley. Intel also talked about how the tech for capturing and showing VR is moving forward. Ted Schilowitz, cofounder of HypeVR, came out on stage to talk about computer vision software. The second VR demo showed a waterfall in Vietnam, with every frame consisting of 3 gigabytes of video data. It really felt like I was there, except there was an annoying green line running down the side of the screen that sort of spoiled the experience for me. (I clearly just had a flawed unit.) “We’re offering a variety of ways to enjoy immersive travel,” Krzanich said. Krzanich said that VR will likely change the way we do work as well. He showed another demo where a technician had to go out and inspect solar panels in a solar array. Drones have been used for this work, but you can’t really see a lot at once that way. With this VR demo, I could look around in 360 degrees and inspect the solar panels from my point of view. The interesting thing about the demo is that it was live. We were really looking out over the arrays spread throughout the Mojave Desert, in real time, and watching it in VR. As for entertainment and fun, Krzanich said viewers will decide what seats they have at a sports event or a concert. He showed what the view looks like, in real time, within VR at a basketball game. I could see what it was like on the floor of the Villanova versus Butler NCAA game. The VR demo used Intel’s Voke VR sports technology. “This is the future of sports viewing,” Krzanich said.

The German luxury carmaker yesterday confirmed that 40 self-driving cars, co-developed with Intel and Mobileye, are taking to US and European roads this year. “Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye,” stated Klaus Fröhlich, BMW’s head of development at a joint press conference at CES in Las Vegas. “This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles.” When the partnership was announced in July 2016, the companies set themselves a hugely ambitious target of having not just an autonomous car, but an autonomous car platform that could be used by other companies, ready to go by decade’s end. Yet, just six months in, it appears that the project is on track. “We have made very good progress in designing a state-of-the-art solution for autonomous driving on both highways and in urban areas. The solution has been defined in a scalable manner to allow affiliate automakers to meet their unique needs,” said Mobileye chairman, Prof Amnon Shashua. It also means the iNext, BMW’s fully self-driving car is also on schedule for its 2021 launch. “This year, our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNext,” said Fröhlich. According to Intel, the main obstacle that has been slowing down the development of autonomous vehicle technology is the huge initial costs involved. “From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. As well as a progress report, Intel confirmed at CES that it is taking a 15 per cent stake in HERE.  HERE offers global mapping and localisation services for vehicles and is currently owned by Audi, Daimler and BMW. With Intel on board the owners plan to develop high-definition maps that are detailed enough for autonomous driving. “A real-time, self-healing and high-definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms,” said Edzard Overbeek, HERE CEO. “As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate HERE’s ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected.” — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Drive Channel Most Viewed Now Week In New York, ride-hailing drivers are slaves to the surge Daimler’s Zetsche shows off the new Mercedes E-Class (VIDEO) Perodua unveils new Perodua Axia with VVT-i engine In cars, do Americans care about looks?

Though that feat continues to elude us, a Bucharest-based Intel® Innovator, Silviu-Tudor Serban, has set out to do the next best thing. Leveraging a background in computer vision and artificial intelligence, he and his team have designed Helios, which uses Intel® RealSense™ 3D cameras to give those with severe visual impairments a clearer view of the world. And for those with total blindness, Helios features like reading assistance, facial recognition, and a haptic interface provide a much enhanced sense of their surroundings. Motherboard spoke with Serban about his project, and how next-gen technology can give greater independence to the 285 million people across the world who have low vision, or no vision at all. Tell me about Helios. What we wanted to do with Helios is use next-gen technologies to radically improve accessibility for visually impaired people. It works similar to a VR set, but instead of displaying computer-generated content, the user receives real-time visual data that is captured by the Intel® RealSense™ 3D camera. Our software processes the data in order to provide the most relevant information for people with low vision. For example, if there are some obstacles nearby, our software can highlight them, and tell the user he or she is going to bump into something. It can also recognize people's faces and assist with reading too. How did you come up with the idea? My partners Cristian Dragomir and Andrei Nistor and I took part in the Intel® RealSense™ App Challenge, which was a global competition organized by Intel to create the first applications for RealSense. It had a one million dollar prize pool, and we were actually one of the winners. We built a game called Drill Sergeant Simulator, which is when we first got to explore the full range of capabilities for the Intel® RealSense™ camera and SDK. It allowed us to get to know the technology inside out. That eventually led us towards the “Aha moment,” where we knew this camera could be the secret sauce for building something to help the visually impaired. As someone who's followed emerging technologies within the field of computer vision, what are some things we can do now that we couldn't do five years ago? We can do more on the go. Five years ago you couldn't do much on mobile. Laptop cameras were of much lower quality. We had Kinect, which is like a big hulk of equipment that had 3D vision. But the Intel® RealSense™ camera is so small, it can fit on your phone or tablet. This is the major difference from five years ago. You have the computing power and the sensors, and it's all so small and power-efficient you can actually place it in the product. What do you hope to be able to do in a few years that we just can't do yet? What we're waiting for is the technology to shrink even more. Now we have a wearable prototype, but what we want is to have it smaller and lighter, while keeping all the performance. I think in a couple of years we'll get even better mobility from these kinds of devices. What kind of equipment is the user carrying? The current prototype features an Intel® RealSense™ SR300 3D camera, which is mounted on a headset, and an Intel 2-in-1 hybrid laptop, which the user carries in a backpack. What was most challenging part of making Helios work? From my point of view, the most challenging part was to see the world from the perspective of the people who we are trying to help: the visually impaired. It's vital for designing the product and actually giving the software features that will make sense for the user, not me or you. To that end, we've been working with a couple of people who have vision impairments. We have a team member named Mihai -- he's featured in our videos demoing Helios -- who was born with microphthalmia and cataract-microcornea syndrome. Basically, he can see with only one eye, and that’s up to 50 cm. We relied a lot on his insight. Our meeting was rather serendipitous, actually. I was on the train, returning home after a Helios hardware hacking session with my team. Mihai was carrying a walking stick, and someone was helping him find his seat, which happened to be in the same compartment with me. It was incredibly random. I think the universe is particular in that way, making sure we wind up exactly where we should be. We started talking. First, about his vision impairment and challenges he faces everyday, then about vision aids and his Master’s thesis on accessibility in museums. Finally, I told him about Helios and he said he would love to try it and help out if possible. He’s been part of our team ever since. It sounds like he has a very specific type of vision impairment. Do you have to calibrate it so it works with someone who has a different impairment? There are some afflictions that cover most people: cataracts, glaucoma, Retinitis Pigmentosa, things like that. For the most part, they struggle to see a distant point. For them, Helios works right out of the box. The headgear has an adjustable lense, so that fixes some minor problems. We also have a few presets people can switch between in real-time, to choose whichever is best for them. For example, some people can’t see at night; for them we have a nightvision mode. Was there a particular moment when you knew this was going to work? I believe we have had several breakthrough moments while developing the software and hardware, but one of the most meaningful ones was when Mihai tried out the prototype for the first time. He just put the headset on and started using it with zero learning curve. He began describing objects in his line of sight, like tables, chairs, the closet or the door, sometimes touching them for confirmation. Then he gained confidence and went on exploring the area. Meanwhile, I was trying to hold back an ecstatic grin. I just knew we were on the right track. What if someone can’t see at all? Is there anything Helios can do for them? We actually have two versions of Helios we’re working on: Helios Light is the current working prototype, which aims to enhance sight for people suffering from low vision; and Helios Touch is our concept for improving spatial awareness for the blind. The secret ingredient for both implementations is Intel® RealSense™ technology, which is used to capture visual data. The idea behind Helios Touch is to help people with complete blindness by using software that can describe their nearby environment and then communicate with them via haptic impulses. It uses vibration patterns to convey a level of information about what’s around the user, somewhat like painting a picture in broad strokes. If, for instance, an obstacle is encountered, the user can feel it is there before they run into it. Those with total blindness can also take advantage of other features our software has right now, like reading assistance. That allows them to do things like go to a restaurant on their own and know what’s on the menu. We also have a special feature we call Argos, which is named after the all-seeing guardian giant from Greek mythology. Argos is for remote caregiving. Basically, the user can connect to a friend or relative who they trust, and can ask for help and guidance whenever they need. That friend or relative will have access to a direct visual stream of what the user sees, which they get on their phone. The Intel® RealSense™ technology also allows for almost instant learning of a person's facial features. So a known person, such as a friend or relative, can thus be easily recognized when they are in the line of sight of the user. More than that, the user can better understand facial cues, such as happiness or surprise, when talking to others. What's the next step? Our long-term plan is not only to develop the best possible solution, but also make it affordable. In terms of areas we're working on, we've been focusing a lot on the human-computer interface, improving in terms of computer vision and AI, and refining the algorithms to improve organization. Though we're developing several other core projects, our greatest focus is on Helios, because we think it has the capacity to make the greatest impact. For people with low vision it’s difficult, or even impossible, to do simple things like reading, writing, shopping, watching television, or recognizing faces. With Helios, all these types of activities become achievable. What we want is to empower people. Imagine people with vision impairment being able to better integrate in the workplace, or more easily access knowledge, or have improved mobility or an easy method of asking a friend for help -- this could change the lives of millions.

The pilot project is aimed at demonstrating advances the three companies have made in technology that enables fully self-driving vehicles. The BMW 7 Series will be used as the initial platform for Intel processor and Mobileye computer vision technology during the global trials. Mobileye, an Israeli technology company, is a leader in developing both software and proprietary computer chip technology (EyeQ) to support vision-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that provide warnings for collision prevention and mitigation. Mobileye has also partnered with other automakers and multi-billion-dollar tier 1 auto parts maker Delphi to supply its technology to the industry. Mobileye and Delphi plan to demonstrate their "Central Sensing Localization and Planning" (CSLP) platform for self-driving cars in urban and highway driving conditions during the Consumer Electronics Show taking place now in Las Vegas. They plan to start production in 2019. Mobileye, Delphi Mobileye and Delphi plan to demonstrate their platform for self-driving cars in urban and highway driving conditions during CES 2017 and start production in 2019. In July, BMW, Intel and Mobileye announced a development partnership that BMW said would result in a completely autonomous car called iNEXT, suited for both city streets and highways, by 2021. Like Google with its autonomous vehicle technology, the three firms have developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to create differentiated brands. The offerings scale from individual key integrated modules to a complete end-to-end autonomous system that provides "a wide range of differentiated consumer experiences." BMW believes self-driving cars will be widely used in ride-hailing services such as Uber, which has already deployed a self-driving test car in Pittsburgh. In related news, Intel announced Intel GO In-Vehicle Development Platforms for Automated Driving, which is specifically tailored for the self-driving technology market in that it's highly scalable and designed to meet the high compute demands of the fully autonomous driving industry. Intel GO computer systems will span the car, connectivity and cloud with multiple development kits that scale in performance based on its next-generation Intel Atom processor as well as Intel Xeon processors plus Arria 10 FPGAs. The technology, Intel claims, is also the industry's first 5G-ready development platform for automated driving.

The pilot project is aimed at demonstrating advances the three companies have made in technology that enables fully self-driving vehicles. The BMW 7 Series will be used as the initial platform for Intel processor and Mobileye computer vision technology during the global trials. Mobileye, an Israeli technology company, is a leader in developing both software and proprietary computer chip technology (EyeQ) to support vision-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that provide warnings for collision prevention and mitigation. Mobileye has also partnered with other automakers and multi-billion-dollar tier 1 auto parts maker Delphi to supply its technology to the industry. Mobileye and Delphi plan to demonstrate their "Central Sensing Localization and Planning" (CSLP) platform for self-driving cars in urban and highway driving conditions during the Consumer Electronics Show taking place now in Las Vegas. They plan to start production in 2019. Mobileye, Delphi Mobileye and Delphi plan to demonstrate their platform for self-driving cars in urban and highway driving conditions during CES 2017 and start production in 2019. In July, BMW, Intel and Mobileye announced a development partnership that BMW said would result in a completely autonomous car called iNEXT, suited for both city streets and highways, by 2021. Like Google with its autonomous vehicle technology, the three firms have developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to create differentiated brands. The offerings scale from individual key integrated modules to a complete end-to-end autonomous system that provides "a wide range of differentiated consumer experiences." BMW believes self-driving cars will be widely used in ride-hailing services such as Uber, which has already deployed a self-driving test car in Pittsburgh. In related news, Intel announced Intel GO In-Vehicle Development Platforms for Automated Driving, which is specifically tailored for the self-driving technology market in that it's highly scalable and designed to meet the high compute demands of the fully autonomous driving industry. Intel GO computer systems will span the car, connectivity and cloud with multiple development kits that scale in performance based on its next-generation Intel Atom processor as well as Intel Xeon processors plus Arria 10 FPGAs. The technology, Intel claims, is also the industry's first 5G-ready development platform for automated driving.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google January 04, 2017 5G will start deployments in 2018 and what expectations should be for real world speeds future, google, internet, smartphones, technology, wireless, world Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit In 2008, ITU – International Telecommunication Union said that 4G would deliver 1Gbit/sec for stationary devices, and 100Mbit/s for those moving. 4G brought a considerable improvement in speed over 3G, but even in 2017 real-world speeds are averaging out at around 7-40 Mb/s. 4G real world speeds actually delivered on the promised speeds for 3G. 5G could start deployments in 2018 Intel, Qualcomm, Samsung and others are preparing hardware for 2018 Intel aims to attract 5G design wins in top 2018 smartphones for the first modem made in its 14 nm process. The plan is an aggressive effort to be early with a chip that supports 3GPP 5G standards. Engineers attending those meetings say the first phase of the 5G standard won’t be formally approved until at least May 2018. Intel is not alone in the rush to 5G. Its archrival, Qualcomm, announced late last year its X50 5G modem will sample in 2017. It uses eight 100-MHz channels, a 2x2 MIMO antenna array, adaptive beamforming techniques and 64 QAM to achieve a 90dB link budget and works with separate 28 GHz transceiver and power management chips. Fixed wireless access over millimeter wave frequencies will come first, claiming to be 5G ahead of the standard. This was the scenario with 4G. Various startups and Google are trying to accelerate point to point millimeter wireless deployment 5G with controlled tests has speeds of 10-20 Gbps, but real world speeds will probably be a few hundred Mbit/second in most countries for those moving and a few Gbps for stationary point to point communication. Only countries like South Korea, Japan and Sweden might see Gbps or multi-Gbps speeds under real world conditions.

The pilot project is aimed at demonstrating advances the three companies have made in technology that enables fully self-driving vehicles. The BMW 7 Series will be used as the initial platform for Intel processor and Mobileye computer vision technology during the global trials. Mobileye, an Israeli technology company, is a leader in developing both software and proprietary computer chip technology (EyeQ) to support vision-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that provide warnings for collision prevention and mitigation. Mobileye has also partnered with other automakers and multi-billion-dollar tier 1 auto parts maker Delphi to supply its technology to the industry. Mobileye and Delphi plan to demonstrate their "Central Sensing Localization and Planning" (CSLP) platform for self-driving cars in urban and highway driving conditions during the Consumer Electronics Show taking place now in Las Vegas. They plan to start production in 2019. Mobileye, Delphi Mobileye and Delphi plan to demonstrate their platform for self-driving cars in urban and highway driving conditions during CES 2017 and start production in 2019. In July, BMW, Intel and Mobileye announced a development partnership that BMW said would result in a completely autonomous car called iNEXT, suited for both city streets and highways, by 2021. Like Google with its autonomous vehicle technology, the three firms have developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to create differentiated brands. The offerings scale from individual key integrated modules to a complete end-to-end autonomous system that provides "a wide range of differentiated consumer experiences." BMW believes self-driving cars will be widely used in ride-hailing services such as Uber, which has already deployed a self-driving test car in Pittsburgh. In related news, Intel announced Intel GO In-Vehicle Development Platforms for Automated Driving, which is specifically tailored for the self-driving technology market in that it's highly scalable and designed to meet the high compute demands of the fully autonomous driving industry. Intel GO computer systems will span the car, connectivity and cloud with multiple development kits that scale in performance based on its next-generation Intel Atom processor as well as Intel Xeon processors plus Arria 10 FPGAs. The technology, Intel claims, is also the industry's first 5G-ready development platform for automated driving.

The world’s largest software company is leaving no stone unturned in its bid to change that perception with mixed reality software and hardware products that meld the offline and online worlds and make both living rooms and companies smarter. On 8 December, for instance, Microsoft Corp. joined its partners and hardware engineers from around the world at the Windows Hardware Engineering Community event (WinHEC) in China to talk about its vision for building the next generation of personal computers (PCs) that support mixed reality and gaming, and to introduce always-connected, more power-efficient cellular PCs running Windows 10. Microsoft first announced a new PC partnership with Intel Inc., code-named ‘Project Evo’, which envisages “new ways for devices to light up with the latest in advanced security, artificial intelligence and Cortana, mixed reality, and gaming”, according to a 7 December note by Terry Myerson, executive vice-president of Microsoft’s Windows and Devices Group. The announcement was a continuation of Wintel, an industry lingo for personal computers based on Intel microprocessors and one of the Windows operating systems from Microsoft. That very day, the Redmond-based company also announced a partnership with Qualcomm Technologies Inc., to enable Windows 10 on mobile computing devices powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, once again signalling that personal computing is increasingly becoming mobile, which will necessitate power-efficient devices with multiple form factors that run on open platforms. The first such PCs are expected to be available as early as next year. Personal computers are passé The reason for these announcements is evident. While Microsoft garnered almost half of its $85 billion revenue from PCs, this year, the fortunes of PCs are consistently on the decline. Worldwide PC shipments totaled 68.9 million units in the third quarter of 2016, a 5.7% decline from the third quarter of 2015, according to preliminary results by Gartner Inc. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of PC shipment decline, the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry. “According to our 2016 personal technology survey, the majority of consumers own, and use, at least three different types of devices in mature markets. Among these devices, the PC is not a high-priority device for the majority of consumers, so they do not feel the need to upgrade their PCs as often as they used to. Some may never decide to upgrade to a PC again,” Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said in a 11 October note. “In emerging markets, PC penetration is low, but consumers are not keen to own PCs. Consumers in emerging markets primarily use smartphones or phablets for their computing needs, and they don’t find the need to use a PC as much as consumers in mature markets,” Kitagawa added. The fact is that the world is becoming increasingly mobile, making it imperative for Microsoft to prove that it is no longer just an Office and Windows company for PCs but an agent of digital transformation. The change is perceptible under the guidance of its chief executive Satya Nadella, with Microsoft executives peppering their pitches with terms like analytics, intelligent cloud, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, machine learning and deep learning, in the same breath as they talk of Windows, Microsoft Office and PCs. Also Read | Satya Nadella in the driver’s seat at Microsoft “Personal computing is about the mobility of the experience, the Internet of Things (IoT); it is about augmented and virtual reality. It’s the way we access computing through touch and make it accessible in multiple languages. It is about enabling even differently-abled people to interact with computing because computing has become all pervasive. And in a sense, people will only see personal computing because everything else will become invisible. Personal computing will come in different shapes and sizes,” says Bhaskar Pramanik, chairman of Microsoft Corp. (India) Pvt. Ltd. Form factors are already changing With Windows 10, Microsoft’s goal is to have “the effect of the Gutenberg Press on this next generation of computing, enabling 3D creativity, mixed reality, and eSports and game broadcasting for everyone”, said Myerson in a 26 October note when introducing the ‘Surface Studio’ and a new input device called ‘Surface Dial’. Microsoft touts Surface Studio as “a new class of device that transforms from a desktop PC into a powerful digital canvas”. Microsoft has also launched its ‘Creators Update’, which enables Windows 10 users to be able to start capturing in 3D, printing in 3D, creating in 3D, sharing in 3D, and experiencing mixed reality. Users can take an object from the real world, capture it in 3D, edit it in Paint 3D, share it on the web, bring it back as a hologram, or even take it into a virtual world. Over the next year, Microsoft also plans to bring 3D to a range of Office applications including Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Myerson believes that with Intel’s collaboration, devices of the future will “take advantage of Microsoft and Intel innovations” including “far-field speech communications so you can ask Cortana a question or play a song from across the room”, advances in biometric authentication with Windows Hello, insights from Microsoft’s Intelligent Security Graph, analytics from Intel, mixed reality experiences with head mounted displays (HMDs), and gaming innovations like eSports and game broadcasting. To be sure, Microsoft, which is taking to the cloud in a big way with its Office on iPad, already has Kinect—an input device that senses motion and allows users to play games with gestures and spoken commands. It is also betting big on its mixed reality holographic computer which it christened HoloLens. Microsoft believes that “holograms are the next evolution in computing”. Photo: Bloomberg The idea, as the company puts it on its website, is: “Mixed reality blends 3D holographic content into your physical world, giving your holograms real-world context and scale, allowing you to interact with both digital content and the world around you.” HoloLens has sensors that allow you to use your gaze to move the cursor when you want to select holograms. You can use gestures to open apps, select and size items, and drag and drop holograms, and use voice commands to navigate, select, open, command and control the apps. You can also speak directly to the personal digital assistant Cortana. Microsoft first announced HoloLens in January 2015 and shipped to developers and commercial partners in Canada and the US this March. Microsoft HoloLens is now available to pre-order exclusively from the Microsoft Store in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and the UK. Many organisations and institutions have begun using HoloLens for business. This July, for instance, during the Worldwide Developer Conference in Toronto, Japan Airlines demonstrated a HoloLens app that lets engineers get up-close with a full-scale, computerized model of a jet engine. The app can highlight engine parts and show how different components work together in a way not possible with a real engine. Skype for HoloLens lets your contacts see what you see and draw on their screens to place holograms over physical objects in your view. Last June, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) and Microsoft teamed up to develop Sidekick, a project using commercial technology to empower astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Sidekick used Microsoft HoloLens to provide virtual aid to astronauts working off the Earth. Nasa’s OnSight project also enables scientists to use HoloLens to “work on Mars” together, directly from their offices, allowing them a means to plan and, along with the Curiosity Mars Rover, conduct science operations on the Red Planet. By extending the OnSight project, in September, Microsoft opened “Destination: Mars” at the Kennedy Space Center to the public, which allows visitors the only opportunity possible today to walk around the Red Planet. Lowe’s Innovation Labs (LIL) is another case in point. It has partnered with Microsoft to launch the Lowe’s Hologram Experience in two of Lowe’s stores in the US. At these pilot stores, customers collaborate with a HoloLens specialist to plan their kitchen renovation in an interactive, mixed reality environment. Customers view physical objects and digital holograms merged through the Microsoft HoloLens headset, while standing in a showroom kitchen. With Skype on HoloLens, technicians at Thyssenkrupp Elevator AG can be hands-free while on the job, even when making remote calls to experts and sharing holographic instructions between users. This enables more flexibility while also complying with safety regulations. Additionally, the elevator company has partnered with Microsoft and systems integrator CGI to develop a solution christened MAX, which integrates machine learning IoT technology to analyse realtime data from elevators around the world. The solution provides technicians with instant diagnostic capabilities and rich, real-time data visualization of two primary types of data: alarms that indicate an immediate issue, and events, which are stored and used for management. In India, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd launched an optional telematics-based service for its customers. Christened ‘Drive Smart’, the device can track vehicle information such as driving summary, vehicle diagnostics and provide safety alerts. The device uses Pune-based telematics startup, CarIQ’s app that provides real-time feedback on driver behaviour, including overspeeding, faulty gear changes and rash driving. The statistics include the time spent driving, distance travelled and likely fuel consumption. However, handling this humongous data can be very challenging in real time. Hence, CarIQ uses Microsoft’s Azure Cloud to receive data from multiple sources. Big Data analysis is then done on the stored data and the platform also integrates with external services.

According to Narendra Bhandari, general manager of Developer Experience and Evangelism at Microsoft, “these solutions are helping the manufacturing sector create digital factories”. These solutions offer IoT and analytics to improve productivity, efficiency and compliance. Click here for enlarge Microsoft, for instance, claims that its Teramatrix IoT software platform, which enables companies to connect with their fixed or mobile infrastructure and analyze the massive data streams emanating from them, “resulted in a 20% expected increase in direct and indirect manpower productivity by enabling 24x7 continuity of testing operations and remote management of testing equipments” at Hero MotoCorp Ltd. “The predictive analytics as a service market is entirely led by consulting firms. In contrast, what Microsoft is seeking to achieve is to empower enterprise users to access analytics platform directly by integration of R and Azure technologies into their mainstream technologies, such as SQL Database. Microsoft has made it easier to run models and brought down the learning curve. Given the extensive reach that Microsoft has in the Enterprise markets, Microsoft’s analytics platform is likely to dominate the advanced analytics market,” concurs Alok Shende, founder and director of Ascentius Consulting. Also Read | Analytics is now built into everything we do, says Microsoft India chairman Steep curve ahead The business potential is undoubtedly huge but so is the competition, which is getting tougher. The global augmented -reality (AR) market in 2014 was valued at $1.72 billion and is expected to touch $56.8 billion by 2020, according to market research firm MarketsandMarkets. According to the new Worldwide Semiannual Augmented and Virtual Reality Spending Guide from the International Data Corp. (IDC), worldwide revenues for the augmented-reality and virtual-reality (AR/VR) market will grow from $5.2 billion in 2016 to more than $162 billion in 2020. MarketsandMarkets pegs the total mixed-reality market at $453.4 million by 2020. Besides the increasing adoption of mixed-reality products for multiple applications and growing popularity of reality technologies such as augmented reality, the report attributes the growth of the mixed-reality market also to rising investments and new product development activities “from some of the major companies such as the Microsoft Corp., Atheer Labs, and Meta Co. among others”. The global mixed reality market will be worth $1.2 billion by 2024 as opposed to $35.30 million in 2015, says a 15-November report by Transparency Market Research. Some of the key companies in this market include Daqri LLC, Seiko Epson Corp., Facebook Inc., HTC Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, Recon Instruments Inc., Microsoft , Magic Leap Inc., Canon Inc., Meta Co., Infinity Augmented Reality Inc., and Osterhout Design Group, according to the report. Mixed reality combines the best of augmented reality and virtual reality with hardware such as associated devices, head-mounted displays (HMDs), cameras, consoles and software that comprises cloud, gestures, mixed reality tracking software, and software development kits (SDKs) to offer real-world experience through virtual images. In terms of applications, the report divides the global mixed-reality market into segments such as healthcare, automotive and aerospace, e-commerce and retail and entertainment. Transparency Market Research analysts expect the North American market to lead the global market in the coming years with Asia Pacific projected to follow its lead “as the region is exhibiting a high uptake of smart devices”. Research and consulting firm, IndustryARC, pegged the global mixed-reality market at $294.8 million in 2015. In its 20 July report, it pointed out that eye glass devices currently dominate mixed-reality hardware but added that the HMD devices segment is “set to become the largest one in the coming years owing to its penetration in virtual reality”. The report noted that with increasing investments in innovation centers located in emerging countries like India and China, the mixed reality market is set to witness considerable growth especially in creative industries such as education, mobile-based applications, mixed reality-based movies, advertising and fashion. It listed the key companies in this market as Facebook, Samsung, HTC, Seiko and Recon. “This mixed-reality market is highly consolidated with top five companies occupying close to 90% of the market share in 2015. The growing number of start-ups coupled with technological advancements is estimated to however shift the market share slightly from key players to smaller companies. Furthermore, rising investments in emerging companies boost their innovation,” said the IndustryARC report. Moreover, while Microsoft has its Cortana, Google Assistant’s Allo chatbot and Apple’s Siri give it very tough competition. All of them use artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms. Moreover, while there are newer entrants like the Bridge Explorer Edition from Occipital, there are existing products like Amazon Echo and Google Home that compete with Project Evo. Echo connects to the Alexa Voice Service to play music, provide information, news, sports scores, weather and more. Google Home, on its part, is a voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant. Pramanik is unfazed about the competition. He admits that “if you think about the Microsoft even two years back, our obsession was about competition, about our products, technology and licensing” but adds that “today, our focus is really around customers—our obsession is around customers, and our focus is on innovation.” He concludes, “Transformation is about business model changing. So if you have a connected product or service, your whole business model changes because you don’t charge for the product—you charge for the service. Second is about differentiated customer experiences. We have transformed the way people buy. Analytics is now built into everything we do because that gives you the power of data—the ability to actually take better informed decisions. Finally, it is IoT which you can look at manufacturing, services—how using IoT you can actually make processes, products intelligent. So we are not the Office and Windows company of the past. We are a company that can help you empower, engage, optimize and transform.” Leslie D'Monte Topics: Microsoft personal computing PC sales Satya Nadella digital transformation More From Livemint READ MORE Why the rhetoric of caste vs. development in UP polls rings hollow Nintendo takes big gamble with Switch’s split personality Believing in India’s solar mission takes a leap of faith First Published: Thu, Jan 05 2017. 02 18 AM IST Editor's Picks Union budget: Good economics, good politics, or bit of both?

The year is front-loaded because even announcements not technically made at the Las Vegas show are pushed ahead because the big convention is happening. For 2017, it’s no surprise that the one of the high-profile items is 5G. AT&T mapped out its 5G roadmap for the year ahead; it will pursue fixed and mobile solutions and is working with more than 12 companies on standards. AT&T will continue to deploy LTE-Advanced, which it positions as a precursor to 5G. It will conduct a 5G video trial with DirecTv Now during the first half of the year. The company said that it will follow what it said was the first business trial in Austin in collaboration with Intel and Ericsson. The next step is trials of mobile and fixed wireless during the second half of 2017 with Qualcomm and Ericsson. The press release claims that the trials will be the first of the radio specification that is expected to be promulgated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). Intel announced what figures to be an important 5G modem. The not too creatively named Intel 5G Modem is, according to the company, the first to offer a baseband chip that supports both mmWave and sub-6 GHz bands. Intel’s aim is for the modem to be used in trials and in early deployments in sectors including automotive, home broadband and mobile. The modem will be available in sample form during the second half of the year, according to the press release. Everyone agrees that 5G will be big. How that actually “will look,” however, is difficult to say. Phil Marshall, the chief research officer for Tolaga Research, suggests that different markets will react differently. Areas where there is a great deal of interest in new techniques may not react as staid markets will. There also is the issue of whether the real money in 5G will be made by extending the types of services now available or going after unproven revenue streams, such as the “tactile” internet. The bottom line? Companies need to be careful and meticulously plan their entry into the market. That’s a tall order because the technology itself is nowhere near ready. At this point, there is a rhythm to technical innovations. They start in the tech sites and get taken over by marketers. Thus, they jump ahead and become household names well before they truly are ready. It is simply impossible to rush physics. That is the stage that 5G is in now -- that in-between time of the technology catching up to the hype, as this Financial Times piece suggests: Qualcomm chief Stephen Mollenkopf has made 5G the theme of his keynote speech this week, while other chipmakers are also expected to be pushing the technology. 5G promises faster data speeds at lower latency and lower power consumption. While beneficial to smartphones, 5G could be transformational in automotive, virtual reality and the internet of things. However, consumers will probably have to wait several years before it becomes widely available. By the time of next year’s CES, the vendors may have rollouts of more substance to discuss.

Auto Tech by Stephen Shankland January 4, 2017 6:45 AM PST @stshank Up Next New 2018 Buick Enclave expected at the New York Auto Show Enlarge Image Intel CEO Brian Krzanich opens the door for Elmar Frickenstein, leader of BMW's electronics work, at a 2016 Intel conference.Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET It's go time for Intel. The company that almost certainly made the chip in your PC wants to be the one that also makes the chip for your self-driving car. To that end, it's launching a new product brand, Go, that encompasses its processors, its coming high-speed 5G radio communication links and the software it'll offer so programmers can make it all useful. It's not clear whether the Go brand will mean you'll see an "Intel Inside" sticker on your next car's dashboard. But the plan does show how seriously the tech industry is taking the computerization of cars. Computers have seized onto our work, school and home lives, but they've remained largely peripheral to how we experience cars. Lots of chips are hidden away in fuel injection systems and antilock brakes, and we can use Bluetooth to hear phone calls on the car stereo. Intel, though, wants to be part of the radical digital overhaul that's only just beginning with cars. In November, Intel formed a new automated driving group, gave it a $250 million R&D budget and named Doug Davis to lead it. At this week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, it announced it's acquiring a 15 percent stake in digital mapping company Here to boost its self-driving car work, it'll tout its new Go brand along with efforts to expand into new growth markets like virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Despite its manufacturing prowess, Intel missed out on the overhaul of another big market, phones. Establishing its brand outside the PC market also will be hard -- especially with rivals like Nvidia and Qualcomm, which is trying to spend $39 billion to buy NXP Semiconductors, a chipmaker with lots of expertise in automotive computing tech. "The brand inside a vehicle doesn't matter," said David Kanter, chip analyst with the Linley Group and Real World Technologies. "People care about Mercedes, Tesla or Toyota, not NXP, Intel or Nvidia." Digital driving Computerization is remaking driving. An array of sensors -- lasers, radar, conventional cameras -- will make cars aware of what's around them, with computers to make sense of the raw data. That data will let self-driving cars decide when to turn, brake and change lanes, and it'll let them share data through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication links the US government wants in all cars. Cars will need network links for refreshing maps and fetching updates to block the latest security threats, too. And even if it's a long time before computers supplant human drivers, voice interfaces like Google Assistant, Siri and Alexa are mature enough today to cue up the latest album or podcast without you taking your hands from the wheel. Manufacturers will probably spend between $1,000 and $1,500 on chips to build a modern car, Kanter estimates -- "even higher for autonomous vehicles, which will need more impressive sensors, communications and computation," he said. Enlarge Image Intel plans to send prototypes of its 5G communication chips to auto industry partners in the second half of 2017.Photo by Intel Intel chips and wireless links Intel wants to supply all kinds of processors for cars, Davis said. That includes tiny Quark models, midrange A3900 models to run dashboard displays, high-end Xeon models for self-driving tasks and unusual field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips that can be good at bridging between modern computers and the years-old standards that car electronics still use. For communications, Intel wants to supply 5G chips -- those that'll replace today's fourth-generation technology. Today's 4G networks are handy for phones, but 5G proponents promise all manner of revolutions -- superfast home broadband, an internet of things bringing networks far beyond phones and laptops, and augmented reality glasses that populate the real world with computer-generated video game characters. 5G is a big deal at CES, and just about any other large tech show these days. And Intel is hardly the only interested party. Network equipment maker Ericsson announced a partnership on Wednesday to test 5G cars this year with carrier Orange and the French automaker behind the Peugeot and Citroen brands. The zippy data-transfer speeds of 5G will let cars fetch updated map data, and short communication delays will mean it can handle V2V communications, Davis said. "5G has the low latency that would meet those requirements," he said. It's not yet clear which standards will be used when cars chat among themselves, though: the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has signed up for a variation of Wi-Fi standards called dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). Cars talking to cars V2V could help cars share information. Two cars passing in opposite directions in rural Iowa, for instance, could exchange information about the last 10 miles they'd each driven -- as long as they had a fast-enough connection. "That's a lot of data you want to exchange in short period of time," Davis said. It's just the sort of thing that 5G should be good for -- once the standard is done. The technology is taking years to develop, but Intel plans to deliver prototype 5G chips in the second half of 2017 so auto partners can see what's possible sooner. Intel partners in the auto market include BMW, Chinese internet company Baidu and auto technology provider Delphi. Its chips are used in hundreds of advanced prototype self-driving cars, and 33 top-tier automotive companies have picked its products for their designs. It's not domination as in the PC market, but it's a start.

Close Intel strengthens self-driving car presence with 15 percent stake in HERE digital maps firm Viknesh Vijayenthiran Jan 4, 2017 Follow Viknesh Add to circle Self-driving carEnlarge Photo Intel is set to acquire a 15 percent stake in digital mapping company HERE which is owned by Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. The acquisition is set to be completed in the first quarter of 2017, pending approval from various regulatory bodies. In addition to the acquisition, Intel and HERE have signed an agreement to collaborate on the development of a proof-of-concept scalable system that supports real-time updates of highly-detailed digital maps that self-driving cars will be able to tap in order to calculate their routes. HERE has been developing the digital maps for several years, including using information gathered from sensors fitted to car models from its owners Audi, BMW and Mercedes. In late December, HERE announced that it would also use information gathered from vehicle sensor company Mobileye. All of these sensors are the key to updating the maps in real time. The maps promise to make self-driving cars extremely safe. For example, today’s navigation technology can pinpoint a car’s location to within meters, but HERE’s digital maps support localization to within centimeters. This will help vehicles precisely position themselves on the roadway to enable reliable and safe self-driving capability. HERE HD Live MapEnlarge Photo And together with vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, the maps will also give vehicles the ability to see obstacles beyond their immediate field of vision and receive real-time updates as environments change due to traffic, road conditions and other factors. “A real-time, self-healing and high-definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle computer platforms,” HERE CEO Edzard Overbeek said in a statement. “As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate HERE’s ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected.” Intel and HERE will initially work with Audi, BMW and Mercedes to test the technology. However, the plan is to make it available to other automakers. Note, Intel is already working with BMW and Mobileye to develop self-driving cars and estimates to have the technology ready by 2021.

G.Skill has been constantly releasing the highest clocked memory kits around, so when we got their latest press release overnight  showing off Trident Z DDR4 4266 MHz memory kits we weren’t too shocked by it. The two new kits that G.SKill is highlighting today are rated at DDR4-4266MHz at CL19-19-19-39 for 16GB (8GBx2) kits and DDR4-4133MHz CL19-21-21-41 for 32GB (8GBx4) kits. Both kits have CL19 memory timings and that is pretty aggressive seeing how fast the clock speeds are. The voltage to get a 16GB 4266MHz DDR4 memory kits is 1.4V, which is the highest that we have ever seen a DDR4 memory kit at. The G.Skill DDR4 4266MHz memory kits appear to be available now from Newegg for $249.99 shipped. G.Skill didn’t show off any performance benchmarks on either of these new kits, but did show off a screenshot of them running error free. If you are buying a new Intel Z270 motherboard and need a new memory kit be sure to check out all the different speeds available from G.SKill to get the most from your new platform. FZ1 Sweet colors!

Intel’s new Go brand covers car tech from self-driving to 5G wireless Posted Jan 4, 2017 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story ZF debuts ProAI, a production self-driving system based on Nvidia’s Drive PX 2 Intel already has a dedicated functional group targeting the automotive industry, and now it also has sub-brand devoted to all things car tech. The Go brand covers products including in-vehicle automated driving development platforms, a 5G communication platform that’s intended to help carmakers get ready for broader rollout of 5G wireless tech in 2020, and an SDK aimed at helping developers in the automated driving field take advantage of new computing and sensor hardware. Go, and its three product lines, are making their official debut at CES 2017 on Wednesday, and put some more definition on Intel’s plan to position itself in a key role as autonomous driving continues to gain traction. Intel also announced a test fleet deployment partnership with BMW and Mobileye Wednesday morning, and those test vehicles will indeed carry Intel Go platforms on board, according to the chipmaker. The new 5G deployment platform is also very interesting, because it paves the way for connective not only between vehicles, but also between cars and infrastructure, with wireless network advances that drastically improve latency and speed, which are both key ingredients when you’re talking about communication tech that’s used to help inform split-section decisions a car’s autonomous navigation systems are using to potentially avoid accidents. Intel’s Automated Driving Group (ADG) will likely be a big contributor to Go’s development, but it sounds like Go might be even more broad-reaching as the silicon giant looks to make the most out of the car industry’s increasing reliance on tech.

BMW is ready to get its self-driving cars on the road, and you could see one whizzing past you on the highway by year's end. The car maker is in Las Vegas for CES this week, where it—alongside Intel and Mobileye—announced that autonomous BMW 7 Series vehicles are scheduled for trials in the US and Europe later in the year. BMW, Intel, and Mobileye teamed up in July to "create an open platform for the next generation of cars," with an eye on providing fully automated driving solutions by 2021. Now, the trio are ready to start testing what they've come up with, which BMW board of management member Klaus Frölich called "a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group's first fully autonomous vehicle." "Over the last six months, we have made very good progress in designing a state-of-the-art solution for autonomous driving on both highways and in urban areas," said Mobileye co-founder, chairman, and CTO Professor Amnon Shashua. Mobileye is contributing its EyeQ 5 high-performance computer vision processor, which handles input from the 360-degree vision sensors and localization. Going forward, it's prepping a "sensor fusion solution," which will create a model of the environment around the vehicle using vision, radar, and lidar sensors. Intel solutions, meanwhile, are present in the vehicle via Intel GO and the data center. "From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement. The solution will be available to other auto makers, not just BMW. "We are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies—manufacturers, suppliers, or technology companies—to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform," Frölich said. Intel, meanwhile, has also acquired a 15 percent stake in digital mapping firm Here, which BMW, Audi, and Daimler acquired in 2015. Check Out the Best Photos From CES 2017!

The announcement, made at a joint press conference at CES 2017, the consumer and electronics trade show that is taking place this week in Las Vegas, is testament to the “significant advancements” made by the three companies towards fully autonomous driving, the companies said. The BMW 7 Series will employ “cutting-edge” Intel and Mobileye technologies during global trials starting in the U.S. and Europe, the companies said. BMW, Intel and Mobileye announced their partnership in July last year, and the companies have since developed what they define a “scalable architecture” for autonomous driving that can be also used by other carmakers for their own brands. This offering to other manufacturers will range from individual integrated modules to complete end-to-end solutions, the companies said in a statement. “Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye,” said Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development. “We are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies — manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies — to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform.” This year, a BMW fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions, he said, adding that this is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle. As part of the partnership, the BMW Group will be responsible for driving control and dynamics, evaluation of overall functional safety of the cars; Intel brings to the partnership the high performance computing elements that span from the vehicle to the data center; while Mobileye contributes its high-performance computer vision processors. Mobileye will further collaborate with the BMW Group to develop additional sensors, as well as establishing driving policies and using Mobileye’s reinforcement learning algorithms, to provide the vehicles with the artificial intelligence required to safely negotiate complex driving situations, the companies said. Mobileye and its UK based partner Delphi Automotive Plc. said last month they would hold the “most complex automated drive ever publicly demonstrated on an urban and highway” route in Las Vegas this week. There are some 30 corporate groups globally, ranging from the automotive industry to leading technology brands — including Google, Daimler and General Motors — that are chasing the dream of driverless cars by setting up research and development activities, and buying or teaming up with tech companies, according to CB Insights, a New York-based data company. And the race is on among them for who will be able to put the first driverless car on the road.

The companies will deploy 40 self-driving cars for testing on public roads in the second half of this year. The test cars will be BMW 7 Series sedans that are packed with technology provided by Intel and Mobileye. BMW hasn’t made this announcement today out of the blue. It first announced more than six months ago that it was looking to team up with Intel and Mobileye on self-driving cars. Intel will provide the processing power while Mobileye will come up with the systems and sensors required to enable the car to drive itself. BMW said back then that it wanted to start selling autonomous cars by 2021. Today’s announcement is interesting for a different reason. These companies aren’t just collaborating on self-driving car technology that only BMW will use. They are actually working on scalable architecture that other car manufacturers can adopt and use in their vehicles of the future. BMW also has an independent project that it’s working on. It’s the company’s autonomous electric car currently referred to as i NEXT that BMW is hoping to have out on the market by 2021. The three companies will begin their joint testing with BMW 7 Series vehicles in the second half of 2017. Filed in Transportation. Read more about bmw, CES, CES 2017, Intel and self-driving cars.

Intel's 7th-generation processors are built on the "14nm+" process, introducing new optimizations compared to previous 14nm Broadwell and Skylake chips. According to Intel, Kaby Lake will bring "double digit productivity performance increases" of up to 20 percent for gaming notebooks and 25 percent for desktops. With 4K and 360 degree content, customers can expect up to 65 percent faster performance on notebooks. Enhanced security, a new media engine, and improvements in VR and gaming are all advertised features. Of the chips announced today, the 28-watt U-Series chips are appropriate for a future 13-inch MacBook Pro update, and we could see the 7267U/7287U/7567U used in 13-inch MacBook Pro machines this year. Those same chips are likely what Apple would use in a Mac mini update, as the Mac mini and the 13-inch MacBook Pro have traditionally included the same chips. Intel's 45-watt H-Series chips are appropriate for a future 15-inch MacBook Pro update. The 7700HQ would be ideal for entry-level machines, while a mid-tier machine would use the 7820HQ and the top-of-the-line MacBook Pro would use the 7920HQ. There are multiple potential upgrade options for the 27-inch iMac, but the S-Series desktop chips (7500/7600/7700K) are the straight upgrade path from the current Skylake chips used in 27-inch machines. For the 21.5-inch iMac, Apple normally uses chips with higher-end integrated graphics, but Intel has not released Kaby Lake chips that are a clear upgrade for the smaller iMac machines. Apple could choose to use Skylake chips instead of Kaby Lake chips for the 21.5-inch iMac, and in that case, would likely adopt the 6585R, 6685R, and 6785R chips, released six months ago. With today's announcement, Kaby Lake chips that are clear upgrades for the iMac, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini will be available to manufacturers in the near future and will be available for Apple's planned 2017 upgrades. Kaby Lake chips appropriate for future MacBook updates are already available. Rumors suggest we will see refreshed iMacs in the spring, which is also when we may see new MacBooks, and in the fall, we expect to see Kaby Lake refreshes for the MacBook Pro lineup.

BMW’s Self-Driving Cars to Hit Public Streets This Year Share Tweet Subscribe Get AutoGuide.com in your Inbox Like AutoGuide.com on Facebook By Stephen Elmer Jan 04, 2017 BMW along with partners Intel and Mobileye have announced that about 40 self-driving BMW vehicles are destined to hit public streets for testing by the second half of 2017.  The fleet will be made up of BMW 7 Series vehicles fitted with technology from Intel and Mobileye, the entire suite of which has been designed to scale to different platforms and could even be used by other automakers. The three companies announced a partnership in July of 2016. BMW is responsible for the driving control, dynamics and overall evaluation of the functional safety of the system along with building a high-performance simulation engine. Production of prototypes and eventually scaling the platform through partners will also be handled by the German automaker. Intel supplies the brains of the car, with its new Intal GO system offering powerful processors that handle sensor fusion, driving policy, environmental modelling and path planning. Mobileye provides its EyeQ 5 system which processes and interprets the input from the 360-degree surround view vision provided by a number of sensors, made up of radar, lidar and cameras. SEE ALSO: Weird BMW ‘Sculpture’ Thinks Holograms are the Future “This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles,” said Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development. “Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies – manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies – to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform. This year our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle.” BMW is still planning to launch the BMW iNext model by 2021, complete with a full suite of self-driving technology. The brand says the iNext will serve as the basis for all of its self-driving cars moving forward.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Qualcomm Unveils Smaller, More Powerful Snapdragon 835 Chip By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: JANUARY 04 2017 The next generation of Qualcomm Technologies' Snapdragon system-on-chip (SoC) will be far smaller, thinner and more power-efficient than than the previous version. It will also support faster wireless connectivity for mobile computing, gaming and multimedia use, the company said yesterday. Introduced yesterday ahead of the kick-off to CES 2017, which runs from Jan. 5 through Jan. 8, in Las Vegas, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 is made by Samsung using a new 10-nanometer design that could put new pressure on competitor Intel. Currently, the global microprocessor leader, Intel is still producing 14-nanometer-based chips, although the company said it expects to begin shipping 10-nanometer technology sometime this year. Qualcomm's new design for the Snapdragon 835 makes the SoC 35 percent smaller than the previous version, the Snapdragon 820. Combined with the Snapdragon 835's improved power profile, that means the new chip could enable significantly better battery life, charging, camera images and virtual reality applications for a range of devices, Qualcomm said. 835 To Appear in New Smart Glasses "[A]s we embark on a new era of intelligent, connected experiences, our mobile devices are going to need a new, one-of-a-kind processor that's smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient than any chipset in history," Francisco Cheng, Qualcomm's director of technical marketing, wrote yesterday on the company's Snapdragon blog. "Qualcomm Technologies' newest mobile SoC is designed to meet every one of these rigorous requirements while setting new standards in mobile performance." The architectural improvements in the Snapdragon 835 will pave the way for a new wave of capabilities in smartphones, virtual reality (VR) gear, Bluetooth devices, 4G connectivity and security-focused authentication, Cheng said. The improved computing power of the new SoC will also enable smarter and more dynamic machine learning applications, he added. One of the first VR devices to incorporate the Snapdragon 835 will be Osterhout Design Group's R-8 and R-9 smart glasses, both set to hit the market later this year. Unveiled at CES yesterday, the devices will allow wearers to view movies and videos, play games and read articles and books, among other uses. Improvements Across 5 Key Technologies Qualcomm said the Snapdragon 835 will help deliver improvements across five key technologies: battery life, virtual/augmented reality immersion, image and video capture, connectivity and security. One of the chip's new features, Qualcomm Haven, is a security platform that supports biometric authentication via fingerprint, eye and face-based imagery. The Snapdragon 835 also features an upgraded software framework for neural processing that will enable new machine learning capabilities, Qualcomm said. Original equipment manufacturers and software developers will be able to use these capabilities for "rich experiences such as intelligent photography, strong security and privacy protection, smart automobiles and personal assistants, and responsive and true-to-life VR and AR," Qualcomm said. Faster connectivity will be provided through the chip's new integrated Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, which can support download speeds of up to one gigabit per second and upload speeds of up to 150 megabits per second, Qualcomm said. The company added that the new Snapdragon is also the first certified commercial technology to support the latest Bluetooth 5 standard, which promises signficant improvements over the previous Bluetooth 4 range and connection speeds. In production now, the Snapdragon 835 will begin appearing in commercial devices hitting the market in the first half of this year, Qualcomm said.

Next Article > CES 2017: Wireless Charging May Be About To Become a Reality By Samuel Gibbs PUBLISHED: JANUARY 06 2017 Over the past few years, wires have been cut for everything from internet connections to earphones -- but still, almost every device needs to be plugged in at least once a day to charge. That may be about to change. At CES this year, Dell unveiled the Latitude 7285, a convertible two-in -- one Windows 10 computer that gets its power from a desktop wireless charging pad, and Ford announced it would be conducting tests of wireless vehicle charging. But it was Energous that revealed the most interesting development. The four-year-old company, a CES regular, had something to show of its WattUp wireless system, which beams power to devices using radio frequencies, rather than the magnetic induction used in the contactless charging of certain smartphones of the past few years. It had six companies showing off devices with WattUp technology powering them. From Bluetooth trackers, hearing aids and styluses, to a small module you can plug into other things, WattUp’s tentative steps into the real world with products you may actually be able to buy are encouraging with one small caveat: it only works over a few centimetres. Energous claims that these devices will be able to “seamlessly transition from being charged by small, contact-based, portable transmitters, to forthcoming larger transmitters that offer charging at-a-distance of up to 15 feet (4.6m)”. How long before that switch to power at a distance greater than a few centimetres takes is unknown, but one of the WattUp devices is capable of providing 700mAh of power to any microUSB port, a level of power greater than minimum expected of traditional USB supplied power from a computer. While 700mAh is certainly not enough power for something large, yet, it should be easily capable of powering portable devices and the burgeoning Internet of Things ecosystem instead of requiring a USB cable or replaceable battery. Energous also signed a undisclosed deal last year to supply its wireless power system to “one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world” according to the Energous chief executive, Steve Rizzone, talking to the Verge. The company also claimed that its technology was going through “Apple compliance testing” suggesting that it might have inked a deal with the Cupertino-based company. Wireless power is still in its infancy, but CES 2017 has marked a significant milestone for the technology. To leap out of the pages of science fiction and into the real world products you might actually buy will need a large electronics firm to put the technology into its products. A company such as Apple or Samsung, which was an early adopter of wireless charging technology, may just be catalyst needed to make it happen. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge.

More About: The Changing Automotive Landscape Intel Advertisement Intel Corp., trying to convert its dominance of computers into a stake in the growing market for chips used in cars, is offering automakers new products aimed at making its technology crucial to the effort to develop self-driving vehicles. ‘Intel Go’ will feature processors ranging from its smallest Atom chips all the way up to its most powerful Xeon product packaged with other components and software. It will be available in the first half of 2017, the company said Wednesday. The world’s largest chipmaker is seeking to gain a greater piece of what the industry is targeting as its next big market. As cars make the move from primarily mechanical devices to become increasingly dependent on electronics, Intel, Nvidia Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are tuning their digital products to provide more intelligence in vehicles. Popular Now The Dawn of the Smart Factory 5 Ways to Develop a More Efficient Factory Top 10 Manufacturing Countries in 2020 Intel processors are a good fit for autos because the same type of chips are used to develop software on personal computers and process information in data centers, said Doug Davis, the head of Intel’s car unit. The company also announced Wednesday that it will offer the first version of a new modem to connect to forthcoming 5G cellular networks. That part will be available to test in the second half of 2017. Intel’s chips are already designed into 30 vehicle models that are on the road and are being used in hundreds of autonomous test vehicles, the company said. It doesn’t break out how much revenue is generated by that market. Nvidia automotive chip sales rose to $320 million in its 2016 fiscal year from $183 million in the preceding period. Neither Intel nor Nvidia made it into the the Top 10 chip providers to the automotive market in 2015, according to IDC Corp. One chipmaker that did, NXP Semiconductor NV, last year bought another on the list, Freescale Semiconductor. Now that combined company is being acquired by Qualcomm.

How long before that switch to power at a distance greater than a few centimetres takes is unknown, but one of the WattUp devices is capable of providing 700mAh of power to any microUSB port, a level of power greater than minimum expected of traditional USB supplied power from a computer. While 700mAh is certainly not enough power for something large, yet, it should be easily capable of powering portable devices and the burgeoning Internet of Things ecosystem instead of requiring a USB cable or replaceable battery. Energous also signed a undisclosed deal last year to supply its wireless power system to “one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world” according to the Energous chief executive, Steve Rizzone, talking to the Verge. The company also claimed that its technology was going through “Apple compliance testing” suggesting that it might have inked a deal with the Cupertino-based company. Wireless power is still in its infancy, but CES 2017 has marked a significant milestone for the technology. To leap out of the pages of science fiction and into the real world products you might actually buy will need a large electronics firm to put the technology into its products. A company such as Apple or Samsung, which was an early adopter of wireless charging technology, may just be catalyst needed to make it happen. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge.

Credit: Intel More like this Xavier and BB8: Nvidia heroes drive ambitious autonomous car plans Nvidia's updated Drive PX 2 computer will drive autonomous cars Nvidia teases Volta GPU in next-gen Xavier self-driving car computer Video The State of Solar 2017 There's a race to put more computing power in self-driving cars, and it's shaping up to be eerily similar to an earlier battle between Intel and AMD to crank up PC horsepower. Intel at CES announced the powerful Go computer with up to 28 Xeon chips so self-driving cars can cruise the streets safely. Beyond Xeon, Go will also be available with either next-generation Atom chips or 5G connectivity. The first 40 self-driving BMW cars based on the Go will hit the streets in tests this year. Autonomous cars need a lot of computational power under the hood to avoid accidents and make smart driving decisions. That horsepower comes from computers like the Go, which is configured to be faster than gaming PCs and many servers. Go will compete with Nvidia's Drive PX 2, a water-cooled supercomputer for autonomous cars announced by Nvidia last year. The Drive PX 2 has 12 CPU cores and two Pascal-based GPU cores but no 5G connectivity. The car chip race between Intel and Nvidia resembles the competition between AMD and Intel in the late 1990s and early 2000s PC heyday to crank up the clock frequency of processors. The chip makers ultimately gave up the battle to focus on power efficiency to increase battery life in laptops.  Intel believes it has an advantage over its rivals with 5G connectivity, allowing cars to communicate with servers in the cloud to analyze images. This connectivity is an important tool for cars to identify objects on streets. Both the Go and the Drive PX 2 have the same target: To train computers to be smarter. The computers help cars detect pedestrians, recognize lanes, and stop at signals. Computers make decisions based on algorithms and data collected from cameras and sensors like lidar and radar. Intel and Nvidia are also in a race to put self-driving cars on streets. Intel is working with Mobileye and BMW on self-driving cars, and Nvidia's hardware is being used in Tesla vehicles with self-driving features. The biggest benefit to self-driving cars is in safety, but there are other functional and economic benefits, said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of the automated driving division at Intel. Self-driving vehicles could help people make better use of their time. Self-driving cars could bring economic benefits to logistics related to transportation and delivery of products, Winter said. Uber is already testing self-driving taxis in the U.S., and other technology companies are dabbling in self-driving cars. Companies are working together to establish standards for autonomous vehicles to communicate about traffic and weather conditions. The Go computers are part of development kits that come with software tools. The kits join a stable of Intel computers that include NUC mini desktops, Compute Sticks, and development boards for smart devices, robots, and drones. Intel's Go hardware with Xeon is supplemented by two FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), which can be reprogrammed to do multiple tasks. The FPGAs are to Intel's Go what the GPUs are to Nvidia's Drive PX 2 -- fast chips that will help cars make key decisions instantly. The version of Go with next-generation Atom chips has only one FPGA. The Go computer with 5G will be demonstrated at the upcoming Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Intel announced its first 5G modem at CES this week. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

It will also support faster wireless connectivity for mobile computing, gaming and multimedia use, the company said yesterday. Introduced yesterday ahead of the kick-off to CES 2017, which runs from Jan. 5 through Jan. 8, in Las Vegas, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 is made by Samsung using a new 10-nanometer design that could put new pressure on competitor Intel. Currently, the global microprocessor leader, Intel is still producing 14-nanometer-based chips, although the company said it expects to begin shipping 10-nanometer technology sometime this year. Qualcomm's new design for the Snapdragon 835 makes the SoC 35 percent smaller than the previous version, the Snapdragon 820. Combined with the Snapdragon 835's improved power profile, that means the new chip could enable significantly better battery life, charging, camera images and virtual reality applications for a range of devices, Qualcomm said. 835 To Appear in New Smart Glasses "[A]s we embark on a new era of intelligent, connected experiences, our mobile devices are going to need a new, one-of-a-kind processor that's smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient than any chipset in history," Francisco Cheng, Qualcomm's director of technical marketing, wrote yesterday on the company's Snapdragon blog. "Qualcomm Technologies' newest mobile SoC is designed to meet every one of these rigorous requirements while setting new standards in mobile performance." The architectural improvements in the Snapdragon 835 will pave the way for a new wave of capabilities in smartphones, virtual reality (VR) gear, Bluetooth devices, 4G connectivity and security-focused authentication, Cheng said. The improved computing power of the new SoC will also enable smarter and more dynamic machine learning applications, he added. One of the first VR devices to incorporate the Snapdragon 835 will be Osterhout Design Group's R-8 and R-9 smart glasses, both set to hit the market later this year. Unveiled at CES yesterday, the devices will allow wearers to view movies and videos, play games and read articles and books, among other uses. Improvements Across 5 Key Technologies Qualcomm said the Snapdragon 835 will help deliver improvements across five key technologies: battery life, virtual/augmented reality immersion, image and video capture, connectivity and security. One of the chip's new features, Qualcomm Haven, is a security platform that supports biometric authentication via fingerprint, eye and face-based imagery. The Snapdragon 835 also features an upgraded software framework for neural processing that will enable new machine learning capabilities, Qualcomm said. Original equipment manufacturers and software developers will be able to use these capabilities for "rich experiences such as intelligent photography, strong security and privacy protection, smart automobiles and personal assistants, and responsive and true-to-life VR and AR," Qualcomm said. Faster connectivity will be provided through the chip's new integrated Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, which can support download speeds of up to one gigabit per second and upload speeds of up to 150 megabits per second, Qualcomm said. The company added that the new Snapdragon is also the first certified commercial technology to support the latest Bluetooth 5 standard, which promises signficant improvements over the previous Bluetooth 4 range and connection speeds. In production now, the Snapdragon 835 will begin appearing in commercial devices hitting the market in the first half of this year, Qualcomm said.

Yahoo To Be Altaba after Buyout Next Article > Apple App Store Breaks Another Sales Record By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: JANUARY 05 2017 After a year in which its developers earned record-high revenues from app sales, Apple reported today that it broke another sales record on New Year's Day. Calling Sunday the "App Store's busiest day ever," Apple said customers spent $240 million in app purchases on the first day of 2017. The holiday shopping season was also Apple's busiest, with more than $3 billion in App Store sales in December, the company said. Introduced in 2008, Apple's App Store offers more than 2.2 million free and paid applications for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and other iOS devices. Developers of iOS apps, which include everything from games to software for workplace productivity, took in a record $20 billion in earnings last year, 40 percent more than in 2015, Apple said. Game Apps Led the Way Apple's App Store "shatters records on New Year's Day," senior vice president of worldwide marketing Philip Schiller noted this morning in a tweet announcing the company's latest sales figures. Those results suggest that "2017 is off to a great start," he said. The most-downloaded app on both Christmas and New Year's Day was Nintendo's Super Mario Run, which became available for iOS devices on Dec. 15, according to Apple. In the first four days after its release, the game was downloaded more than 40 million times. (The Android version isn't set to come out until later this year.) Apple's top grossing apps for the past year include Monster Strike, Fantasy Westward, Clash Royale and Pokémon Go. Other apps that led the year in downloads included Prisma, Reigns, Procreate, Lumino City, Sweat With Kayla and djay Pro. Fast Growth, but Limits, in China Over the past year, the number of apps available from Apple grew by more than 20 percent, with the U.S., China, Japan and the U.K. making up the top markets. China's App Store in particular saw dramatic growth in 2016, with activity expanding by 90 percent. Despite such growth, China also placed some limits on what iOS users there can and can't download. In fact, at the request of Chinese authorities, Apple removed both the English- and Chinese-language versions of the New York Times' iOS app from China's App Store in late December, The New York Times reported yesterday.. According to the New York Times, Apple's director of corporate communications Fred Sainz said his company was informed that the app was in violation of local regulations. "As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China," he said. In the fall, Apple also introduced several changes to its App Store guidelines and revenue splits for developers. Under a new subscription model launched in September, developers receive an extra cut from Apple's earnings when customers subscribe to their apps for more than one year. The top subscription apps for 2016 included Netflix, HBO Now, Line, Tinder and MLB.com at Bat. Subscription-based revenues at the App Store grew by 74 percent in 2016, reaching a total of $2.7 billion, according to Apple.

An In-Depth Look at Intel's Kaby Lake Next Article > AMD Spills Details on Vega, New Design for Virtually Unlimited Workloads PUBLISHED: JANUARY 10 2017 Today, AMD unveiled preliminary details of its forthcoming GPU architecture, Vega. Conceived and executed over 5 years, Vega architecture enables new possibilities in PC gaming, professional design and machine intelligence that traditional GPU architectures have not been able to address effectively. Data-intensive workloads are becoming the new normal, and the parallel nature of the GPU lends itself ideally to tackling them. However, processing these huge new datasets requires fast access to massive amounts of memory. The Vega architecture's revolutionary memory subsystem enables GPUs to address very large data sets spread across a mix of memory types. The high-bandwidth cache controller in Vega-based GPUs can access on-package cache and off-package memories in a flexible, programmable fashion using fine-grained data movement. "It is incredible to see GPUs being used to solve gigabyte-scale data problems in gaming to exabyte-scale data problems in machine intelligence. We designed the Vega architecture to build on this ability, with the flexibility to address the extraordinary breadth of problems GPUs will be solving not only today but also five years from now. Our high-bandwidth cache is a pivotal disruption that has the potential to impact the whole GPU market," said Raja Koduri, senior vice president and chief architect, Radeon Technologies Group, AMD. Highlights of the Vega GPU architecture's advancements include: -- The world's most advanced GPU memory architecture: The Vega architecture enables a new memory hierarchy for GPUs. This radical new approach comes in the form of a new high-bandwidth cache and its controller. The cache features leading-edge HBM2 technology which is capable of transferring terabytes of data every second, doubling the bandwidth-per-pin over the previous generation HBM technology. HBM2 also enables much greater capacity at less than half the footprint of GDDR5 memory. Vega architecture is optimized for streaming very large datasets and can work with a variety of memory types with up to 512TB of virtual address space. -- Next-generation geometry pipeline: Today's games and professional applications make use of incredibly complex geometry enabled by the extraordinary increase in the resolutions of data acquisition devices. The hundreds of millions of polygons in any given frame have meshes so dense that there are often many polygons being rendered per pixel. Vega's next-generation geometry pipeline enables the programmer to extract incredible efficiency in processing this complex geometry, while also delivering more than 200% of the throughput-per-clock over previous Radeon architectures. It also features improved load-balancing with an intelligent workload distributor to deliver consistent performance. -- Next-generation compute engine: At the core of the Vega architecture is a new, next-generation compute engine built on flexible compute units that can natively process 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit operations in each clock cycle. These compute units are optimized to attain significantly higher frequencies than previous generations and their support of variable datatypes makes the architecture highly versatile across workloads. -- Advanced pixel engine: The new Vega pixel engine employs a Draw Stream Binning Rasterizer, designed to improve performance and power efficiency. It allows for "fetch once, shade once" of pixels through the use of a smart on-chip bin cache and early culling of pixels invisible in a final scene. Vega's pixel engine is now a client of the onboard L2 cache, enabling considerable overhead reduction for graphics workloads which perform frequent read-after-write operations. GPU products based on the Vega architecture are expected to ship in the first half of 2017. © 2017 T-break Tech under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

THIS STORY Support every customer. Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Jef Cozza. Updated January 4, 2017 9:04AM SHARE ALSO SEE CES Intel Processor Chip Kaby Lake Hardware Laptops Desktops Enterprise IT Technology News Chipmaker Intel announced updates to its core CPU series yesterday, in preparation for the CES 2017 tradeshow in Las Vegas, which officially opens Jan 5. The announcement focused on launch of the remaining models in the 7th generation of its Intel Core processors. The addition of the desktop versions of the Kaby Lake processors should have plenty of appeal for enterprise clients thanks to improved performance, security, and graphics. The new CPUs feature several small improvements in efficiency and performance over Intel's previous Skylake models. Improved Integrated Graphics One of the key differences between Kaby Lake and Skylake is an upgraded video engine. This can be important for laptops that lack the space for a dedicated graphics card, but often has little impact on the desktop market where users can add a dedicated GPU. But most corporate customers aren't going to invest in separate graphics cards for their employees' desktops. For these buyers, the improved media engine offers the promise of improved graphics and video rendering performance during their next upgrade cycles without having to spend any extra cash on a GPU. "With the latest 7th Gen Intel Core vPro processors, business owners and IT managers can offer new PCs with up to 10 hours of battery life and a 65 percent increase in productivity when compared with a 5-year-old PC," Navin Shenoy (pictured above), senior vice president and general manager for the Client Computing Group at Intel, said in a statement about the launch. "And with many Millennials today taking technology into consideration when choosing their workplace, I'm confident the new 7th Gen Intel Core processor-based 2 in 1s and AIOs will delight them." Enhanced Security for Enterprises The new Kaby Lake chips make use of the same 14nm manufacturing process that Intel introduced with the launch of its Broadwell chips several years ago. Nevertheless, Intel is claiming that the new chips show a significant improvement in performance over the previous Skylake processors, with up to 20 percent improvement for performance and gaming notebooks and 25 percent for desktops. For 4K and 360-degree content, users can expect up to 65 percent faster performance on notebooks and 35 percent faster on desktops, the company said. But the biggest news for enterprise clients is likely the new improvements in security. The new chips feature several advances in hardware-enhanced security and two-factor authentication. The new processors feature Intel's hardware-based Authenticate multi-factor authentication solution. Authenticate verifies user identity using a combination of hardened factors such as a PIN, a Bluetooth signal from the user's phone or a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint, making employee logins many times more secure than traditional password logins. The new integrated graphics engine and hardwired security features of the Kaby Lake chips will likely make it appealing to businesses that were already looking to replace their aging IT infrastructures.

Hackers Release Malware Tools WhatsApp Has Exploitable Bug AMD Spills Details on Vega GPU Atlassian Buys Trello for $425 Million An In-Depth Look at Intel's Kaby Lake Next Article > Atlassian To Acquire Project Management Firm Trello for $425M By Shirley Siluk / Top Tech News. Updated January 09, 2017. By acquiring the fast-growing project management firm Trello for $425 million, collaboration software provider Atlassian said today that it expects to fill a gap in its own offerings for workplace teams. The deal also brings together two companies with a shared goal: to put their tools into the hands of 100 million users, according to Atlassian. Atlassian co-founder and co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes said Trello's visually based system for managing everything from family projects to Red Cross emergency responses fills a gap between two of Atlassian's tools: JIRA for structured workflows and Confluence for "free-form" collaboration. Trello's key strength is its system for "capturing and adding structure to fluid, fast-forming work," he added. Launched five years ago, the customer base for Trello's cloud-based collaboration tools nearly doubled over the past year to 19 million users. Atlassian, meanwhile, has also grown rapidly via a series of 18 acquisitions since its founding, with six new additions, including Trello, which is the largest, in a little over two years. Trello Users Include Google, UN "Trello will become an important part of the Atlassian portfolio, offering a fun new way for teams to organize the often messy range of information that feeds into great teamwork," Cannon-Brookes wrote in a company blog post today. "Its card system is intuitive, easy to use, and instantly familiar, which has made it extremely popular with teams across marketing, legal, HR, sales and beyond." Among Trello's wide-ranging customer base are users that include Google, Kickstarter, National Geographic, PayPal, Pixar, the Red Cross, the U.K. government and the United Nations. Developed by Fog Creek Software in 2010, Trello spun out as an independent company in 2014 backed by $10.3 million in venture capital funding. "As part of Atlassian, Trello will be able to leverage investments in R&D that will enhance the product in meaningful ways," Trello CEO Michael Pryor said today in a post on his company's blog. "Our team will be able to focus on improving the core experience of Trello for all users." Continuing as Standalone Service Expected to close by late March, the Atlassian acquisition of Trello is being paid for with around $360 million in cash, with the rest covered through the exchange of shares and share units. Atlassian said Trello will likely continue operating as a "standalone service" after the deal is completed. Cannon-Brookes said Atlassian will begin working with Trello's product team to help the company speed up its development efforts. Pryor added that Trello's service will also continue integrating its offering with other collaboration tools, including Atlassian's Confluence, JIRA and HipChat. Acquired by Atlassian in 2012, HipChat is a Web-based service for team chats and instant messaging. The new Trello integrations for Atlassian's services will be available to users through Atlassian's enterprise software marketplace in the near future, according to Cannon-Brookes. Atlassian said it expects to provide additional details about the Trello acquisition when it releases its next quarterly report on Jan. 19.

The company looks to be trying to get a head start on competitors with 5G, the next big mobile connectivity standard, by giving manufacturers a way to test 5G in their upcoming products. While there's been no publicly agreed upon standard for 5G networks as yet, Intel is helping things along with its latest modem, and is likely hoping to become a major supplier for 5G technology in the future. Related: CES 2017 Recently, the company has been making investments in drones and self-driving cars, two products that could benefit from 5G tech. And when it comes to self-driving cars, Intel's previously announced partnership with BMW and Mobileye will soon yield a fleet of 40 test vehicles, which will hit the road in the second half of 2017. The companies announced the project at CES in Las Vegas, following the announcement of their partnership back in July. Related: What is 5G? A BMW engineer works on an autonomous system The three firms say they have already developed a “scalable architecture” for autonomous driving – a technology they hope will eventually be used by other manufacturers and developers. Intel says the system is scalable because it can be used either as discreet modules at the most basic level or an entire autonomous driving system. The project to test 40 vehicles will, according to BMW, be carried out “globally under real traffic conditions," though just where the tests will take place remains unclear. Related: Who's to blame when robot cars get it wrong? Explaining the benefits of the partnership, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said: “From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform. "The car to cloud system will perform with consistent, predictable behavior and is validated to the highest level of safety. “That’s why this partnership is breaking new ground. We have established a dedicated team with clear, shared goals and a culture of innovation and agility and accountability.” Intel, BMW, and Mobileye say they plan to release hardware samples and software updates in the upcoming years.

The German automaker will put 40 of its 7-Series sedans on the road and train them to drive in urban areas, Klaus Froehlich, BMW’s head of development, said in an interview. The goal is to apply the gathered data toward producing the iNext, which will supplant the 7-Series as the BMW brand’s flagship model and be capable of full autonomy four years from now. BMW engineer, André Mueller does an automated driving technology check. Photo: BMW Automakers and technology companies are rushing to form partnerships to compete against the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which has clocked 2 million self-driving miles on public roads, and Tesla Motors Inc., with 1.3 billion miles of data from Autopilot-equipped vehicles. BMW is appealing to other carmakers to adopt its approach to help shoulder research costs, speed development by sharing data and ensure they don’t become also-rans. “Those who reach the finish line before you will have their tech become the basis of standardization,” Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s co-founder and chief technology officer, said in an interview. “This is why sharing is important.” Enabling vehicles to navigate without human input through cities requires them to see and understand complex situations more like people do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye brings expertise in cameras that model the surroundings while Santa Clara, California-based Intel wields computing capabilities to power artificial intelligence. The companies released details Wednesday in conjunction with CES 2017, the consumer-technology show in Las Vegas. Costly Technologies “At the beginning, I think only premium cars will be able to afford such technology – huge numbers of sensors in the car – so I think we will be the drivers anyway,” Froehlich said. “If everybody would use the same network, it will be best.” Carmakers could participate by buying sensors to install in their cars, or go deeper with equipment that helps crowd-source data from an autonomous-vehicle fleet, said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of Intel’s Automated Driving Division. While Munich-based BMW’s main target is individual car owners, the technology will be available for ride-sharing fleets as well, Froehlich said. Auto manufacturers are pushing into so-called mobility services like car-sharing and ride-hailing to counter alternatives to private vehicle ownership. Partnerships Form BMW, which co-owns the DriveNow car-sharing venture with Sixt SE, will be jockeying for consumers’ attention against the likes of Uber Technologies Inc., Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, among others. Google, which separated its self-driving car project into a new unit called Waymo last month, plans to start a ride-sharing service using semi-autonomous minivans made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV as soon as the end of 2017. VW is rolling out Moia, a new division that will focus on ride-sharing. Revenue from car-sharing is projected to surge more than sevenfold to 4.7 billion euros ($4.9 billion) by 2021, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group Inc. Robo-taxis will make up 40 percent of automotive profits by 2030, more than selling vehicles to individuals, according to consulting company Roland Berger. Copyright 2017 Bloomberg.

The new Trident Z modules come in 8 GB and 16 GB sizes and are rated for operations at data rates beyond 3600 MT/s per pin. For Intel’s Kaby Lake and Z270 launch, G.Skill now offers various dual-channel kits with 16 GB (2×8 GB), 32 GB (4×8 GB, 2×16 GB) and 64 GB (4×16 GB) capacities designed to run in DDR4-3600, DDR4-3866, DDR4-4000, DDR4-4133 and DDR4-4266 modes at 1.35 V or 1.4 V (the top-of-the-range kit only). Due to rather high data rates, the new Trident Z kits come with rather looser CL17, CL18 or even CL19 timings. The modules support XMP 2.0 technology that simplifies setting of correct sub-timings on platforms that support this feature. For about a year now G.Skill has been using Samsung’s 8 Gb B-die ICs for its high-end DDR4 memory modules. Keeping in mind that companies tend to be cautious with new platforms and memory controllers, it is not surprising that the new DIMMs designed for the brand new CPUs are based on familiar chips made using 20 nm process technology. G.Skill's Memory Modules Designed for Intel's Kaby Lake Platform Speed CL Timing Voltage Kit Configuration Kit Capacity DDR4-3600 CL17 19-19-39 1.35 V 2×16 GB 4×16 GB 32 GB 64 GB DDR4-3866 CL18 19-19-39 2×8 GB 4×8 GB 16 GB 32 GB DDR4-3866 CL18 18-18-38 2×16 GB 32 GB DDR4-4000 CL18 19-19-39 2×8 GB 4×8 GB 16 GB 32 GB DDR4-4133 CL19 19-19-39 2×8 GB 16 GB DDR4-4133 CL19 21-21-41 4×8 GB 32 GB DDR4-4266 CL19 19-19-39 1.4 V 2×8 GB 16 GB Initially G.Skill will offer Kaby Lake-optimized memory modules with its regular aluminum heat spreaders, but eventually the company will expand the lineup with DIMMs featuring RGB lighting and other enhancements. G.Skill has tested its new memory modules (DDR4-4133 32 GB kit to be exact) on the ASUS ROG Maximus IX Formula motherboard and the Intel Core i5-7600K processor to ensure compatibility with the new CPUs, but everything should work on other Kaby Lake/Z270 configurations that plan to support high speed memory. Newegg already sells G.Skill’s Kaby Lake-optimized 16 GB DDR4-4266 memory kits (F4-4266C19D-16GTZ series) for $229.99. Other modules will hit the market shortly from now and more retailers will follow. Source: G.Skill Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

Revealing this at a podium discussion held during a joint press conference at CES, the companies further explained that the BMW 7 Series will employ cutting-edge Intel and Mobileye technologies during global trials starting in the U.S. and Europe. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170104005906/en/ This news follows the partnership that was announced between the BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye in July of last year. The companies have since developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to pursue state of the art designs and create differentiated brands. The offerings scale from individual key integrated modules to a complete end-to-end solution providing a wide range of differentiated consumer experiences. "Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye. This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles. Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies – manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies – to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform. This year our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle,” stated Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development. “From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform. The car to cloud system will perform with consistent, predictable behavior and is validated to the highest level of safety,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “That’s why this partnership is breaking new ground. We have established a dedicated team with clear, shared goals and a culture of innovation and agility and accountability.” “Over the last six months, we have made very good progress in designing a state-of-the-art solution for autonomous driving on both highways and in urban areas. The solution has been defined in a scalable manner to allow affiliate automakers to meet their unique needs,” said Mobileye Co-Founder, Chairman and CTO Professor Amnon Shashua. As part of this partnership, the BMW Group will be responsible for driving control and dynamics, evaluation of overall functional safety including setting up a high performance simulation engine, overall component integration, production of prototypes and eventually scaling the platform via deployment partners. Intel brings to the partnership innovative high performance computing elements that span from the vehicle to the data center. The newly launched Intel® GO™ solution for autonomous driving offers world class processor and FPGA technologies for the most efficient balance of performance and power, while meeting the stringent thermal and safety requirements of the automotive industry. Within the car, the Intel GO solution offers a scalable development and compute platform for critical functions including sensor fusion, driving policy, environment modeling, path planning and decision making. In the data center, Intel GO offers a wide range of technologies ranging from the high performance Intel® Xeon® processors, to Intel® Arria® 10 FPGAs and Intel® Solid State Drives to the Intel® Nervana™ platform for artificial intelligence that provides a powerful machine and deep learning training and simulation infrastructure required for the autonomous driving industry. Mobileye contributes its proprietary EyeQ®5 high-performance computer vision processor offering automotive-grade functional safety and low-power performance. The EyeQ®5 is responsible for processing and interpretation of input from the 360-degree surround view vision sensors as well as localization. EyeQ®5, in combination with Intel CPU and FPGA technologies, forms the Central Computing Platform to be integrated into each autonomous vehicle. Mobileye will further collaborate with the BMW Group to develop the sensor fusion solution, creating a full model of the environment surrounding the vehicle, using input from vision, radar, and lidar sensors. As well as establishing a driving policy, including Mobileye’s reinforcement learning algorithms used to endow the vehicle system with the artificial intelligence required to safely negotiate complex driving situations. To further propel the development of the autonomous platform, the partnership plans to release hardware samples and software updates in the upcoming years. The BMW iNEXT model, which will be introduced in 2021, will be the foundation for BMW Group’s autonomous driving strategy. Following this vehicle, a range of highly automated models from all BMW Group brands will follow. Link to live streaming of the joint press conference will be available on Facebook and on the BMW Group website: http://www.live.bmwgroup.com. This will be available as replay as well. #futureofdriving2021 #bmwintelmobileye About BMW Group With its three brands BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce, the BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

It fumbled a chance for its wares to be in Apple's first iPhone, and then quit making its Atom smartphone chip to focus on modems. But the company is now set to ship a groundbreaking modem that will deliver data-transfer rates many times faster than most wired internet connections. The chipmaker will start shipping its first 5G modem for testing in the second half this year. Beyond mobile devices, the modem could also be used in autonomous cars, servers, base stations, networking equipment, drones, robots, and other internet-of-things devices. In name, 5G is the successor to 4G in today's mobile devices, but it's significantly faster and more versatile. It will combine multiple wireless high-speed and low-bandwidth technologies and enable communications across an array of spectrum bands. New 5G networks are expected to be deployed starting in 2020. The Intel 5G Modem, as it's called, is designed to provide download speeds in excess of 5Gbps, which is five times faster than today's fastest 4G modem. It's also five times faster than Google Fiber, which offers speeds of up to 1Gbps. But don't expect the modem to be installed in smartphones immediately. It will be used mainly for testing on 5G network deployments. It will also be used to test possible 5G applications, still being explored in areas like automotive tech. The benefits of 5G are enormous. Download and upload speeds will go up for devices like drones, robots, smart devices, and industrial equipment. Faster networks will help autonomous cars communicate over long distances about weather and road conditions.  The technology will improve mobile health-care services, which need reliable connections for patient monitoring. It will also help IoT devices remain in constant contact with servers running analytics. Intel believes as wireless becomes ubiquitous, there will be more opportunities to put its 5G modems in devices. The 5G Modem is a big move for Intel when its mobile chip future was in question after many false starts. Intel's effort to put Atom chips into smartphones was a colossal failure, and the company wasted billions of dollars on the lost cause. Last year, it bailed out of the smartphone chip market and refocused on modems. Apple will reportedly use Intel's 4G modems in its next iPhone, and that's a major win for the company. Apple also uses modems from Qualcomm, which is considered ahead of Intel in modem technology. Qualcomm announced its first 5G modem, the Snapdragon X50, in October. Intel is slowly catching up, but Qualcomm also has the advantage by integrating high-speed modems inside its Snapdragon chips that power smartphones. Intel does not plan to offer Atom chips for smartphones anytime soon, though it has hinted that it could make such chips if opportunities arise. Intel until now provided FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) that could be programmed to mimic modems. But the 5G Modem will be needed to obtain results from real-world testing. The new 5G technology will be important for autonomous cars, which may make driving decisions by consulting remote servers to recognize objects, signs, and lights, said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of the automated driving division at Intel. Intel also announced autonomous vehicle development kits ready for 5G at CES. Intel is also building an autonomous car with BMW and Mobileye that could be ready to hit the streets by 2021. It's possible that Intel will put its 5G modem in that car. Intel's 5G Modem supports the sub-6GHz band, where cellular networks typically operate. It also supports the 28GHz millimeter-wave band, which should enable deployment trials in U.S., South Korea, and Japan, Intel said. The 28GHz band allows for faster data transfers and is expected to be used for 5G networks.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: BUSINESS BMW, Mobileye, and Intel will test 40 self-driving cars on U.S. and European roads in 2017 Paul Sawers@psawers January 4, 2017 9:07 AM Tags: BMW, CES 2017, Intel, mobileye, top-stories Above: BMW BMW is planning to put 40 autonomous test cars on public roads in the second half of 2017, as the race to capitalize on the burgeoning self-driving car industry intensifies. The German luxury car maker teamed up with chip giant Intel and Mobileye, an Israeli computer vision company specializing in building driverless car technology, back in July when they first announced plans to put self-driving cars into full production by 2021. Speaking at a joint press conference at CES 2017 in Las Vegas, the three firms revealed that BMW 7 vehicles will “employ cutting-edge Intel and Mobileye technologies” as part of the trials that will take place in the U.S. and in Europe. In addition to their collaboration, the companies revealed that they have developed a “scalable architecture” that can be used by other carmakers — so in effect they’re working on a white-label platform that can be used by other brands. “This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles,” explained Klaus Fröhlich, member of the management board at BMW AG for Development. “Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies — manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies — to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform. This year our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions.” BMW first revealed its plans for self-driving cars last May when it discussed a futuristic concept car called the iNext, which it touted as its “innovation driver” for autonomous driving. And it’s the iNext that will form the building blocks of its autonomous driving strategy. “This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle,” continued Fröhlich. We’re starting to see a significant degree of collaboration between the automotive and technology industries — car companies typically don’t have the technological smarts to build self-driving cars, while technology companies don’t have the automotive capabilities. So partnerships like the one we’re seeing between BMW, Intel, and Mobileye is to be expected — self-driving cars will drive demand for high-end chips, which is where Intel comes into play. And self-driving cars need to be able to understand their environment, which is where Mobileye will help. That the trio is opening the platform to other companies also reveals that the race is on to become one of the default platforms powering the self-driving car industry. “From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform,” added Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “The car-to-cloud system will perform with consistent, predictable behavior and is validated to the highest level of safety. That’s why this partnership is breaking new ground.  We have established a dedicated team with clear, shared goals and a culture of innovation and agility and accountability.” We saw a number of notable developments in the autonomous car realm last year. The world’s first public self-driving taxi service hit Singapore roads in August, courtesy of NuTonomy, with Uber following suit a month later in Pittsburgh. Uber’s foray into San Francisco in December was short-lived, however, with the company conceding defeat in its battle with California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.
