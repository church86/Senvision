The investors were Intel Capital, SET Ventures and Nest. PRESS RELEASE Elmodis, an Industrial IoT (IIoT) startup based in Poland, has raised USD 4.9 million from Intel Capital, SET Ventures, and current investor Innovation Nest. The company will use the investment proceeds to scale production, increase development, and expand their commercial and technical team in Kraków, Poland. Elmodis provides an integrated hardware and cloud based software solution that monitors the performance of industrial machines powered by electric motors in real time, based on electric parameters. Connected directly to machine’s electric motor, Elmodis’ solution detects malfunctions and calculates savings for optimal working conditions. Elmodis’ solution helps Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) reduce warranty repair costs and ultimately build better products. It also provides value to end-users such as plants operating in various industries, by helping them optimize their energy consumption and prevent failures from incorrect usage. Contemporary monitoring systems based on vibration and temperature measurement technology have limited applications and can be expensive to install. By contrast, the Elmodis system, is easy to install, and can be applied to any existing or new machine powered by electric motor. Poland is currently Elmodis’ key market, but it is also working with Palo Alto based Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to introduce the technology to the US. Elmodis technology taps into an expanding Industrial IoT (“IIoT”) market, which is estimated to reach USD 195.47 Billion by 2022. Investment activity in this space is accelerating, with 321 deals and USD 2.2 billion invested in IIoT startups in 2016, according to CB Insights. Quotes Marcin Hejka (Vice President of Intel Capital and Managing Director of Greater Europe and India): “The exponential growth in the number of smart, connected devices and machines isgenerating a flood of data that is driving innovation and growth across industries. As new IoT technologies are implemented, smart factories are pumping out massive amounts of data to the data center and cloud that can be analyzed and acted on to generate financial and operational efficiency improvements. Within this virtuous cycle, we are investing in companies like Elmodis, whose Industrial IoT solutions have great potential to impact the way smart factories of the future operate. We look forward to working with Elmodis to bring its end-to-end solutions to a broader range of applications and accelerate adoption of IoT” Marek Kapturkiewicz (Partner, Innovation Nest): “Elmodis is a company with a fantastic product and great potential. The fourth industrial revolution is not the matter of future, it’s here and already influencing many crucial processes in various industries. Elmodis is a part of this huge shift led by connected sensors and big data analytics techniques. Thanks to this investment, they will be able to continue growth in Poland and start venturing to foreign markets too.” Rene Savelsberg (CEO, SET Ventures): “Machines are responsible for a very large part of electricity consumption in the industry. Elmodis provides unique data and insights that enable significant improvements of energy efficiency. As a fund, we are very excited about the possibilities of data-driven approach in this area.” Artur Hanc (CEO and co-founder, Elmodis): “From the very moment when we started fundraising, we decided we wanted smart money in the round i.e. investors who understand our business and can make a difference with their support.

Get smart about the red-hot computer chip designer. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Apr 15, 2017 at 1:31PM Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have absolutely crushed the market recently, soaring 366% higher in the last 52 weeks. You may know the company as an eternal foil to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the market for PC processors, and AMD's duels with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the graphics chip sector are also the stuff of legend. The company currently shows negative profits but positive cash flows, and management hopes to have found a path back to sustainable black ink on the bottom line. Analysts tend to agree, painting a picture of healthy sales growth with a side of positive and rising profits over the next two years. That's a snapshot of AMD's headline news. Here's a handful of facts that might be unfamiliar to many AMD investors. Image source: AMD. 1. From early days to the golden age One year after Intel's founding fathers left Fairchild Semiconductor to start their own pioneering business, AMD's founders followed suit. Eight former Fairchild engineers and executives struck out on their own, under the helm of CEO Jerry Sanders. AMD shares started selling on the NYSE exchange in 1979. Just three years after that, IBM (NYSE:IBM) reached out to secure a second source of processors for its recently launched PC systems. Working under an Intel license for x86 technologies, this became AMD's mainstay business for the next 35 years. By 1995, AMD's K5 and K6 processors were putting significant pressure on Intel's PC market stature. The chips offered competitive performance at a much lower price point, forcing Intel to adjust its own pricing strategies. In 1997, AMD presented its first Athlon processor. The company introduced many industry-first innovations over the next few years, like the first 64-bit x86 processor, the first dual-core PC processor, and the energy-saving PowerNow! and Cool'n'Quiet technologies. These were the days where AMD had Intel paying defense, catching up to AMD's innovations rather than the other way around. AMD CEO Lisa Su. Image source: AMD. 2. Back to engineering 101 Jerry Sanders served as AMD's CEO for the first 33 years. On his retirement, the executive suite saw a flurry of four new CEOs in 12 years. Current corporate leader Lisa Su brought AMD back to a technical focus that some of her recent, more business-oriented predecessors had lacked. During her doctorate work in electrical engineering at MIT, she advanced the idea of silicon-on-insulator chip-building technologies that AMD uses today. Taking the helm in 2014, Su quickly established a new company strategy with a heavy focus on developing new technology to address growing markets. She had been pushing for such changes from the senior VP level, starting in 2012. Five years ago, some 90% of AMD's total sales were designed for use in PC systems. Su wants about half of her company's revenue to come from other markets such as gaming consoles and embedded systems, and had reached a 60-40 split between PC and non-PC sales by 2015. 3. AMD is not a chipmaker Once upon a time, AMD built its own microprocessors in company-owned factories. A long-standing manufacturing research partnership with IBM helped to keep those chipmaking operations going. But things have changed. Investment groups from Abu Dhabi started building ownership in AMD in 2007, and right at the darkest days of the 2008 financial crisis, that relationship led to AMD's manufacturing operations spinning off into a joint venture called GlobalFoundries. While the rest of the world seemed stopped in its financial tracks, AMD shares surged 30% in a single day on this news. GlobalFoundries still counts AMD as its largest customer, but now operates as a completely separate business with plenty of supply contracts with other chip designers. The manufacturing spinoff gave AMD a fighting chance to survive as Intel retook its throne while market conditions started to shift away from PC systems. The balance sheet lightened immensely when the GlobalFoundries separation closed in 2010. AMD used the funds from that deal to pay down debt balances, and annual interest payments took a deep dive. Without the GlobalFoundries transaction, AMD probably wouldn't have survived this far. So AMD is now a fab-less chip designer, and better off for it. AMD doesn't do this anymore. Image source: Getty Images. 4. Stock moves AMD was a member of the S&P 500 index back in the Athlon-and-K6 heyday. The stock was dropped from that prestigious index in 2013 due to a plunging market cap, falling back to the lesser S&P MidCap 400 index instead. As of March 2017, AMD is back in the big leagues. The stock replaced crumbling retailer Urban Outfitters before the opening bell on March 20. At the time, AMD investors could look back at one-year share price gains of 390% while Urban Outfitters suffered a 30% haircut over the same period. Lisa Su is one of just 30 female CEOs among the 500 index members today. That's up from 23 female leaders two years ago, but the S&P 500 club is still hardly a model of gender equality. In other stock-related news, AMD spent 33 years on the New York Stock Exchange before jumping to the Nasdaq exchange in December 2014. Then-CFO Devinder Kumar described the move as a way to align the company more closely with other technology businesses on that exchange, and also to provide better lines of communication with investors. But the NYSE charges significantly higher listing fees than the Nasdaq, and AMD can use every penny of cost-cutting it can get -- especially when the business of developing and selling computer chips doesn't suffer from the change. 5. AMD's first ARM chips The company has worked strictly within the Intel-compatible x86 world for decades, supplemented by graphics processors. Competing processor architectures from ARM Holdings -- now a part of the SoftBank Group -- were always more of a threat than an opportunity. That started to change in 2012. AMD secured a license to design an ARM-based processor, immediately inserted ARM-based solutions to handle security tasks in mobile processors, and announced that ARM-style server chips would be cut from whole AMD cloth as soon as 2014. Of course, Lisa Su was on stage for that announcement in her capacity as global products manager at the time. Her fingerprints are all over this project. It took a bit longer than that, but AMD did indeed launch its first ARM-powered server processor in 2016. The AMD Opteron A1100 puts eight high-end ARM cores together with enterprise features like built-in high-speed networking, fast access to system data via 8 PCI-Express lanes, and support for large quantities of DDR4 memory with error correction. It's a new system-building option for server manufacturers, offering low power consumption and a performance profile tuned for managing massive amounts of data transfer. The target market here is cloud-based storage platforms, and the Opteron A1100 series also works well as the storage-management component of a multisystem big data analysis solution.

Bob Taylor, outside his home in Woodside, Calif., in 1999. (THE MORNING CALL/FILE PHOTO) Katie WangOf The Morning Call PUBLISHED ON NOV. 21, 1999 —It is a land of gold, where dreams are digital, money is plentiful and dotcom is a way of life. Millionaires abound, money talks and gridlock traffic, a daily yet accepted nuisance, crawls slowly every day along the threads of freeways that stitch San Francisco to San Jose. Nestled between the two cities is a treasure chest of high-tech companies in homogeneous glass offices set against naked, sun-baked mountains. The company names are familiar: Intel, Cisco Systems, Apple Computers, Lucent Technologies, Hewlett-Packard. And every day, new, unfamiliar start-up enterprises join the veteran giants of this 50-mile stretch known as Silicon Valley, the epicenter of the technological world. The region, once dotted with prune and apricot trees, is the heart of the transistor and microprocessor industries, devices that have made people's lives move faster and easier in the 20th century.

(Kristine Phillips) During the 1980s, a decade where Americans shifted toward the Reagan right, greed and yuppies raged and corporations downsized, microprocessors spurred a technological surge that produced wonders such as the fax machine, voice mail and videocassette recorder. The sleek compact disc, with a smoother, digital sound, replaced muffled audio cassettes. Cellular phones provided convenience and accessibility to a society always on the go. Atari, a Silicon Valley-based company, sold tens of millions of colorful video games for home, creating a generation labeled "X" with an appetite for fast, flashy entertainment.

According to his son Kurt Taylor, the scientist died Thursday at his home in the San Francisco Bay Area town of Woodside. He suffered from Parkinson's disease and other... (Esmeralda Bermudez) The defining moment of the technology boom occurred in 1984, when Apple Computers, a Silicon Valley company, introduced the Macintosh personal computer. Life hasn't been the same since. The user-friendly Macintosh connected people to computers in a way they had never been linked before. Instead of using complicated programming language, people could use a palm-size tool called a mouse and click on desktop images on their monitor. Americans were transported into a world of spreadsheets, word processing and computer games. The personal computer revolutionized the workplace, creating new skills for employees to master, but making it easier for them to perform daily tasks. Budget reports, address lists and memos could be typed, saved to a disc and faxed to another office thousands of miles away. E-mail provided a new means to keep in touch, replacing phone calls and handwritten letters for some. But there was a price to pay. The accelerated pace made the workplace and society more stressful, cutting into family time, said Keith Gardiner, a Lehigh University professor. While technology blossomed, the 1980s was also the decade America witnessed its worst space disaster, when the space shuttle Challenger exploded into a fireball, killing all seven people aboard. It was a somber reminder that even with all the technological advances, man was not invincible. Still, Americans churned ahead, embracing as many new gadgets as they could. Technology's magic touched everything from entertainment, with hit movies such as "Back to the Future," to the medical world, where the first artificial heart transplant took place. At the center of the boom is Silicon Valley, a hotbed for tech companies. The region, with its fusion of brains, money and energy, set the benchmark for technological growth in one area. Other places, including the Lehigh Valley, have tried to emulate its success. Today, Silicon Valley is a destination point for ebullient, fresh-faced entrepreneurs who arrive with an Internet start-up plan in one hand and a Palm Pilot in the other. A 1980s spirit of greed prevails in this area where people ask when you will make your first million, not if. Transiency is accepted, if not encouraged, as people such as John Lilly, a 28-year-old former Apple employee, break away from their companies to start their own. Lilly is one of the lucky ones. His company, Reactivity, a consulting firm that spins out start-ups, is up and running in less than two years since its conception. Chances are, though, that most start-ups will not succeed because of intense competition. But failure is hardly a blemish in the valley of opportunity, where 19,400 jobs were added in 1998. Nearly every day, a new company shapes the landscape, drawing more people to the area, outpacing residential development and making the valley one of the most expensive places to live. "We're in the richest county in the richest state in the richest country of the world," said Tod Browndorf, chief operating officer of Pacific NetSoft, a Silicon Valley head-hunting firm. "If you want to be part of the way the world turns, this is where you need to be." ALL WIRED TOGETHER, PORTOLA VALLEY residents Kaiti Malloy and her husband, Scot, own three lap top computers, a personal computer, a fax machine, two cell phones that also double as pagers, a digital satellite dish and a portable MP3 player. Kaiti plans on purchasing a Palm Pilot, a hand-held computerized version of a daily planner, and Scot, a Bethlehem native, is going to trade his cell phone for one with a PDA, or Personal Digital Assistant, the equivalent of a personal computer on a telephone. Their home, as wired as an electronics store, is typical in Silicon Valley. It's filled with enough gadgets to guarantee they will never lose touch with the world. "With the exception of when I'm on vacation, I feel lost without at least one PC and Internet access," said Scot Malloy, who works at Reactivity. Tiny gadgets are what make the valley spin. Drivers chat on cell phones while zipping along freeways in their daily commute. A trip to Fryes Electronics, a technology superstore, is a family outing. It would be rare to find someone without a cell phone, pager or Palm Pilot. "When people work in the industry that produces the technology, they're much more likely to have that technology," said June A. English-Lucek, an anthropology professor at San Jose State University. But the gadgets have created a frenetic society. "There's more pressure to deliver, there's more deadlines," said Gardiner, who only recently purchased an answering machine. The pressure could grow as technology becomes smarter and more sophisticated. General Motors has announced it will equip cars with voice-activated Internet access, which could connect drivers to e-mail even behind the wheel. In San Francisco, some taxis are furnished with a lap top computer so passengers can surf the Web while stuck in traffic. Browndorf, of Pacific NetSoft, spends at least six hours a day connected to some sort of electronic device. Relatively speaking, he is barely wired, but has the basics -- cell phone and personal computer. "I hate the feeling that someone wants to inform me of something and I can't be reached," he said. Even with all their gadgets, the Malloys say they aren't nearly as wired as some of their friends who also own digital cameras, scanners and multiple personal computers. The couple uses the personal computer to bank, pay bills, shop and send e-mail. This year, Scot Malloy, 34, plans to purchase all of his Christmas gifts online. His latest techno gadget is the "Diamond Rio," a portable MP3 player, a personal music player that is smaller than a cigarette pack and plays sound files from computers. The fax machine, once considered revolutionary, gets the least use. "Usually it's only needed when dealing with old, established and somewhat out-of-date companies that haven't discovered e-mail yet," he said. BUILDING BLOCKS The one-car garage sits 10 feet behind a brown-shingled Palo Alto house, sectioned off by a chain and a tiny sign warning people to "Keep Out." In the front yard is an inconspicuous plaque, marking the garage as the birthplace of Silicon Valley. The garage, where Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard started their computer company, is symbolic -- a testimony that great things can grow out of small places. It is an entrepreneurial spirit that generations of Silicon Valley technology companies have adopted since Hewlett-Packard formed in 1938 -- each company building upon each others' innovations. These building blocks paved the way for the personal computer revolution. "HP has always been innovation-oriented and organized in small work groups that are fast and flexible like start-up companies," said John Young, Hewlett-Packard's chief executive officer from 1979 to 1992. Despite the plaque at the garage, Hewlett-Packard never worked with silicon in the 1930s, the material used in most semiconductors, but the garage is the model for so many entrepreneurs. Unused, it is a draw for gawking tourists who visit daily. A management company owns and rents out the house. The last set of renters moved out because tourists barraged them from dusk until dawn. Palo Alto also is considered the heart of Silicon Valley, because it is home to Stanford University, which feeds hundreds of graduates to the tech world annually. Hewlett and Packard are two of the school's most famous alumnae. The university also was a reason why so many tech companies moved to the region during the '50s and '60s. In 1968, Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce launched a business called Intel. The company carved computer chips out of silicon, a grainy, sandy material that, next to oxygen, is the most abundant element on earth. Intel designed the microprocessor, a complex chip that could perform 60,000 calculations in one second, in 1971. By the end of that decade, engineers were able to squeeze more transistors, a tiny switch that is almost invisible, on a chip. These transistors make microprocessors operate faster and more efficiently. THE BOOM Jamis MacNiven, a boisterous, animated contractor was working on a renovation job in 1980 at a two-story house in Los Gatos. MacNiven asked the homeowner what he did for a living. "I own a computer company," the man replied. "What's that? MacNiven asked. "Punch cards or something?" The homeowner was Steve Jobs, a 25-year-old, bespectacled computer geek who started tinkering with computers, also in his garage, in the 1970s. The company was a burgeoning enterprise called Apple Computers. During the 1980s, it topped the personal computer industry, tumbled, and is now trying to stage a comeback. Today, Jobs and MacNiven are both entrenched in the Silicon Valley scene -- Jobs by choice, MacNiven by circumstance. MacNiven owns Buck's, a popular Woodside family-style restaurant where venture capitalists strike million-dollar deals over breakfast burritos and silver dollar pancakes. The restaurant is a watering hole for entrepreneurs. Jobs is back in charge of Apple, after being ousted in 1985. Apple recently introduced a colorful new line of personal computers called the iMac, a long way from the primitive single-board computers that the company first built. The legendary garage where Jobs and Steve Wozniak, a former Hewlett-Packard employee, started their company in 1976, sits unmarked on Crist Lane in Los Altos. But like the Hewlett Packard garage, it is a magnet for tourists. Jobs "is an authentic genius," MacNiven said, sitting in his restaurant before the dinner rush. "He really did good." The story of how Apple began is well documented. Jobs and Wozniak started with pocket change and an order to manufacture 50 single-board computers at $500 apiece. Around this time, in 1981, IBM introduced its personal computer using Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system. The company formed a partnership with Bill Gates, who like Jobs, was trying to make his mark in the computer world. Apple released three computers before unveiling the Lisa computer in 1983, the first commercially sold computer with a graphical user interface. The Lisa computer was unique because of its icons and pop-up menus, making it easier for people to use, but it flopped because it cost an unaffordable $10,000. The company was looking to rebound. Coincidentally, Jobs was invited by managers at Xerox to visit the company's premier research center, called Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. The center is the birthplace of the laser printer and the first work station, the Alto. Xerox never sold the Alto commercially. Legend has it that Jobs conceived the idea for the Macintosh after seeing the Alto. Xerox officials had invited Jobs there because it was interested in investing in promising small companies. Jobs asked to see the computer science laboratory, but Xerox PARC researchers objected out of fear of giving away trade secrets. Corporate managers in New York ordered the employees to allow Jobs in. "It was a stupid thing to do -- I couldn't believe it happened," said Bob Taylor, director of the computer science division at that time. As fate would have it, Taylor was out of town the day Jobs visited. Otherwise, he said, he would've refused to let the Apple CEO in. The Mac made its debut in grand fashion as a Super Bowl commercial, single-handedly igniting the personal computer revolution. The spot played off George Orwell's "1984" and featured the destruction of Big Brother with the Mac. That year, at least half a million units sold at $2,500 each. The Mac was the first computer to put text and graphics on the same page. Today, the iMac costs $999. Office dynamics changed. The service sector -- people who typed letters and compiled budget reports -- were no longer in as high demand because the computer made it easier for middle management to handle those tasks. "Ask any secretary what her work is like (compared to) the 1980s," English-Lucek said. "There was a massive shift in organizations about what happened at work." People transformed their homes into offices to save on commute time, smudging the distinction between work and home. And as predicted, society became more reliant on computers. At the end of the '80s, more than 45 million PCs were in use, more than double the 19 million in 1984. In the shadows of the personal computer revolution, another major breakthrough in technology unfolded: the continual strengthening of the microprocessor. The concept is simple -- increase the numbers of transistors on a silicon chip and the capabilities will multiply. By 1989, Intel produced a chip that allowed users to run desktop publishing and color computing simultaneously at significant speed. The microprocessor is still the driving force behind today's technology boom that is sweeping the nation faster than society can absorb it. It is the reason computers are getting smaller and flatter and equipment from the phone to the camera will continue to integrate. "This is the engine that drives the advancement of everything you know today," said John Gage, chief scientist at Sun Microsystems. "We'll get to 2010 using what we do now, but it'll be 1,000 times smaller." THE REVOLUTION Today, billboards promoting Internet companies fan the eight-lane freeways that cut through the heart of Silicon Valley. The entrepreneurial spirit set by Hewlett-Packard more than 60 years ago still drives the Valley like a furious engine, churning out more companies nearly every day. But instead of starting in a garage, today's new tech company is likely to start on the Internet -- the tool driving the nation's economy. "There's no place else on the planet where so many ideas can be turned into prototypes and working models, where you find expertise in everything you need to make a company," said Tim Lenoir, who teaches a class on Silicon Valley history at Stanford University. Every day, at least hundreds of people will come up with the same great idea. The real test, though, is successfully packaging that idea before others do. In 1997, John Lilly came up with the biggest idea he could think of -- a company to spin out other start-ups. The company creates, develops and consults start-ups on how to launch their business. The Stanford alum called it Reactivity to symbolize the blend of intelligent, energetic employees he wanted to hire. Reactivity launched in 1998 with three people and $30,000 in capital. By the end of that year its revenues reached $1 million. "Everybody seems to be starting up these days," he said. "No one wants to work in a large company." Today, their Redwood City office, a converted bank, is a typical valley workplace. A colorful mesh basketball hoop is in one corner, diagonal from a shelf topped with Legos, a Curious George and other toys. Across the room are Nerf guns and more toys to relieve stress and engender creativity. Two miles down the road is the Buck's Restaurant, the hunting ground for entrepreneurs waiting to be discovered like actors in a Hollywood restaurant. "People come in now every day and say, `I've got this great Internet idea. I need $20 million, do you know where I can get it,'" said MacNiven, the owner, who has heard nearly every offbeat idea. Secluded from the flurry of activity is Bob Taylor, a mastermind of the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet, who predicted the Internet explosion 30 years ago. Taylor, who lives five miles from Bucks in a house overlooking Stanford University, is surprised it has taken this long to happen. In the '60s, Taylor and J.C.R. Licklider, who is regarded as the father of the Internet, prophesied that "in a few years, men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face." The U.S. government developed ARPANET out of its agency, Advanced Research Projects Agency, which was the country's response to the Sputnik launch in 1957. Taylor expects there is more to explore in cyberspace. "I think it's clear today that the Internet is one of the most important innovations of this century," Taylor said. Many more innovations are on the horizon. Last week in Las Vegas, Bill Gates opened a technology trade show insisting in his keynote remarks that personal computers are here to stay. Gates outlined his vision for homes to have Web-connected flat-panel screens in every room. Samsung just released a Dick Tracy-like cellular phone that straps to the wrist like a watch and is voice operated. And Frigidaire unveiled a refrigerator of the future with a touch-screen and bar-code scanner built into the door. People running low on an item will be able to scan the code, adding them to an electronic grocery list. The list would be zapped to an online grocer. "The blur between life and different technologies is going to get blurrier and blurrier," English-Lucek said. "It is making it easier to play at work or to work at home because the technologies you have will allow you to do both of those."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 April 2017 by Military News 3 Stocks We Like More Than NVIDIA Shares of graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) soared 220% last year, driven by explosive growth in its core gaming business coupled with even more impressive growth in its enterprise and automotive segments. NVIDIA is at the center of multiple trends, including virtual reality, machine learning, and self-driving cars, and investors have not been shy about awarding the stock a nosebleed valuation. For those not willing to pay more than 8 times sales for NVIDIA but who still want to invest in emerging technology like self-driving cars, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) , Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are three good options. A newcomer to driverless car technology Daniel Miller (Intel Corporation):  To be fair, it’s pretty difficult to find many stocks better than NVIDIA. However, Intel Corporation is cheaper and less volatile than NVIDIA, and offers investors a strong angle in the future of driverless cars, with a dividend yield of 3%. Again, to be fair, Intel might not have made this list if it wasn’t for the recent acquisition of my favorite driverless car stock , Mobileye , the global leader in computer vision for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Intel estimates automated driving systems, data, and services could be a $70 billion addressable market as soon as 2030, and the acquisition will be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings and free cash flow. Image source: Intel. Mobileye already boasts major partnerships with 25 automakers, including some of the world’s largest such as General Motors, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and many high-end luxury brands. Mobileye’s EyeQ chips were installed in roughly 16 million vehicles at the end of 2016, and its EyeQ4 and EyeQ5 chips for level 3 and 4 autonomous driving vehicles will go into production in 2018 and 2020. With Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye, the combined company will be a leading end-to-end autonomous driving technology provider with a world-class supply chain. Intel still faces headwinds with the PC industry in decline, but its move to acquire Mobileye and jump into the future of driverless vehicles is promising. It’s also trading at a cheap valuation of roughly 17 times earnings, and it will pay you a 3% dividend yield while management tries to revive its growth story. Lawsuits and self-driving cars Tim Green (Qualcomm): With NVIDIA trading at an optimistic valuation, a better bet could be Qualcomm. Qualcomm makes most of its profit from licensing key technology and intellectual property, but its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors , expected to close before the end of the year, will make it the leading supplier of semiconductor products to the automotive industry. This will put Qualcomm in direct competition with NVIDIA in the driver assistance and autonomous vehicle markets. The deal closing is not a sure thing, and Qualcomm is also facing some serious headwinds that could derail the stock. The company was sued by Apple earlier this year, with the iPhone maker accusing it of charging unfair royalties and withholding payments. That news came just days after the Federal Trade Commission charged Qualcomm with anti-competitive sales and licensing tactics. With the majority of Qualcomm’s pre-tax profit derived from licensing, any threat to the licensing business could be big trouble for the company. It’s impossible to tell how these lawsuits will play out, but investors have pushed down the stock in reaction. Shares of Qualcomm are down 13% so far this year, creating an opportunity for those who believe the company will emerge from these challenges unscathed. With the stock trading for just 12 times the average analyst estimate for fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings, a favorable outcome for Qualcomm, or the successful closing of the NXP deal, could send the stock soaring. Stop searching for a great tech stock Dan Caplinger (Alphabet): Technology stocks come in and out of vogue, and NVIDIA has been one of the darlings of the tech world for more than a year now. By contrast, Alphabet has languished, posting only minimal gains in 2016 and underperforming the Nasdaq Composite so far this year as well. Yet over the long run, Alphabet has a number of growth drivers that should help push the stock higher. The key search engine market continues to be a cash cow for the company, with Google having huge penetration rates both on mobile and on desktop devices. In addition, YouTube has retained its dominance in the video realm, and efforts like the Gmail service, the Chrome internet browser, and the Android operating system for mobile devices have been extremely popular as well. Some investors worry that non-core projects like self-driving cars might end up siphoning profits from the more successful businesses. Yet those moonshots also carry some potential for outsized gains if they pan out well. With NVIDIA having already generated impressive returns, its remaining upside is less clear than it was this time last year. Alphabet has room to move higher if it can keep delivering with its core business.

Both Intel’s Kaby Lake and AMD’s Ryzen chips are manufactured on a 14nm process node, which refers to the size of the chip’s transistors. The smaller the manufacturing process, the more transistors can fit on a single die. Microprocessors are one of the most complex products in the world, and creating these chips is a difficult and precise process. The steps we have outlined below are the most basic stages in the fabrication process, and many steps are repeated, altered, or omitted – depending on chip design. Below is an overview of how an Intel desktop processor is made, using images from Intel’s 22nm fabrication outline. Start with sand The process of creating a computer chip begins with a type of sand called silica sand, which is comprised of silicon dioxide. Silicon is the base material for semiconductor manufacturing and must be pure before it can be used in the manufacturing process. Silicon ingot Multiple purification and filtering processes are performed in order to deliver electronic-grade silicon, which has a purity of 99.9999%. A purified silicon ingot, which weighs around 100kg, is shaped from melted silica and made ready for the next step. Cut wafers The circular silicon ingot is sliced into wafers as thin as possible while maintaining the material’s ability to be used in the fabrication process. The silicon wafers are then refined and polished in order to provide the best possible surface for the following fabrication steps. Photolithography After being polished and readied for the process, a layer of photoresist is spread thinly across the wafer. This layer is then exposed to a UV light mask, which is shaped in the pattern of the microprocessor’s circuits. Exposed photoresist becomes soluble and is washed off by a solvent. Ions and Doping Exposed photoresist is washed off and the silicon wafer is bombarded with ions in order to alter its conductive properties – this is called doping. The remaining photoresist is then washed off, revealing a pattern of affected and unaffected material. Etching A pattern of hard material is applied to the wafer using another photolithography step. Chemicals are then used to remove unwanted silicon, leaving behind thin silicon ridges. After this, more photolithography steps are applied – which create more of the transistor structure, depending on which gate formation is being used. Electroplating An insulation layer is applied to the surface of the almost-complete transistor and three holes are etched into it. Next, manufacturers use a process called electroplating to deposit copper ions on the surface of the transistor, forming a layer of copper on top of the insulation. The excess copper is polished off, leaving only three copper deposits in the insulation layer holes. Layering Interconnects All the transistors are now connected in an architecture which allows the chip to function like a processor. The layering and design of these interconnects is incredibly complex, and there can be over 30 layers of metal connections in a single processor. Test and Slice Die The chips on the wafer are now ready to be tested. The wafer is sliced into dies, and functional dies move on to the final step in the fabrication process. Packaging Dies are packaged with a substrate and heat spreader, and assume the familiar form factor of a desktop processor. The heat spreader conducts heat away from the silicon and into the heatsink mounted on top of it. Processors are then tested for power efficiency, maximum frequency, and other performance metrics. Those that pass are then packaged as a retail product.

Intel Cannonlake Patches Posted For Mesa Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 15 April 2017 at 12:01 AM EDT. 2 Comments Last week we reported on Intel Cannonlake patches for their DRM kernel driver while published today were patches for bringing up the next-generation Intel graphics within Mesa. Hitting the Mesa mailing list on Friday were patches for enabling Intel Cannonlake "Gen 10" graphics within Mesa. Bringing up this new generation of Intel support within the Intel OpenGL Mesa driver was just over 3,700 lines of new code. But this support isn't yet finalized and is still relying upon many "Gen 9" code-paths. More details via this patch series. Cannonlake hardware is expected to begin appearing by the end of 2017. 2 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Intel Ivy Bridge Gets OpenGL 4.2 On Mesa 17.1 Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 14 April 2017 at 09:45 PM EDT. 20 Comments For those still using Intel "Ivy Bridge" class processors with integrated graphics, Mesa 17.1 will take the hardware from OpenGL 3.3 to OpenGL 4.2. Mesa 17.1 is being branched tonight and the code merged just in time allow OpenGL 4.2 support for Intel "Gen 7" graphics and newer where as previously the support was limited to Haswell and newer. This support comes thanks to the work by Igalia on ARB_shader_precision, ARB_vertex_attrib_64bit, and ARB_gpu_shader_fp64. Great to see this milestone accomplished for Intel Ivy Bridge, albeit don't expect to play too many GL4 Linux games with Ivy Bridge era graphics. Mesa 17.1 will be officially released in early to mid May. 20 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Timothy Green, Dan Caplinger, and Daniel Miller (TMFBargainBin) Apr 14, 2017 at 7:04PM Shares of graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) soared 220% last year, driven by explosive growth in its core gaming business coupled with even more impressive growth in its enterprise and automotive segments. NVIDIA is at the center of multiple trends, including virtual reality, machine learning, and self-driving cars, and investors have not been shy about awarding the stock a nosebleed valuation. For those not willing to pay more than 8 times sales for NVIDIA but who still want to invest in emerging technology like self-driving cars, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) are three good options. A newcomer to driverless car technology Daniel Miller (Intel Corporation): To be fair, it's pretty difficult to find many stocks better than NVIDIA. However, Intel Corporation is cheaper and less volatile than NVIDIA, and offers investors a strong angle in the future of driverless cars, with a dividend yield of 3%. Again, to be fair, Intel might not have made this list if it wasn't for the recent acquisition of my favorite driverless car stock, Mobileye, the global leader in computer vision for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Intel estimates automated driving systems, data, and services could be a $70 billion addressable market as soon as 2030, and the acquisition will be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings and free cash flow. Image source: Intel. Mobileye already boasts major partnerships with 25 automakers, including some of the world's largest such as General Motors, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and many high-end luxury brands. Mobileye's EyeQ chips were installed in roughly 16 million vehicles at the end of 2016, and its EyeQ4 and EyeQ5 chips for level 3 and 4 autonomous driving vehicles will go into production in 2018 and 2020. With Intel's acquisition of Mobileye, the combined company will be a leading end-to-end autonomous driving technology provider with a world-class supply chain. Intel still faces headwinds with the PC industry in decline, but its move to acquire Mobileye and jump into the future of driverless vehicles is promising. It's also trading at a cheap valuation of roughly 17 times earnings, and it will pay you a 3% dividend yield while management tries to revive its growth story.  Lawsuits and self-driving cars Tim Green (Qualcomm): With NVIDIA trading at an optimistic valuation, a better bet could be Qualcomm. Qualcomm makes most of its profit from licensing key technology and intellectual property, but its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, expected to close before the end of the year, will make it the leading supplier of semiconductor products to the automotive industry. This will put Qualcomm in direct competition with NVIDIA in the driver assistance and autonomous vehicle markets. The deal closing is not a sure thing, and Qualcomm is also facing some serious headwinds that could derail the stock. The company was sued by Apple earlier this year, with the iPhone maker accusing it of charging unfair royalties and withholding payments. That news came just days after the Federal Trade Commission charged Qualcomm with anti-competitive sales and licensing tactics. With the majority of Qualcomm's pre-tax profit derived from licensing, any threat to the licensing business could be big trouble for the company. It's impossible to tell how these lawsuits will play out, but investors have pushed down the stock in reaction. Shares of Qualcomm are down 13% so far this year, creating an opportunity for those who believe the company will emerge from these challenges unscathed. With the stock trading for just 12 times the average analyst estimate for fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings, a favorable outcome for Qualcomm, or the successful closing of the NXP deal, could send the stock soaring. Stop searching for a great tech stock Dan Caplinger (Alphabet): Technology stocks come in and out of vogue, and NVIDIA has been one of the darlings of the tech world for more than a year now. By contrast, Alphabet has languished, posting only minimal gains in 2016 and underperforming the Nasdaq Composite so far this year as well. Yet over the long run, Alphabet has a number of growth drivers that should help push the stock higher. The key search engine market continues to be a cash cow for the company, with Google having huge penetration rates both on mobile and on desktop devices. In addition, YouTube has retained its dominance in the video realm, and efforts like the Gmail service, the Chrome internet browser, and the Android operating system for mobile devices have been extremely popular as well. Some investors worry that non-core projects like self-driving cars might end up siphoning profits from the more successful businesses. Yet those moonshots also carry some potential for outsized gains if they pan out well. With NVIDIA having already generated impressive returns, its remaining upside is less clear than it was this time last year. Alphabet has room to move higher if it can keep delivering with its core business. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 April 2017 by Military News Intel Announces Two New Film Collaborations at VRLA Printer-friendly version Personal computing is radically evolving to become capable of experiences hardly believable today, and virtual reality’s (VR) highly sensory and immersive nature is central to that evolution. The opportunities for VR content creation are ripe for innovation. As part of Intel’s commitment to bring VR mainstream through areas such as entertainment, the company has a strong presence at VRLA, taking place today and Saturday at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Intel’s general manager for virtual reality and gaming, Frank Soqui, gave a keynote speech this morning that reinforced Intel’s commitment to the creator community – from powering best-in-class PC VR experiences today to the company’s vision for the future with merged reality. Soqui also unveiled two new content collaborations. The company will power filmmaker Eliza McNitt’s first episode of her new project, “Pale Blue Dot,” a virtual exploration of the universe inspired by the iconic image in the film’s name. The VR experience brings to life immersive worlds at the fringes of our solar system while also showing the fragility of our own planet. Audiences have the opportunity to find themselves lost together floating through the cosmos. The film comes after the success of McNitt’s “Fistful of Stars,” a VR film that debuted at SXSW and also was powered by Intel. Additionally, Intel has partnered with Winslow Porter and Mileca Zec to enhance their film “Tree,” immersing audiences in a majestic rainforest where viewers’ arms become the branches and their bodies become the trunks. The highly immersive experience captures the growth (from seeding to tree) at its fullest form, resulting in the unique opportunity to witness firsthand the fate of the rainforest. To date, “Tree” has received official selection at Sundance Film Festival New Frontier and Tribeca Film Festival Immersive 2017, where it will make its premiere. MORE ON VIRTUAL REALITY: Press Kit: Virtual Reality Intel iQ: Virtual Reality Story Series Intel.com: Making Virtual a Reality In partnership with CyberPowerPC, 26 VR systems powered by 7th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 processors will be on hand for the learning workshop series at VRLA School. This includes powering the first VR projects made by members of Big Brothers Big Sisters and Girls Who Code. In addition to the hands-on workshops, the Intel booth is hosting chalk talk sessions that explore the intersection of entertainment and technology. Powerful VR and merged reality experiences dreamed up by creators demand massive computing power, new sensing and capturing technologies in both the PC and the cloud, and huge amounts of data flow. Thanks to Intel’s rich experience, robust portfolio of technological capabilities and longstanding relationships with developers, content creators and industry leaders around the globe, the company has the assets and influence to bring about the promise and possibility of VR and merged reality through exciting new products, market segments and experiences.

The company is still hiring, though, and said Thursday that its Oregon workforce now totals 19,300 — just 200 off its peak before major cutbacks began 12 months ago. Intel declined comment on the most recent job cuts, but sources inside the company said they could number in the dozens or perhaps more than 100 at a business that employs 106,000 around the globe. That makes them an order of magnitude smaller than job cuts in 2015 and 2016. Last year alone, Intel eliminated 15,000 jobs across the company to prepare for long-term decline in its core PC business. In its finance group, Intel is consolidating work across many sites into “shared service centers” in Costa Rica and Malaysia. Sources familiar with Intel’s plans said few if any people will lose their jobs, and that Intel slowed hiring of junior employees last year in preparation for the shift. Employees in Intel’s sales and marketing group learned last week that the organization will lay off workers to comply with “corporate spending targets,” according to memo from Greg Pearson, the Intel vice president who manages the group. The memo sent to employees earlier this month outlined other spending cuts, including restructuring a portion of the organization, but did not specify how many people will lose their jobs. Sales and marketing represents less than 2 percent of Intel’s total workforce, according to 2015 employment data reviewed by The Oregonian/OregonLive. And there is no indication this month’s cuts are especially large. When Intel began its broad restructuring last year, the company said it needed to cut back in some areas to free up resources to invest in new opportunities. Those include memory chips, self-driving cars and a new class of connected devices and appliances known as the Internet of Things. As Intel pursues those new markets, its sales have been buoyed by growing demand for microprocessors to run the large data centers that power the internet and store vast amounts of corporate data. Revenue grew by more than 7 percent in 2016, to an all-time high of $59.4 billion. Though Intel’s headquarters are in California, the company’s largest and most advanced operations are in Hillsboro, Ore. Intel laid off 784 Oregon employees during last year’s cutbacks and offered buyouts or early retirement packages to thousands of additional employees in Washington County. The company remains the state’s largest private employer, though, apparently because Intel has hired for new local positions. In other places, the cutbacks have had a profound effect. Several small sites closed altogether, and Intel disclosed this week that it has reduced employment at its aging factories near Albuquerque, N.M., by 37 percent in the past year. According to the Albuquerque Journal, Intel now has 1,200 employees working there — down from 1,900 at the end of 2015. The New Mexico site employed 3,300 as recently as 2013, according to the Journal. But Intel has skipped three generations of manufacturing upgrades in New Mexico, putting the factory there in danger of obsolescence.

Apple granted permit to test self-driving vehicles in California Rick and Morty enter the VR world on 4/20; GTA V mod out now 174 Facebook Twitter Google Plus RSS Comments The answer to that question may seem obvious to many of you, not least because our Ryzen 5 review said the non-X model looked like a better value. However, we didn't actually have a plain 1600 on-hand at the time, we just assumed based on what we saw with the Ryzen 7 chips that the 1600 would overclock as well, or at least nearly as well as the 1600X. Although there isn't likely to be a dramatic performance difference between the two chips, the $220 1600 comes bundled with the 95-watt 'Wraith Spire' cooler, while the $250 1600X doesn't come with a cooler at all. If you add the cost of a basic heatsink to the 1600X, the non-X version is around 20% cheaper, yet it shouldn't be more than 10% slower out of the box. The 'X-rated' 1600X also features "XFR" or Extended Frequency Range, which is basically a beefier version of Turbo that lets the CPU overclock itself a little harder when attributes such as power, current and thermals are within acceptable ranges. XFR is enabled by default on 'X' model Ryzen CPUs, though it's disabled when manually overclocking. The 1600X has a base clock speed of 3.6GHz, a boost clock of 4.0 GHz and a maximum XFR boost speed of 4.1GHz. However those figures are a little misleading. For example, boost frequencies will only allow the 1600X to hit 4 - 4.1GHz for single-threaded workloads, whereas the CPU won't actually boost higher than 3.7GHz on multi-threaded workloads, or a mere 3% increase over the base clock. The 1600 on the other hand operates at a base clock frequency of just 3.2GHz and is advertised to boost as high as 3.6GHz, though again that boost frequency will only be achieved when taxing a single core. However, despite advertising a boost speed of 3.6GHz, stressing a single core in most cases also sees the 1600 exhibit XFR-like gains, allowing it to reach 3.7GHz. Interestingly, it seems like all Ryzen CPUs feature XFR. The 1600's maximum multi-thread frequency is 3.4GHz, which suggests that for heavy workloads it will only be clocked 8% lower than the 1600X. Of course, these figures will be different if you manually overclock, which is certainly worth considering given that Ryzen CPUs are unlocked and the 1600 can be pushed quite hard with the Wraith Spire box cooler. We can already say that if you don't plan to overclock, the 1600X is the faster CPU while the 1600 is the better value as it can't be more than 10% slower and yet it's at least 20% less expensive thanks to the included box cooler and lower MSRP. However, we aren't sure if that story remains true when overclocking, especially if the 1600X offers more headroom. Rumor is, the X-models are capable of greater frequencies and we've seen some evidence of this with the 1700X and 1700, though for the most part the margins were thin. The 1600X chip we have on-hand for testing had no trouble hitting 4.1GHz at just 1.38 volts and it was even possible to benchmark the system at 4.2GHz after increasing the voltage to 1.5, but AMD recommends a maximum of 1.45 volts for sustained use. Set at the same 1.38 volts, the 1600 reached 4GHz -- not bad -- and increasing the voltage a fraction more to 1.4 allowed us to achieve a stable overclock of 4050MHz, only 50MHz shy of what the 1600X managed. Of course, this could have very easily been around the other way. I just happened to receive a good 1600X. I've seen plenty of reviewers and now users limited to 4GHz with the 1600X, so as always with overclocking, your mileage will vary (4GHz does seem nearly guaranteed, though). For single-threaded workloads, the manual overclock won't actually be any faster than the stock 4.1GHz XFR performance, but multi-threaded performance should be up to 11% faster for the 1600X and 21% faster for the 1600. Before moving on, we should note that this isn't an in-depth Ryzen 5 1600 review -- in fact, it's not really a review at all. That will come later along with coverage of the quad-core 1400 model. Instead, we thought it would be interesting to take a detailed look at the performance differences between AMD's six-core Ryzen 5 processors, assuming you’re lucky enough to be in the market for a new CPU priced between $200 and $250.

This was the same limitation we faced with the 1500X, so high-speed memory support is still dependent on the CPU. This will hand the 1600X a slight advantage, over the advantage it already had due to those higher clock speeds. In any case, even with DDR4-2933 memory the 1600 was still good for a memory throughput of 35GB/s. When testing with Cinebench R15, the 1600X is 10% faster in the multi-threaded test and 11% faster in the single-threaded test, which is about what we would expect to see out of the box. Remember the 1600X is clocked 11% higher for single-threaded work and 9% higher for multi, so these figures make sense. 7-Zip provides a glimpse into real world application performance with both the compression and decompression tests using all available threads on the 1600X and 1600. Here the 1600X was around 7 to 8% faster than the 1600, which is in line with what was previously seen in Cinebench and again given the out of the box clock speeds these are the margins we expected to see. Testing game performance with Hitman we find that the 1600X is just 4% faster than the 1600 when comparing either the average or minimum frame rates. Obviously not a significant difference and it explains why we didn't see many worthwhile gains in most games when overclocking Ryzen. Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation is the last game I used to compare the 1600 and 1600X. This time we see a mere 2 to 3% performance advantage in favor of the 1600X, so again it looks like you can expect a poor return on investment when buying the 1600X for gaming. When overclocked, performance is equalized on the Ryzen 5 CPUs. The 1600 fell just 50MHz shy of the 1600X when using reasonable voltages -- obviously a negligible difference and as you can see both CPUs allowed the Titan XbigP to average 88fps. Wrap Up The Ryzen 5 1600 is the obvious choice as suspected. Between its $220 asking price and bundled cooler, it presents too much of a value proposition to give the cooler-less 1600X much consideration at $250. All told, with the 1600 CPU and its cooler mounted on an affordable B350 motherboard along with memory such as G.Skill's FlareX DDR4-2400 16GB kit, you have the core components of a killer six-core/12-thread machine for no more than $400. How much does Intel's Core i7-6800K cost again? The 1600-based build has even more appeal when you realize that it should overclock to at least 4GHz while our G.Skill RAM reached 2933MHz with relaxed timings. Looking at it that way, the Ryzen 5 1600 is an exceptional value. As I found earlier in the week, even compared to more affordable CPUs such as the Core i5-7600K, the new six-core Ryzen chips are a much better buy, regardless of what it is you plan to do with them. However, there's not much reason for anyone to purchase the 1600X over the 1600 as you're only paying more for less. You might be wondering why AMD would release a 1600X at all and I'd say it exists simply to maximize profit. AMD's playing a similar game as Intel with these chips. The difference being that they are doing it without completely taking advantage of enthusiasts who want to save a little money. When it comes to the 1600, you're being rewarded for doing your homework and a little tinkering. 28 comments 174 interactions Share this article: User Comments: 28 Got something to say?

The new Trident Z kit for operates at 4333 MT/s (DDR4-4333), though it requires a bit of extra voltage to get there. In addition, the company said that it was working on even faster DDR4 DIMMs. The new G.Skill Trident Z memory modules are based on Samsung’s 8 Gb DRAM ICs (B-die, 20 nm), which also power other high-end DIMMs from the company. The 16 GB kit (F4-4333C19) consists of two 8 GB modules rated for DDR4-4333 operation with CL19 19-19-39 timings at 1.4 V, which is above the standard high-performance voltage setting for DDR4 (1.35 V) and is considerably higher than JEDEC-specification of 1.2 V. Just like the rest members of the Trident Z family, the new DDR4-4333 kit comes with aluminum heat spreaders (so, no RGB LEDs just yet) as well as SPDs with XMP 2.0 settings. G.Skill is the Trident Z DDR4-4333 kit for use with Intel’s Z270 platforms and Kaby Lake processors. So far, G.Skill has only validated its F4-4333C19-8GTZ modules on the ASUS ROG Maximus IX Apex motherboard and the Intel Core i5-7600K processor, but expect the list of compatible mainboards to expand over time. In addition to announcing the new DDR4-4333 kit, G.Skill also teased DDR4-4400 (F4-4400C19-8GTZ) and even DDR4-4500 (F4-4500C19-8GTZ) 8 GB memory modules working in dual-channel mode. The company is still working on such DIMMs and finalizing their specifications (timings, voltages, etc.), so do not expect them on the shelves for a bit. It should be noted however that this week's announcement is just that: an announcement. The actual product release will come later. G.Skill has not yet announced when that will be; presumably the company is still binning chips and building up a launch supply. We'd also expect the retail price of the kit to be announced at that time. At present, a dual-channel 16 GB DDR4-4266 kit costs around $250, so it's reasonable to assume the new DDR4-4333 kit will be priced above that.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE Review HP Spectre x360 15-inch (2017) review: Fantastic 4K UHD display and performance Ken Yeung@thekenyeung April 15, 2017 6:00 AM Tags: HP, HP laptops, HP News, HP Spectre, HP Spectre 15.6 inch 2017, HP Spectre 2017, HP Spectre Review, laptop, Spectre, top-stories Above: The HP Spectre x360 (2017) 15-inch convertible laptop. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell / VentureBeat HP has come out with a refreshed 15.6-inch Spectre x360 laptop, one with speed and performance that essentially replaces the desktop and will appeal to any creator. With a retail price of $1,500, the 2017 edition certainly delivers, with a quality entertainment center and a touch surface to let your imagination go wild. Armed with a 4K touch display, a 3840×2160 resolution, a 7th-generation Intel Kaby Lake chip (i7-7500U processor), fast charging, and a larger battery, HP has made its 15.6-inch Spectre on par with the 2016 Spectre 13. Getting to know the 2017 Spectre In addition to Windows 10 Home, the HP 15.6-inch Spectre comes equipped with a 256GB PCIe NvME M.2 solid-state drive (SSD), 16GB DDR4 SDRAM, ports for USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3, HDMI, USB A, and USB Type-C 3.1 Gen1. HP has packed this computer with the technology necessary to handle your creative needs, be it managing Photoshop, editing photos, word processing, watching videos, playing games, or surfing the web. Above: The HP Spectre x360 15-inch laptop is thin and powerful. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat The 15.6-inch Spectre isn’t bulky — it has a thickness of 0.7 inches and weighs in at 4.42 pounds. By itself, that’s not bad, but the 2017 edition is 0.07 inches thicker and 1.22 pounds heavier than its predecessor. This laptop is no brick, but it does have some weight to it, and I could feel it when lugging it around in my backpack to and from the office. This isn’t a device that you’d want to carry around like a MacBook Air — it certainly isn’t suitable for airplane usage, because it’s so big. But that’s not why HP made this laptop; it’s something that really stands out at the home or office. Just like with the MacBook Pro and the Microsoft Surface Book, the HP Spectre is a premium quality device, not only internally but externally as well. With an aluminum chassis and a black (“ash silver”) and gold finish, the HP Spectre has a polished look that could be well received by creative professionals. It’s a change from last year’s model, which was only available in HP’s “natural silver” color. Above: The keyboard and trackpad on the HP Spectre x360 (2017) 15-inch laptop. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat The keyboard is massive, and there’s no mistaking where the keys are — they take up nearly the entire width of the computer. Typing felt normal, with one exception: You have to account for the fact that on the very end is a column featuring the home, page up, page down, and end buttons that can throw off your typing. Much of this review was typed on the HP Spectre, and the keyboard felt very comfortable to use. There’s 1.5mm of travel and enough space between keys to make it easy to type out a script, email, or document without any problems. HP provides a backlit keyboard, but you can’t toggle the lighting levels — it’s either on or off. The trackpad on the 15.6-inch HP Spectre is wide enough that no matter where your hands are on the keyboard, you’ll be able to easily control the cursor. There were times when the cursor would coast randomly across the screen for no apparent reason, an issue that I’ve experienced on at least one other HP laptop. However, when you’re actively steering the cursor with the trackpad, you can still browse the web, use multi-finger gestures to scroll, and move things around. HP has once again used Bang & Olufsen audio technology in its laptop, with quad speakers, two more than its predecessor. It matches the update the company made with its 13-inch model last year, and the sound quality is pretty good. While there are audio controls on the display and the keyboard, there are also volume controls along the right-hand side of the computer, which come in handy when in tablet mode. As for battery life, HP boasts that its latest Spectre laptop contains a larger lithium-ion battery with six cells and 79.2Wh that HP says will last up to 13 hours. It supports fast charging and, the company claims, will achieve 50 percent capacity within 30 minutes. After I drained the battery and then charged it, this wasn’t quite the case — it took a few minutes longer to reach the 50 percent mark. But that’s not a deal-breaker. When the battery was fully charged and I used the HP Spectre unplugged, the computer lasted at least nine hours with normal usage such as browsing the internet, writing articles, checking emails, listening to Spotify, having a Google Hangouts video call, and watching YouTube. During my time with the HP Spectre, I have not experienced any issue where the bottom of the device becomes too hot or the fans begin to whirl audibly. When making a video call, HP’s Bang & Olufsen audio app has a noise cancellation option that lets people you’re talking to hear only you or multiple people around you. Where this comes in handy is largely determined by the environment you’re in — if you’re in a Starbucks or a loud co-working space, for example, having HP noise cancellation set to only pick up your voice would be helpful. But if you’re in a group chat with others next to you, being able to pick up multiple voices will help. The problem with this is that HP has buried this feature in an app most people probably won’t readily know where to find — you have to find the HP Audio Switch in the taskbar, select “Bang & Olufsen Audio Control”, and then the “Input” section in the app. It would be great to have this option within the volume control, or at least a link to it. The Spectre’s camera is decent, with a 1080p resolution. It’s suitable for selfie photos and amateur videos, but if you want better quality, invest in a camera. Above: Sample photo taken from the camera on the HP Spectre x360 (2017) 15-inch laptop. Image Credit: Ken Yeung/VentureBeat HP has also equipped this premium laptop with Orbit, its app that lets you share files between the computer and mobile devices. This can be helpful, especially if you take a video on your iPhone or Android device and want to broadcast that onto a larger screen — HP Orbit can let you impress your friends with the quality display of the HP Spectre. Impressive display but so-so stylus Speaking of the display, perhaps what impressed me the most about the 2017 15.6-inch HP Spectre is the display, which provides an immersive experience no matter whether you’re playing a game, watching a video, having a video call, designing, or simply using a web browser. HP claimed that feedback it received from the previous version was a request for a higher-resolution display. The 2017 model not only supports 4K at a 3840×2160 resolution (compared to last year’s full high-definition 1920×1080 or quad high-definition 2560×1440 resolution), but it also includes a narrow border display so your experience isn’t cut off by the borders of the laptop. At times, I felt it was like watching a widescreen version of a movie — it really draws you in. Above: The HP Spectre x360 (2017) 15-inch laptop has a 4K UHD display that makes watching videos really worthwhile. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat Having a micro-edge display with 4.65 millimeters on both sides provides additional screen real estate for those who want a larger canvas to draw on using the HP stylus or who just want more space to be better organized. HP claimed in a survey it commissioned that the majority of people who prefer a 15-inch display want a high-resolution display with thin bezels. Because it’s a convertible tablet, you can position the HP Spectre in several ways: as a traditional laptop, as a tablet, in tent mode, and any other way you deem appropriate. This is helpful when you want to watch your favorite movie or show from Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon and don’t like having a keyboard between you and the screen. An issue I had with the touch display is how easy it was to get fingerprint smudges on the screen, causing me to constantly having to wipe it down. One thing that helped was the use of the HP stylus that comes with the laptop. Above: The HP Spectre x360 (2017) 15-inch laptop in tablet mode with stylus. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat The stylus isn’t a small S-Pen that you’d have with a Samsung device, but the equivalent of a pen or pencil that an artist would use to draw their masterpiece. There’s some weight to the stylus, and it’s built in a way you don’t worry about it snapping in half. One qualm is that it requires AAAA batteries — it was an adventure to find a store that had them in stock. But that aside, if you want more control over your on-screen creativity, be it using Photoshop, Illustrator, or Adobe Premiere, than a mouse can provide, the stylus should work for you, especially when you’re using the Spectre in tablet mode. On the body of the stylus are two buttons, the equivalent of the left and right buttons on a mouse. The HP Spectre includes an app that lets you modify the purpose of each button to suit your workflow. What I appreciated about the Samsung’s S-Pen is that there was a launcher constantly on screen that you can select to take screenshots, make immediate annotations, and do other things. HP’s stylus requires at least a couple of extra steps. Above: The stylus that comes with the HP Spectre x360 (2017) 15-inch laptop. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat Palm rejection technology on the display lets you rest your hand on the screen without leaving a mark as you use the stylus. However, pressure sensitivity does not appear to be available, so the size of your brush or pencil stroke will be the same no matter how hard you’re pushing the stylus into the screen. Judging the HP Spectre Overall if you’re looking for a quality laptop to replace your desktop or something that you can use in your role as a creative professional, then the HP Spectre 15.6-inch convertible laptop is worth exploring. At a starting price of $1,500, it’s not a cheap device, but, given its capabilities, it should last for quite a few years. Some of the benefits of having this computer is the 4K display, its audio quality, the battery life, and the performance. The camera could use a bit more work and the stylus could be a bit better, but after weeks of using the HP Spectre, I didn’t find anything that was a deal-breaker.

MSAA Support Added To The OpenSWR Software Rasterizer Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 15 April 2017 at 06:50 AM EDT. 4 Comments Intel's OpenSWR graphics software rasterizer living within Mesa now has experimental support for MSAA. Should you be needing multi-sample anti-aliasing with SWR, it will be found in Mesa 17.1. But for Mesa 17.1 there still may be some bugs and work is being done on further improving the performance. While MSAA support in the software rasterizer may not seem like a big use-case, apparently some Intel customers are after it, "We wanted to get the changes out now to allow several customers to begin experimenting with MSAA in a software renderer. So as not to impact current customers, MSAA is turned off by default - previous functionality and performance remain intact. It is easily enabled via environment variables." If you find yourself using OpenSWR, it can be enabled via SWR_MSAA_FORCE_ENABLE environment variable and SWR_MSAA_MAX_SAMPLE_COUNT for specifying the MSAA sample count up to 16x.

Intel Vulkan Driver Preps External Memory Extensions For Mesa 17.2 Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 15 April 2017 at 07:39 AM EDT. 1 Comment Intel's Jason Ekstrand has posted 21 new Mesa patches for adding the VK_KHX_external extensions to their ANV Vulkan driver. He believes the patches are now ready for merging and plans to land them for what will become Mesa 17.2. The revised patches put out on Friday implement VK_KHX_external_memory_capabilities, VK_KHX_external_memory, VK_KHX_external_memory_fd, VK_KHX_external_semaphore, and VK_KHX_external_semaphore_capabilities. VK_KHX_external_memory is among the extensions used by SteamVR on Linux for dealing with external memory -- these extensions were introduced in the big Vulkan 1.0.42 update. The KHX prefix denotes these extensions are still experimental, but have been supported already by the NVIDIA Linux driver, RADV patches are available, and Ekstrand appears ready to merge them to Mesa Git once 17.1 has been branched. These patches put out on Friday are revised from the ANV patches from late February when the extensions were first made public. The patches can be found on the Mesa mailing list. The functionality also relies upon a new DRM sync object API that has yet to be mainlined in the Linux kernel. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Credit: (NMSU photo by Tiffany Acosta) Jordan Glaze, a New Mexico State University junior majoring in both mechanical and aerospace engineering and Innovator in the Aggie Innovation Space, helped Josiah Brooks create a prototype of a feed intake device for cattle. MEDIA CONTACT Available for logged-in reporters only CHANNELS Agriculture, Engineering, Environmental Science KEYWORDS Animal Science, Engineering, Student Research Newswise — New Mexico State University Department of Animal and Range sciences junior Josiah Brooks is creating a feed intake device for cattle, and he is working with the Aggie Innovation Space to design and develop parts for a prototype.   Through an NMSU College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences USDA-Hispanic Serving Institution LEADERS grant awarded to the Animal Science Department, Brooks is conducting a research trial to develop a marker system to determine feed intake in grazing cattle that will allow researchers to investigate how grazing management and supplementation programs can improve cattle health and performance.    To properly manage rangelands, ranchers need to understand grazing cattle nutrition and have the ability to quantify how much cattle eat when they are grazing in a pasture, according to Eric Scholljegerdes, Animal and Range Sciences associate professor and Brooks’ faculty adviser.   Researchers obtain this data with an inert marker (not digested), titanium dioxide, which is typically administered to cattle twice daily. Unfortunately, this dosing method requires manpower and interrupts grazing. Brooks is working on a device that will be inserted into the stomach of cattle and will automatically release the marker over a period of time.   To create a cap and a plunger for a prototype, Brooks has been working with Jordan Glaze, an Aggie Innovator in the Aggie Innovation Space Presented by Intel in the College of Engineering.   “The Aggie Innovation Space has allowed us to develop parts for this device that would otherwise be unavailable,” Scholljegerdes said. “We are very grateful for the wonderful help we have received thus far from the personnel at the Aggie Innovation Space. Without their help we would not be where we are at in the development process.”   As a former engineering student, Brooks knew about the Aggie Innovation Space and started working with Glaze in late 2016.   “I’m extremely happy with the Aggie Innovation Space,” Brooks said. “Jordan, specifically, because working with that level of technology is extremely challenging. I didn’t realize how much effort went into designing something on a software program.”   “You can’t do that without patience and you can’t do that unless you have a passion,” he added. “You feel welcome as a student even though you are not in the department, a completely different department, but they help and that’s what they want to do and that’s their passion. It’s been a very positive experience for me. I wouldn’t have gone back if I didn’t get that experience.”   A junior majoring in both mechanical and aerospace engineering, Glaze said he has enjoyed working with Brooks on his first animal science project. A few of projects Glaze has recently assisted on are from the industrial engineering department, art department, geology department and a community outreach project for a dog wheelchair for a NMSU employee.   “The Aggie Innovation Space is based around developing cross disciplinary skills focused on engineering specifically, but also branching out into different disciplines such as this case being animal science,” Glaze said.   “We guide projects from the very first stage, and work with our clients to help them get to the prototyping and later the manufacturing stages,” Glaze noted. “We work very hard to make projects successful, but focus on not doing the project for the client. We want them to learn and take away something when the project is said and done, and hopefully give them the guidelines to follow for future projects.”   While Brooks and Glaze are continuing to work on a prototype, Scholljegerdes hopes to test the device on cattle this summer. If successful, Brooks and Scholljegerdes would like to patent the device. Permalink to this article COMMENTS | COMMENTING POLICY Comment/Share Share Leave a comment...

Casey April 13, 2017 Pros / Fantastic general performance; Excellent battery life; Durable design; Comfortable keyboard; Lots of ports Cons / Dull, lo-res display; Gets hot; Slow SSD Verdict / The Dell Latitude 5280 offers great typing and 12+ hours of battery life, but temperature and screen issues hold it back. Dell Latitude 5280 from $849.00 Visit Site from Dell Home The 12-inch Dell Latitude 5280 is a great choice for frequent business travelers. Not only does it fit in smaller luggage, but it also has fantastic battery life, which allows you to leave the power cord at home. The Latitude 5280's speedy 7th Gen Kaby Lake CPU enables solid performance, and its comfortable keyboard allows for tons of typing. A dim default display and warm skin temperatures keep Dell's laptop from a higher rating, but if you're looking for a durable, reliable machine, the Latitude 5280 should definitely be on your list. Specs Design Dell kept things simple with the 5280's design. The notebook's matte-black, carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer shell looks and feels sturdy, and its polycarbonate keyboard deck provides a comfortable area for your wrists to rest while you're typing. The Latitude's first USB 3.0 port, USB Type-C port and HDMI port are all located on the machine's left side, while the headphone jack, second USB 3.0 port, VGA port and Ethernet port sit on the right. You'll find an SD card reader at the rear of the device. The laptop has a number of ports that its competitors do not. The AsusPro for example, doesn't offer HDMI, VGA or Ethernet, while the ThinkPad X1 Carbon has no VGA and requires a dongle for its micro-Ethernet port. Dell Latitude 5280 from $849.00 Visit Site from Dell Home Weighing 3.2 pounds and measuring 0.8 inches thick, the 12.5-inch Latitude 5280 is heavier and thicker than the 14-inch AsusPro B9440 (2.4 pounds; 0.6 inches) and the 14-inch Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2.5 pounds; 0.6 inches). Durability and Security Mobile professionals will appreciate the Latitude 5280's ruggedness, as Dell built the notebook to survive the dangers of everyday use and accidental abuse. Having passed 15 MIL-SPEC standard tests, it can work in the most grueling conditions, including extreme temperatures (from 140 degrees to -20.2 degrees Fahrenheit), drops, shocks and blasts of dust. Provided that they don't mind spending a little extra, your IT managers will appreciate all of Dell's security options. The system comes standard with a FIPS 140-2-certified TPM 2.0 chip for secure data. Intel's vPro technology for remote management costs an extra $21, as does a smart card reader. If you want an IR webcam for Windows Hello login, one is available for $35. Unfortunately, there's no fingerprint reader option. MORE: What is vPro? Display When configuring the Latitude 5280, pay $70 extra for the 1080p screen or go home. Our review model had the base-level, 1366 x 768 display, which was weighed down by poor color, low resolution and dimness. We don't know how much better the 1080p screen would have performed on our tests, but at least it would be sharper and fit more content on the screen. Watching the Thor: Ragnarok teaser trailer on the base screen, I noticed that Asgard's normally copper hue had faded to a light gray, while normally verdant trees looked sickly and what little life there was in Cate Blanchett's face was drained away. According to our colorimeter, the Latitude 5280's 1366p screen  produces 71 percent of the sRGB color spectrum. That's below the readings from the AsusPro B9440 (103 percent) and ThinkPad X1 (104 percent), and the 96-percent category average. The Latitude's panel emits up to 243 nits (a measurement of brightness). That's notably less than the 299-nit category average, as well as the results from the AsusPro B9440 (291 nits) and the ThinkPad X1 (275 nits). This dimness leads to a poor range of viewing angles, with color darkening at 45 degrees when viewed from the left or right. Keyboard and Touchpad Typists will enjoy click-clacking away on the Latitude 5280, as its comfy, backlit keyboard enabled fast input during my testing. I reached 82 words per minute on the 10fastfingers.com typing test, beating my 80-wpm personal average. While the 1.2 millimeters of travel in the keys is lower than the 1.5-2.0mm we hope to see, the 65 grams of actuation force makes up for that, sitting well above our minimum 60g comfort level. The Latitude's 3.9 x 2.1-inch touchpad tracks input accurately and supports Windows 10's app-switching gestures. Dell's Touchpad utility offers an easy way to disable tap-to-click and enable other gestures. The pair of left- and right-click buttons beneath the touchpad offers a solid feel to each click. Audio The Latitude 5280's speakers filled our largest conference room with strong sound. Listening to Rick Ross' "Trap Trap Trap" on the notebook, I noted its sturdy bass, accurate-sounding synths and clear vocals. Dell preloads the Waves MaxxAudio Pro sound-adjustment utility, but the default settings seem to be the best for clarity and strength. If you like to play with settings for sound-space width, audio details and bass, you'll have fun with this app. MORE: Best Bluetooth Speakers for Home or On-the-Go Performance With its Intel Core i7-7600U CPU, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD, our review configuration of the  Latitude 5280 packs enough punch for solid multitasking. I didn't experience any slowdown even after splitting my screen between a dozen Chrome tabs (including ones for TweetDeck, Slack and Google Docs) and a 1080p YouTube video. The system also maintained its performance as I ran a full-system scan in Windows Defender, edited a Microsoft Word document and played a round of Candy Crush Soda Saga. Dell Latitude 5280 from $849.00 Visit Site from Dell Home The Latitude turned in a great score of 8,690 on the Geekbench 4 general performance test. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon, which also has a Core i7-7600 CPU, earned a slightly lower score of 8,571. That beats the 6,933 average for ultraportable notebooks and the 7,238 from the AsusPro B9440 (Core i5-7200U, 8GB). The 256GB M.2 SATA SSD in the Latitude 5280 copied 4.97GB of multimedia files in 41 seconds, for a speed of 124.1MBps. That's behind the speeds from the SSD in the AsusPro B9440 (196MBps) and the PCIe SSD in the ThinkPad X1 (242MBps), as well as the 184.8MBps category average. The Latitude 5280 gave a  speedy performance on our OpenOffice productivity test, finishing in 3 minutes and 16 seconds. That's shorter than the times from the AsusPro B9440 (4:02) and ThinkPad X1 Carbon (3:22), as well as the 5:54 category average. The integrated Intel HD Graphics 620 chip in the Latitude earned a solid 68,949 on the Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test, beating the 54,231 category average. Similar scores came from the AsusPro B9440 (69,585) and ThinkPad X1 (68,082), both of which use Intel HD Graphics 620 cups. The Latitude 5280 can play moderately demanding games, running Dirt 3 (at Medium settings) at a silky smooth 61 frames per second. That's faster than 34-fps category average, as well as the frame rates from the AsusPro B9440 (27 fps) and ThinkPad X1 (28 fps). Battery Life The Latitude 5280 can burn the midnight oil and then some. The system clocked 12 hours and 21 minutes on the Laptop Mag battery test (continuous web browsing). That's better than the 8:26 time from the AsusPro B9440 and the 8:19 category average. The ThinkPad X1 (12:21) lasted just as long as the Latitude. Our test unit features a four-cell, 68-watt-hour battery that comes standard for Core i7 models but is an optional upgrade for the Core i3 ($49) and Core i5 ($28) models. Those come with three-cell batteries. MORE: Laptops with the Longest Battery Life Webcam The 0.9-megapixel webcam is passable but unimpressive. In a photo of my torso, my skin tone and a green fern in the background looked pretty accurate, while digital noise obscured details such as my facial stubble and a diagonal pattern in my shirt. Heat This notebook can get plenty hot. After I streamed 15 minutes of HD video on the Latitude, its G and H keys spiked to a temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit, and its underside got as hot as 107 degrees, issues I also noticed during general usage. Both measurements exceed our 95-degree comfort threshold, though the 89-degree reading from Latitude's touchpad stayed below the threshold. Software Dell bequeathed the Latitude 5280 with the company's standard pack of preloaded utilities. Those include Command Power Manager (for optimizing battery life), SupportAssist (for reaching Dell tech support agents) and Touchpad Options (for enabling/disabling click, tap and gesture settings). Configuration Options The $1,505 model we tested features a Core i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB M.2 SATA SSD, an IR webcam and a 1366 x 768-pixel display. You'll have to choose between the 1080p display ($70) and an IR camera ($35). Dell Latitude 5280 from $849.00 Visit Site from Dell Home The entry-level Latitude 5280 costs $849 and includes a Core i3-7100U CPU, 4GB of RAM and a 500GB, 7,200rpm hard drive. For $100 you can upgrade that notebook to a Core i5-7200U CPU. You can add LTE connectivity (with support for AT&T, Sprint or Verizon) for $139. Bottom Line The Latitude 5280 is a great machine for taking care of business, thanks to its speedy CPU, comfy keyboard and fantastic battery life. But while the Latitude has solid power, its mediocre display makes it hard to enjoy all that brawn. You can get a more colorful display with the thin, lightweight $2,122 ThinkPad X1 Carbon, but getting similar performance on that machine will cost an extra $617. Business travelers looking for a port-rich powerhouse notebook have a lot to like in the Latitude 5280, provided that they can take the heat and pay for the 1080p display.

(Thomas Boyd/Staff) Print Email The Oregonian Editorial Board By The Oregonian Editorial Board The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 15, 2017 at 3:00 PM, updated April 15, 2017 at 3:02 PM comments It might seem odd to say that Oregon, which is expecting more tax money from Oregonians than ever before, has a revenue problem. Certainly, the booming economy, record low unemployment and strong forecasts suggest that generating money for Oregon's coffers is not a problem.  Even the state's projected $1.6 billion deficit for the 2017-2019 budget can't be blamed on disappointing revenue. Rather, that mindboggling gap stems from the state's chronic spending problem. Not only have lawmakers expanded programs without a plan to fund them, but they have failed to tame health and pension benefits that are thoroughly baked into state contracts and threaten to claim a larger and larger share of taxpayer dollars for years to come. Such structural spending problems remain the primary threat facing Oregon. But the state does indeed have a revenue problem that needs attention as well. Our tax policies park too much of the burden on individuals while letting businesses pay less than they should thanks to property tax limits enacted decades ago. The state's reliance on personal-income taxes for more than 80 percent of the state's general fund translates into wild swings in revenue, robbing public services of the stability needed for real momentum and progress. And fixing Oregon's structural spending problems alone won't set the state up for success - particularly in the event of an economic downturn that's bound to hit. Editorial Agenda 2017 Boost student success Get Oregon's financial house in order Help our homeless Honor our diverse values Make Portland a city that works Expand access to public records ________________________ Read more about the editorial board's priorities for Oregon. In fact, even the business community knows it needs to pony up more money, something Oregon Business Plan Chairman Patrick Criteser acknowledged at the December 2016 summit of political, business and community leaders. And business representatives last year explicitly promised to help craft tax legislation if voters would reject Measure 97, a union-backed measure that threatened to levy a supersized tax on Oregon's largest corporations. "The day after the election," Portland Business Alliance Sandra McDonough said, as quoted in The Portland Tribune, "we will be at the table." Apparently, we all should have clarified which table they would be at. They're not at the one headed by Sen. Mark Hass, D-Beaverton, who is developing the most promising corporate tax revenue proposal in the state Legislature. While some prominent companies including Nike, Intel and Columbia Sportswear are engaging with Hass on tax proposals, McDonough and Oregon Business Council President Duncan Wyse are giving short shrift to the effort. At a recent meeting with The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board, McDonough and Wyse instead insisted that the Legislature must reform its structural spending problems first before talking with them about new taxes. They have a point in one respect: More money alone fixes nothing. Even with the record amount of money pouring into the state, school districts are planning teacher layoffs, universities are announcing 9 and 10 percent tuition hikes and other programs are steeling for severe cuts later this year. It cannot be more obvious it is simply unsustainable for public employers to continue devoting millions of dollars to generous benefits as opposed to actual services for Oregonians.

If you have questions about the opinion section, contact Laura Gunderson, editorial and commentary editor, at 503-221-8378 or lgunderson@oregonian.com. But the critical need to fix those defects does not excuse the no-show by some business leaders on revenue reform, which must take place on a parallel track. Hass' proposal would more fairly tax businesses, add some stability to help smooth out Oregon's revenue ups and downs and provide modest relief to individuals on the income tax rates they pay. Instead, McDonough and Wyse brushed aside Hass' proposal because it taps the same underlying mechanism as Measure 97 of basing a tax bill on overall sales. A separate, secretive business group, Priority Oregon, is taking it one step further, with a misleading ad campaign that paints Hass' proposal as a Measure 97 retread and aims to derail its chances. Oregonians shouldn't fall for such reductive reasoning. The merit of any tax proposal should be evaluated not just on the mechanism but by such measures as whom it targets, the rates levied, the fairness of the tax, and whether policymakers can mitigate unintended consequences. Hass' proposal takes into consideration all of those whereas Measure 97 fell short across the board. If anything, Hass' proposal shows exactly why tax policy should be crafted at the legislative level - where policymakers can address such concerns and fine tune adjustments in the tax architecture - rather than pushed through at the ballot box by an initiative as nuanced as a bumper sticker. Citizenship carries certain responsibilities. It means that we all share the burden of dealing with the reality that we live in. Our reality is that we face an urgent deadline to address monumentally challenging issues this legislative session or face dismal cuts that hurt students, seniors, low-income families and the public at large. This will take immense political courage and leadership from Oregon's elected officials. It will take cooperation from unions and businesses. And it will take sustained public pressure to get legislators to do the hard work of fixing both spending and revenue. But if anything, the threat of a $1.6 billion deficit clarifies just what's at stake: Sit back and let budget disaster unfold or seize this opportunity to change government as usual and set this state on a trajectory out of perpetual dysfunction. - The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board Opinion Resources How do I submit a letter to the editor or a guest column?

With a lightweight design, integrated screen, and easy to use software, Ohmni is designed to be the most accessible (and affordable) mobile telepresence robot yet. Ohmni is heavily focused on ease of use, which is always a good idea when developing a robot for consumers. It arrives completely assembled (folded in half), and setup consists of unfolding it, meaning that you can send it to a relative with minimal computer experience and not have to worry. The display, audio, and video hardware are all integrated, so there’s nothing to mess with there, either. The robot itself is 4’ 8" tall, and weighs just over 18 pounds. It runs Android 6.0 on an Intel X5 processor, with 64 GB of on-board storage and 4 GB of RAM. The lithium battery will keep the Ohmni moving and chatting for 5 hours, and the included dock will give you an hour of life for every hour of charging. Ohmni does include an autodocking feature with minimal autonomy: as long as the cameras can see the fiducial on the dock, the robot can orient and dock itself. Photo: Ohmni One feature you’ll find on Ohmni that distinguishes it from other telepresence platforms is a tilting neck. Not pan and tilt, because it’s not designed to let you look around, rather it’s just a single extra degree of freedom that allows Ohmni to look up, down, and nod. You control this manually, but I can imagine how this simple change would go a long way towards making the robot seem more connected to the person remotely inhabiting it. For more details on Ohmni, we spoke with Jared Go, Ohmnilabs co-founder and CTO: IEEE Spectrum: How do you convince people that a telepresence robot is worth investing in when the cellphones and tablets they already own come with video chatting capability? Jared Go: One key part is helping them realize that they’re just taking for granted what it means to stay in touch by phone or video chat. Almost everyone we talk to tells us they miss the feeling of being there in person, even with all these video chat apps and hardware surrounding us. So there is definitely a value gap there and our research and user testing early on focused on that key question—how to use robotics can help solve that problem. We know now that the key lies in the holistic, differentiated experience. It’s not about having a screen, or remote control wheels. It’s about what this enables. We studied behavior as we let testers try Ohmni with their own family and the results were really awesome. Almost the very instant they tried it, the way they interacted completely changed. Photo: Ohmni For example, we found conversations would immediately move to the most natural and comfortable place, rather than say sitting in the study or on a bar stool. The other side most often said they felt way freer, not forced to constantly aim a device at them, or sit in one spot. Because of this, conversations got longer and instead of just recapping what happened last week, people would spend an hour or more just hanging out around different activities, like watching sports on TV. This is stuff they’d never do with FaceTime or Skype.  How does Ohmni differentiate itself from other mobile telepresence platforms like Double or Beam+? Double and Beam have designed their products around the corporate use case from day 1, which has forced them down a particular road very different from us. We’ve focused on home from the very beginning, which allows us to provide a much better suited experience. We’ve rethought the entire process. The tablet on our robot is not removable and is completely integrated and set up ahead of time. When you order, we can even pre-program WiFi credentials for you so that if you ship it to your parents, they just unbox, unfold, and turn it on. That’s it! We’ve had people 65+ set it up with high level verbal instructions only. That’s super important for the consumer market. The moving neck along with our MotionMap technology is also key to creating biggest difference in experience. Driving around Beam and Double and interacting feels a lot like walking around with a neck brace on, which results in unnatural interaction. We studied this and notice in a lot of cases people will bend down or adjust their pose to look flat into screen, because the screen and camera can’t orient to look straight at them. People say that it’s really the moving neck that makes the product feel really human. The human brain is hardwired to sense attention so seeing what the remote user is exactly looking at has a tremendous impact. Being able to emote and nod too really gives the extra oomph to that feeling. Why should roboticists be excited about Ohmni? What kind of interesting technology (software, hardware, or both) does it use? Two main things. We’re focused on optimized the telepresence experience first, but we’ve already started building out Ohmni as an affordable, human-scale open platform. We have a cloud-based JS framework we call OhmniAPI. Our goal here was to make programming Ohmni as easy as developing web pages. You basically develop a rich HTML5 app that can run display whatever complex media or network logic on the screen and also uses privileged JS calls to have full access to motors, lights, text-to-speech, and so on. And you deploy it to any bot with one click from the cloud. We’ll be extending the capabilities of the framework over time to add higher-level navigation and image/audio recognition so that writing high level tasks will be possible without a Robotics PhD. We’re also developing an in-call developer console so you can run code on the bot while you’re in the telepresence call, which we think is a really exciting way to do robot development! We’ll release more details on this later on in the year. Photo: Ohmni Ohmni’s also built on open standards so it gives devs a lot of flexibility to hack on the hardware. We’ve left extra hardware ports where you can attach extra servos and sensors. The core of Ohmni’s sensors and peripherals is a USB root hub so you can easily plug in and control all the hardware from a beefy laptop or anything else too. We’ll be publishing the packet protocol for controlling motors as well. How do you plan to improve Ohmni through software updates? We’re always iterating on things like autodocking precision, MotionMap precision. Continually improving the driving UI. We’re planning to roll out features over time like hotword detection and speech control (i.e. integrating with the Alexa API). We’ve definitely got plans for more autonomy and more assisted driving and will talk more about that later this year. We’re hoping developers do crazy and fun things with Ohmni like try and do some interesting HCI applications or even things like get a whole set of Ohmni bots to sync together and perform songs from Hamilton*. You can pledge US $1460 (shipping included) for an Ohmni on Indiegogo right now, which is $500 less than the robot will eventually sell for. This is likely to be the biggest issue with Ohmni—even though it’s relatively affordable for a mobile telepresence robot, its price will make it a luxury item for most people, and it could be hard to justify. We certainly agree that telepresence robots have a surprising amount of value, and that it’s something it’s best to experience to really understand how it’s different from (and better than) a regular video chat: the sense of embodiment you get is powerful, and the ability to have a physical presence somewhere else makes interacting with people remotely a much more natural experience. There’s a lot to like about Ohmni, and the platform in general seems to have potential. While it may not represent a significant advance in terms of mobile telepresence technology, it’s a compelling mix of features and affordability that seems to have potential.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Your Nvidia Titan Xp has little to fear Home Hardware What Xbox ‘Project Scorpio’ means for PC gaming By Jeremy Laird on April 13th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Microsoft has dished the deets on its upcoming ‘Scorpio’ hardware update for the Xbox console, and in what amounts to uncharacteristic detail and candour given the ruddy thing isn’t going on sale until the end of 2017. But what are we poor PC peasants to make of the Beast of Redmond’s latest game box and its towering on-paper capabilities? In short, what influence will Project Scorpio’s trick new hardware have on future PC games? As ever with such developments, there is no single and simple answer. Scorpio’s hardware is at the very least a tale of two halves even if they are crammed into a single computer chip or SoC. I speak, of course, of the critical CPU and graphics elements. The media razzmatazz has largely centred on the graphics half of the equation and there’s no denying Scorpio packs some serious pixel-pumping power for a grotty little games console. The headline figures for the GPU rock in at 40 so-called compute units running at 1,172MHz. That compares with ye olde Xbox One’s 12 units at 853MHz and the One S with the same number again, albeit running at 914MHz. It’s AMD, of course, who supplies both the graphics and the CPU designs for the Xbox and, in the Red Team’s standard parlance, a compute unit packs 64 of those, er, shader thingies that make the pixels look so very pretty. We’re talking 768 shaders in the Xbox One and 2,560 of the bump-mapping blighters in Scorpio. If that sounds impressive, AMD’s current fastest GPU, the elderly Radeon R9 Fury X packs 4,096 shaders. And lest you forget, the Fury X is a generation behind and not nearly as fast as Nvidia’s best GPU du jour, the preposterous Titan Xp. On the CPU side of the Scorpio equation, Microsoft has stuck with eight low-power AMD Jaguar-derived cores, albeit running upclocked from 1.75GHz to 2.3Ghz and benefiting from several detail tweaks. The other major part of the package involves the memory and bandwidth combo, which in these consoles is a little more complex given the single-chip architecture means shared memory for GPU and CPU. Anyway, there’s a healthy uptick here too, from 218GB/s and 8GB to 326GB/s and 12GB. The very first observation to make is that while Scorpio moves the game on massively for consoles, it is not exactly frightening today’s high-end PC hardware, much less what will be available when Scorpio actually arrives and, in turn, the PC hardware that will appear over Scorpio’s lifetime. For some perspective, consider that main Scorpio CPU-GPU-SoC thing as a whole clocks in at seven billion transistors. That’s for everything – the CPU, the graphics, the other SoC gubbins, the lot. Nvidia’s biggest GPU, as found in the silly new Titan Xp and indeed the slightly more sensible 1080Ti, packs no fewer than 12 billion transistors. Add billions more for Intel’s finest CPU and a bleeding edge PC’s CPU and GPU alone are more than twice as complex. Even the next tier down in Nvidia’s GPU range, the GTX 1070 and the vanilla GTX 1080 are alone about on a par for complexity with the unified Scorpio chip. So while consoles tend to do more with less, there’s a limit to that philosophy. The PC’s performance and fidelity advantage isn’t being challenged. That’s especially true when it comes to the CPU side of things. Put simply, Scorpio’s CPU cores continue to suck. A fair bit of Microsoft guff has been regurgitated by the tame media regarding Scorpio’s modified cores, the reduced internal latency, 31 per cent faster core clocks, how the new SoC is more customised than before. But I’m not terribly impressed. Clearly, they’re still mostly the the same crappy low-power cores as before, not proper desktop cores. Ermegerd, is that a magnetic hard drive? Put another way, remember what a kicking AMD got for the poor performance of its outgoing FX PC processor? Well, it’s a hell of a lot better than the CPU in any Xbox, including Scorpio. Even AMD’s new Ryzen CPU has been taking a bit of a beating for supposed iffy gaming performance. It would completely obliterate the feeble cores in Scorpio. That’s the disappointing bit, then: That the initial development target for a lot of games for several years to come will still be a system with pretty pathetic CPU cores. The rub here is that while it’s relatively straightforward to add at least some graphical detail to a game when porting for the PC (just chucking in some high res textures can do a power of good for the look of a game), taking advantage of additional PC processor power tends to require a more fundamental rethink of the game engine and indeed the game itself. Which, let’s be honest, isn’t usually going to happen. The exception to all this and what might – just might – prove a saving grace, is the new so-called GPU Command Processor in Scorpio. It’s basically a section of dedicated circuitry on the main SoC design to run DirectX 12 API invocations. In English? Think of it as a DX12 hardware accelerator for some of the more CPU-intensive bits of the game engine like draw calls. It could be a game changer by freeing up even Scorpio’s weak CPU cores to do interesting and innovative things. But it’s far too early to say for sure. If that’s the bad and yet-to-be-proven news, the good is that Scorpio’s focus on pukka 4K capability means that developers will put a lot of effort into making games look great at high resolutions. To pinch a quote from Kevin Gammill, Group Program Director of the Xbox Core platform, “it’s about delivering those pixels with 4K assets, so they look great. It’s about delivering those pixels with HDR and wide colour gamut fidelity. It’s about delivering those pixels with no loss of frame-rate compared to the 1080p version of that title – that’s super-important to us.” In other words, proper high-res textures, geometry and effects that on the one hand really make the most of the detail 4K can deliver and on the other are optimised to reduce performance overheads. And, of course, Scorpio should accelerate the development of games with proper HDR support, which is just another string in developer’s bows when it comes to making games look awesome. Of course, you very likely don’t have a 4K PC screen and you almost certainly don’t have an HDR monitor. But all that should still benefit PC-relevant resolutions like 2,560 by 1,440, otherwise known as 1440p, that sit in between full 4K and 1080p. One part of the Scorpio graphical package for which the benefits to the PC remain to be seen involves tweaks to the graphics engine that go beyond simply adding more functional units. Apparently, Microsoft and presumably AMD took a good look at how developers actually make game engines and then tweaked detailed aspects of the graphics architecture to suit. That’s not going to help existing PC graphics cards. But will we see any of those same hardware tweaks in AMD’s new Vega GPUs, due later this year? My guess is that we may see some similar elements, but probably not everything. So the benefit-cost calculation for the PC in that regard remains to be seen. Overall, Scorpio looks like it’ll be a great thing for PC gaming in terms of plain old eye candy. Whether it will enable more innovation and complexity at the core of game engines is a tougher question and will likely depend on how that funky hardware DX12 setup engine in the Scorpio SoC pans out.

The 5xx line up has already been leaked online in terms of the specs – just expect more of what the 4xx line up gave but tweaked. It’s a re-release rather than a brand new card. Vega is where the big change will be in a month or two. Log in to Reply 13/04/2017 at 22:50 Czrly says: Sigh. Eye Candy is just about the last thing I think we need more of.

There are still better Intel chips (usually for more money) but with R5, Ryzen looks to be at LEAST comparable price/performance wise. It’s a shame that Scorpio doesn’t seem to be enjoying the Ryzen improvements. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 00:37 geldonyetich says: They would be wise to develop consoles that people have compelling reasons to own. When all you can do is slightly upgrade the power and add useless features like social media, you prove there is no next gen. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 00:38 particlese says: They’re supposedly also stuffing all the Freesync 2 stuff into the thinger, which should mean low-faff HDR/high-bpp/wide-gamut capabilities will (hopefully) catch on sooner than if it were just AMD pleading with display companies to make things lovelier for us. It’ll spread the joy of non-proprietary variable refresh rate around a bit more, too, although I haven’t myself found that to be the revelatory feature some profess it to be. On the minus side, that’ll all supposedly be implemented exclusively via HDMI, so they’re missing the opportunity to encourage display manufacturers to bung our lovely royalty-free display port into their super-sized photon launchers. Not that it makes a ton of difference in practice, but HDMI is the only display interface which has ever caused me problems, and it did so for a while in various ways, so I tend to be a jerk to it when the opportunity presents itself. So basically, I’d love to someday see a 50″+ screen with Display Port, high (120Hz+) refresh rates which aren’t just marketing “features”, and user-friendly HDR/bpp/gamutStuff; and this newfangled thinger looks to be encouraging much of that. Hooray! Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 00:47 The Almighty Moo says: Any thoughts on it’s out of he box support for the new FreeSync and HDMI standards Jeremy? I know you covered the standards themselves in a previous article, but I’d be interested to know your thoughts on the effects of this support on the PC / Monitor market. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 01:46 Jeremy Laird says: Good question. First part of the answer would involve the extent to which games use monitors on consoles. I don’t know the answer to that, but my hunch is the heavy majority of consoles are hooked up to TVs. That said, I happen to know from some corporate work I did recently that at least some monitor makers are very keen to sell screens to console gamers. So, I’d expect at least some to try to crack the market by offering a ‘full’ console experience. Whether TVs will fully support it all is a separate question. Do TV makers engineer for console specifically? Honestly, I don’t know. My knowledge of that aspect of the TV market is pretty thin. That said, HDR is quickly becoming the norm as is HDMI 2.0. My experience recently with an HDR TV is that everything works much more seamlessly than before. Hooking a modern PC up to a 4K TV is a non issue in terms of the res, if not perhaps HDR functionality, for now. That said, I think that most of the features of Freesync 2 if not necessarily Freesync 2 itself along with higher bandwidth interfaces are going to become pretty common. Things have been developing pretty fast in the last couple of years and I don’t see that stopping. Displays just keep getting better. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 14:17 funkstar says: Don’t TVs have to support variable refresh rate if they want to be HDMI 2.1 compliant? According to DigitalFoundry, Scorpio supports *both* Freesync AND the new HDMI VRR standard, so TV manufacturers should be covered Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 01:10 SquarePeg says: The reason for Jaguar cores in the Xbox Scorpio is backward compatibility. All Xbox and PS4 games till now are built from the ground up for the Jaguar CPU architecture. They wouldn’t run on Ryzen’s “Zen” architecture without an update for every current gen game ever made. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 01:36 Jeremy Laird says: Jaguar is x86. Ryzen is x86. They are cross compatible except where Ryzen has additional extensions. Ryzen is in effect a superset of Jaguar in terms of the instruction set. So basically, no. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 10:33 Sakkura says: There could perhaps be some very low-level optimizations, like accounting for the timing of how many cycles the architecture will spend on different instructions and structuring the code to take optimal advantage of that… but who would even give a crap about losing such optimization advantages if you were moving from Jaguar to Zen? The latter can easily overcome that deficit, and more to boot. So you’re right. It’s about cost and cooling. Zen is still new stuff, and AMD knows it’s finally got a CPU architecture people will actually pay for. So the price tag would be higher. And while Zen is surprisingly efficient, it’s still a high-power/high-performance architecture optimized for running at higher clocks.

Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 10:47 Asurmen says: Well, Scorpio does have more than four times the power? Also capability is more than just tflops. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 13:07 Don Reba says: Ah, yes, you’re right, I did the math and it is indeed a bit more than 4x rendering power. And when you increase the number of pixels by 4, you pretty much just need 4 times the rendering power. Geometry and fragment shaders don’t take up a large proportion of the computation budget. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 13:59 Sakkura says: On the other hand, the Xbox One usually doesn’t render at 1080p anyway. It’s typically 1600×900 or 1280×720 that then gets upscaled to 1080p. So if we say the Xbox One is capable of 1600×900, and Scorpio is capable of 5 times that much, that’s still a little short of 3840×2160. I suspect we’ll be seeing a lot of games rendering at 2560×1440 and upscaling to 4K. Maybe even 1080p upscaled as well. That will still look very nice on a TV, much better than 720p or 900p upscaled to 1080p. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 14:41 funkstar says: According to DF (going by MS reports) performance testing indicates that all 900p and above titles should hit 4k at the same framerates 14/04/2017 at 16:35 Kinsky says: The Xbox One is barely capable of 1080p and forces developers to employ shortcuts galore to achieve even 900p in some cases, such as using uncompressed video/audio files to reduce CPU load, lower texture resolution, lower poly models, and noisy postprocessing effects like bloom and motion blur to cover up the ugly. Scorpio is setting 4K as its target, but seems barely capable of that as well. This likely means we can continue to expect multi-platform releases and ports (i.e. Battlefield) to have ridiculously bloated installation sizes, poor texture resolution, an over-reliance on postprocessing effects, all that sort of thing. But hey, at least they can put a cool-looking bullet point on the console’s features page. 14/04/2017 at 06:32 ElementalAlchemist says: Anyone expecting Scorpio to suddenly change things for PC needs to reign in their expectations. This is not a new generation of consoles, it’s not an Xbox 4, in the same way a PS4 Pro is not a PS5. The baseline/lowest common denominator for game development (excluding the Switch) is still the original Xbone. Games are still going to be developed first and foremost to run on that and the original PS4. All Scorpio will do is (notionally) provide some higher framerates and resolutions (and the jury is out on just how well it will actually perform in practice). So nothing will change for PC going forward in the short to medium turn. We’ll still get the same poorly optimised ports that, on a design basis, are hamstrung by the hardware limitations of the Xbone. Log in to Reply 15/04/2017 at 14:18 scritty says: While games still have to work on the Xbone, all the extra graphical fluff in the world is not going to make these new iterations world beaters. Also CPU speed is vital for many genres of games. Not FPS and 3rd person action games so much, but games where many AI agents are used (like RTS games, 4X games and most strategy games) being hamstrung with an old – if up clocked Jaguar CPU means these consoles will lag a long way behind even a low end PC in all those genres. But all I see on consoles is one 1st person shooter and 3rd person action game and the odd annual updated sports franchise after another, and I guess if that’s all you ever want to play… more power to you. They offer good value. I don’t play games like those though so consoles offer no value for me at all. The day Dwarf Fortress comes out on console and allows me to have over 2000 dorfs and other AI entities in play at one time with no lag? Is the day I consider buying one.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 April 2017 by Military News CeBIT trendspots – what exhibitors presented in Hannover! No. 2 Right on the button! This year sees tapdo making its CeBIT premiere at SCALE11. tapdo is a smart button developed by a company of the same name that can control a whole range of apps and functions on the basis of various biometric features. Fingerprint sensors have well and truly arrived as an everyday authentication solution and are being used to unlock a whole host of even low-cost consumer products. However, up until now, virtually all applications have focused on just one fingertip, with all the other parts of the hand completely ignored. All in all, there is some way to go until the interaction potential of fingerprint sensors can be extended to the whole hand. Instead, the smartphone itself is used as a remote control for a wide variety of other smart devices. It’s a popular solution, but not exactly ideal. What most users want is an ultra-simple and intuitive way to control their apps and devices. At least, that must have been how the team at startup firm tapdo technologies saw things when they dreamt up the idea of the tapdo button. The end result of their ingenuity is a smart button that can do much more besides authenticate device users – it also offers a rapid, distraction-free and discrete way to interact with a variety of apps and functions. tapdo is at SCALE11, the startup hub at CeBIT, to show how its button scans the biometric features of various fingers so that they can be assigned to a wide range of functions. For example, you might want to use the tip of your little finger to fire up the music player on your smartphone, your thumb to switch on the lights in your smart home and your middle finger to… well, that’s entirely up to you. The tapdo button and smartphone connect via Bluetooth, while the smart button, which features vibration feedback, can be worn on a wrist strap or clipped to clothing. The tapdo button has been on sale through Kickstarter since 28 March 2017 with prices starting from 99 euros. Early adopters who invest in the product can expect to take delivery of their tapdo – including battery and wriststrap – in September 2017. tapdo technologies GmbH (48149 Münster, Germany), Hall 11, Stand A36 (17) Contact: Markus Sudhoff Tel.: +49 251 9801270 E-Mail: PR@tapdo.io Thunderbolt – Part 3! At CeBIT 2017, QNAP Systems showcased a number of highlights including its first Thunderbolt-3 NAS systems, innovative QTS-IoT servers, NAS supported by optical data storage and smart-home solutions with automation services. QNAP (Quality Network Appliance Provider) Systems, Inc., one of the world’s leading manufacturers of high-performance NAS systems, NVR video surveillance solutions and digital signage, exhibited an impressively wide range of offerings at this year’s CeBIT in Hannover. Besides NAS innovations for domestic and business applications and the latest apps and features, the Taiwanese company also offered key insights into the trending topic of the Internet of Things. QNAP’s most popular attraction turned out to be its QIoT solution combined with smart-home concepts. However, the company itself chose to highlight its first Thunderbolt-3 NAS, above all the TVS-1282T3 12-bay model. The QNAP TVS-1282T3 NAS is equipped with a seventh-generation 14-nm Intel Core i5/i7 processor and boasts four Thunderbolt-3 connections. With no less than 12 slots for eight 3.5-inch and four 2.5-inch hard disks, the system offers more than enough storage. Specially designed in this way to appeal to media producers and creative professionals, all of QNAPs Thunderbolt-3 NAS systems have ultra-fast transmission speeds (double the previous generation’s) and expandable data storage to meet the current demands in high-speed multi-workstation environments. Not only that, but QNAP’s Thunderbolt-3 NAS systems are downwardly compatible with USB 3.1 storage media and thus marry much more effectively with non-Thunderbolt USB devices. QNAP Systems, Inc.

Hamburg-based connected health.eu GmbH is exhibiting its product „LifeTime”at the Bitkom industry association partners stand to promote a much easier way for doctors and patients to share information. As a digital native, Dr. Johannes Jacubeit was struck by two things in particular in his daily work as a clinician – how out of date the IT systems were and how much he missed the benefits of modern communications. By the end of 2014, enough was enough, and he decided to do something about it himself. Dr. Jacubeit left medicine to found connected health.eu GmbH and joined forces with high-tech expert and IT allrounder Matthias Lau to find a solution. Since then, the company has grown to a team of 20, won numerous awards and garnered enormous media attention with the product LifeTime. Now, with its own stand at CeBIT 2017 in Hannover and as a partner with Bitkom, Germany’s digital association, it is set to write the next chapter in its success story. LifeTime is designed to give doctors and patients a simple, digital way to share health information – without ever having to connect directly to the Internet. While medical practices install the LifeTime Hub, patients use the LifeTime App so that medical documents can be transferred directly from and to their smartphones. To enable this transfer, the hub creates an encrypted local connection with the patient’s smartphone, all in line with data protection regulations. Health data can then be encrypted and stored in the app. Thanks to this innovative approach, LifeTime App allows patients to carry their own health documents such as X-rays and doctor’s letters with them at all times – which is a real help in emergencies, or just when next visiting the doctor. connected-health.eu GmbH (22767 Hamburg, Germany), Hall 4, Stand C58, co-exhibitor with Bitkom Contact: Dr. Johannes Jacubeit Tel. +49 40 2286 7897 E-Mail: support@lifetime.eu A great start by all accounts! CeBIT 2017 saw JustOn GmbH make its debut appearance at the fair and was a great success for the team of developers behind its Salesforce-based, cloud-supported invoicing software Only recently launched in Jena in Thuringia, JustOn GmbH has already had one successful première this year at CeBIT 2017, resulting in highly positive feedback as well as numerous new contacts and prospective customers. Participating for the first time in the Salesforce World Tour, the company showcased the latest version of its self-titled cloud-based invoicing software – a Salesforce-based solution for SMEs that is fully compatible with existing accounting and business systems, including JIRA. A key focus for JustOn GmbH at CeBIT this year was on new connectors for its cloud-based invoicing software. The full service provider highlighted the advantages of cloud-based e-invoicing in a live demo. „Visitors at our stand proved to be very interested in the new connectors and integration options for existing accounting systems, as well as the implications for increased data security,” reports Marko Fliege, CEO and founder of JustOn GmbH. „We also networked with potential collaboration partners from all over the world and discussed sales with a large number of prospective customers. The fair was a huge success for us in every respect!” JustOn GmbH (07745 Jena, Germany), Hall 9, Stand A01, co-exhibitor with salesforce.com Germany Contact: Marko Fliege Tel.: +49 3641 5598580 E-Mail: service@juston.com Two worlds – one scanner! CeBIT 2017 in Hannover not only marked the announcement of future collaboration between Zeutschel and PhaseOne – it also played host to the world première of the innovative ScanStudio as the first product of this exciting new relationship! Initially billed somewhat enigmatically as a “”world première – the best of two worlds”, the cat was finally let out of the bag when Tübingen-based Zeutschel GmbH in collaboration with PhaseOne unveiled the innovative Zeutschel ScanStudio to the wide audience of visitors at CeBIT 2017 in Hannover. „The Zeutschel ScanStudio shows what happens when two world market leaders – Zeutschel with book scanners and PhaseOne with medium-format digital cameras – merge their skills and expertise,” says Jörg Vogler, Managing Director at Zeutschel. Peter Nielsen, Market Manager for Cultural Heritage Market at PhaseOne, adds: „We are pleased to have found a partner who shares the same high standards in terms of quality and flexibility in the cultural heritage market. Together, we have achieved a milestone in repro solutions in the shortest possible development time. We are all proud of that.” Having specialized up till now in cultural heritage solutions for books and other valuable bound documents, Zeutschel is now in a position to expand its digitalization solutions and open up new markets through its collaboration with PhaseOne. The ScanStudio consists of a camera system with a PhaseOne digital back, interchangeable lenses, special LED illumination and a range of copyboard systems. It is designed for digitalizing a wide variety of film formats, slides, glass negatives, stamps and coins, as well as books and large-format documents. The cooperation agreement will also see PhaseOne taking over exclusive distribution of the new digitalization system in North America.

Rabbi Hier is one of 12 torch lighters who have been slated for approval by Culture Minister Miri Regev (Likud). Also on the list: billionaire Amnon Shashua, founder of Mobileye—which he recently sold to Intel for a record $15.3 billion. Advertisement In January, Rabbi Hier said a prayer during the inauguration of President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, ignoring many calls from within the liberal Jewish community to refuse the honor. He recited a verse from Psalm 137 that reads: “If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand wither away. May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I fail to remember you, if I fail to count Jerusalem as the greatest of all my joys.” Rabbi Marvin Hier was born in 1939 in New York City and grew up on the Lower East Side attending the Rabbi Shlomo Kluger Yeshiva on Houston Street for elementary school and the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School for high-school and six years Kolel. Hier received his ordination in 1962 from Rabbi Mendel Kravitz, dean of the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School. In 2007, Newsweek describes Rabbi Hier as being “one phone call away from almost every world leader, journalist and Hollywood studio head.” In 2007 and 2008 Newsweek named Rabbi Hier the most influential rabbi in America.

It’s been another thrilling week across the tech world, with some exciting announcements, a few spicy rumors, some big surprises, and some bigger disappointments. But don’t worry about missing anything, for once again, 7 Days is here to walk you through what’s been happening. Our journey begins this week in the world of fast food, as Burger King created a TV ad designed to trigger Google's Home speaker hub and digital Assistant in people's homes, by ending with "OK Google, what is a Whopper burger?" That should then have got Google Home and Assistant to read out the description of the Whopper from Wikipedia - but the Wikipedia entry was quickly edited to suggest that the Whopper contains "rat meat" and "toenail clippings". In the end, it wasn't Burger King that killed the ads, but Google, which wasn't too happy about its devices being used in that way without its blessing, and blocked its Assistant from responding to the ads. Google's got much bigger things on its mind anyway - next week, it's planning to introduce "the new Google Earth" with a "brand new experience". Lineage OS added support for more handsets, including Samsung's Galaxy S III, and the OnePlus One. And Canonical released Ubuntu 17.04 'Zesty Zapus', bringing a new kernel and removing the default swap partition - although it hasn't yet made the recently-announced switch from Unity to GNOME. At CES in January 2016, Dell unveiled its stunning 30-inch OLED monitor with 4K resolution. Priced at $4,999, it was due to go on sale in March 2016, but never appeared. Now, over a year later than planned, it's finally available to order - and its price tag has shrunk by 30%. The US Federal Aviation Administration has given the green light to Boeing's use of 3D-printed titanium aircraft parts for use on its 787 Dreamliner. The move is set to save millions of dollars in production costs for the company. Image: Digital Trends Meanwhile, the FCC has abandoned plans to enable cellphone calls during flights. Given how obnoxious fellow passengers can be, even without license to scream into their mobile phones at 37,000ft, this seems like a sensible move. Over in the UK, Virgin Media is turning its home broadband customers' routers into public Wi-Fi hotspots. Kodi, frustrated by its software being misused for content piracy, is now considering adding DRM support to its products. A new strain of ransomware has been doing the rounds lately, demanding that you play a game and unlock your data by reaching a high score. Hacking group Shadow Brokers published a range of tools used to exploit vulnerabilities in Windows versions all the way back to Windows 2000 - but Microsoft said that it had already patched most of those security flaws. Image: Shutterstock Microsoft published its latest transparency reports, including details on law enforcement requests for information about its customers. Microsoft and Chinese tech giant Tencent were among the investors in the latest $1.4 billion funding round for Indian online retailer Flipkart. More significantly, Flipkart is now taking over eBay India, while eBay is taking an equity stake in Flipkart as part of a $500 million investment. Microsoft released a new Office Insider Preview for Windows users in the Slow ring, bringing new features such as collaborative editing in Excel. It released a new Outlook for Mac preview for Office Insiders in the Fast ring too, adding support for email templates. But separately, it also launched another Outlook for Mac preview, available to everyone. The standalone preview program does not require an Office 365 subscription, unlike the Office Insider Program. Rumors in recent months suggested that Apple had abandoned its self-driving car project in favor of working with existing manufacturers to develop software for use in their vehicles. It's still not clear exactly what Apple has planned, but this week, the company received a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California. Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly working on a secretive project to expand the healthcare benefits of its Watch. The company is said to be developing sensors that can non-invasively monitor blood sugar levels for diabetics, similar to the heart-rate sensors on its existing wearable devices. In rather more mundane news, Apple also released its second developer betas for iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1; followed by the second public betas of those iOS and macOS versions. Apple is being sued by Qualcomm, which alleges that the iPhone-maker deliberately limited its chips' performance so that they wouldn't outperform those sold by Intel. Qualcomm didn't have a great week, as it was ordered to refund $815 million to BlackBerry, which was found to have overpaid the chip-manufacturer. The ruling came after a period of arbitration, and cannot be appealed, so while Qualcomm made it clear it "does not agree with the decision", it has no choice but to pay up and shut up. The latest smartphone sales market share data from Kantar Worldpanel shows further gains for Android in many key markets, with iOS holding steady in most parts of the world - except in China, where demand for iPhones plummeted year-over-year. Windows phone sales remain in freefall, unsurprisingly. After months of leaks and rumors, HTC officially unveiled its new One X10, a mid-range handset with a 5.5-inch 1080p display, octa-core processor, and a very generous 4000mAh battery. There was very surprising news from Samsung this week. After it became clear that its new 'intelligent assistant' Bixby would be far more limited at launch than Samsung had implied on stage at its Galaxy S8 announcement, the company has now admitted that its new flagship will launch in the US without support for Bixby voice controls. Samsung also tweeted that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will launch in India on April 19, before deleting that tweet. It also seems that AT&T will be exclusively launching a Galaxy S8 active, following similar 'rugged' versions of the S6 and S7. If you've ever found yourself asking "what's the point of a smartwatch?", you're not alone. In fact, Huawei's CEO made the same point this week - shortly after launching his company's two new smartwatches - saying: "I am confused as to what smartwatches are for when we have smartphones." ZTE unveiled an affordable Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch with a 1.4-inch AMOLED display, priced at $192. Unfortunately, it doesn't have NFC support, which means no Android Pay. That seems like a bit of a missed opportunity. And while LG updated its first-gen Watch Urbane to Android Wear 2.0 last week, the company said the update won't be available for its second-gen model until next month. Nearly eight months after Google released Android 7.0, its long, slow rollout continues, reaching more devices this week: Google updates Nexus 6P beta testers to final build of Android 7.1.2 Android 7.1.1 now available for Nokia 6 Samsung Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ get Android 7.0 on AT&T Samsung Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ get Android 7.0 on Verizon Android 7.0 rolls out to Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge on Sprint HTC One M9 finally gets Android 7.0 on Sprint... with February security update While the February security update reached the One M9 on Sprint, HTC rolled out the March security patches for unlocked models of that device. Wileyfox began its migration away from the now-defunct Cyanogen OS to Android 7.1.1 Nougat, starting with its Spark 2X handset. Intriguingly, Wileyfox also revealed that it's making a Windows phone, saying that "Windows is much better for security than Android". That might comes as a surprise, until you realize that Wileyfox was funded by the same company that owned UK handset brand KAZAM, which also made Windows phones, until it was "absorbed" into Wileyfox last year, although they're still both registered as separate companies. Speaking of which: Someone should probably also mention to KAZAM's directors they're overdue on filing latest Companies House paperwork https://t.co/CL7Vmyglub pic.twitter.com/eh6b9oeJ0e — Andy Weir (@gcaweir) April 10, 2017 HP's pricing for its Elite x3 Windows 10 Mobile flagship in the UK has made absolutely no sense over the last few months. In the last two months, the handset and Desk Dock have been priced at £673, then £707, £757, £702, and back to £673 again - and now, that bundle is available for £583, with a £90-off voucher code. In the US, T-Mobile has ended sales of Alcatel's Windows 10 Mobile flagship, just six months after its launch, and two months after slashing its price by a third. While Microsoft is continuing to sell the unlocked Alcatel IDOL 4S with Windows 10 for $400, Amazon is now offering it for just $284.99. Two weeks after WhartonBrooks launched crowdfunding efforts for its "most disruptive" "radical" fairly ordinary mid-range Windows 10 Mobile phone - the Cerulean Moment, priced at $299 - the Indiegogo campaign has so far reached just 2% of its $1.1 million target, with one month remaining. But WhartonBrooks is already looking to the future, planning a virtual reality headset, and four more Windows phones targeting a range of different users. That's ambitious, given how poorly the company has managed expectations so far, and how far removed the Moment is from the absurd promises and astonishing hype that WhartonBrooks generated around the device before it was finally unveiled, months later than planned. The Lumia 750 - one of several Windows phones that Microsoft cancelled when it ripped up its mobile strategy - made an appearance in an unofficial video this week. On April 25, Microsoft will release the Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update - but as feared, it won't be made available to all handsets currently supported by the OS. Microsoft confirmed on Friday that just thirteen handsets will officially receive the update, leaving many devices - including some that are still on sale today - unable to upgrade to the newest version of the OS. Those older phones will still be able to install the Creators Update via the Windows Insider Program Release Preview ring - but they will not be officially supported. Microsoft also released build 15204 for Windows 10 Mobile - its first build from the Redstone 3 development branch - but its build number is much lower than that of the latest build for PCs, raising further questions about the future of the smartphone version of the OS. Microsoft insists that the reason for the divergence in build numbers for Windows 10 Mobile compared with PCs is because it's 'converging code into OneCore', which has left many people scratching their heads. Meanwhile, Microsoft dropped key features that it announced for the Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update, and it's far from clear if they'll ever make it to devices. Indeed, with only 13 handsets supported, and its development now lagging far behind that of PCs, it's starting to look an awful lot like Windows 10 Mobile is being switched to a Windows Phone 7.8-style 'maintenance' branch, leading nowhere but a dead end. The latest Redstone 3 preview for PCs rolled out on the same day that Microsoft made its unwelcome Mobile announcement. Build 16176 is now available for PCs in the Fast ring, and you can see the fixes and known issues here. On Tuesday, Microsoft began its rollout of the Windows 10 Creators Update (developed under the Redstone 2 codename) for PCs: Overview of new features and improvements How to install the Creators Update right now A closer look at changes to privacy settings How to download and read e-books from the Windows Store in the Creators Update Windows 10 Creators Update: Microsoft Edge beats rivals in battery performance yet again Evaluation ISOs for Enterprise customers now available New firmware available for Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 running Creators Update Microsoft released updates for every version of Windows 10 this week, on PCs and phones: build 15063.138 (cumulative update for the Creators Update / Version 1703) builds 14393.1066 and 14393.1083 (Anniversary Update / Version 1607) build 10586.873 (November Update / Version 1511) build 10240.17354 (the original Windows 10 release, also known as Version 1507) Microsoft confirmed that it will officially end support for Version 1507 on May 9, 2017. Microsoft has also started blocking updates for older versions of Windows running on PCs with newer processors, as it tries to force those users to upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft is reportedly working on a new 'Tabbed Shell' for a future Windows 10 update, which would allow users to run multiple instances of the same app in a single window, with tabs to switch between them, much like a web browser. Microsoft sent out invitations for its next big event, which will be held on May 2 in New York City. With the hashtag '#MicrosoftEDU', it seems that it may have a focus on education - but it's widely expected to also discuss its new Windows 10 Cloud edition at the event. However, it's not expected to unveil the much-anticipated Surface Pro 5 there. Microsoft is including a free Surface Dock worth $199.99 with purchases of any Surface Pro 4 tablet in the United States, including the $799 entry-level model, which has an Intel Core m3 CPU, 4GB RAM and 128GB - but no Surface Pen. Leaked images revealed a new family of Windows 10 devices on the way from Huawei... ...while HP officially announced its new range of affordable Windows 10 notebooks and convertibles, with support for Windows Hello facial recognition, and active pens. Amazon is making it easier for companies to use its microphone and voice recognition technology to build devices that use its Alexa digital assistant, by making its reference design available to hardware partners. We've known for a while that Harman Kardon is working on a new speaker powered by Microsoft's Cortana digital assistant. This week, it emerged that that device will be called the 'Invoke', and will feature Skype integration - and it seems that Microsoft may be planning to invite select Windows Insiders to provide feedback on the device. Microsoft is making it a bit easier for users to share their feedback with the company. Starting with those in the Windows Insider Fast ring, it's now adding the ability to directly share content from across the OS to the Feedback Hub, making it simpler to report issues. Last year, Microsoft shipped the Windows 10 Anniversary Update with the half-baked 'Skype Preview' app as its default communication experience. After months of development - and months of endless frustrations for its users - Microsoft finally dropped the 'Preview' tag with the rollout of the Windows 10 Creators Update. It says the new Skype app is now "ready for everyday use". The "all-new Skype app" - in reality, just the newest update of the UWP version that's been in preview on PCs and phones since last year - is now available on the Xbox One too. Microsoft said that its interface has been "redesigned to put gamers first." Microsoft is introducing "self-service refunds" for apps and games on Windows 10 and the Xbox One. On Thursday, Microsoft released the Version 1704 update to all Xbox One users, bringing numerous "fan-inspired" features to its consoles. And after offering early access to its new Xbox Game Pass for the Xbox Insider Alpha and Beta Rings, Microsoft has now expanded preview availability to Ring 3. Xbox Game Pass will offer unlimited access to over 100 games for $10 a month when it launches this spring. Microsoft's Project Scorpio dev kit was revealed on Wednesday, with a similar design to the Xbox One S. The dev kit is even more powerful than the final console will be, and has some distinctive features, including double the RAM of the production model, and an OLED display on the front. Microsoft confirmed that Project Scorpio, which it calls "the most powerful console ever", will be officially unveiled at the E3 gaming expo in June. It also revealed this week that Scorpio will support FreeSync and HDMI 2.1 Variable Refresh. Call of Duty: Black Ops II was the latest (and very welcome!) addition to the list of Xbox 360 games playable on the Xbox One through the Backward Compatibility program. Microsoft is launching an official store for "community-made goodies" in Minecraft with curated content from nine professional partners, which players will pay for with new Minecraft Coins. And this news will probably come as no surprise, given that Minecraft is pretty much everywhere else - but Microsoft is launching its blocky, world-building game on the Nintendo Switch on May 11. Perhaps the most shocking news of the week was that Nintendo has officially ended production of its wonderful NES Classic Edition console. Despite enormous demand for the retro machine, Nintendo has apparently decided that it just doesn't want your money. Perhaps this guy has the right idea: a gamer built his own tiny console that squeezes into a tin of mints, powered by the brilliant Raspberry Pi micro-computer. Check out Zelda and Donkey Kong on that dinky screen! And if you think that's cool, make sure you check out HoloLems, bringing virtual reality Lemmings to your living room! But our odyssey across the tech world ends this week as it began: with fast food. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to find me some nuggs. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Rich Woods put HP's new Spectre x360 through its paces. The Windows 10 convertible device earned itself an exceptionally high score in his review, making it one of the best devices we've ever tested - thanks in no small part to its 4K display and active pen support. And Justin Luna took a trip down Memory Lane with the help of Timi Cantisano, as Microsoft terminated its extended support for Windows Vista this week. Vista was pretty, but went largely unloved, and never achieved the popularity of its successor, Windows 7. RIP. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Watch Easy To Hack, Claims Researcher. April 15, 2017 by Staff   Filed under News, Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) Promoted by adventurer Bear Grylls, the Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Watch can be hacked very easily. The recent shift from Android to Tizen is exposing Samsung’s millions of customers to the risk of being hacked remotely. A researcher named Amihai Neiderman from Israel has reported Samsung about the vulnerabilities and the company is ready to work with him to identify and fix the problems. Samsung replaced Android with its new operating system Tizen and since then, the company has launched many products in its wide ranging lineup of smartphones, TVs and smart watches. According to the researcher, Samsung’s Tizen operating system that powers Samsung Gear S3 frontier has around 40 vulnerabilities. The OS is developed by Samsung and it partners that including leading companies such as Intel and Linux Association as well. But the Israel-based developer says that the platform is developed with worst codes he has ever seen. The claims are not officially confirmed by Samsung, but according to a report published by Motherboard, Samsung has responded to its request for comments on this issue. The publication states that Samsung has released the following statement. Samsung’s statement reads, “We are fully committed to cooperating with Mr. Neiderman to mitigate any potential vulnerabilities. Through our SmartTV Bug Bounty program, Samsung is committed to working with security experts around the world to mitigate any security risks.” Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Watch is big and comes in solid stainless steel body. With a manly look, the smart watch wraps around the wrist very well as its thick bands provide perfect grip with the help of a shiny metal clasp. People who love wearing a smart watch, have many reasons to convince themselves to go for Samsung’s Gear S3 Frontier. Its barometer, altimeter, water and dust resistance capabilities and support for over 10,000 apps make it a great choice. From GPS to SOS, wireless charging to making calls on the go, Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Watch features almost everything you can think of in a smart wearable. The 4-day battery backup also makes it a must have smart watch from Samsung. The watch comes equipped with Exynos 7270, Dual 1.0GHz chipset and also supports Bluetooth and LTE connectivity. But safety is more important than anything. The claims regarding the operating system of Gear S3 Frontier Watch are majorly based on the use of old and borrowed codes. But Neiderman also highlighted the fact that the new codes are also not good because a large number of vulnerabilities discovered by him lie within the new codes. Putting the technical jargons aside, the major concern raised due to these revelations is the safety of users. If such vulnerabilities are not fixed anytime soon, there are chances that someone can break into the system and put the privacy of users at risk. Products such as Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Watch are being appreciated by a large number of people and many will surely buy it in the coming days and its potential successors as well. As Samsung has confirmed that there are many other devices scheduled for release, a majority of them will run on Tizen. So the presence of vulnerabilities will enable hackers to remotely control such devices from anywhere in the world. Now when the products like Gear S3 Frontier with rich features are giving freedom to make payment through NFC (Near Field Communication) and MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) technologies, it is highly dangerous for the users who simply rely on smart devices to manage their transactions needs. Currently, Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Watch is the best in the market, but such issues are going to make it fail on many fronts. The reported vulnerabilities and lack of applications are the major drawbacks of this smart watch. With an awesome price tag, the Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Watch is ahead of all the smartwatches available, but Samsung will have to prove itself because this time, it’s about the safety and protection of customers and their confidential information.

Caption: NextVR Skip Article Header. Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Paul Sarconi. Paul Sarconi Gear Date of Publication: 04.15.17. 04.15.17 Time of Publication: 8:30 am. 8:30 am 3-D TV Tech Finally Finds Good Use Streaming NBA Action in Virtual Reality NextVR My first five minutes watching NextVR’s livestream of a Golden State Warriors game was average by VR standards. An entertaining way of watching basketball, but nothing special. Everything changed about 10 minutes in. By that point, I usually feel a headache coming on and want to rip the headset off. I didn’t feel that, and then I realized why: the world that NextVR creates lacks the image distortion and inaccurate scale so common in VR. It looks like the real world. What makes the experience so immersive is not what you notice, but what you don’t. Even if you’ve seen sports in VR before, you’ve never seen anything like sports in NextVR. What makes it revolutionary isn’t how it looks, but how it’s created. Live VR produced by other broadcast platforms like Intel TrueVR and Fox Sports VR combines images captured by multiple cameras with a wide field of view. NextVR’s presentation relies on technology developed for 3-D gaming and television, which creates a far more immersive experience that could become the future of VR. In a League of Its Own When NextVR launched in 2009, it was developing compression technology for broadcasting 3-D content. Creating a 3-D picture requires broadcasting two images—a left-eye view and right-eye view. There’s a lot of overlap in the middle, and NextVR’s created a clever way of reducing redundancy in the two images, making 3-D video easier to transmit. Related Video Step Into the VOID, Where VR Merges With the Real World Then the 3-D TV market collapsed. In 2012, with pretty much nowhere else to go, NextVR switched to virtual reality. CEO and Co-Founder David Cole, a self-described “old dog” in VR who worked for a Kodak subsidiary in the ’90s, started meeting with the same broadcasters he met months before while pitching his 3-D tech. This time, pitching the company’s stereoscopic compression for VR. He already knew it was fast enough for live broadcasts. Sporting events—the big reason people still watch live TV—seemed a natural fit. Five years later, Cole’s company is a major player in the NBA’s forward-thinking ethos. The league, which long ago embraced social media—more than 22 million followers on Instagram alone—offered NextVR’s weekly broadcasts for free to anyone holding an NBA League Pass. It announced a multi-year deal with the company in January, and accommodates its needs in everything from camera placement to seats for its broadcasters. All of this shows in the quality of NextVR’s broadcasts. The company primarily utilized four cameras during the broadcast I watched, with on one on each basket, one at midcourt, and one roaming the stadium. That game—the Warriors played the Minnesota Timberwolves—was such a back-and-forth affair that my view mostly switched between the two hoops. I should have found the frequent cuts disorienting, but I didn’t have any trouble once I figured out when and how the camera angle would change based on the action on court. By the end, watching the game in VR felt almost as natural as watching it on television. Shoot Around This gets back to how NextVR creates content. Most in the VR industry use multiple cameras, then stitch their feeds together to create a panoramic image. Effective, but you wind up with parallax and distortion issues. NextVR’s system also uses multiple cameras, but it does far more than just capture images. It produce a 3-D mesh of what those cameras see. “Think of it as taking chicken wire and running it over everything in here,” says Cole, motioning around the arena. “Then taking everything else away and just leaving the chicken wire. That’s what you get.” The video is then projection-mapped to that 3-D frame, effectively painting in all the surfaces. This takes precise alignment, and if the projection is even slightly off, the scene looks more like a videogame than real life. But this way, the world scale feels right. The players are lifelike, and the edges of the video don’t distort. It’s a big reason why I could watch the game for 10-15 minutes, an eternity in VR. Practice Makes Perfect As good as the tech is, NextVR wants to make it even better. Company brass have weekly calls with the NBA to discuss potential improvements, and at the beginning of the season those calls were long and ripe with feedback. There have been multiple learning curves. The announcers had to change how they call a game, and the producers and directors had to learn how to transition between cameras without discombobulating viewers. Early broadcasts even lacked some of the most basic elements of sports television. “When we first started, we didn’t have replay,” says coordinating producer Josh Earl. “Graphics were difficult because of the 3-D environment. We say we went back to the ’60s as far as television goes for week one.” The company has tried to integrate new features every week, slowly building a broadcast that resembles a typical NBA game. A NextVR production now includes announcers, instant replays, graphics, even a broadcasting truck. It’s a full-fledged television operation. NextVR won’t be broadcasting the NBA playoffs, but you can still watch highlights packages and replays of some regular-season games as long as you have a Samsung Gear VR or a Google Daydream. The company will spend the offseason streaming concerts with LiveNation, and may broadcast other events, too. NextVR rarely says no, and has done everything from horse races to monster truck bonanzas. All the while, it has been developing cameras—a third-generation rig debuts for the next NBA season—and improving its compression technology to improve next season’s broadcasts. “Having an operational pressure on the company to be there every Tuesday night is tough.” says Cole. But so far it’s worked. NextVR’s virtual world—especially when contrasted against the occasionally disorienting, headache inducing real world—is a fine place to watch a game. Go Back to Top.

The index received a slight boost on Monday, primarily from energy shares, after U.S. oil prices closed at a one-month high. On Tuesday, the index slipped marginally following concerns over increase in geopolitical tensions including the U.S. attack on a Syrian air base and possible conflict with North Korea. These concerns flowed into Wednesday, leading to larger losses for the Dow. Last Week’s Performance The Dow declined marginally last Friday, dragged down by weaker-than-expected March jobs data and President Trump’s surprise attack against an airbase near Homs, Syria. Jobs data showed an increase of 98,000 jobs in March, marking the smallest gain in almost a year. Moreover, New York Fed President William Dudley’s comments hinting at a simultaneous rate hike along with Fed’s plan to reduce its balance sheet, adversely affected the equity market. Over the last week, the index declined 0.03%. During the week, stocks suffered a setback after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve. Weak auto sales data and a dip in manufacturing growth rate also had an adverse impact on the investor sentiments which eventually led the benchmarks to finish in the red. The Dow This Week The index gained marginally on Monday, boosted primarily by energy shares, which gained after U.S. oil prices closed at a one-month high. Gains in energy shares offset some geopolitical turmoil including U.S. attack on Syrian air base last Thursday. Meanwhile investors remained focus on bank earnings set to begin later this week. Financials declined as investors expressed concerns over lofty valuations of equities and raised doubts over Trump’s ability to implement his pro-growth policies. The index declined a meagre 0.03% on Tuesday as investors remained concerned over increase in geopolitical tensions including the U.S. attack on a Syrian air base and possible conflict with North Korea. Investors remained focused on upcoming corporate earnings results while they also raised questions over Trump’s ability to implement deregulation policies. Meanwhile, Trump’s comments on revamping the Dodd-Frank law helped stocks pare losses. The index lost 0.3% on Wednesday as investors remained worried about rising geopolitical concerns including U.S. strike on a Syrian air base last week and escalating tension between U.S. and North Korea. The rise in geopolitical tensions led S&P 500 and Dow industrials to finish below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since November. The market’s fear gauge touched a five-month high. Investors also kept close watch on the Presidential election in France. Components Moving the Index 3M Company (MMM – Free Report) has over 109,000 patents in various categories across its product portfolio. Over the years, the company has successfully enforced its patent rights against unauthorized uses and filed legal suits against firms that infringed them. The latest of such litigations is a patent infringement suit against China-based manufacturing firm, Phoenix Automotive Refinishing and California-based marketing firm, K2 Concepts. In the lawsuit filed in the Central District of California, 3M alleged that Phoenix violated seven patents, manufacturing some automotive painting spray gun cup products in China and selling them in the U.S. through K2 Concepts. The infringed patent relates to 3M’s PPS technology that facilitates the efficient mixing and spraying of coatings for automotive collision repair. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS – Free Report) latest live-action remake “Beauty and the Beast” is only few million away from touching the magical figure of $1 billion. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). So far “Beauty and the Beast” has grossed $984 million globally, making it the 29th highest grossing movie of all time internationally and is behind “The Dark Knight”, “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey”, “Zootopia” and “Alice in Wonderland”. To date, the movie’s overseas collections are pegged at $550.5 million and if it continues to perform at the same level then it is likely to cross $1 billion mark globally. Notably, the movie was made at a budget of nearly $160 million. (Read: Disney’s (DIS – Free Report) Beauty and the Beast Nears $1 Billion Mark) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT – Free Report) is reportedly laying off a number of employees this month in its international and technology businesses and at Sam’s Club warehouse chain. Per The Wall Street Journal, the move is part of Zacks Rank #3 rated Wal-Mart’s plans to lower expenses, owing to rising costs. The company has been witnessing increased costs due to higher investment in e-commerce operations. The company is making efforts to maintain its low-cost pricing in the U.S. retail sector and streamline stores, making them more efficient. (Read: Wal-Mart (WMT – Free Report) Announces Job Cuts to Bring Down Expenses) Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK – Free Report) announced that the FDA has denied approval to include cardiovascular outcomes data on the labels of its diabetes drug, Januvia (sitagliptin) and other medicines containing Januvia. The FDA issued a complete response letter to Zacks Rank #3 rated Merck’s supplemental new drug applications (sNDA) seeking approval to include data from the TECOS (Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin) trial on labels of Januvia, Janumet (Januvia+ metformin HCl) and Janumet XR, an extended release formulation of Janumet. Merck is reviewing the letter and will discuss further steps with the FDA. (Read: Merck’s Bid to Add Cardiovascular Data on Januvia Label Fails) Intel Corp (INTC – Free Report) has finally completed the divestiture of its majority stake in Intel Security division to alternative asset fund manager TPG. The newly spun-off unit has been renamed McAfee, with TPG holding 51% stake. As previously announced, Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rated Intel and TPG valued the security division at $4.2 billion. Per the agreement, Intel received $3.1 billion in cash and retained 49% stake post the completion of the transaction. Per an agreement with TPG, private equity firm Thoma Bravo also joined as a minority shareholder. Moreover, TPG’s investment of almost $1.1 billion in the standalone business will boost McAfee’s capital base. (Read: Intel Trims Business, Sells Majority Stake in Security Unit) Microsoft Corp (MSFT – Free Report) has acquired container technology specialist, Deis for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition will help it boost Azure Cloud’s ability to run containerized workloads. Per a blog post, Scott Guthrie, Zacks Rank #3 rated Microsoft’s Executive Vice President, Cloud and Enterprise Group, said “Containers have been at the forefront of cloud transformation in recent years, and for good reason: Container technologies let organizations more easily build, deploy and move applications to and from the cloud.” He further added that Deis will give “developers the means to vastly improve application agility, efficiency and reliability through their Kubernetes container management technologies.” Kubernetes is an open source system, designed by Alphabet’s (GOOGL – Free Report) Google, to help in automation of deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Over the last five trading days, the Dow has lost 0.3% Ticker Last 5 Day’s Performance 6-Month Performance MMM -0.2% +11.6% GS -0.5% +34.8% IBM -1.1% +11% HD -0.1% +16% BA -0.6% +32% UNH +0.6% +23.4% MCD +0.3% +13.7% TRV +0.2% +5.6% JNJ +0.6% +6% AAPL -1.6% +21.2% Next Week’s Outlook Several crucial economic reports and big bank earnings are lined up for release over the end of this week and the next. Bank earnings are likely to set the tone for the rest of the earnings releases while data on retail sales and industrial production will provide clues about the Fed’s future actions.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) WASHINGTON (AP) — Paul Manafort says he's registering with the Justice Department as a foreign agent. Michael Flynn already has. In both cases, the decisions to register by these associates of President Donald Trump came late — after the lobbying has already taken place — and accompanied by an admission that they violated federal law. The high-profile filings are putting a spotlight on the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a law enacted before World War II with the goal of unmasking foreign influence campaigns in the U.S. The idea was simple: Lobbyists and others who work on behalf of a foreign government or political interest must disclose to the Justice Department and to the public their work to sway public opinion and U.S. policy. But the cases of Manafort, who was forced out as Trump's campaign chairman, and Flynn, who was fired as the president's national security adviser, have raised questions, particularly in light of the continuing scrutiny of the foreign entanglements of several Trump associates. A few answers: ___ Q: WHAT IS THE FOREIGN AGENTS REGISTRATION ACT? A: Congress enacted the 1938 statute in response to covert Nazi propaganda agents operating in the U.S. It requires individuals who act in the U.S. on behalf of foreign political parties, people or governments to register as foreign agents with the Justice Department. Registrants are expected to disclose whom they work for and how much they're paid, and to describe their activities. They're also expected to conspicuously disclose that mailings, letters, opinion pieces or other material they distribute are on behalf of a foreign principal, and that additional details about their efforts are available in Justice Department files. There are exceptions in the law for foreign diplomats and foreign government officials, and for people engaged in solely religious, academic, commercial or scientific activities. ___ Q: HOW DOES IT WORK? A: In practice, lobbyists file reports that can list meetings, phone calls and even emails on behalf of their foreign clients. They must disclose the names of people they meet with and the issues they discussed. The foreign agent must register within 10 days of agreeing to perform the foreign work, before beginning any activities. After that, supplemental reports must be filed every six months, as long as the foreign agent work is ongoing, and the Justice Department must be notified when the agreement is terminated. The reports are posted on a searchable public website: https://www.fara.gov/ ___ Q: WHY DID FLYNN REGISTER? A: Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group, registered as foreign agents in March for work performed for a Turkish-owned business. In the registration, Flynn acknowledged that the work could have principally benefited Turkey's government. Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was on contract with the company while he was a senior Trump campaign adviser. Over the course of the three-month contract with the company, Inovo BV, Flynn's firm was paid $530,000. Flynn's filing showed the breadth of activities considered foreign-agent work. While his firm performed some lobbying, most of its work was gathering adverse information on Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames Gulen for a failed coup attempt in Turkey last summer and is pushing for the U.S. to extradite him. Gulen denies involvement, and the U.S. has rebuffed Erdogan's request. The goal of Flynn's work, according to his filing, was to develop information that would convince American officials to pursue criminal charges against Gulen. The Associated Press has since learned that Flynn's firm also pushed for a congressional investigation of Gulen during an October meeting. The request was refused. ___ Q: WHAT PROMPTED MANAFORT TO SAY HE WOULD FILE? A: His spokesman says Manafort worked to further Ukrainian political interests . Spokesman Jason Maloni confirmed the intent to register months after the AP reported that his consulting firm had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraine's ruling political party. That effort, from 2012 through 2014, was never disclosed to the Justice Department. Maloni said Manafort began discussions with the U.S. government about his lobbying activities after he joined the Trump campaign. It's unclear whether the conversations came before or after Trump forced Manafort to resign his post, on the same day as the AP report of unregistered lobbying. The Podesta Group, a Washington lobbying firm, has already retroactively registered for its part in the Ukrainian influence campaign. The firm was one of two that worked under the direction of Manafort and his former deputy, Rick Gates. The other firm involved, Mercury LLC, says it also will register soon. ___ Q: DOES RETROACTIVE REGISTRATION FLOUT THE LAW? A: Perhaps, although the Justice Department favors administrative enforcement over criminal punishment and sees value in disclosure no matter when it's made. "The statute's purpose isn't necessarily served by after-the-fact registration, especially where the registration is after the activity on behalf of a foreign interest has ceased," said Stephen Vladeck, a national security law professor at the University of Texas at Austin.

"But for better or worse, DOJ has at least sometimes allowed individuals to escape liability by registering after the fact, especially in cases in which the initial failure to register appeared to be negligent, not intentional," Vladeck wrote in an email. In a statement, the Justice Department said it always strives for compliance with the registration requirement and to ensure the accuracy of information about the political activities of those who register. "This is true whether such information pertains to current or past activity," the statement read. "Requiring registration for past activities ensures that these objectives are met and that an accurate public record is created and maintained." ___ Q: WHY ARE THESE CASES ONLY RARELY PROSECUTED? A: Transparency, rather than punishment, is the law's primary purpose. "Not every violation is worth prosecuting," said Amy Jeffress, a former Justice Department national security official. Federal prosecutors typically don't prosecute failure to disclose unless they can prove that it was intentional, she said. Dan Pickard, a partner at the Washington law firm Wiley Rein, said that proving criminal intent can be difficult because of the obscurity of the foreign agent law. "To show a willful intent not to register is a tall order," Pickard said. An August report from the department's inspector general's office counted seven criminal cases under the law between 1966 and 2015, and cited "differing understandings" between FBI officials and Justice Department prosecutors about the statute's intent. Justice Department officials believe the law's primary purpose is not to secure criminal convictions. They cite a separate statute, which makes it a crime to spy or conduct other espionage-like activities on behalf of a foreign government, as a point of focus. But FBI officials say they believe federal prosecutors aren't aggressive enough in pursuing punishments for people who fail to register. ___ Q: HOW DOES THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ENFORCE THE LAW? A: A small staff in the Foreign Agent Registration Act unit keeps the records and undertakes open-source research. The unit routinely combs the Lobbying Disclosure Act database and news reports looking for lobbying work that should be disclosed as foreign agent work. When the unit finds a likely case, it sends letters of inquiry to the lobbying firms, asking them to turn over documentation and to register as foreign agents if the work qualifies. There's a catch, though. The letters don't have the same power as a subpoena, meaning the unit relies on voluntary disclosure. The Justice Department has pushed for Congress to grant subpoena authority in cases going back to the early 1990s. So far, Congress hasn't given it. ___ Follow Chad Day and Eric Tucker on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ChadSDay and https://twitter.com/etuckerAP Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

A: Perhaps, although the Justice Department favors administrative enforcement over criminal punishment and sees value in disclosure no matter when it's made. "The statute's purpose isn't necessarily served by after-the-fact registration, especially where the registration is after the activity on behalf of a foreign interest has ceased," said Stephen Vladeck, a national security law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. "But for better or worse, DOJ has at least sometimes allowed individuals to escape liability by registering after the fact, especially in cases in which the initial failure to register appeared to be negligent, not intentional," Vladeck wrote in an email. In a statement, the Justice Department said it always strives for compliance with the registration requirement and to ensure the accuracy of information about the political activities of those who register. "This is true whether such information pertains to current or past activity," the statement read. "Requiring registration for past activities ensures that these objectives are met and that an accurate public record is created and maintained." ___ Q: WHY ARE THESE CASES ONLY RARELY PROSECUTED? A: Transparency, rather than punishment, is the law's primary purpose. "Not every violation is worth prosecuting," said Amy Jeffress, a former Justice Department national security official. Federal prosecutors typically don't prosecute failure to disclose unless they can prove that it was intentional, she said. Dan Pickard, a partner at the Washington law firm Wiley Rein, said that proving criminal intent can be difficult because of the obscurity of the foreign agent law. "To show a willful intent not to register is a tall order," Pickard said. An August report from the department's inspector general's office counted seven criminal cases under the law between 1966 and 2015, and cited "differing understandings" between FBI officials and Justice Department prosecutors about the statute's intent. Justice Department officials believe the law's primary purpose is not to secure criminal convictions. They cite a separate statute, which makes it a crime to spy or conduct other espionage-like activities on behalf of a foreign government, as a point of focus. But FBI officials say they believe federal prosecutors aren't aggressive enough in pursuing punishments for people who fail to register. ___ Q: HOW DOES THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ENFORCE THE LAW? A: A small staff in the Foreign Agent Registration Act unit keeps the records and undertakes open-source research. The unit routinely combs the Lobbying Disclosure Act database and news reports looking for lobbying work that should be disclosed as foreign agent work. When the unit finds a likely case, it sends letters of inquiry to the lobbying firms, asking them to turn over documentation and to register as foreign agents if the work qualifies. There's a catch, though. The letters don't have the same power as a subpoena, meaning the unit relies on voluntary disclosure. The Justice Department has pushed for Congress to grant subpoena authority in cases going back to the early 1990s. So far, Congress hasn't given it.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement HP introduces its 2017 Pavilion and Pavilion x360 notebook lineup 04/13/2017 at 8:00 AM by Brad Linder 1 Comment HP is updating its Pavilion line of consumer notebooks with new 14, 15.6, and 17.3 inch laptops and a new line of Pavilion x360 convertibles featuring 11.6 inch, 14 inch, and 15.6 inch displays. The 2017 lineup is thinner and lighter than earlier Pavilion notebooks, and some models also pick up a few premium touches that had previously only been available on more expensive HP Envy or Spectre models. The new laptops should be available in May or June, and prices start at around $349 for an entry-level model. That entry level machine is actually the one I’m most interested in, because this is a website about little computers, and for $399 what HP is selling is an 11.6 inch Pavilion x360 convertible with an Intel Pentium N4200 processor, 4GB of RAM, and a 500GB hard drive. For that price you also get a digital pen: all of HP’s new Pavilion x360 convertibles support pen and finger input, and the pen is a standard feature, not an optional accessory. HP says the laptop should get up to 8.5 hours of battery life, and supports fast charging: you should be able to get a 90 percent charge in about 90 minutes — something HP is promising for all of its new Pavilion laptops. Other features include stereo speaker tuned by Bang & Olufsen, a 1366 x 768 pixel IPS display, and an 88 degree HD webcam. The 11.6 inch HP Pavilion x360 measures 11.6″ x 7.9″ x 0.8″ and weighs about 3.1 pounds. HP may also offer model with up to a Core i3 processor or up to 8GB of RAM, but the RAM is not user accessible, so there’s no way to upgrade if you buy a model with 4GB and later decide that you want more. Larger Pavilion x360 models are available with HD and full HD display options and support up to a Core i7 CPU and optional NVIDIA GeForce 940 or Radeon 530 graphics. The 14 inch model supports up to 12GB of RAM, and the 15.6 inch convertible can be configured with up to 16GB. The larger models can also be configured with SSDs, hard drives, or both. They support dual storage, thanks to M.2 slots for solid state storage and 2.5 inch bays for hard drives. Storage options top out at 512GB for solid state storage and 1TB for hard drives (so you can get up to 1.5TB of total storage). One more difference between the 11.6 inch Pavilion x360 and its larger siblings? The smallest model has three full-sized USB 3.1 ports, while the larger models have two full-sized ports and a USB 3.1 Type-C port. HP’s 14, 15.6, and 17.3 inch Pavilion notebooks are all available with a choice of Intel or AMD chips, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage (with hard drive, SSD, and dual storage options). NVIDIA and AMD graphics options are also available. While the Pavilion line is still aimed at HP’s more value-oriented customers, the new models do take a few design cues from the company’s more expensive Envy line, including a sloping keyboard design with a diamond cut touchpad, a metal keyboard dock (the area around the keyboard, and a “lift hinge” design (when you open the laptop, the back of the lid extends down below the keyboard to give the keyboard it’s slope). Prices start at $600 for an entry-level HP Pavilion 15 laptop, $700 for a 14 inch model, or $630 for an HP Pavilion 17.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Microsoft’s next Surface device may be Cloudbook education laptop 04/13/2017 at 10:59 AM by Brad Linder 4 Comments Microsoft is holding an education-focused event in New York City next month, and word on the street is that this will be where Microsoft officially launches Windows Cloud. While early builds of the operating system have already been leaked, Microsoft has yet to officially confirm its existence. But the company may also have new hardware to compliment the new software. And it looks like that may be a new Microsoft Surface Cloudbook… or something like that. Everex Cloudbook MSPowerUser puts together a few different leaks and rumors to come to that conclusion. It’s still not entirely clear if the new device will have the Surface name. And there have been some rumors that it’ll feature an ARM-based processor, but it’s also possible that the Cloudbook could have an Intel chip. What’s in a name? The name’s a bit… confusing. First of all, this wouldn’t be the first Cloudbook. Acer launched a cheap Windows laptop called the Acer Aspire One Cloudbook in 2015. And way back in 2008, a company called Everex had a line of netbooks sold under the Cloudbook name. But the name sort of makes sense when you think of the Surface Cloudbook as a device designed to run Windows 10 Cloud… and when you think of Windows 10 Cloud as a stripped-down, cheap version of Windows designed, at least in part, to compete with Chromebooks. Windows Cloud is expected to be locked down in a way that only allows you to run apps downloaded from the Windows Store. But unlike Microsoft’s ill-fated Windows RT, the new Windows Cloud operating system will support both Universal Windows Platform apps and Win32 programs (assuming they’ve been packaged for the Windows Store). Anyway, what we do know is that there’s something called Windows Cloud. We’re also pretty sure there’s something called Cloudbook. And there’s a set of education-oriented apps in the Windows Store that are bundled under the cloudbook ID. I’m going to go out on a limb and speculate that Cloudbook may not refer to a single device, but a new category of low-cost, low-specced computers designed to run Windows Cloud software. The “cloud” in the name could refer to an emphasis on running web-based software, which means we could perhaps see devices with small amounts of storage… much as we do with Chromebooks (they typically have just 16GB or 32GB  of storage, although some models have as much as 64GB). But even if Cloudbook is the name of a new category and not just a single device, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a Surface Cloudbook launch at Microsoft’s May 2nd event. Surface is sort of like Microsoft’s Pixel or Nexus brand: the company produces hardware that showcases some of the best of its software not only to sell hardware, but also to encourage other device makers to launch their own related products. Since the first Surface tablets launched in 2012 we’ve seen a number of PC makers launch Surface-style -2in-1 tablets. Maybe the Surface Cloudbook will be the first of a new class of Windows-powered notebooks. What remains to be seen is whether there’s actually a market for notebooks running a crippled version of Windows at a time when it’s not exactly hard to find a full-fledged Windows laptop for under $200. Why education? There’s one more important piece to the puzzle to consider: the May 2nd event is focused on education. As PC World points out, Chromebooks have become popular choices for classroom use, and that’s not only because they’re cheap. Chrome OS is also a relatively secure operating system since apps run in a sandboxed environment and updates are downloaded and installed automatically, helping IT administrators ensure that security vulnerabilities are patched quickly. Google also offers educators tools for managing Chromebooks in the classroom. When considered in this light, a locked-down version of Windows actually looks like an advantage. Microsoft may position Windows Cloud as an operating system first and foremost for use in classrooms (and maybe business settings), where educators (and managers) may not want to give laptop users total control over the software running on their devices. So while I’m skeptical that Windows Cloud will be a success if Microsoft’s goal is to compete on price in the consumer space, there’s a chance the company could make some inroads in the education space by focusing on the areas that make Chromebooks attractive: price and classroom management features. The move could also open a new revenue stream for Microsoft if the company launches additional hardware and software services for educators to rival those offered by Google.     Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 4 Comments on "Microsoft’s next Surface device may be Cloudbook education laptop" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest BoloMKXXVIII Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

(AP Photo/The St. Cloud Times, Jason Wachter) While all eyes turn to the gunfire and Molotov cocktails of War Zone Ferguson, Mo., many minds turn to questions of mindless faith in the political establishment. What’s happening to us? One such mind belongs to basketball champion turned actor and best-selling author, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, whose Monday commentary on Ferguson for Time Magazine bore the chilling headline, "The Coming Race War Won’t Be About Race." It will be about class warfare, he predicted, the powerful and wealthy elite against the 50 million Americans who are poor – black, Latino and white. “Fifty million voters is a powerful block if they ever organized in an effort to pursue their common economic goals,” Abdul-Jabbar wrote. This great icon’s class warfare insight reaches farther than he knows, into the multimillions of marginalized, demonized and despised workers of the resource class — loggers, coal miners, cattle ranchers, commercial fishermen, oil rig roustabouts, tunnel blasters, heavy equipment operators, and on and on, every one of us who gets dirty hands making the stuff of elite splendor and majesty — and, yes, I once shoveled foundation trenches and shouldered kegs of ten-penny brights (nails) for a living. All these hardworking people are mocked, devalued and destroyed by Big Green’s privileged few, as told in the recent Senate report, “How a Club of Billionaires and Their Foundations Control the Environmental Movement and Obama’s EPA.” It’s a class warfare warning. Natural Resources Defense Council President Frances Beinecke (heiress of the Sperry & Hutchinson fortune) doesn’t help the poor with their economic goals using her $427,595 annual compensation or the group’s $241.8 million assets, but ruins every resource worker possible. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation’s chief investment officer, Denise Strack, doesn’t help the poor with their economic goals using her $1.6 million annual compensation or the foundation’s $5.6 billion assets from the Intel fortune, but helps ruin every resource worker possible. Big Green conducts class war with its power over the federal government. If that sounds impossible, let me tell you a story. On July 27, 1991, 30 U.S. Forest Service agents on horseback, some armed with semi-automatic weapons and wearing bulletproof vests, raided rancher Wayne Hage’s cattle in Meadow Canyon in the Toiyabe National Forest, high in the mountains of central Nevada. The cows were drinking from disputed water and were to be impounded that day, destroying Hage’s livelihood — and dooming some of the meat supply that gave minimum-wage urban burger flippers something to flip. The agents hoped to infuriate Hage into violence and kill him. However, he showed up with a camera, immortalized them on film, sued them, and after years in a federal court, won a ruling that he owned the water. The Forest Service had no right to impound his cattle. A court document showed that David Young, special agent in charge of the raid, had personally brought with him several Remington Model 870 pump-action 12 gauge shotguns, Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic rifles, Sig Sauer P220 .45 caliber semi-automatic pistols and a Smith & Wesson Model 36 .38 caliber revolver. On April 2, 1990, Deputy Chief of the U.S. Forest Service James C. Overbay sent a letter to his subordinate regional foresters, urging support of environmentalists in return for their help supporting larger Forest Service fish and wildlife budgets, removal of ranchers, and expansion of USFS authority and power. It said: “Conservation groups representing the organized wildlife and fish interests across the country have given considerable effort, time, and money to help the Forest Service promote these important programs. We need the support of these groups to avoid possible reductions in fish and wildlife budgets. They would like to see the results of these efforts. We owe this to them.” A little over a year later, the Forest Service paid off rich environmentalists by ruining Wayne Hage. The service's culture of resource stewardship was drifting far from its conservation roots to political obsequiousness and ostentatious zeal. Overbay had already devastated other ranchers with less publicity, but it was the Hage raid that reinforced Cliven Bundy’s misguided beliefs about federal authority and led to President Obama’s Bureau of Land Management storming the Bundy ranch from attack helicopters duded up in military-grade body armor, flashing short-barreled assault rifles, and crashing around in armored vehicles – enough combat equipment to remove the tinfoil hat stigma from the black helicopter crowd’s collective head. As John Steinbeck famously wrote in The Grapes of Wrath: “Repression works only to strengthen and knit the oppressed.” A rabble in arms materialized from all over the West to protect the Bundy ranch – ready to die. It was blatant armed insurrection, but federal prudence prevailed and the BLM stood down – prosecutors are dealing with it now. The militarization of federal agencies has a long history but should have a short future. Big Green’s federal power grip needs to be smashed and its storm troopers disarmed. In June, Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, introduced the Regulatory Agency Demilitarization Act, to stem the trend of federal regulatory agencies developing SWAT-like teams. Maybe it’s unrealistic, but perhaps Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could recommend a diplomatic mission from the poor to the reviled workers of the resource class, put aside any past hurts and hates for a while, and organize in an effort to pursue their common economic goals.

Ace Computers CEO John Samborski said, “Many public sector and enterprise users are migrating from desktops/PCs to workstations now. For any demanding application such as product simulation and digital forensics the difference in performance is remarkable.” Samborski added that Ace Computers continues to recommend and provide desktops for some applications such as K-12 schools and small to mid-sized enterprises. Ace Computers’ clients generally opt for workstations over PCs because of high performance and increased durability—two areas that are especially important for sensitive/intensive applications where technology tends to be pushed hard 24x7x365 such as product simulation, digital forensics, and deep learning projects, “A workstation opens up new capabilities that can help increase productivity, improve reliability, and limit downtime,” Samborski said. “The options for workstations are constantly evolving. Part of the reason we have been so successful is that we stay on top of and evaluate these options even before they enter the marketplace. We are always on the leading edge of proven technology, but never the bleeding edge. So our clients—whether public or public sector always get an expertly designed workstation that performs to their exacting specifications and is capable of expanding along with the organization.” While workstations cost more than desktops, the cost is recouped through faster productivity and streamlined operations. Speed gains are often significant; greater than 500%. The motherboard, internal drive, RAM, etc. are usually more robust than desktop components and are optimized for peak performance. Even an entry-level workstation can be configured with about twice the memory of a desktop. A workstation can also be configured with a larger number of more powerful processors than a PC. Because Ace Computers designs workstations from the ground up it is easy to add hard drives and graphics cards and increase RAM. It is also possible to later create multiple workstations with the same configuration as the organization grows. Leading custom computer builder and HPC cluster specialist, Ace Computers currently holds the following contracts: SEWP V, CCS-2, GSA, WSIPC, PEPPM, State of Wis., State of Ga. The company is a Woman-Owned Small Business custom technology systems manufacturer and reseller for the public sector as well as the commercial sector. Channel partners include Intel, Supermicro, NVIDIA, Mellanox and Samsung among others. Ace Computers is an authorized Microsoft Surface Partner. An industry leader since 1983, the company is a 2016 HPCwire Readers’ Choice Award finalist. In addition to some of the finest academic institutions in the U.S., long-term clients include the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of Defense. In addition to our Greater Chicago headquarters, Ace Computers has locations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Nevada.

The Samsung Chromebook Plus proves them wrong thanks to great hardware, a beautiful touchscreen and the S Pen. It also runs Android apps well. That’s why we listed it as one of the best Chromebooks of 2017. Students will love the Samsung Chromebook Plus because the S Pen, normally found only on the Galaxy Note phones and tablets, makes taking notes easy. Owners can read and write with less eye strain, thanks to the great screen. The Samsung Chromebook Plus feels small enough to carry from class to class and the battery lasts long enough to enjoy some entertainment back in the dorm later that night. These same reasons mean business users will enjoy taking it on the road and using it for work and play. In fact, most consumers will love the Chromebook Plus. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Touchscreen The 12.3-inch touchscreen on the Samsung Chromebook plus excels at almost every category of evaluation. It’s bright and comfortable to use even in bright settings. I used it at 50% most of the time, which also extends the already great battery life. The colors on the display look nice and the high-resolution displays text clearly with crisp sharp quality. It’s easy to read using the screen even for long times. Controlling the computer using touch in laptop mode feels more comfortable now that we’re getting used to touchscreens. I hate that my MacBook doesn’t let me scroll quickly with a flick of my finger on a touchscreen. Once you get used to the quick motion, you miss it on devices without one. We’ll look at the S Pen below. The palm rejection helps note takers and artists in the right apps. The system works so much better than my iPad Pro with Apple Pencil or any other active or passive stylus setup. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Hardware Design The computer looks almost like a square with 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ dimensions. It’s not square, but looks it and that’s a good thing when using touch or the pen. the 3:2 aspect ratio seems more natural for a tablet. Samsung gave the Chromebook Plus an aluminum chassis. The textured surface on the lid and around the keyboard feels nice and looks great. It’s also super thin and sleek. The bezel around the display gives the user enough space to hold the computer in tablet mode. Its hinges give enough stability without making it hard to open and close. The combo headphone/mic audio jack sits on the back left edge closest to the screen. There’s also a USB-C 3.1 port next to that and a micro-SD card reader with a door that covers it. The right edge holds the S Pen silo closest to the screen. Next we get the second USB-C port, the power button and LED status light and volume up/down rocker buttons. This right-side USB port also charges the computer, but the left-side port doesn’t. The 2-in-1 convertible design means you have the option of using the Chromebook as a traditional laptop plus tent mode as seen above or stand mode. Bend the screen back so that you can lay the keyboard facing down on a table and use just the screen with touch or the S Pen as seen below. Samsung Chromebook Plus: S Pen Keyboard and Trackpad The input devices on the Samsung Chromebook Plus mostly add to the devices quality. The S Pen works with the screen to create a great writing experience. We get the best palm rejection using apps that support it, like my favorite Android note-taking app Squid, formerly Papyrus.  Metamoji Note is another great Android note-taker. Other active digitizer pens let users rest their palms on the screen, but some of them don’t work as well as the S Pen on the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The S Pen supports pressure sensitivity and writes or draws smoothly. Slide it into the silo on the right side of the keyboard to stow it. Don’t worry. It can’t go in wrong, so you won’t damage it like the S Pen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Speaking of older Samsung S Pens, I miss the buttons that give the user a right-click. The spacious and responsive trackpad sits below the keyboard and doesn’t get in the way. I didn’t accidentally touch it with my palm while typing. The keyboard feels a little mushy, but I got used to it quickly. Typing on it accurately isn’t difficult after getting used to the feel. It’s narrower than a typical keyboard, which also takes time to adjust to. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Performance and Battery Life The performance seems great. The computer scored 9159 on Octane, a useful benchmarking website. That’s a decent score when running the benchmark over a slow public Wi-Fi hotspot. Other computers that run on an Intel processor will smoke the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The ARM processor in the Samsung Chromebook Plus runs quickly compared to other ARM Chromebooks. It reboots in seconds and apps jump to fill the screen. Open a dozen tabs in Chrome before it really slows down. Even though the Chromebook generally runs quickly, it suffers one problem. Closing the lid and letting it sleep, then opening it often causes it to freeze and reboot within about 30 minutes. I’m not the only one with the problem. A Reddit thread includes a bunch of other owners with the same or similar issues. A few of those in the thread replaced their Chromebook and didn’t experience problems with their second machine. I fixed this problem with a total reinstall of the operating system. Look for a How To post on that very soon. Until then, use Google’s help site, which explains how to download ChromeOS onto a USB flash drive or card and then restore the OS using recovery mode. This forces a fresh install, which downloads the OS and reinstalls it from a flash drive or SD card. Since then, the freezes have gone away. The battery of the Samsung Chromebook Plus lasts longer than most. Notice in the screenshot above that with 85% battery life left, the OS estimates about 8:23 until it runs out of power. I’ve used the Chromebook for as long as 2 hours at a time and it typically drops by only 15% resulting in about 12-14 hours of use depending on usage and screen brightness. The screen stays at about 50%. Users may not want to use the Samsung Chromebook Plus for multimedia, like streaming music or viewing videos online, unless they plan to hook up headphones or external speakers. The downward facing speakers pump very little volume. In a moderately loud environment, you have to boost volume 100% to tell that sound is coming out. With decent external speakers, playing through an HDMI TV with good speakers or hooking up a nice set of headphones fixes the problem. That is how most people listen to audio on a laptop anyway. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Software ChromeOS powers the Samsung Chromebook Plus with a new addition: the Google Play Store and Android apps. Before Google added the Play Store, the Chromebook seemed so simple. Users can load Chrome Apps (see the Chrome Web Store above) that run in Chrome browser or a window that may not look like Chrome, but still is. If you want to reset the Chromebook, just run something called a Powerwash. This erases the Chromebook and reinstalls the operating system. You log back in with your Google account and within a few minutes all the apps and settings come to life. Adding Android apps makes this Powerwash process a little more complicated, especially if you run Android apps that need a lot of setting up or must download files to work, like my Bible apps. Google partially fixed the problem by automatically downloading most of the apps installed on the Chromebook before the Powerwash. In spite of the added complexity of Android apps, running a Chromebook got a lot more interesting after Google added the Play Store. I don’t install all the apps that I run on the Google Pixel XL. A lot of those apps do things that a user can do inside Chrome as well or better. However, a few of the best Android apps find a fitting home on ChromeOS. Microsoft doesn’t let users install the mobile Word, PowerPoint and Excel apps on any screen larger than 10-inches. That means no Android versions of these apps on my Chromebook. You have to run the online versions instead. That’s the only Android app I miss. The rest of my apps work fine on the device. You can install the apps by side loading them, but that’s not for the beginning user. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Specs Hexa-core Dual Arm Cortex A72 2GHz Processor 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM 32GB eMMC storage Model Number – XE513C24-K01US 12.3-inch LCD Touchscreen Display with 2400 x 1600 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio and 400 nit brightness 2-in-1 rotating display Shared integrated graphics 2 1.5watt stereo speakers facing down 720p webcam 802.11ac/a/b/g/n Wi-Fi with Marvell 88W997 wireless card Bluetooth 4.0 Headphone mic combo audio port 2 USB-C 3.1 ports (up to 5Gbps and 4K display output with optional adapter) 1 micro-SD card slot Spill resistant 74-key keyboard S Pen 2-cell Li-ion 5140mAh batter with 39 watt hours Dimensions – 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ Weight – 2.38lbs The Bottom Line Samsung makes the best Chromebook money can buy. It will get better when they release the Samsung Chromebook Pro, which adds an Intel Core M processor making it faster, but reducing battery life. The Samsung Chromebook Plus includes the excellent S Pen with great palm rejection while writing or drawing. The bright and sharp screen displays text, video and images beautifully and lets users turn down brightness to extend the already great battery life. I experienced freezes and frequent crashes at first. However, the problem seems isolated and a swap at the store or reinstalling the OS should fix the problem. Let’s hope Samsung can find out what’s wrong and fix it with an update. The mushy narrow keyboard might cause some to struggle as they type. I’ve got big hands and got used to the size and the feel of the keys after a couple days. At $449, or on sale at Best Buy for $419 in April 2017 or $369 for students until May 6, the price might cause some potential buyers to pause since other Chromebooks cost as low as $200. None of those cheaper machines comes with the great S Pen or excellent screen. Few offer battery life as long as the Samsung Chromebook Plus.   2 Responses 04/15/2017 Michael Perry Reply Thanks for a very nice review. I have the Samsung Chromebook Plus and have been using it for about two weeks now having purchased at a reduced cost from Amazon Prime. The things I enjoy are the fun I get from it installing new games and seeing how they run. I have had good luck with so many different games like SimCity Buildit and Shadowmatic. I wish they would fix the immersive screen and allow a switch in the on screen keyboard to turn this on. I have not sideloaded the MS apps since most of my docs are google docs. I do have OfficeSuite Pro installed which seems to be set up for chromebooks and it has support for OneDrive and Google Drive which is nice. It also runs quite well on the Plus and allows editing and saving of word, powerpoint, and excel files. Its worth “noting” that OneNote is present and can be installed. The screen ratio and brightness is something which has amazed me a few times. This is a nice small form factor laptop hybrid thing and I have used it in tablet, tent, and laptop. I have not used the touch screen that much in non tablet modes. I will experiment with that. I did load almost all the apps on my Pixel and as I mentioned I love trying new games that come out to see how they play. I am not a demanding gamer but its fun to see them run in full screen or immersive mode on the Plus. I wish Google would make the tablet form factor a bit easier but the S-pen makes it nicer. There are so many nice touches with the Plus! I am planning a long trip to Asia later in the year and will be taking the Plus with the select group of Android apps plus Skype or another SIP client to make calls. 04/15/2017 oldman65 Reply Great review. However I scored 10080 with octane 2 when my Samsung plus is connected to a socket, and I replaced Microsoft Office by Google Office ( Suite) long long time ago and never missed it. Most Web applications are great with a Chromebooks but having the possibility to run Android applications is definitevely a plus. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

The sci-fi in games and other entertainment used to be really out there, divorced from real-life technology and the near future. But then came lightning fast advances in artificial intelligence for voice services and self-driving cars, and that blurred the line between sci-fi and Silicon Valley. Masayoshi Son, CEO of Japan’s SoftBank conglomerate, bought ARM for $32 billion. Why? He wanted to build the Singularity, or the day when A.I. becomes smarter than the collective intelligence of humans. When I heard Son say that he was preparing to invest for the Singularity, I was astounded by his ambition. Above: Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi But he’s not alone. This movement prompted Eliot Peper, an author that I’ll talk more about below, to ask the question, “Are we living in science fiction?” And it moved Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO of Nvidia, to say, “I don’t really have to watch science fiction because I’m in science fiction today.” Novels such as Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash inspired Silicon Valley’s virtual worlds, like Second Life. Blade Runner, The Matrix, Inception, Black Mirror, Ex Machina, The Terminator, and HBO’s new remake of Westworld have also inspired new visions for technology companies and new plots for video game stories. Sci-fi and video games are a mirror for our own times. This is a longhand way of saying that changes are coming really fast, and real life is surpassing what was once science fiction, and that the feedback cycle for inspiration and creativity in games, sci-fi, and tech is accelerating. That’s why I chose this as the theme for GamesBeat Summit, our conference coming on May 1-2 in Berkeley. I’m going to try to explain why I truly believe that you have to be there. I feel that I was in a good spot to see the connections, as I have covered games for 20 years and written about technology for more than 25 years. Months ago, this idea of cross fertilization between different creative industries was just a vision. But I’m happy to say we’re living up to that vision with our event. Tim Sweeney, who recently waxed poetically about how building the Metaverse from Snow Crash is now possible, will lead off our event. One of our key speakers is John Underkoffler, CEO of Oblong Industries. Back in 2002, Underkoffler was the science adviser for the landmark sci-fi film Minority Report. In 2006, Underkoffler started Oblong Industries to take the ideas from Minority Report and build the next generation of computing interfaces. In 2012, the company began selling commercial versions of that interface, the Mezzanine platform for immersive visual collaboration. He’s going to give a talk at GamesBeat Summit about how games are the vanguard of the user interface, the value of working at visual scale, and advanced user interfaces as “empathy machines.” His talk is going to go above my head, and I’m going to like that. We’re also going to pair Underkoffler on stage with some very interesting people that we’ll announce soon. Above: Tom Cruise in Minority Report inspired lots of tech and game companies. Image Credit: 20th Century Fox Underkoffler is one of many people who will speak to our theme. What I have found interesting about the process of organizing this conference is that we’re exposing connections that already existed between science fiction, technology, and games. Jamil Moledina of Google Play will be our emcee, and he’s tight with Gary Whitta, the screenwriter for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. They’ll be doing a fireside chat. Intel’s Kim Pallister, a virtual reality expert, will get on stage with one of his favorite novelists, Austin Grossman, author of Soon I Will Be Invincible, YOU: a novel, and Crooked. Tim Chang, managing director of Mayfield Fund and an investor in Playdom and Ngmoco, will moderate a fireside chat with his friend Eliot Peper, author of Cumulus, Neon Fever Dream, and the Uncommon Series. Peper has also worked as an entrepreneur-in-residence at a venture capital firm and has helped build various technology businesses. We’ve also got a pair of friends talking about real-world starts, the brain, and sci-fi: Rob Reid, founder of Listen.com and a sci-fi author of Year Zero and the upcoming After On. He’ll be moderated by Adam Gazzaley, a neuroscientist at UCSF and visionary about the connection between games and the brain. We’ve got some surprising pairings, like Rod Chong of Slightly Mad Studios, maker of the video game Project Cars. He’s going on stage with Laszlo Kishonti, CEO of AImotive, a self-driving car software company that tested its technology using the video game. Tech journalist Violet Blue and Ubisoft game developer Thomas Geffroyd will speak about the appeal and challenges of creating realistic fiction in Watch Dogs 2, a game about a “hacktivist” cyber gang set in the hacker culture of San Francisco. Both Blue and Geffroyd helped unearth the real stories and culture that Ubisoft imported into the game. Above: DedSec is the hacker group in Watch Dogs 2. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi We also have speakers who are not focused on the science fiction and tech theme. But they related to it in a different way. Akshay Khanna, an executive at the Philadelphia 76ers, will talk with Greg Richardson, chairman of Team Dignitas, an esports team acquired by the 76ers. This talk is about the seams between physical sports and esports. And since we are not divorced from the real world, we’ll talk about the issues of leadership that have arisen since the election of Donald Trump. Ted Price, CEO of Insomniac Games, will talk about leadership with Mike Gallagher, CEO of the Entertainment Software Association. We’ve got a panel, dubbed Bucking the Status Quo, that will also take on leadership issues. And on a completely different subject, we have Michael Condrey and Glen Schofield, founders of Sledgehammer Games. They’re next in line to make the new Call of Duty game this year, and they’ll talk about what it takes to inspire creativity in teams that have to make a Call of Duty game feel like new. Owen Mahoney, CEO of Nexon, will also riff on inspiring creativity. Above: Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare debuted in 2014. Sledgehammer games made it. Image Credit: Activision We’ll explore some relevant topics like the rise of China in the global game industry, and we’ll close with a fireside chat between Rich Hilleman of Amazon Game Studios and Chris Roberts, CEO of Roberts Space Industries.

HIDESHOW NAVIGATION Top Stories Governor Senate Congress Harrisburg Features Search for: PA-13: Boyle Calls for Investigation Into Claims Russia is Blackmailing Trump Written by Nick Field, Managing Editor Congressman Brendan Boyle wants to get to the bottom of claims that Russia is blackmailing President-Elect Donald Trump. “If true, the intelligence report outlining allegations of Russia’s possession of compromising personal and financial information about President-elect Donald Trump is beyond unsettling and sheds great light on Mr. Trump’s oddly sympathetic approach to Russia and its meddling in our election, as determined by our intelligence community,” Rep. Boyle stated. “If substantiated or verified, I will call for a formal, bipartisan congressional investigation into these scandalous and disturbing allegations.” As reported by CNN, a two-page addendum on the matter was included in the latest briefing for President Obama, President-Elect Trump and Congressional leaders. The thirty-five page dossier, compiled by a former member of British Intelligence, was then released by Buzzfeed. While the information has not been verified, it has been deemed credible. While I know there are some salacious details in the Intel report, it's important people focus on the explosive charge re: Trump lawyer 1/2 — Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) January 11, 2017 If Intel report is true, it would be the most treacherous and criminal act in US political history. Congress must investigate immediately. — Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) January 11, 2017 This is NOT about R or D! I mean does anyone think this would ever be an issue with John McCain? Or Romney? Or both Bushes? Of course not. — Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) January 11, 2017 Boyle currently sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The 13th Congressional District represents Northeast Philadelphia and Southern Montgomery County.

Robert Guzzardi says: January 12, 2017 at 1:37 pm The Sordid History of the Firm Behind the Trump-Russia Dossier Meet Fusion GPS. 7:15 AM, JAN 12, 2017 | By MARK HEMINGWAY Thursday’s New York Times has a report on how the highly suspicious dossier alleging that Donald Trump was compromised by Russian intelligence agents came into existence. Among the other interesting revelations was that the dubious opposition research report was put together by the research firm Fusion GPS: The story began in September 2015, when a wealthy Republican donor who strongly opposed Mr. Trump put up the money to hire a Washington research firm run by former journalists, Fusion GPS, to compile a dossier about the real estate magnate’s past scandals and weaknesses, according to a person familiar with the effort. The person described the opposition research work on condition of anonymity, citing the volatile nature of the story and the likelihood of future legal disputes. The identity of the donor is unclear. What’s interesting about this revelation is that Fusion GPS has an institutional reputation for doing shoddy and underhanded political work, and nearly all of it has been at the behest of Democrats looking to attack Republicans. In 2012, Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberly Strassel did some blockbuster reporting on Fusion GPS’s alarming efforts to dig up dirt on donors to Mitt Romney and socially conservative causes: Robert Guzzardi says: January 12, 2017 at 1:18 pm Good idea. BuzzFeed was all too ready to report Fake News. The motive is clear and malicious. *** Trump has grounds for a libel lawsuit against BuzzFeed BuzzFeed may have accomplished the nearly-impossible in journalism this week, when it arguably libeled President-elect Trump by publishing a report about his alleged Russian ties.

James Clapper called Donald Trump to inform him that Donald Trump confirmed Thursday that the director of national intelligence contacted him to deny leaking a dossier containing a variety of allegations against the president-elect over his relationship to Russia. *** “James Clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated,” Trump tweeted. “Made up, phony facts.Too bad!” *** Clapper said he emphasized “that this document is not a U.S. Intelligence Community product and that I do not believe the leaks came from within the IC.” http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/12/donald-trump-james-clapper-russia-dossier/96481140/ Apple of Your Turdseye says: January 12, 2017 at 12:29 pm Linda2: It would be shorter to just call it Trumpism.

By Niall Stanage - 04/15/17 12:04 PM EDT 0   © Getty President Trump is moving in a more conventional direction, winning plaudits from former critics in the process. But his shifts, in both policy and personnel, are disconcerting those who were once among his loudest boosters.  The Trump diehards are queasy at the notion that a president who ran as a proud outsider might be co-opted by a Washington establishment they loathe.   “Trump won by bringing out millions of people who hadn’t voted in decades, maybe ever,” the conservative commentator Ann Coulter told The Hill in an email. “They’re not on ABC’s ‘powerhouse roundtable,’ working on Wall Street or for the Koch brothers — where everyone is delighted with how Trump has ‘grown’ in office.  ADVERTISEMENT “The base is terrified that Trump is being led down the primrose path with flattery from all the people who didn’t vote for him and never will.” The charge that Trump is going to disappoint — or even sell out — the insurgent legions who supported him last November is not new.  When the GOP’s internal fight over the attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was at its height at the start of April, conservative Rep. Justin AmashJustin AmashTHE MEMO: Has Trump gone Washington? GOP infighting imperils agenda Dem senator seeks probe of Trump aide's tweet MORE (R-Mich) lamented on Twitter that “Trump admin & Establishment have merged into #Trumpstablishment. Same old agenda.” Even earlier, the conservative media icon Matt Drudge of The Drudge Report tweeted, “The swamp drains you,” a clear jab at Trump.  But those worries have intensified this week.  The president backed away from several of his campaign positions in short order. He no longer views NATO as “obsolete”; he no longer views China to be a currency manipulator; and his opposition to the Export-Import Bank and to Janet Yellen’s reappointment as the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve have gone by the wayside. Meanwhile, reverberations are being felt from the airstrike he launched on Syria. During President Obama's White House tenure, Trump had warned about the dangers of getting involved in the strife-torn nation. The White House has vigorously pushed back against suggestions that the president has made u-turns on those policy issues. Aides put a particular emphasis on the NATO question, insisting that the organization has proven receptive to Trump’s key demands: that member nations aside from the United States should pay their fair share and that the fight against terrorism should be a higher priority. NATO's moves in response, they say, are what have caused Trump to take a more favorable view of the alliance.  White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Thursday said that, “when you look at these issues and you recognize the direction in which they’re moving, they’re moving in a direction that the President stated very clearly.” Spicer was, however, much keener to emphasize NATO over issues such as the Export-Import Bank, where there has been little, if any, germane changes to an institution that candidate Trump railed against. “I was very much opposed to Ex-Im Bank,” the president told the Wall Street Journal this week, before explaining that he had realized “lots of small companies” as well as corporate behemoths gain from it.  "Instinctively you would say, ‘Isn't that a ridiculous thing?’ — but actually it’s a very good thing,” he said of the bank. Statements like that have convinced some conservatives who have long been skeptical of Trump that they were right all along.  “If Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump reportedly annoyed by Time cover with Bannon Maxine Waters rallies Tax March crowd for Trump's impeachment Privacy group sues IRS for not disclosing Trump's taxes MORE had ran on, ‘I’m essentially Chris Christie — you might not agree with me on everything but I’m better than Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonCelebs call on Trump to release his tax returns THE MEMO: Has Trump gone Washington?

Scott GarrettScott GarrettTHE MEMO: Has Trump gone Washington? Trump picks critic of Ex-Im Bank to lead it House GOP targets Dems over ObamaCare during recess MORE (N.J.) to lead the Ex-Im Bank. Garrett was a staunch critic of the bank in Congress, saying it “embodies the corruption of the free enterprise system.” Deace cautioned that Trump supporters were not monolithic, encompassing everyone from true believers to those who backed the president without real enthusiasm, only because they thought he was a better choice than Clinton, his Democratic opponent. The president’s latest shifts would play differently to different strands within Trump’s support, Deace said. Still, he asserted, the overall effect amounted to “abandoning his own base and relying on people who don’t like him or his way of communicating. … In politics, it never works to abandon your own base.” Policy is only one part of that picture. The shifting fortunes of individuals within the White House are also causing discontent on the right.  Many have speculated that chief strategist Steve Bannon — seen as the keeper of the Trumpian flame by the president’s most conservative supporters — is losing ground after being removed from the National Security Council. The president also minimized Bannon’s contribution in interviews with the Journal and the New York Post. Figures in the White House who are perceived to be ascendant — notably Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs president who now serves as the head of the National Economic Council — favor a less nationalist and more establishment-friendly stance than Bannon. “If Trump fired Bannon and kept Cohn, I don’t think the White House understands that s---storm they would face,” one Trump associate told The Hill earlier this week. Defenders of the president argue that most voters are uninterested in the latest palace intrigue and have faith in Trump as an agent of change.  “Every time the press reports that everything is in turmoil, a lot of voters understand that is not necessarily true,” said Republican strategist Hogan Gidley. “Instead what they are seeing is business as usual being shaken up.” Gidley added that Trump is such an inherently unorthodox figure that there was never a danger of him succumbing to Beltway norms. “I don’t think there is a real fear that he will ‘go Washington.’ People don’t know what he is going to do. He doesn’t follow any of the conventional political norms. To try to ascribe to him a traditional political motive is complete folly.”  But others are far from convinced.  “It was a magical moment to finally have a president who is not owned by Wall Street,” Coulter said. “You’ll never see that again. There’s no reason for Trump to voluntarily turn his [administration] over to all the people who hysterically opposed him, but if there’s one more Goldman Sachs hire, they might as well fly the Goldman flag over the White House.”  The Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump’s presidency.  Tags Hillary Clinton Scott Garrett Justin Amash Donald Trump Ted Cruz   View the discussion thread.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Apr 15, 2017 at 6:42AM You may have come across the term "machine learning" while digging around for new technology ideas to invest in, or perhaps you've heard of it while researching the broader (but related) artificial intelligence space. In any case, machine learning probably isn't an idea that most investors know about, so it's worth taking the time to walk through a few basic aspects to help you get started. Let's take a quick look at where the term came from, how machine learning is being used right now, and what its market opportunity is. Of course, I'll discuss a few machine learning stocks investors should know about as well.  Image source: Getty Images. 1. What exactly is machine learning and how is it being used? Machine learning may sound like a new tech concept, but it's been around for decades. Back in 1959, the computer scientist and artificial intelligence pioneer Arthur Samuel coined the term and described it as the "field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." Samuel worked on early machine learning systems at IBM (NYSE:IBM) and even developed a checkers program that was capable of beating a checkers master. This was a significant feat for a computer at the time (1962), and it is one of the earliest examples of artificial intelligence.    For a solid example of machine learning that we can all recognize, consider the search results provided by Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. Lukas Biewald, the CEO of an AI company, wrote in TechCrunch last year that "What makes Google special is that it knows which matching result is the most relevant; the way that it knows is through machine learning."  Google has applied machine learning to its other businesses as well. The company's recently spun-off driverless car company, Waymo, uses machine learning to teach cars how they should react to specific situations by letting them observe how a driver, or another car, responds to certain driving scenarios.   Other tech companies are doing exciting things with machine learning as well. Graphics processing unit (GPU) maker NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) uses machine learning for computer vision, which allows computers to see and interpret what they're looking at (e.g., the cameras on a driverless car being able to identify a stop sign).  2. How big will this market be? Many estimates for the machine learning market are lumped together with the broader artificial intelligence market, but a few specific estimates do exist. For example, research firm MarketsandMarkets says that machine learning as a service (MLaaS) will grow from $613.4 million in 2016 to $3.7 billion by 2021.   A separate estimate by Transparency Market Research says the compound annual growth rate of MLaaS will be 38.4% between 2017 and 2025, and become a $19.8 billion market by the end of that time.  Whichever estimate you choose, it's clear that machine learning applications are expanding, and that should fuel growth for companies creating services based on that technology.  3. Who are the major players? I've already mentioned how Google has tapped into machine learning for some of its business and how NVIDIA is using machine learning for computer vision. It's worth mentioning that aside from NVIDIA's own machine learning uses for semi-autonomous vehicles, it also sells its GPUs to other companies, including Google and Facebook, for machine learning. That's helping the company tap into broader AI market, which is creating a $5 billion opportunity for NVIDIA. But NVIDIA isn't the only chipmaker that stands to benefit from machine learning. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is looking to machine learning to spur new chip sales as the PC market dwindles. The company is in the process of buying the semi-autonomous car technology maker Mobileye so that it can set itself up to benefit from the driverless-car market, which relies heavily on machine learning. An MIT Technology Review article noted that "Intel's acquisition of Mobileye shows how critical data and machine learning are to the auto industry's future."  And just as IBM was at the forefront of machine learning decades ago, the company is still helping to lead the way with its own enterprise machine learning services. The company says that its machine learning solutions, like Watson, can use enterprise data to automatically create self-learning behavioral models for businesses. The company is so bullish on machine learning and its impact on businesses that it calls the technology the "21st century's Industrial Revolution" and believes that machine learning is the first step toward a broader cognitive computing world.  Just a few months ago, Deloitte published a report mentioning that 300 million smartphones will have some form of machine learning built into them this year, and that soon drones, cars, virtual and augmented reality devices, and even medical tools will have their own built-in machine learning capabilities. It's clear from these predictions -- and the current machine learning uses -- that this technology revolution is already underway. And investors would be wise to take a closer look at the companies that are leading the charge. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 April 2017 by Military News ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment.

Though Apple has yet to officially announce that they are working on self-driving cars, having them on the official list of companies confirms that they are, indeed, quietly working their way to the autonomous automobile industry. Silent Confirmation The company has kept mum about their plans regarding their movement toward the automotive industry, but has kept a trail of breadcrumbs for people to follow. In October, CEO Tim Cook did not directly address press queries about the rumors of the company's movements in the car arena, but did point out that the company is always on the lookout for new things, and that the automobile industry has a lot of technologies that can be developed. Despite the pronouncements that intrigued many, still, they did not make any announcements. Perhaps a clearer sign of Apple's concrete movements in autonomous vehicles is when Apple's director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, wrote a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2016 stating the company's substantial investments in the study of machine learning and automation, and expressed the company's excitement in the potentials of automation, including the area of transportation. If writing a letter to the NHTSA isn't a clear enough sign of the company's intent, then perhaps this latest development of having their name listed as the 30th company to test autonomous vehicles in the sunny state should be enough proof. What's even more interesting about this piece of news is that having their name officially listed at the DMV could perhaps means that they have gone beyond the study of automation, and have gone on to the testing phase of an actual product, something that a spokesperson from the DMV confirmed. "The permit covers three vehicles, all 2015 Lexus RX450h, and six drivers," said the spokesperson to Business Insider. While it is still unclear whether Apple will soon make any announcement about the company's expansion to a completely different industry altogether, just like Intel, it is very clear that Apple is ready to advance and move beyond computers and mobile technology. Growing List Since the adoption of California DMV's autonomous vehicle testing regulations, many big names have applied apply for the permission to test their autonomous vehicle prototypes. With Apple as the 30th name on the list, it also includes other big names such as Subaru, Ford, Tesla Motors, Faraday & Future Inc., and Volkswagen.
