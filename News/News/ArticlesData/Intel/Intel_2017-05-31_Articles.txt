Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

Intel just took the wraps off its long-awaited Core X-Series processors and accompanying X299 chipset, which bring enough horsepower and bandwidth for everything from professional content creation to hardcore gaming. Intel's new X299 platform and accompanying Core X-Series processors raise the bar for CPU and memory performance with up to 18 cores and 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 memory. And they add bandwidth for multiple graphics cards and NVMe SSDs with up to 44 PCIe lanes through the CPU and even more from the chipset. It's an incredibly potent platform we've used to create the Prime, TUF, and ROG X299 families.     Based on Intel's X299 chipset, the ROG, Prime and TUF series feature state-of-the-art connectivity and control options designed for gamers, power users and prosumers   ROG has three models expertly tailored for different priorities: the Rampage VI Extreme lives up to its name for drool-worthy dream machines with custom liquid cooling and ultra-fast networking, the Rampage VI Apex unabashedly targets peak game performance and record-breaking overclocking, and the Strix X299-E provides gamers the powerful tuning, cooling, and personalization options they need to get the most from their rigs. ROG does more than just offer checkbox features-we take the time to ensure each one is empowering for enthusiasts and accessible for beginners.   The Prime and TUF models are designed for differing audiences: new Prime X299-Deluxe is for high-end builders who want it all, the Prime X299-A eschews certain extras in favor of a straightforward approach that gets back to basics, the TUF X299 Mark 1 stands out from its competitors with protective armor and advanced cooling options, while the TUF X299 Mark 2 strips down to the essentials for X299 builders who want to deviate from the conventional formula. The new ASUS Prime and TUF X299s series are a breath of fresh air at a time when far too many motherboards offer more of the same.   Shared innovations define the ROG X299 family All three boards share the same DNA - essential features that enthusiasts in the Republic of Gamers demand. That starts with critically acclaimed overclocking and cooling controls for liquid and air. There are dedicated pump headers for powering custom loops and all-in-one coolers, plus intelligent fan controls for optimal efficiency and quiet acoustics. Sensor grouping lets your cooling react to a mix of workloads, including GPU-heavy gaming via direct temperature monitoring for select graphics cards. Tuning your gaming PC is easy whether you want to perfect your setup with manual tweaking or automatically configure and overclock the whole thing with a single click using our 5-Way Optimization utility.   Gaming PCs provide unprecedented options to express your style, including through personalized lighting. The RGB LEDs embedded on our boards are augmented by headers for multiple RGB LED strips to illuminate your entire chassis. All of the lighting is part of our Aura Sync ecosystem, which synchronizes harmoniously across compatible ROG graphics cards, peripherals, and monitors, along with other components from our partners.   Equipped with the latest generation of SupremeFX integrated audio, ROG's new X299 motherboards boast enhanced recording quality for streamers who want their voice to come through clearly. Graphics cards plug into reinforced SafeSlots that protect against damage from heavy GPU coolers and rough handling.   Intel's VROC technology combines with our optional add-in card to enable insane M.2 RAID arrays made up of a stack of parallel drives with a direct line to the CPU. You can hit ludicrous speeds with enough capacity for overflowing game libraries. You get all the latest I/O, including USB 3.1 Gen 2 with Type-C ports and internal headers pushing speeds up to 10Gbps. Onboard Wi-Fi and Intel Gigabit networking are standard equipment, and you can add Intel's new Optane memory as a high-speed cache.   Imagine your dream machine with the Rampage VI Extreme The flagship of this new family is the Rampage VI Extreme, which balances power and design to elevate showcase PCs. It's made specifically for machines with custom liquid cooling. Along with all of the usual fan and pump headers, we added dual flow headers that let you monitor the coolant coursing through your loop. There's also a special connector that lets water blocks designed for the Extreme provide flow, temperature, and leakage data.   Almost every aspect of the Rampage VI Extreme has been enhanced to give you more. The Intel Gigabit Ethernet controller is bolstered by an onboard 10Gbps chip capable of increasing networking throughput by an order of magnitude. We've also upgraded the Wi-Fi to the latest 802.11ad standard, increasing wireless bandwidth up to 4.6Gbps.   To help avoid unsightly wiring, three M.2 SSDs can be added to the board without using the VROC card. One slots under the Extreme's outer skin, while the other two ride our DIMM.2 module next to the memory slots. The onboard Thunderbolt header lets you extend high-speed connectivity to external devices with our optional add-in card.   New for X299, the Rampage VI Extreme integrates a LiveDash OLED screen that lets you monitor system temperatures, frequencies, and fan speeds right on the board. The dashboard also displays custom messages and graphics to add a little extra flair to your build. It's complemented by enough onboard LEDs and strip headers to put on a show.   Set performance records and game with the Rampage VI Apex ROG's commitment to pursuing the highest overclocks and top performance manifests in the Rampage VI Apex. This model is purpose-built for setting records at sub-zero temperatures - not just with LN2, but also with exotic liquid helium. Our overclocking experts have already used the Apex to take 8 world records and 20 global records with the Core X-processor reaching 7.560GHz, and we're just getting started. Expect more records to fall as we cement ROG's legacy as the absolute performance leader.   Less is more on the ragged edge. The Apex has only one DIMM slot per channel, which allows optimized trace routing that can improve stability with the fastest memory kits. You can load the board with 64GB of DDR4 memory running at blistering speeds and extremely low latencies. Memory is flanked by dual DIMM.2 slots that take up to four M.2 SSDs between them.   The Rampage VI Apex proudly wears its attitude on its sleeve - or rather PCB. The distinctive shape visually sets the Apex apart from the competition, while the customizable name plate provides space to add a personal touch. You also get the latest I/O, including USB 3.1 Gen 2 with Type-C ports, onboard Wi-Fi and Intel Gigabit networking plus SupremeFX audio technology for those times when you want to game instead of setting records.   Game in style with the Strix X299-E Where the Rampage VI Extreme and Apex are highly specialized, the ROG Strix X299-E takes a more straightforward approach. It represents an affordable entry point into the Republic of Gamers without sacrificing the looks and features that define the number one gaming brand.   Like its Rampage siblings, the Strix wears a monochrome motif that won't clash with other components or your lighting choices. Featuring standard ATX dimensions, the Strix still comes with all of the slots, ports, and headers you expect from ROG. This includes dual M.2 slots for NVMe SSDs, Intel Gigabit networking, onboard Wi-FI, USB 3.1 Gen 2, SupremeFX audio technology with Sonic Studio III and class leading RGB options featuring Aura Sync.   Ready for liquid cooling and RGB lighting, the Strix X299-E has headers for dual pumps and both standard and addressable LED strips. We also include a couple of extension cables that make it much easier to get the look you want.   Prime time for X299   Built for power users and prosumers, the Prime series represents the culmination of decades of experience refining all aspects of motherboard technology. These boards mate state-of-the-art connectivity with accessible tuning options to provide a premium experience everyone can enjoy.   All of our X299 motherboards have extensive overclocking and cooling options available in both the UEFI and software. The Primes go one step further with 5-Way Optimization, which intelligently overclocks your system and tunes the cooling based on the individual characteristics of your components. Beginners can effortlessly optimize their entire PC with a single click, while experienced users can adjust tuning parameters to meet their needs.   Refinement extends to the styling, whose predominantly black-and-white theme lays the perfect foundation for understated builds-or much flashier ones with RGB lighting. Our Prime X299 boards feature multiple headers for LED strips that can light up your entire chassis. They're part of a rich ecosystem of Aura Sync products that can synchronize colors and effects across a complete system.   Intel's new Core X-Series processors demand serious cooling, which is why all of our new X299 motherboards have dedicated headers for all-in-one liquid coolers and stand-alone pumps. Our Prime X299 series also support up to three-way graphics configurations, and their x16 slots incorporate structural reinforcements with our SafeSlot technology to prevent damage and protect your investment.   PCIe lanes left unused by graphics can be devoted to storage with VROC, which combines multiple M.2 SSDs in a bootable RAID array connected directly to the CPU. An insane number of drives can run in parallel across multiple VROC cards to deliver staggering throughput and warp fast access for system drives. Intel's Optane Memory technology is supported, which provides a solid state cache to accelerate other storage devices.   This new Prime series receives our latest on-board audio enhancements, including a Realtek S1220A codec paired with an amplifier and premium components that produce immersive and crystal clear sound which rivals some dedicated sound cards.   The Prime X299-Deluxe has everything Our Deluxe motherboards set the template for high-end builders who want it all, and the new Prime X299-Deluxe continues that proud tradition. It adds pretty much everything you could want on a high-end motherboard, from ultra-fast I/O to cutting-edge aesthetic enhancements.   After setting the bar for RGB lighting with Aura Sync, we're raising it with new customization features that take personalization to the next level. Chief among them is support for addressable lighting strips that offer independent control over each LED on the line, setting the stage for considerably more advanced effects. The Deluxe has headers for addressable and conventional RGB LED strips, plus dual onboard light bars that run down the I/O shield and chipset heat sink.   The chipset heat sink also houses the all-new LiveDash, an integrated OLED screen capable of displaying valuable system information and custom graphics. You can see vital stats like temperatures, frequencies, and fan speeds without alt-tabbing away from games and other full-screen tasks. LiveDash can also display text messages and graphical animations to set your rig apart from the rest.   Ultra-high-speed storage is available in multiple form factors, and the Deluxe supports them all. In addition to offering a U.2 port for enterprise-grade SSDs, it comes with dual M.2 slots for gumstick-sized NVMe drives. Both M.2s are situated with thermals in mind; the main slot sits under the chipset heat sink, which reduces drive temperatures, while the secondary one mounts drives vertically near the DIMM slots, where they can be exposed to airflow generated by system fans.   Networking gets a boost from next-gen Wi-Fi with an integrated 802.11ad module. The dual-band solution can push wireless rates up to 4.6Gbps-several times the speed of most wired connections. And the Deluxe has you covered on the wired front, too, with dual Intel Gigabit Ethernet controllers delivering fast and reliable connectivity.   There's only so much we can squeeze onto a motherboard without exceeding standard ATX dimensions, so the Prime X299-Deluxe comes with a couple of sidekicks. Our ThunderboltEX 3 card is included, providing 40Gbps of bandwidth to external peripherals. We also bundle our Fan Extension card, which expands the board's already generous assortment of fan headers and temperature sensors. If you want one board with everything, the Deluxe is it.   Distill the essentials with the Prime X299-A Although the Prime X299-A features many of the same technologies as the Deluxe, it eschews certain extras in favor of a straightforward approach that gets back to basics. The combination of core Prime features with the latest Intel platform produces an enticing board.   Like its big brother, the X299-A supports up to three-way graphics configurations across a trio of x16 slots. You can add VROC arrays via our add-in card, if the two onboard M.2 slots are not enough. Essential I/O is fully covered, including an USB 3.1 Gen 2 internal header for chassis' that support the new 10Gbps standard, plus Type-A and reversible Type-C ports at the rear.   With a more sedate design than its sibling, the Prime X299-A can still light up your PC with RGB effects. The board has dual headers for off-the-shelf LED strips, each of which supports up to two meters of lighting at optimal brightness. The colors, effects, and tastefulness of the resulting glow is entirely up to you.   The Prime X299-A shows that affordable Core X-Series motherboards need not skimp on the features you crave. It has everything needed for an entry-level build, plus room to grow into something much more formidable.   TUF enough to endure Our Prime X299 motherboards are balanced by entries from the TUF family. These models march to a different beat that prioritizes reliability and durability for PCs built to go the distance. They use tougher components than conventional counterparts, and they're subjected to more stringent testing.   Shifting focus requires a new outlook, and TUF answers with distinctive designs that meld industrial sensibilities with a touch of space marine. Stealthy by nature, the new boards minimize RGB lighting to concentrate on different priorities.   Arm yourself with the TUF X299 Mark 1 A new coat of reinforced armor makes the TUF X299 Mark 1 stand out from its predecessors. The protective cover streamlines airflow over the board and prevents dust from accumulating in nooks and crannies. Airflow beneath the surface is generated by a dedicated fan that also directs cool air toward the primary M.2 slot that further improves thermals.   Managing thermals is critical to maintaining stability when systems are pushed to the limit, especially on a high-end desktop platform. The TUF X299 Mark 1 is laced with additional temperature sensors to monitor different zones on the motherboard and in your system as a whole. Sensor data is fed into Thermal Radar 3 software that intelligently manages your cooling to keep temperatures and acoustics low.   The updated armor is our strongest yet, but the Mark 1's real strength comes from its Fortifier backplate. This rear reinforcement uses a carefully shaped and folded metal plate to stiffen the board against warping that now includes a removable GPU Holder that supports the weight of sagging graphics cards. And, as an added bonus, it helps dissipate thermal energy from multiple hot spots on the back of the PCB.   TUF Detective reprises its role as smartphone-powered troubleshooter and monitoring utility. Unlike previous iterations, which require a wired USB connection, the latest version performs diagnostics wirelessly over Bluetooth using the included USB adapter.   As the flagship of the TUF family, the Mark 1 also adds several perks. The glowing logo at the center of the board changes based on the load to show how hard the system is working. There are dual Intel Gigabit LAN controllers plus all the flavors in the USB 3.1 Gen2 rainbow: old-school Type-A, reversible Type-C, and internal header.   Welcome the X299 Mark 2 into the TUF family TUF strips down to the essentials with the X299 Mark 2. Like the Prime X299-A, the board delivers all the features of the new Intel platform, plus must-have ASUS innovations like advanced overclocking, cooling and tuning options. It removes the armor and backplate in favor of a naked PCB with a darker motif that blends into the shadows. The Mark 2 makes TUF more accessible for X299 builders who want to deviate from the conventional formula.   AVAILABILITY & PRICING   ROG Rampage VI Extreme, Rampage VI Apex and ROG Strix X299-E motherboards will be available at leading resellers starting in late June with the Strix series arriving first. ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe, Prime X299-A and TUF X299 Mark 1 motherboards will be available at leading resellers starting in late June.

Funsters port WannaCrypt to Commodore, Cisco, Nintendo and Tesla Data Center Cloud Google cloud switches on Intel's Skylake Xeons and cloud CPU picker Another thing cloud's changed: it used to be be server-makers that trumpeted CPU exclusives 1 Jun 2017 at 04:02, Simon Sharwood A member of Intel's new “Xeon Scalable Family” has appeared in Google's cloud. The Alphabet subsidiary says that Skylake Xeons are now generally available and that it is “the first and only public cloud to deliver Intel’s next-generation Xeon server processor”. That's the kind of thing server-makers used to trumpet in the hope those with a need for speed would shop with a perhaps-unfamiliar supplier to get their hands on more clock cycles. The arrangement with Google looks similar: The Register understands that Intel cut a custom Xeon for the Alphabet subsidiary to use in the knowledge it would shout long and loud about the new Xeon's many fine qualities. Google's not, however, sharing a lot. It is saying that Skylake-Xeon-powered instances have clock speed of 2.0 GHz and let you build virtual machines with up to 64 vCPUS and 455 GB of RAM. We still don't know exactly what's inside Skylake Xeons, which is no surprise given that Intel's only revealed branding for the CPUs and plans to reveal specifics about their their innards in coming days ahead of their mainstream launch. For now we have Google's assurance that the CPUs are well-suited to demanding applications, but that they're nonetheless ready to roll inside its standard instances, as well as the gruntier highmem, highcpu, Custom Machine Types and Preemptible VMs. For now they're only offered in Google's Western US, Western Europe and Eastern Asia Pacific regions, but the company says “we have more capacity arriving every day, and support for additional regions and zones coming in the near future.” Google's also added a new “Minimum CPU Platform” feature that lets you specify the worst CPU you're willing to use in its cloud. The company has admitted it has a fleet mixing Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Broadwell silicon. The new feature means if you specify Haswell, you'll never run on the older Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge. ® Tips and corrections Post a comment MORE Google Intel Cloud Skylake Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Amazon's AWS S3 cloud storage evaporates: Top websites, Docker stung 'Increased error rates' is the new 'outage', according to Bezos' bit-barn bods 107 Comments Scality reinvents the RING, adds extra Amazon S3 polish Software-flinger improves security, integration with v6.4 Amazon S3-izure cause: Half the web vanished because an AWS bod fat-fingered a command Basically, Team Bezos pulled a GitLab 91 Comments Google lights toasty price war under S3's hot and cold data bits We're the 'perennial price leader' in cloud.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 1 June 2017 | MYT 8:00 AM Cricket: England trio to pioneer bat sensors in Champions Trophy Intel has developed a sensor, placed on top of the bat handle, that provides previously unseen precise details about a player's bat speed and angle of back lift. — AFP Relaxnews England trio Jason Roy, Alex Hales and Ben Stokes will be among the players from around the world pioneering new bat sensors during the upcoming Champions Trophy, it was announced Tuesday.  Technology giant Intel has developed a sensor, placed on top of the bat handle, that provides previously unseen precise details about a player's bat speed and angle of back lift. The aim is to both provide more information to television audiences and, longer term, develop a coaching aid. Former England captain turned cricket broadcaster Nasser Hussain told a news conference at The Oval: "How many times have we spoken about people having 'fast hands' or 'great bat speed'? "But what does that mean? We've never quantified it." Hussain, speaking ahead of the Champions Trophy opener between England and Bangladesh at The Oval on Thursday, said he would have benefitted had this technology been available in his career. "When I first played for England, I had never really seen myself on television. I remember playing in Jamaica, getting out and walking through the hotel lobby and Geoffrey Boycott shouting at me 'Hussain, you'll never get any runs with that open bat face'. "Something like this can show you the exact angle of your bat." Hussain said Roy, going through a run drought that has yielded four single figure scores in his last five one-day international innings, might gain from the new system. "Take Jason Roy, struggling a little bit at the moment. Say this technology had been in place for two or three years, he could have a net tomorrow, play normally, and then take the data from two years ago and say 'is everything I'm doing with my bat exactly the same as it was?' and if you know it was, you know that's not the issue." Hussain added: "There will be traditionalists thinking 'is this relevant?'. "But if it gives you that one percent to improve the game, someone will be using it." Other innovations at the Champions Trophy include the use of high-technology drones to provide more in-depth pitch analysis and a virtual reality system that allows fans to experience what it's like to face the world's best bowlers. International Cricket Council chief executive David Richardson, speaking alongside Hussain, welcomed the developments by saying: "If the technology is available to enhance and amplify the cricket experience, over the years we've shown a real willingness to trial and support it. "Our long-term vision is to make cricket the world's favourite sport and really there's only one way to achieve this – to keep the fans engaged and interested in the game." The former South Africa wicket-keeper added:  "That's all about offering the fans premium content and embracing technology." — AFP Relaxnews   Related Stories You May Be Interested Layoffs rile India’s flagship IT sector Bakers are cashing in on Instagram’s cake obsession How good are budget notebooks really?

According to The Hill, one subpoena seeks information about Susan Rice, President Obama’s former national security adviser, and activities related to documents that included the names of members of the Trump campaign. Four of the subpoenas are related directly to Russian meddling, which is also the subject of probes from the Senate Intelligence Committee and FBI. Representatives Mike Conaway and Adam Schiff, who are leading the House Intel’s inquiry, made a joint statement. “As part of our ongoing investigation into Russian active measures during the 2016 campaign, today we approved subpoenas for several individuals for testimony, personal documents and business records… We hope and expect that anyone called to testify or provide documents will comply with that request, so that we may gain all the information within the scope of our investigation. We will continue to pursue this investigation wherever the facts may lead.” A separate FBI probe that was led by former FBI Director Robert Mueller and the latest actions of the committee prove lawmakers have not given up their own Russia investigations. Mueller was appointed as special counsel by Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein on May 17.

Cohen & Associates PC. Congressional sources described the action as “separate” from the committee’s Russia probe. Chairman Devin Nunes issued subpoenas to the FBI, the CIA, and the National Security Agency for information about how the names of Trump campaign officials were “unmasked” in classified intelligence reports from those agencies. Specifically, the subpoenas issued by Nunes seek information about requests made by former CIA Director John Brennan and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice for the campaign aides’ names to be disclosed in those classified reports. In the letter from Michael Flynn’s attorneys to the Senate Intel, Flynn invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination and declined to give documents sought under subpoena on the investigation of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. [Image by J. David Ake/AP Images] According to a senior committee aide who was not authorized to speak publicly, Nunes issued those subpoenas without agreement from Democrats. In April, Nunes stepped aside from the Russia probe, which is now being led by Conaway. Nunes was criticized for speaking publicly about classified surveillance reports he reviewed during his time at the White House. Three of the subpoenas were directed to the CIA, FBI, and NSA over the unmasking claims. House Intel Committee issues its first subpoenas in Russia probe, for Michael Flynn and Trump lawyer Michael Cohen https://t.co/jTjrt2UALH — CNN (@CNN) May 31, 2017 The “unmasking” issue has been raised by the White House and by Trump supporters that the investigation has been politically motivated. However, Democrats have largely dismissed this issue as an attempt to divert attention from possible collusion by Trump campaign officials with the Russians. On Tuesday, Cohen, Trump’s personal lawyer, acknowledged that he is resisting a request from congressional investigators seeking information from him about possible contacts with Russia. Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday about the House committee’s latest action. Cohen’s name surfaced last year in an unsubstantiated dossier prepared by a former British intelligence agent, alleging that the lawyer attended a meeting in Prague to discuss Russia’s targeting of Democrats for hacking operations. BREAKING: AP source: Ex-National Security Adviser Flynn will provide some documents under subpoena to Senate intelligence panel. — The Associated Press (@AP) May 30, 2017 On Tuesday, Cohen gave the following statement in a text message to USA Today: “To date, there has not been a single witness, document or piece of evidence linking me to this fake Russian conspiracy… This is not surprising to me because there is none! I declined the invitation (by the Senate and House Intelligence panels) to participate as the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered.” On Tuesday, it was reported by CNN that Flynn would provide documents requested by the Senate intelligence committee. The initial batch is due by June 6, a person close to Flynn said Tuesday. Two subpoenas were sent to his businesses. Flynn will also provide personal documents sought via a separate subpoena after Senate investigators narrowed the scope of the request.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

This particular motherboard is "designed for gamers and PC enthusiasts who love performance," and features high-end tools for overclockers including a 10 phase DigitALL power design with Loadline Calibration and MSI's Turbo Socket.     The X299 GAMING M7 ACK also features M.2 Shield FROZR to cool M.2 SSDs, Audio Boost 4 PRO, which allows users to use two headphones and speakers at the same time, as well as a three-way conjunction of Killer networking hardware to ensure optimum online gaming. MSI's premium X299 mobo also features Mystic Light RGB along the board's heat sinks and covers, offering 16.8 million colors combos and 17 LED effects.     Next up is the MSI Performance Series, which includes the X299 GAMING PRO CARBON AC and X299 GAMING PRO CARBON motherboards. Let's start with the first one: the Gaming Pro Carbon AC is touted as "a modder's dream" and is the world's first motherboard to allow users to change-out the stock heat sink covers and X-Mount accessories with custom 3D-printed and modded covers, but MSI provides three color options: black, silver, and gold.     The board also comes with Mystic Light RGB LEDs and many of the premium M.2 cooling, audio boost, game boost, and Killer LAN networking features as the other models.   The X299 Gaming Pro Carbon is essentially the same as the X299 Gaming Pro Carbon AC besides the swappable custom covers.     Last but not least we have MSI's Aresnal Gaming series, which is comprised of the X299 Tomohawk and X299 SLI Plus.     The X299 Tomohawk's main selling point is its solid reinforced design. The motherboard features stainless steel heat sinks and a "Steel Armor" design that's built with Military Class 5 components, making it "unbreakable in any gaming session."   The X299 Tomohawk also features front-facing USB Type-C for a myriad of different devices, and rocks the premium features of MSI's motherboard series including VR boost and game boost, along with Audio Boost 4 with Nahimic 2 to deliver "next level sound quality".     The MSI X299 SLI Plus is "engineered to gratify even the most demanding professional" and features premium power phases and high-end military class components to ensure optimum reliability. In fact, MSI boasts that the X299 SLI Plus is the "strongest SLI PLUS we've ever built."   "The X299 SLI PLUS adopts premium Dual Intel® LAN, optimized for maximum transfer speeds by reducing CPU overhead and offering exceptionally high TCP and UDP throughput. Featuring 15KV protection, the X299 SLI PLUS also shields your network from lightning strikes and static electricity.   "Combining MSI exclusive System Saver design, users will never have to worry about a system issue. Simply use one of the System Saver's options to guarantee a successful boot up. For maximum data transfer performance and latest generation SSD support, the X299 SLI PLUS adopts the latest Turbo U.2 and Twin Turbo M.2 with Steel Armor.   "For the best DDR4 memory compatibility and stability, DDR4 boost with Steel Armor is included. The X299 SLI PLUS motherboard will make anyone's professional life easier with super stable, reliable and long-lasting top performance.     MSI also notes that its full fleet of X299 motherboads are the first to feature the new ASMedia ASM3142 USB 3.1 controller to enable maximum high-speed performance. In fact, all the front-facing USB Type-C connectors featured on MSI's X299 motherboards have been upgraded from Gen1 to Gen2 for improved performance and transfers. >> NEXT STORY: Thermaltake announces tempered glass full-tower PC case << PREVIOUS STORY: GIGABYTE reveals new fleet of Aorus X299 motherboards Related Tags Computex 2017 Intel X299 X299 MSI MSI X299 Motherboards Motherboards Intel BitFenix Corsair Phanteks Subscribe to our Newsletter Latest News Posts AMD prepares 9 models of ThreadRipper, up to 16C/32T Intel Core i9-7900X @ 5.7GHz on LN2, sets world records AMD ThreadRipper: X399, 16C/32T, 64 PCIe lanes and more G.SKILL Trident Z DDR4-4800 on Intel's new X299 chipset AMD's mainstream Radeon RX Vega delayed until 2018?View More News Posts Forum Activity Amped Wireless Artemis-EX AC1300 Range Extender Review asrock fatal1ty x370 K4 GAMING - Cannot create RAID GA-Z87x-UD5H Only PS/2 Keyboard can be used with SETUP Plugable USBC-SATA-V USB 3.1 Gen 2 HDD Dock Review Intel Introduces X299, Kabylake-X, and Skylake-XView More Forum Posts Press Releases Next generation 3D NAND propels PCIe SSD adoption Tegila expands lifetime storage program, unveils controller-only refresh option ASUS Republic of Gamers showcases brand new gaming innovations at Computex 2017 AMD exhibits PC innovation leadership at Computex 2017 Thermaltake unveils the new 4 tempered glass View 71 TG Edition full-tower chassis with Tt LCS CertifiedView More Press Releases Home Sitemap Advertising Awards About Contact Price Search RSS FEEDS PRIVACY POLICY & AD CHOICES © 1999-2017 Tweak Town Pty Ltd.

Computers / Intel Core i9: six things worth knowing By Hadlee Simons on 31 May, 2017 Intel made a huge splash this week when it announced the Core i9 processor. Of course, 9 is higher than 7 (duh), so you’d expect it to be powerful (bigger duh). But what are the key things to know about the new chip? A lot of cores and threads The Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition has a monster 18 cores and 36 threads, clearly being designed for the one-percenter wanting to one-up their middle class friends. Otherwise, the company says the new chips are made with “advanced gaming, VR and content creation in mind”. It’s part of Intel’s new X-Series family Yep, the Core i9 isn’t the only new chip brought to market by Intel, as it’s actually part of a family of ultra high-end processors. Other chips include the standard Core i9 7900X (10 cores/20 threads), the Core i7 7820X (8 cores/16 threads), Core i7 7800X (6 cores/12 threads), the Core i7 7740X (4 cores/8 threads) and Core i5 7640X (4 cores/4 threads). Pricing? The Core i9 Extreme Edition won’t be cheap though, receiving a suggested price of US$1999. Sheesh. How about the Core i9 7900X? Well, you’re looking at a US$999 price tag. Able to pay more than US$999 but not willing to go to the US$2000 mark? Well, Intel is also readying 12, 14 and 16 core variants of the Core i9 chip, with suggested prices of US$1199, US$1399 and US$1699 respectively. Otherwise, the cheapest chip in the family (Core i5 7640X) has a US$242 price tag. About the socket Intel has confirmed that the X-Series family takes advantage of a new LGA 2066 socket. In other words, you’ll need to buy a new motherboard as well. Then again, if you’re buying the most expensive chip, it’s a small price to pay. How powerful is it? Intel claims that the family also includes their first teraflop CPU. But it’s not just due to sheer number of cores, apparently. Although that helps massively. The company’s new boost tech sees the two best cores being identified, with heavy lifting then being directed to them for a performance boost. Intel adds that you should be able to edit, transcode, animate and render simultaneously (presumably on the higher end chips). What about gaming? For starters, the company says it represents the best gaming performance in an Intel chip. Obviously. But Intel says you can game, stream, record and transcode simultaneously too (again, we presume you’ll want to try this on the higher end processors). Otherwise, the firm says the new chips have support for up to four graphics cards Author Bio Terrible puns make Hadlee Simons difficult to work with, but he brings over seven years of tech journalism experience to the table. When he's not at work or watching motorsport, he's in the foetal position on a jiu jitsu mat.

ASRock displays its trove of funky motherboards at Computex by Zak Killian  8:00 AM on May 31, 2017 We've yet to look at the company's wares, but ASRock is in attendance at Computex, too. ASRock has a reputation for making some of the zanier products around, although it might prefer the word "innovative." This year, the company is showing off some unique motherboards for both Intel and AMD systems, along with what might be the coolest application of the Mini-STX form factor we've seen yet. ASRock has the usual array of high-end X299 boards on display. Although we don't have specific details on the models, the company is showing X299 motherboards bearing Johnathan "Fatal1ty" Wendel's sobriquet as well as the name of champion overclocker Nick Shih. While the X299 Fatal1ty Professional Gaming i9 hails from the "does everything" school of motherboard design, the X299 OC Formula by Nick Shih is more stripped-down, with just four memory slots and a 14-phase voltage regulator. Perhaps more interesting to gerbils (given you folks' affection for PCs en miniature) is the X299E-ITX/ac. Yes, ASRock's engineers crammed an X299 motherboard into the Mini-ITX form factor. To support the LGA 2066 socket's quad-channel memory, the board uses a quartet of SODIMM slots. It also packs on six SATA ports, three M.2 sockets, dual Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet ports, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Intel's X299 platform isn't the only one getting the ITX treatment from ASRock. The Socket AM4 X370 Gaming-ITX/ac is exactly what it sounds like: a Mini-ITX motherboard for AMD's Ryzen CPUs. You only get two DIMM slots, but they're for full-sized sticks instead of SODIMMs. The board supports the Ryzen CPU's native USB 3.1 ports and has a pair of HDMI outputs, should you wish to stick an APU in it. ASRock also has a version of the board coming out with an AMD B350 chipset onboard. In case you haven't heard, cryptocurrency "mining" has come back into vogue lately because of newer "alt-coin" algorithms that can't easily be accelerated on custom hardware. Generally speaking, GPUs are once again the chosen platform, and since such work is primarily done in chunks that fit entirely on a graphics card and its local memory, the host system's performance is less relevant. Miners could spend a bundle on expensive X299 systems to host their hashing, or they could buy something like ASRock's H110 Pro BTC+. This stripped-down platter has twelve PCIe x1 slots and a single x16 slot. All those slots can be filled with enough graphics cards to power a heavy-duty mining rig. Finally (at least as far as PC parts go), ASRock will be showing off some mini-PCs at its Computex booth. We don't know much about the new boxes yet, but the company says it is launching a line of DeskMini RX and DeskMini GTX products based on products like its new Z270M-STX motherboard. Mini-STX is the proper name of the form factor formerly known as "5x5", since it's just five inches square. ASRock says the Z270M-STX mobo supports MXM graphics cards and a staggering three M.2 slots. Hopefully our guys on the ground will get a chance to stop by the ASRock booth to see this stuff in person. If not, you'll surely be hearing about some of these products in the coming months, so keep an eye out. Tags: Motherboards Systems Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Almost everyone has a smartphone or a tablet or notebook, and some people have all three. Customers want these devices to be light, thin and portable. But, looking at the venerable PC, it seems this same trend has not really caught on. PC enthusiasts are well aware of the Mini-ITX form factor, but the wider market still seems to think of the PC as the stereotypical ATX sized box that has been with us for decades. Most people are simply unaware that they can have a fully capable PC in the size of a paperback book (such as a NUC) or have a gaming capable PC, even capable of 4K gaming, in a package the size of a CD player or shoebox. We have gathered some popular PC components and we’ll be putting them into a Silverstone Fortress FTZ01 and see just what a mini PC is capable of. Let’s start off with our component choices. The Components The Case – Silverstone FTZ01 $185 SGD The case is obviously a key component when considering a mini build. Silverstone is a company that consistently release and refine small form factor products including power supplies and coolers, so it was really easy to choose Silverstone for the chassis and PSU. The Silverstone FTZ01 is among our very favorites. It’s one of the best-designed ITX cases available. It is surprisingly easy to work with,  especially with its GPU riser system that allows the use of large, high-powered video cards, all the while packing a slim, low profile chassis with a 14L capacity. At 14.8″ (W) x 4.21″ (H) x 13.82″ (D), it’s one of the smallest cases capable of holding a high end system without compromise. The FTZ01 is is a premium metal body case which offers the flexibility of being placed vertically or horizontally. It retains flexibility with regards to cooling, it will accept a 3.5″ HDD if needed and includes a slot for a DVD or Blu Ray player at its front. It’s size is about what you’d see from a typical Hi-Fi component. Naturally a small form factor case will come with some considerations, including the choice of cooler, but these are easily worked around with the knowledge of what you need. The Power Supply– Silverstone SX700-LPT 80Plus Platinum $248 SGD The Silverstone SX700-LPT  is a 700 watt power supply, meaning its capable of powering essentially any system including overclocked CPUs with high core counts and a single graphics card. It will also power many systems with dual GPUs too, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having a small form factor build. The key reasons for choosing this unit are its small size and the fact that it is 80Plus Platinum rated. This means it has very good efficiency, which in turn means less heat output and a lower power bill. This is a key consideration for any small form factor build where cooling is usually not as efficient as a full sized build.   The Motherboard– MSI Z270I Gaming AC $329 SGD For our motherboard, we chose a MSI Z270i Gaming AC. This board has a raft of high end features, including quality audio, AC Wi-Fi, M.2 support, USB 3.1 and even full RGB lighting.   The CPU – Intel i7-7700 – $475 SGD The CPU was a tougher choice. While we could have gone with a 7700K, its TDP is significantly higher than our eventual choice of a i7-7700. The 7700 means we have a turbo frequency of up to 4.2Ghz while keeping TDP at an impressive 65w. This compares to 91w for a 7700K. So, with a 3.6Ghz base clock and 4.2 Ghz boost clock, the i7-7700 still provides 8 threads and will easily power the latest games and have enough grunt on hand for demanding tasks. it will also be easy for a modest CPU cooler to handle. The CPU Cooler – Cryorig C7 – $55 SGD The Cryorig C7 cooler is specifically designed for small form factor builds. It has the same footprint as a stock Intel cooler, which fit’s into the Intel socket area where no other components are allowed. This means it won’t interfere with tall memory heatsinks, chipset or PWM heatsinks. It’s still much better than the standard Intel cooler thanks to the addition of heatpipes, greater fin surface area and a more efficient fan. It is easily capable of keeping the 65w i7-7700 cool. The GPU – AMD Radeon RX480 8Gb $409 The choice of GPU for a small form factor build will depend on the users budget and usage scenario. The FTZ01 case can handle cards up to 13″ in length and supports dual slot cards. We chose a reference AMD RX480 with its exhaust blower configuration. This is key as all the heat is dumped outside the case. The card performs well at 1080p and offers a good range of technologies including HDMI 2.0b and Display Port 1.4 for driving high resolution displays. It also brings native HEVC Main 10 support making it a good choice for playback of 4k60p content on modern televisions. A GTX 1060 3Gb or 6Gb would be another good choice for the same reasons. We also have a GTX 1080 Ti reference card here that would be the ultimate choice, but its expense is something to consider. If you want to game on your sexy 4k TV or display though, its the only choice. Do you fancy gaming on a 4k OLED 65″ TV? Droooooool… Of course if you’re playing less demanding games such as DOTA or CS:GO, then you can save dollars and go with a cheaper card, though do be aware that a cheaper card might not be capable of pushing to the 120 or 144fps levels that many gamers prefer.   The Memory – G.Skill 2x8Gb DDR4-3200 $239 SGD G.Skill make the highest speed memory you can get, and high speed memory just so happens to run very well on dual slot motherboards. 2x8Gb of DDR4-3200 is a good sweet spot choice of speed, capacity and performance.   The Storage – Zotac 240Gb SSD $149 + Western Digital 1Tb Blue SSD $499+ Seagate 2Tb HDD $115 These days, a 128-256Gb SSD simply runs out of space once you put a few programs on there. Think Grand Theft Auto 5 or similar which takes up the best part of 70Gb! For this reason we chose a smallish 240Gb Zotac Premium SSD for the OS, then a Western Digital 1Tb Blue SSD for games and and a Seagate 2Tb SSD for media storage. You can omit the HDD of course if you have a NAS or external drive. This will make the system much quieter. Mechanical drives really do make an annoying whirring noise that is really noticeable when they spin up.   The Build Moving onto the build, as we see below, the Silverstone FTZ01 has a unique GPU cage/holder with PCIe extender which allows the card flat relative to a normal GPU/MB installation. This alone allows the case to be several centimeters thinner than would otherwise be possible. Here is the PCie Extender card itself. Inside the cylindrical hole is where you place the GPU into the slot. Here is the RX480 attached to the GPU mechanism. The little black plastic piece in the middle is designed to support the weight of the GPU. This a is a good idea since GPU sagging is become more of an issue as GPUs seemingly get ever heavier. Below is the system prior to installing the GPU cage. This gives an illustration of some of the options available with the FTZ01. If you don’t install the cage and use the IGP, you could install a dual radiator watercooler. Some users might wish to skip gaming altogether and this would allow you to run a heavily overclocked i7-7700K if you like, or even the likes of an ASRock X99ITX or one of the upcoming X299 or AM4 ITX motherboards. On the outside of the case, the fans have magnetized dust covers which seal up the system very nicely.   Here is the system in its complete state minus the WD 1Tb SSD and hard drive (which would be located just underneath the main power cables at the top right). The GPU is located below the SSD. The space to the bottom right is where an optical drive can be placed. Cable management is usually a bit of a nightmare in smaller form factor builds where space is the primary consideration, but in the Silverstone FTZ01 the cables can be routed quite well, which improves airflow and assists with cooling. The scale of the system is well illustrated here with the I/O of the motherboard and graphics card clearly visible. Below is a good comparison of the size if the unit vs a full sized Corsair 760T case. As you can see, it’s a lot smaller in every dimension!   But how does it perform? Here is the main spec of the system. 8 cores at 4Ghz+ at 65w.. Nice!   One of the supposed weaknesses of a compact system is the compromising on cooling. The FTZ01 has no problems with airflow, and the i7-7700 stayed under 80c, which is quite good for a Kaby Lake processor under 100% load. Obviously the Cryorig cooler isn’t as good as a top end air cooler, let alone a water cooler, but under 80c is perfectly worry free.   The beauty of 8 threads is you can do some serious work with them. As you can see below, a i7 7700 smashes an overclocked 2600K at video encoding. The 2600K is one of the best processors Intel ever made, but its starting to show its age now. the i7 -7700 is a good 25% faster without an overclock. We ran a few game benchmarks to see how we’d go. With the RX480, 1080p is the real sweet spot for high quality gaming. Once you go to 1440p, you’ll have to dial back the quality a bit to maintain 60fps. Rise of the Tomb Raider with Very High settings held at 70fps, Far Cry Primal 61fps and Ashes of The Singularity 47.5fps when set to Extreme with DX12 mode enabled. These are difficult games to run, but all are easy with a RX480. Of course you can add about 10% of performance if you go with a RX580. Don’t forget that games like CS:GO, Overwatch or DOTA can get by with a low end card, but to get the best experience in these games, high FPS is still desirable. If you’re running a 120hz+ monitor with freesync, you’ll need a decent card to get the best out your games.   Summing it up The Total for the system is $2700. Of course you’ll need a monitor and peripherals to go with it. This is certainly not cheap, but we think this is a good balanced system. You can easily put a top end graphics card in there and game happily at 4K, alternatively you could go for a cheaper CPU or skip the graphics card altogether. Even a Kaby Lake dual core will do the job for non compute intensive tasks. Another option might be to go for some generic memory, for example 2x8Gb of DDR4-2400. Why ITX? It’s just more convenient! You get the full power of a modern PC, whilst combining it into a small form factor. A smaller footprint adds a lot of flexibility when it comes to the uses of the system. A living room gaming PC? A portable LAN PC? Living in a university dorm room? Not everyone wants a huge snarling beast of a system decked out in Christmas RGB lights. Some people want their systems to be functional and blend in. The wolf in sheep’s clothing. Having experience in PC sales in a previous life, it’s amazing how many people automatically assume a small PC is a weak PC. It is not! The point here isn’t so much to build a top end system or a budget system, it’s to show what an ITX system is capable of. Other than really high end multi GPU systems, a well though out ITX build can do everything a full sized build can do. We all like Ultrabooks, slim phones & compact tablets. Why not apply the same thinking to your next PC? Bigger doesn’t always mean better!   James Seaton Post navigation Previous Article Dell Specials at The PC Show and the Consumer Electronic Exhibition!

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Autonomous-Vehicle Stocks to Buy in 2017 The first autonomous cars will likely emerge from big-company partnerships. Here are three companies at the center of some of the most promising deals. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) May 31, 2017 at 6:06PM How should we approach investing in autonomous vehicles -- so-called "self-driving cars" -- here in 2017? Of course, no company is (yet!) producing a fully autonomous vehicle. In fact, one thing that's becoming clear as companies race to develop autonomous-vehicle technology is that no one company is likely to do it entirely on its own. Tech companies, automakers, and auto-industry suppliers are teaming up to share expertise, hoping to bring the best possible technology to market -- as soon as possible. How can that help investors? If we can identify the companies that have fingers in the most promising pies, we might be able to get an early read on which companies are most likely to profit handsomely, as vehicles that can drive themselves become commonplace. I've been watching this space closely as it has emerged over the last few years. Right now, I think these three companies each have an excellent chance to profit handsomely from the rise of autonomous vehicles: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH). Who's driving this Audi SUV? A prototype autonomous-vehicle system developed by two of the companies on our list drove it in a demonstration in Las Vegas earlier this year. Image source: Delphi Automotive. NVIDIA is an emerging automotive powerhouse It's only recently that NVIDIA has ramped up its efforts to push into the automotive space. Its automotive business is still small, accounting for just 7.2% ($140 million) of the $1.9 billion in revenue that it generated in the quarter ended April 30. But as the company sees it, the potential is enormous. Between chips and systems for digital "cockpit" displays, supercomputing processors for autonomous vehicles, and systems for "transport as a service" (ride-hailing and car-sharing), NVIDIA believes its potential market is between $6 billion and $10 billion. How will it access those markets? Its partnerships are a clue: Back in February, NVIDIA and giant auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH announced that they will collaborate on a hardware "brain" for autonomous vehicles. Bosch is a key supplier to many automakers, and has deep relationships with (among others) giant Volkswagen AG, VW subsidiary Audi AG, and Daimler AG -- all of which are investing heavily in autonomous-vehicle technology. The alliance gives NVIDIA a much broader path to market in the automotive space. It also gives NVIDIA a deeper relationship with companies that could be dominant in the early days of self-driving. Between its Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles and its huge heavy-truck business, Daimler, in particular, has the potential to be a powerhouse in this space. That's just one of what could be a long list of very profitable relationships for NVIDIA as autonomous vehicles become commonplace. Self-driving could be the key to Intel's future I know that a lot of investors are wary of Intel. Growth in the chip giant's core business is stalling, and its management team has arguably been flailing a bit, jumping from one idea to another in search of future growth. But I think it's very possible that Intel's search for a path to future growth ended in March, when it struck a huge ($15.3 billion) deal to buy an Israeli tech company, Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY). Mobileye is a fairly small company, but when it comes to autonomous-vehicle technology, it's a very big deal. The various autonomous-vehicle systems under development use several different combinations of sensors, but nearly all of them use "passive visual" sensors -- cameras and systems that can intelligently process the images they capture. That's the space Mobileye dominates. It's already a key supplier of the chips and technology used in existing advanced driver-assist systems offered by nearly all of the world's automakers, and it's deeply respected by engineers and executives throughout the auto business. Mobileye's client list includes almost all of the automakers you've ever heard of, as well as a bunch of smaller ones that might emerge as heavyweights in the future. Intel doesn't plan to fold Mobileye into its existing business. Instead, it'll leave the Israeli company largely intact -- while essentially adding its own chips and systems to Mobileye's catalog. When the deal closes (expected by the end of the year), Intel will instantly have deep access to the world's automakers -- just as demand for processing power in vehicles is about to skyrocket. Intel already has its fingers in a few important pies with Mobileye. The two companies are working with Delphi on a "turnkey" autonomous-vehicle system that they'll make available to automakers by the end of 2019. In a separate (but related) effort, the three are working with German luxury-vehicle giant BMW AG on a series of autonomous-vehicle systems -- which the partners also intend to offer to other automakers, as well. CEO Brian Krzanich thinks the total addressable market for autonomous-vehicle systems and the data centers that will support them will be over $100 billion a year by 2030. Intel is now in a position to grab a very big piece of that, which could have a major impact on a company that generated just under $60 billion in revenue in 2016. Yes, Intel has issues. But its stock isn't expensive at about 12 times its expected 2017 earnings, and its 3% dividend yield provides some comfort. While the Mobileye deal looks very expensive now, the potential upside could make it -- and Intel's stock -- look very cheap in time. Delphi: An old-line auto supplier, retooled Delphi Automotive is to the Intel-Mobileye partnership what Bosch is to NVIDIA, more or less: It's the well-established auto-industry supplier that has deep relationships with most of the world's automakers -- and the expertise to integrate its partners' systems into its clients' vehicles. Like Bosch, Delphi has its fingers in multiple pies. It's a partner to Intel and Mobileye in both of the efforts I noted above, both of which have the potential to be very profitable. But there are two big things that distinguish Delphi from Bosch for our purposes. First, Delphi is a public company, and Bosch isn't. Second, and more importantly, Delphi is setting itself up to become a "pure play" in autonomous-vehicle technology and related fields. The company announced earlier this year that it will spin off its legacy internal-combustion engine components business to focus entirely on "electronic safety systems" -- autonomous-vehicle tech and its building blocks. That move will make Delphi the closest thing to a "pure-play" investment in autonomous-vehicle technology since -- well, since Mobileye. But Delphi's current valuation (around 20 times earnings) makes it much cheaper than Mobileye was before Intel scooped it up. It might seem counterintuitive to invest in an auto-industry stalwart just as the industry is about to be transformed, but that's arguably another reason why Delphi deserves a very close look.

One of the most interesting ideas was that of a Modular PC. This basically put the core guts of a laptop - chipset, processor, memory, and storage - into a box similar in size to a deck of cards. The company envisioned a set of accessories that ranged from a smartphone to a full-on desktop that would go with it, but the IBM CEO at the time killed the idea. A few years later, a little company called Antelope Technologies brought the thing to market using a Transmeta processor; it found a small niche but didn’t survive. Almost 20 years later, Intel is going to give it a run with something called the Intel Compute Card, which addresses almost all of the problems the old IBM Modular PC had. (By the way, this is Intel’s second shot at this and it is amazing that it’s following a similar path to the one IBM started so many years ago.) The Evolution of the Modular Computer The concept for the modular computer was initially founded to correct a serious consumer problem. Processors, storage and memory were very expensive and users were being forced to buy it two or three times for their smartphones (which were just starting to gain traction), laptop/Windows tablet, and/or desktop computer. If you could create a module that had these core elements, the user would only have to buy one set and then basically plug the module that contained this technology into a smartphone, tablet, laptop or dock to get the function of multiple devices without having to buy the redundant components. In addition, sync wasn’t available back then, wireless technology sucked, and we didn’t even know what “the cloud” was, so this also solved the problem of being able to get to your stuff while mobile. A lot of discussion surrounded whether the module should have a screen and some functionality or not, and it was decided not to include it because these aspects created problems for other applications like laptops, tablets, and even PCs, which had their own screens. The Problems That Killed Modular A number of problems killed the effort. First, prices for processors, memory and storage started to drop quickly, making redundancy less of a problem. The market developed syncing applications, and wireless got better, so keeping your stuff with you on a variety of devices got a ton easier. Intel’s technology wasn’t mobile enough back then, and Transmeta largely went out of business. Given the low runs for the core compute module and all of the accessories, the resulting cost was higher than buying a better-performing multi-device solution. Oh, and the size of the computing module was simply too big, resulting in tablets and smartphones that looked stupid. I was approached to be CEO of one of the efforts related to it back then. I turned down the opportunity because I was convinced the technology wasn’t ready and that it would take a company like Intel or Microsoft to create the core technology and the ecosystem that would make this work, not to mention fund the effort enough to get it to critical mass. Intel’s Compute Card Boy, what a difference a couple of decades make. Intel has aggressively made its technology more portable, resulting in a core module that is the size of a small stack of business cards. Prices have come down sharply, which should keep this module affordable, and it is thin enough to go into a laptop or tablet carrier without the resulting combination being too ugly. While sync and wireless connectivity are common, so are concerns surrounding wireless security, often making it safer to move the files physically rather than electronically for some industries. And finally, and most recently, concerns about laptops being turned into bombs have resulted in an effort to ban them on planes. Renting an approved laptop in an airport for the flight might be a possibility, but the security concerns would be daunting, plus you’d need a configuration that didn’t have a battery (and would be able to live off the power available at the seat). Renting a shell that would use your module would likely be far safer, for the airline and your data, resulting in a very timely alternative to carrying a laptop or tablet on a long flight. At some point, particularly in first class, the airline might provide a dock and a screen so the experience could become even more convenient. Wrapping Up:  The Improved Modular Idea The old IBM idea of a modular computer had a number of critical faults. Over time, one by one, those faults have been corrected and the Intel Compute Card is the impressive result. Still, to fully reach potential, it needs a unique mass market use (like being the only way to safely bring a laptop onto a plane), and an eco-system that fleshes out the offering (and Intel remains one of the few companies that can even do that). In the short term, this could be an ideal way to address some security needs, provide an imbedded computer with prices at scale across a variety of machines that need PC functionality, or have a home PC that can be easily moved from room to room (dock to dock). Not to mention that this might be a good solution for small kids on computers, where the module could be locked up during times when the little darlings aren’t supervised. In the end, I like that someone is still trying to make this work.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Old and Busted: Trump Doesn’t Get Daily Intel Briefs. New Hotness: Trump Spends Too Much Time on Intel Briefs. Posted at 3:30 pm on May 31, 2017 by streiff Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Let’s take a quick trip back to December. Trump had been president elect for about a month and a half and Politico and its fellow travelers were on a tear about Donald Trump not getting daily intelligence briefings. Take this from USA Today as a sampling: Donald Trump’s reluctance to receive daily intelligence briefings — and his blunt rejection of the CIA’s assessment of Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election — suggest a rocky start to the president-elect’s relationship with intelligence agencies. Since the election, Trump has received the President’s Daily Briefing only four times, amid meetings with potential Cabinet secretaries and other transition business. And on Sunday, the president-elect suggested that the rate of briefings won’t change once he’s sworn in next month. As I pointed out at the time, there is no tradition of a president taking the Presidential Daily Briefing in person: Democrats Are Flip-Flopping Like A Landed Fish On Russia And Trump’s Intelligence Briefings. Now we are onto the newest criticism. President Trump consumes classified intelligence like he does most everything else in life: ravenously and impatiently, eager to ingest glinting nuggets but often indifferent to subtleties. Most mornings, often at 10:30, sometimes earlier, Trump sits behind the historic Resolute desk and, with a fresh Diet Coke fizzing and papers piled high, receives top-secret updates on the world’s hot spots. The president interrupts his briefers with questions but also with random asides. He asks that the top brass of the intelligence community be present, and he demands brevity. … Yet there are signs that the president may not be retaining all the intelligence he is presented, fully absorbing its nuance, or respecting the sensitivities of the information and how it was gathered. Of course he isn’t retaining it or absorbing its essence. He’s an idiot, right? As president, Trump now takes briefings nearly every day. In a White House with few steadying mechanisms — and one led by a Washington neophyte who bristles at structure and protocol — the daily intelligence briefing is the rare constant. The sessions often run past their scheduled time, stretching for 30 or 45 minutes, prompting Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to pop into the Oval Office to cut off the discussion: “Mr. President, we’ve got people backing up outside. … Still, Trump tells advisers that he values his daily briefings. Though career intelligence analysts often take the lead in delivering them, Trump likes his political appointees — Pompeo and Coats — to attend, along with national security adviser H.R. McMaster. Pompeo and Coats, whose offices are in McLean, Va., have had to redesign their daily routines so that they spend many mornings at the White House. Vice President Pence usually attends, while other administration principals join depending on the topic of the day, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly. Senior members of the West Wing staff sometimes float in and out of the Oval Office during the briefings.” I’m really sure Trump spending a lot of time on the Presidential Daily Brief, and taking regularly, and asking questions, and having his national security team sit in with him is just another sign that Trump has no interest in the job and is an incompetent boob. What other explanation could there be? In fact, the only thing worse than him taking the briefings and paying attention is him not taking the briefings and not paying attention.

And so far the signs are very promising indeed. We've been keenly following the crowdfunded, community-developed Eve V convertible tablet since the first specs and images emerged late last year, and now it's hands-on time! The Finnish company was present at the Microsoft booth at Computex 2017 today, showing off their creation alongside more established brands. (Microsoft, among Intel and others, is one of the company's backers.) Like a Surface Pro, but with more ports, a speccier base model and a disruptive price. To answer a few likely questions upfront: Yep, this thing looks and feels a lot like a Surface Pro. But it also has its own distinctive identity, with sturdy build quality, and a near perfect balance between size and weight. It hits all the important spec targets, as we've known for a while, and the addition of extra ports and features (compared to Microsoft's latest convertible) doesn't seem to have come with any unwanted side-effects. So if you're after a Surface-alike that's a little bit qurirky, with improved connectivity — USB-Type C, Thunderbolt 3, and a microSD reader — then look no further. The pricing of a maxed-out V hasn't been confirmed yet, but the base model starts at $799, for specs that outpace the Surface Pro, and the manufacturer seems enthusiastic about the halo effect of Surface comparisons. It's "flattering," that consumers might see the V and mistake it for Microsoft's tablet, CFO Tuukka Korhonen told me. Despite its associaton with big names like Microsoft and Intel, Eve still sees itself as a disruptor, and its focus on developing products with its community isn't unlike what OnePlus has tried to achieve in the Android phone world. (It's also a tactic that's been attempted by many less successful crowdfunding hopefuls.) Eve has already succeeded where many other crowdfunding hopefuls have fallen by the wayside. The tablet is built around a 12.3-inch IGZO LCD with 2736 x 1824 resolution, which looks gorgeous, and easily visible under the bright floodlights of the Microsoft booth. (We didn't get to try it under the bright Taipei sunshine, but a rated brightness of 450 nits bodes well for daylight visibility all the same.) There's just enough bezel to hold onto, without making the device appear clunky. The metal body has a subtle matte texture, and feels sturdy in the hand. And the angled side walls serve much the same purpose as the Sufrace Pro's, helping with grip and providing a home for all your ports. That includes the power key, with integrated one-touch fingerprint scanner for Windows Hello. Around the back, there's a Surface-like hinge, which was apparently a major focus of engineering effort throughout development, as Eve worked to get it feeling just right while avoiding any issues with wear and tear. From a layman's point of view, I can say that the hinge does its job, strikes a nice balance between stiffness and ease of motion whether the device is in laptop or tablet mode. The base model Eve V out-specs the Surface Pro at the same price point. Powering the whole assembly are seventh-generation Intel chips — Core M3, i5 or i7 — along with 8GB of 16GB of RAM, and 128, 256 and 512GB storage options. There's also an ample 48 Wh battery, which we're told is good for a full day of use. (The 10-12 hour rating naturally depends on what you're using it for.) Eve's branding is subtle, almost to a fault. You'd easily miss the "V" logo around the back (dark gray on black), and the front panel is completely featureless. The more playful additions can be found on the keyboard backlit, Alcantara-clad keyboard, which connects over Bluetooth and charges over pogo pin connectors. The V key is replaced with a V logo (pressing Fn + V will change your backlighting color, for what it's worth), and backspace becomes "Oops." Because why not? Backspace becomes 'Oops.' It all plays into V's brand image as a disruptive influence — a product developed, publicly, with the people who are going to be using it. And as such, Eve is free to drop in whimsical hardware quirks like this. The keyboard itself is somewhat thicker than the Surface Pro's, but it equally doesn't feel excessively bulky, and stays put just as well as any magnetically attached tablet cover. Other notables include stylus support with Windows Ink certification — the V has its own pen, but also works flawlessly with Microsoft Surface Pen and Surface Dial, CEO Konstantinos Karatsevidis told me. And on the audio side, quad speakers (they get pretty loud, but these things are hard to judge in a trade show environment) are backed up by a 1-amp 3.5mm headphone jack. It's going to take longer than just a half-hour or so with the Eve V to judge its overall success, or otherwise. But the first impressions are very positive. The company appears to have the fundamentals down — everything works, looks good, and the only giveaway that this is the product of a crowdfunded startup are the splashes of branding about the place. There's no shortage of Surface clones right now, but the Eve V is one we're eager to see more of in the months ahead.

But I do think that as average users push that m class chip to turbo over and over and their battery life is more like 6-8 hours they will notice. 4 15 hours ago Reply BryanMahendra Dude... We've been doing the CPU-limit trick (capping at 99%, so it won't go Turbo) for the SP4 i5/i7 for years to manage the maximum 7 hours batery life (usual 5.5 hours if the user doesn't know). Basically the Eve V is the "7th Core-M/Y Model of the SP4 that Microsoft won't bump the Storage/RAM above 128/4gb... with TB3 USB-C/2A ports and 48Wh battery.' I checked the Indiegogo pricing, the i5/256/8Gb is $1000-1100 & the max i7/512/16Gb is $ 1399-1500 (w/without tax-shipment). If the build quality is on-par, that's not a bad bargain. 0 28 min ago Reply Sunstorming Indiegogo = fail -4 17 hours ago Reply Drael646464 Bezels almost look too small.  -1 17 hours ago Reply MrElectrifyer This doesn't "outspec" the Surface Pro, it's using Y series processors, which alone was a deal breaker for me.

So yeah, it's a nifty feature above MS/iPad Pro; you could connect to the Tablet like it would (say you are drawing and need to type from afar.) or hook it up to your phone. 0 23 min ago Reply atulk malhotra I remember Eve prices being an instant put off for many. 0 16 hours ago Reply ScubaDog No kidding.  My interest in this device over the latest Surface Pro really is gaining headway.  I just can't help the nagging feeling, though, that there's a gotcha waiting to be found.  It doesn't really bother me that this doesn't support the pen sensitivity that the new SP does--I currently have the SP3 and the pen is fine even now. One thing that does concern me is the fact that the keyboard is Bluetooth.  I know some would call this a plus, but it's one more thing that has a battery that can lose ability to hold a charge over time.  I guess if I never plan to have it separated from the tablet while I'm using the keyboard this won't matter, but.... Bottom line, I'm anxious to see more substantial reviews of it and am curious about when it will be available and through what avenues.  If I'm going to off on replacing my SP3 (which still works awesome, so no real hurry), I want to make sure I'm going with the best value. 3 16 hours ago Reply Cyril Richard Well, for the keyboard, as you said yourself the Bluetooth is to be considered simply as an added benefit. If you want to use it plugged only, you can. And if from time to time you need to use it with the tablet a meter away (tablet on table and keyboard on your lap maybe?) or to use it with another device (your smartphone maybe?)...you can. And you're likely to have the keyboard with you often since it comes with the tablet. I'm currently seriously considering the Surface Pro but I clearly want to wait until reviews of both the Surface and Eve V are available. I also want to know the final price of the V + keyboard + pen. What drags me a bit to the Surface is all the comments that we can read that insist that any Surface device has that little "something" that makes you just want to use it. I've never owned a Surface device so I'm curious to check by myself. But if battery life of EVE is on par or better than Surface Pro and price is lower...I might go for it. 0 15 hours ago Reply sporosarcina With a Y series (rebranded m) versus and actual U series iCore. 2 15 hours ago Reply Cyril Richard True, but for my use which is pretty casual (with no gaming at all), I'm pretty sure an i5-Y is enough or more than enough. If I suddenly launch many tabs and/or many programs at the same time, the burst should provide enough power for that limited time. I'm mostly using the web browser, quite a lot of store apps, and a few x86 programs including office. 1 13 hours ago Reply sporosarcina That's my point, Y series chips are perfect for that use, but TB3 is wasted in that scenario. A TB3 use scenario (I.e. EGPU) would stress a Y-series chip 2 8 hours ago Reply Cyril Richard Good to know it's perfect for this use! Not that I was worried but a confirmation is always helpful 0 8 hours ago Reply Zachary Wilmes For me, that little something is the same thing that attracted me to Eve. For example, a few weeks ago it was discovered during artificial aging tests that the V's screen could develop yellow spots over time. This is an issue that happens with Surface Pros, iPhones, you name it, all the "high end" big-name manufacturers have this issue on some devices. But Eve returned the screens to the supplier and went with a different screen supplier to eliminate the issue. We're still waiting to hear whether the new supplier has really fixed the issue. Another "little something", each V purchased as an "early bird" is going to have it's display individually professionally color-calibrated to IIRC 102% sRGB (or similar). I could go on and on, the ability to adjust the processor TDP up to a higher value (which doesn't throttle the device because of the custom engineered heatsink), the ability to connect the keyboard by Bluetooth to three separate devices with the push of a button, etc. These guys appear to be the real deal, which is why I've backed them since February 2016 and have an m3 model on preorder. So excited! 😃 2 12 hours ago Reply DavidinCT Something to watch out for....basic same design (look), better specs for the dollar ?  Sounds like a win to me 0 15 hours ago Reply sporosarcina Running the rebranded m5/m7 is not better specs for the dollar. The much demanded TB3 would be useless on a Y series chip. 0 15 hours ago Reply Zachary Wilmes Wrong. It's already been tested by prototype testers. An eGPU works great on the V through TB3, that's one of the reasons it was included in the device. 0 12 hours ago Reply sporosarcina Thermally stressing a Y-series chip with programs needing an eGPU... Yeah, recipe for long processor life. -1 8 hours ago Reply Zachary Wilmes Not as big of an issue as you think. Case in point, I've been running an AMD FX 4130 OC'd to 4.2 GHz on almost 24/7 runtime with an hour or two or more of hard gaming every day since mid 2014. Thing is, these processors are designed to handle heat and if they get too hot thermal limiting kicks in. It's a lot harder to burn out a CPU than it used to be. 0 8 hours ago Reply digitaldd if there is an 8GB RAM/128GB storage version with an m5 or i5 for say $900 I'd be intrigued. 0 14 hours ago Reply iKirin Hi DigitalDD! :) Our "smallest" configuration is featuring the Core M3/8GB/128GB SSD so that should hit the mark for you ;) 1 9 hours ago Reply Mr J Christie CNET says this device outperforms the new surface device in every aspect. Correction " SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMS", both the Surface Pro and all the rest and at a significant reduction in Price, which anyone loves. JC 1 14 hours ago Reply Zachary Wilmes Literally the only area it doesn't is in the pen area. The Surface Pro is a few ms faster with pen input and has more pressure levels, neither of which i think will really affect me. Sounds like the V will be getting pen tilt support so that part is on even ground. 0 12 hours ago Reply Justinian84 There is no way this outperforms the new Surface Pro in any way. Y-series processors, thicker/unknown weight, worse quality trackpad (that's Synaptics for you) and MUCH worse pen are the confirmed standout aspects. Other aspects I have doubts about include likely lower quality screen, lower quality build, lower quality hinge, lower quality keyboard and finish (seems to be quite a fingerprint magnet like the 1st gen Surfrace Pros). I think it's a wonderful product, and I fully support these guys, but comparing a startup's first device with the fruit of years of experience and resources of the Surface Team is a little unrealistic.   0 7 sec ago Reply DeepHeet On driver support the Eve team chose only branded components from vendors with good driver support e.g. Intel SSD, Realtec audio. I'm a hyper early backer and really looking forward to getting my V in June. The devices have been through 3 rounds of prototype testing by 20+ community members to iron out as many bugs as possible. On performance while the V has a 7th Gen Core i Y series CPU performance tests by the community have shown comparable performance to the equivalent 6th Gen Core I U series due to less CPU throttling. Eve Tech are finalising the support model, but there will be coverage for warranty and repairs (possibly similar to the Surface send in model). Not to forget there is a passionate community behind Eve V who will likely provide better and faster support than most larger tech companies. Eve tech keep prices low by cutting out the middle men. Direct orders and shipping direct from the factory. This model might not work for everyone, particularly those who want to see the device before purchasing. Again here the community might provide the answer. There have already been several meet ups to show off prototypes to community members. With 2000+ baxxckers around the world you will probably find a community member near by who is happy to organise a meet up for interested parties. Just join the community and post. 0 11 hours ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

The technology to enable true 4K has been around for years, but as is often the case, it takes a while for the tech to filter through and become more affordable. That's where we're at right now. Today, 4K TVs are common and so are 4K PC monitors, and we're getting more and more ultra HD (UHD) content to use with these displays. But a display isn't any use without something to actually push that 4K content to it. Thankfully, that doesn't require a high-end gaming PC. There's a pretty wide range of PCs that can push 4K video output, from the very big to the very small. And in the case of a mini PC, you're looking at a good option for a living-room-based Home Theater PC (HTPC). How can you tell if a mini PC supports 4K? It shouldn't be too difficult to figure out whether your mini PC is capable of outputting 4K video. From a processor perspective, Intel added support for it into much of its lineup of Core i chips, and now even the lower-powered Atom processors can support 4K. The best place to check many different aspects of specific processors is Intel's reference guide. Check out which processors support 4K video at Intel When it comes to Atom processors, as far back as 2015 with the Cherry Trail x7, Intel was talking about 4K video output at 30 frames per second (FPS) in the H.265 codec, or 60 FPS in H.264. The generations-old Surface 3 has a processor capable of outputting 4K video, for example. Even the less powerful x5 can do 4K video, albeit in a more limited way than the x7. Taking a $100 mini PC as an example, with Intel HD 400 graphics you should still get 4K output at 30 FPS. To look more specifically at Intel graphics and its capability, check out the link below. When you're looking at any product it should always have an accompanying spec on which version of Intel graphics you'll get. Intel graphics specifications Why does any of this matter? If you're not concerned about 4K, it doesn't. Here's the thing: The HTPC isn't a new concept, but in years past folks have had fairly large (read the size of a VCR, remember those?!) boxes beneath their TVs to house them. How to turn your mini PC into a monster media center But even without Windows Media Center, a Windows 10 PC is a great thing to use to control your home media. And even if you don't yet care about 4K content, you probably will in the future. Netflix already delivers 4K video through Microsoft Edge, and Amazon has UHD content available. This trend will only increase. Perhaps best of all is that for not a lot of money you can get yourself a little PC that can handle all of the 4K video. Make the right choice now, and you'll have a highly capable home entertainment center that'll last for years.

I'm near sighted and don't benefit from a higher resolution TV. 0 11 hours ago Reply Zachary Wilmes Have you thought about corrective lenses? I am near-sighted as well but wear inexpensive contact lenses and use a 4K tv for my computer. Trust me, on a 50" screen 4K makes a difference even for near-sighted individuals. Picked up my 4K 50" Samsung for around $400 on Black Friday last fall. 1 10 hours ago Reply phxchristian As a near-sighted guy myself, I think a 4k TV makes a great monitor. I bought a 42" Samsung 4k KU6290 TV for $198 at BestBuy recently (last few months) and it certainly has beaten my previous dual 24" ASUS monitors and a great small PC to get if you need a screaming workstation / gaming PC is the Intel Skull Canyon NUC. I maxed it out to 32GB RAM and dual 500 GB SSD's one with a max read speed of 2200MB/s (boot drive) and the other with a max read speed of 500MB/s (data drive). 1 3 hours ago Reply BilgisayarKurdu16 But gaming from TV introduces more noticeable input lag than monitors. 0 2 hours ago Reply phxchristian Not if the TV has a PC mode.  Mine has a low latency mode that makes input instant.  No lag is apparent at all and this goes for gaming as well.  You set this mode using the input and only one of the HDMI ports supports this (as well as HDR+) so I plug the NUC into that port (HDMI 1). 1 2 hours ago Reply Zachary Wilmes Same here. My TV has a Game Mode but it automatically disables at 4K60 resolution, as there is basically no lag whatsoever. 0 54 min ago Reply nsnhd How comes that the TV has a so low price ? With that price I couldn't buy a new 1080p TV. 0 32 min ago Reply Zachary Wilmes You just have to shop around. Deals like that don't come around every day so sometimes you have to be willing to wait a few months or even a year to get a good price. 0 0 sec ago Reply l00natic71 It was my understanding that for Netflix 4K to work, you need a Kabby lake processor due to the DRM on that family.  0 9 hours ago Reply Paint_Ninja I heard from somewhere that NVidia 10-series GPUs and maybe even AMD RX GPUs also support decoding that DRM. Might be mistaken though 0 5 hours ago Reply Michal Kovac Yes, you need Kaby lake and more, you also need to have HDCP 2.2 connection which typically means also to have HDMI 2.0 - and not on separate card, on the motherboard. So, it is today opposite, most PCs won't be able to stream Netflix. 0 5 hours ago Reply Khaaannn 4K is really only useful at 55' or bigger. Anything smaller than that in a TV and you sit too far away from it to matter. That and it has to support HDR or it's pretty much useless. 0 9 hours ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

By: Express Web Desk | Published:May 31, 2017 10:49 pm Jason Roy, Ben Stokes and Alex Hales will be using the newly invented bat sensor during their match against Bangladesh. (Source: Reuters) Related News ICC Champions Trophy 2017: Battle between Steve Smith and Kane Williamson will be intriguing, says Mike Hussey ICC Champions Trophy 2017: New Zealand don’t know what their best line-up is, says Shane Bond MS Dhoni will make it through to the 2019 World Cup, says Stephen Fleming With the Champions Trophy 2017 slated to begin from June 1 with the hosts England taking on Bangladesh in the tournament opener, ICC and the Intel technologies have come together and have developed a sensor which will be placed on top of the bat handle, to provide precise data about a player’s bat speed and angle of the back-lift. Along with the bat sensor, Intel has designed a Falcon 8 Drone, which will be equipped with HD and infrared cameras for advanced pitch analysis ahead of the matches. Former England skipper Naseer Hussain heaped praise for the invention and said that the batsmen like Jason Roy, who struggling with their current form with the bat, might gain from the new system. “Take Jason Roy, struggling a little bit at the moment. Say this technology had been in place for two or three years, he could have a net tomorrow, play normally, and then take the data from two years ago and say ‘Is everything I’m doing with my bat exactly the same as it was?’ and if you know it was, you know that’s not the issue,” Nasser said. Ahead of their match against the Mashrafe Mortaza-led Bangladesh side, it was confirmed that Alex Hales, all-rounder Ben Stokes and Roy will be among the players to use the newly invented technology. ICC CEO David Richardson believes the innovation Intel is bringing in will transform viewers experience. “We couldn’t be more excited to have Intel as our ‘Official Innovation Partner’ of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017. The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort. That’s all about offering the fans premium content and embracing technology.” Richardson added in a statement. Sandra Lopez, the Vice-President of the Intel Sports Group, said that “Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitisation and personalisation of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports.” Meanwhile, the images caught by the drone will be offering rich visual data which will be used to generate pitch reports. It will also allow the fans to experience what it actually feels like to face the world’s best bowlers.

Flynn's firm was tasked with lobbying the US government to extradite Fetullah Gulen — a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania who Erdogan believes is responsible for planning last year's attempted coup and, more generally, fomenting dissent inside Turkey. Alptekin paid Flynn's firm, the Flynn Intel Group, over $500,000 to produce a documentary about the dangers of Gulen, which he had hoped would be "a small, '60 Minutes' kind of a thing, where these conclusions are brought to the public," he told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. "We thought that might have a good effect." The former Vice News correspondent who was hired to work on the documentary, David Enders, told the Journal that he had been instructed to conceal Flynn Intel Group's involvement in producing the film. "'We don’t want anyone to know the Flynn Intel Group has anything to do with this,'" Enders recalled the head of the firm, Bijan Kian, telling him at the time. He told the Journal that Kian asked him to hide the film equipment from the staff of the hotel they were doing interviews in. "It was very hush-hush," Enders told the Journal. "They were like Keystone Kops." Ultimately, the film was never finished. Neither Enders nor Kian responded to request for additional comment.  Flynn raised eyebrows when he wrote an op-ed article for The Hill, published November 8, alleging that Gulen helmed a "vast global network" that "has all the right markings to fit the description of a dangerous sleeper terror network." Flynn's op-ed seemed out of place amid his work with the Trump campaign. His work for Inovo did not come to light until after he registered as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice in March — four months after his contract with Alptekin ended. In his FARA (Foreign Agent Registration Act) filing, Flynn acknowledged that his firm had conducted research for Inovo that "focused on" Gulen. But it may have gone further than that: Flynn met with Turkish government ministers in September, where he reportedly discussed removing Gulen from US soil, according to former CIA Director James Woolsey, who was at the meeting.  Price Floyd, a former spokesman for Flynn, strongly denied that such a discussion ever took place, telling Business Insider at the time that Flynn was contracted by Inovo, in part, "to gather information on Gulen and turn it over to legal authorities to take action." Alptekin did not respond to request for comment. But he told The Associated Press earlier this year that he did not agree with Flynn's decision to register as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice for his work with Inovo. "It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government," Alpetkin said.  Still, Flynn said in his filing with the DOJ that his work for Inovo "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey."  Join the conversation about this story » NOW WATCH: Watch as Democrats break out in song as the AHCA passes the House See Also: The Trump-Russia controversy may put 'wartime consigliere' Steve Bannon back in the spotlight 'Melania needs to get with the program’: Ian Bremmer explains the biggest takeaways from Trump’s first foreign trip The FBI just declined the House oversight committee's request for Comey's memos SEE ALSO: 'None of it makes much sense': Experts are baffled by Comey's use of a fake Russian document to skirt the DOJ Top Stories Appeals court rules on Crystal Boyett's request for new trial Court overturns man's murder conviction of Vidor teen Tyler Co.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The 3 Best PC Stocks to Buy in 2017 Contrary to predictions, the PC market is far from dead, which translates to opportunities for investors. Tim Brugger (timbrugger) May 31, 2017 at 1:00PM The negativity surrounding the PC market has been around for years now. With the advent of smartphones and other mobile devices, PCs were supposedly on their way to the junk pile. As it turns out, PCs are not only alive and well, but the market is growing. Bucking the anti-PC naysayers has opened the door to great opportunities for investors. The generally dour mood surrounding personal computers means stocks including HP (NYSE:HPQ), OS king Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and chip behemoth Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are all not only experiencing top- and bottom-line growth, they are significantly undervalued. HP's new OMEN computer. Image source: HP. Not your parents PC manufacturer According to IDC, for the first time in five years, PC sales actually climbed to kick off the year, albeit by a mere 0.6%. One of the primary drivers of the PC market turnaround was none other than HP. Given the last several quarters of growth, not surprisingly, HP took over the top spot as the world's No. 1 PC manufacturer, a designation long held by China-based Lenovo. HP shipped 13.1 million units in the first quarter, good for an astounding 13.1% jump year over year and a 21.8% share of the global marketplace. Personal Systems revenue, home to HP's PC sales, climbed 10% last quarter to $7.66 billion: Not bad for a "dying" market. What makes HP's sales results even more encouraging is how the company is executing its PC strategy. Targeting specific niche markets -- HP's OMEN virtual reality-ready PC is an ideal example -- helped drive a whopping 17% increase in notebook sales in the fiscal second quarter. Toss in a 2.8% dividend yield along with its strong PC and improving printing sales, and HP is an undervalued stock by almost any measure. Windows is still king There was some consternation among investors following Microsoft's fiscal third-quarter earnings release on April 27. The "missed" expectations seemed to be the primary story, which is good news for investors in that its stock has remained a relative value despite the strength of its Windows operating system (OS) dominance, forays into the cloud, and market-leading productivity product lineup. Microsoft's Personal Computing division recorded a 7% decline in revenue, to $8.8 billion. But remove the 26% drop in Surface sales, and Microsoft's computing unit tells a different story. Largely thanks to Microsoft's 90%-plus OS market dominance and its industry-leading $15.2 billion annual cloud revenue run rate, Windows has helped boost virtually every PC-related offering in its arsenal. Last quarter, Windows revenue climbed 5%, which helped boost Microsoft's commercial Office 365 sales 45% and drove an astounding 81% increase in Dynamics 365 revenue: Most hosted on the Azure cloud platform, which soared 93% year over year. And like HP, Microsoft also pays shareholders a solid 2.25% dividend yield. What's not to love? Intel is another PC stock that suffers from the PC malaise still prevalent despite the market's strength. After reporting an 8% increase in revenue last quarter to a record-breaking $14.8 billion, Intel's stock declined 3.4% the following day. The problem? Intel's strong PC-related sales were viewed by some as more of an aberration than what it was: Yet another sign that there's a place in this world for computers. Much like HP and its push into the fast-growing 3D printing market and Microsoft's cloud leadership position, Intel is also expanding beyond PCs into data centers, the Internet of Things (IoT), and memory solutions. In addition to the 6% increase in computing revenue last quarter, to $8 billion, Intel's data center sales of $4.2 billion were a 6% improvement, IoT was up 11%, and memory solutions revenue skyrocketed 55% to $866 million. Also lost in the PC hoopla last quarter was the fact that even considering Intel's forays into markets beyond its core computing segment, its operating expenses declined, which, combined with its top-line growth, boosted per-share earnings 45% to $0.61. With its 3% dividend and a forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of a meager 12.7, Intel also warrants a spot on a list of PC stocks to buy in 2017.

Michael Flynn previously declined the Senate intelligence committee’s subpoena and invoked his Fifth Amendment protection.  (CHRIS KLEPONIS / AFP / GETTY IMAGES)   By Chad Day And Jake PearsonThe Associated Press Wed., May 31, 2017 WASHINGTON—Former national security adviser Michael Flynn will provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee as part of its probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, The Associated Press has learned. Flynn’s decision Tuesday came as U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, rejected a House intelligence committee request for information, and former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the House investigation. Meanwhile, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sounded similar tones as they criticized the ongoing U.S. scrutiny of Russia’s attempts to sway the presidential election. Flynn’s co-operation was the first signal that he and the Senate panel have found common ground. Congressional investigators continue to press for key documents in the ongoing investigation, and the retired lieutenant general is trying to limit damaging disclosures that hostile Democratic lawmakers could use against him. Read the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump Article Continued Below Flynn had previously invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination in declining an earlier subpoena from the committee, which sought a wide array of documents and information related to his contacts with Russia. Flynn’s attorneys had argued the request was too broad and would have required Flynn to turn over information that could have been used against him. U.S. President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn invoked the fifth amendment on May 22, rebuffing a subpoena in the investigation into Russia's election meddling. (The Associated Press) In response, the Senate panel narrowed the scope of its request. It also issued subpoenas seeking records from Flynn’s businesses. One of the businesses, Flynn Intel Group Inc., did consulting work for a Turkish businessman that required Flynn to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent earlier this year. The other, Flynn Intel Group LLC, was used to accept money from Flynn’s paid speeches. Among the payments was more than $44,500 Flynn received from RT, the Russian state-sponsored television network that U.S. intelligence officials have branded as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin. Read more: Intel committee issues subpoena for Trump’s personal attorney in ongoing Russia investigation White House communications director Michael Dubke quits The Trump-Russia investigation now hinges on what Jared Kushner was thinking when he met Putin ally On Tuesday, a person close to Flynn said he will turn over documents related to the two businesses as well as some personal documents the committee sought in the narrower request. Flynn plans to produce some of the documents by next week, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Flynn’s private interactions with the committee. While the Senate committee awaits documents from Flynn, Putin and Trump both dismissed the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic emails. In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Putin reaffirmed his strong denial of Russian involvement in the hacking. The interview was recorded during Putin’s Monday trip to Paris and released Tuesday. Putin also said the allegations are “fiction” invented by the Democrats in order to explain their loss. Trump made a similar claim in a tweet early Tuesday: “Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.” Meanwhile, Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney, told the AP that he turned down a request for information from the House intelligence committee looking into the Russian interference. “I declined the invitation to participate as the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered,” Cohen said. “I find it irresponsible and improper that the request sent to me was leaked by those working on the committee.” Earlier Tuesday, the AP reported, citing a congressional aide, that the House intelligence committee had subpoenaed Cohen. The aide later retracted the statement. Cohen said if he is subpoenaed, he will comply. Cohen, a longtime attorney for the Trump Organization, remains a personal lawyer for Trump. He served as a cable television surrogate for the Republican during the presidential campaign. Cohen told ABC News that he had been asked by both the House and Senate intelligence committees to provide information and testimony about contacts he had with Russian officials. Cohen’s ties with Russian interests came up in February when The New York Times reported that Cohen helped to broker a Ukraine peace plan that would call for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and a referendum to let Ukrainians decide whether the part of the country seized by Russia in 2014 should be leased to Moscow. The Russian government denied knowing anything about such a plan. The Times reported that the peace plan was the work of Felix Sater, a business associate who has helped Trump try to find business in Russia, and Cohen. Cohen was a fierce defender of Trump during the campaign, often haranguing probing reporters and famously challenging a CNN reporter live on-air to name the specific polls that showed then-candidate Trump behind his rival, Hillary Clinton. In the early 2000s, he formed his own firm working on a range of legal matters, including malpractice cases, business law and work on an ethanol business in Ukraine. Cohen also owned and operated a handful of taxi medallions, managing a fleet of cabs in New York. Cohen’s business associates in the taxi enterprise included a number of men from the former Soviet Union, including his Ukrainian-born father-in-law. Cohen has made his own unsuccessful attempts at public office, losing a city council race and briefly running for state assembly in New York. The House intelligence committee has also sought information from Epshteyn, a former staffer in the Trump White House. Epshteyn said in a statement that he has asked the committee questions to better understand what information it is seeking and will determine whether he can reasonably provide it. Epshteyn, who grew up in Moscow, worked a short time in the White House press office. He left in March and now works as a political analyst for right-leaning Sinclair Broadcasting.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman IT Innovation Drives Business Value Printer-friendly version Intel Issues Annual IT Performance Report Today, Intel published its 2016-2017 Intel IT Annual Performance Report, which showcases how innovative use of predictive analytics and machine learning is helping the company make better products faster, improve its supply chain, and make its marketing and sales efforts more effective. The case studies in this year’s report demonstrate Intel IT is leading the company’s digital transformation – the same transformation Intel technology makes possible for customers around the world. According to IDC, 70 percent of Global 2000 CEOs are building corporate strategies around digital transformation to manage unprecedented technological and economic disruption. Intel CIO Paula Tolliver explains that Intel is leading by example. “At Intel, IT not only contributes to the productivity and operational efficiency and effectiveness of the company, it also advances the corporate strategy,” said Tolliver. “Our annual report demonstrates that Intel IT continues to raise the bar in driving innovation, like machine learning and predictive analytics, that helps accelerate growth opportunities for Intel.” Here are some notable results: $656 million in business value derived by rolling out predictive analytics across Intel’s sales, supply chain, factory and manufacturing operations worldwide. Estimated $1 million per year in operational savings due to the rollout of 30,000 high-density disaggregated servers dedicated to product design, cutting refresh costs by as much as 65 percent. 39-week improvement in bringing Intel products to market via a machine-learning platform that uncovers potential bugs during the design phase of a product before it goes into development. 50,000 hours that employees saved by using the Intel® Unite™ solution to quickly start and connect to conference room meetings.

Timing Now, be aware that AMD’s part is expected in a few weeks, while Intel’s is due more towards the end of the year, making Intel’s launch more of a paper launch at the moment.  Still, this is designed to stall the market so that people wait to buy until they see Intel’s part tested.  However, the issue with the timing is that kids in school often have summers off and that is when they’d likely prefer to build a new computer or buy one and have it to play games.  AMD’s Threadripper, I love that name, should arrive late, but within the window, while Intel’s i9 will arrive later in the year.   You can’t expect people to wait for something better when they want to game now, particularly when you are talking about young adults who are known for thinking tactically and needing instant gratification.  Consuming Cores About a decade ago, Intel sent me an 8-core machine and, as I worked and played games, I would bring up the performance monitor to find that I rarely lit up 3 cores let alone anything over 6.  But apparently a lot has changed because I’m writing this on an 8 core i7 and all 8 cores are almost constantly lit up and running at about 30 percent to 50 percent capacity. Plus, when I play a current generation strategy game, I can often peg the cores, suggesting that now I can actually use more than 8 even in what I’m doing.  However, the folks that will really like this extra headroom are those that work with visual tools, such as photo editors, video editors, 3D creation, Computer Aided Design, engineering, or graphic arts.   You and I may like the cores but folks using those tools need them.   Core Wars AMD launched with 16, and Intel countered with 18, but AMD also launched a 32 Core processor (named Epyc) for enterprises, suggesting they have a ton more potential core headroom to match and possibly raise Intel by year end when the i9 actually ships. So, this fight is far from over and we are likely to see a return to something similar to the MHz wars of the 1990s, but this time with cores instead of clock speed. 3D-Xpoint Now, there is a technology that plays on the periphery of this, and it is 3D-Xpoint memory.  Current Intel has it, branded Optane, and AMD doesn’t, though they could get access through Micron, which shares rights to this technology with Intel.  This is the wild card that could be a king maker, but currently it is being used mostly to speed up drives, not replace them.  When it moves to an SSD replacement, AMD should be able to use it as well as Intel does, making it an important, but potentially fleeting, advantage depending on how it plays out.  Optane, 3D-Xpoint is substantially faster than flash, performing closer to DRAM, and the visible performance improvement it has showcased is impressive (though I have yet to use it myself).   Wrapping Up:  More Excitement to Come The core war thing is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to battle royals in the PC space.  This initial fight is on desktop computers but it will quickly move to laptops, and overlaying this will be another Battle Royal between AMD and NVIDIA over graphics technology.  AMD is also launching a new line of graphics cards and NVIDIA has been pumping up their cards at an incredible pace.   In a fight like this, the only people that truly win are us because from gaming, to VR, to actually getting work done that pays the bills, our next computer is likely to be incredible regardless of whose technology is in it!   Author Info Rob Enderle President and Principal Analyst, Enderle Group Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles Core Wars: AMD's Threadripper Takes On Intel's i9 By: Rob Enderle    5/31/2017 Boy, it's starting to feel like summer in the tech market because the competitive fights are really heating up.

Thanks to the brightest minds in Silicon Valley, however, they're rapidly becoming science fact. Google is nearing the final stages of testing for its autonomous car programme, Tesla drivers can enjoy an 'Autopilot' feature for hassle-free motorway driving, and Pittsburgh residents can hail an Uber that drives itself. But how do driverless cars work? Are they safe? When can we expect to try one out for ourselves? We answer all these questions, and more, below. Latest news 31/05/2017: Uber has fired Anthony Levandowski after the engineer failed to cooperate in the ongoing lawsuit with Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Uber general counsel Salle Yoo outlined in Levandowski's termination letter, dated 26 May, that his failure to comply with a court order is the reason for his firing. In the letter Yoo also wrote that "your failure impeded Uber's internal investigation and defense of the lawsuit". A federal judge in the ongoing court case between Uber and Alphabet's self-driving car firm, Waymo, granted a preliminary injunction against Uber on 12 May that led the ride-hailing firm to remove Levandowski from any work on Lidar, and to return any stolen documents to Waymo. Levandowski is accused of downloading 14,000 confidential files before leaving Google's self-driving division in 2016. He went on to start his own self-driving truck company called Otto, which Uber bought in August 2016, six months after he had left his previous employer. Yoo goes on to underline that Uber required the engineer to have "destroyed all property and confidential information belonging to any prior employer" and by not complying with the court order it's a potential breach and warranty in the employment agreement and an "additional ground for termination". Levandowski invoked the fifth amendment in order to not to incriminate himself and refused to hand over documents or answer questions during a deposition. Uber has insisted its technology is different to Waymo's and there is no evidence it has the stolen files on its servers, although it did not check Lewandowski's computer in its search. 19/05/2017: Uber has reportedly threatened to fire Anthony Levandowski amidst a potentially damaging court case involving the possible theft of a rival's trade secrets. The ride-sharing firm is currently embroiled in a legal battle which centers around Levandowski's departure from Waymo, Google's autonomous vehicle division. Waymo claims that when he left the company, Levandowski also exfiltrated over 14,000 documents containing trade secrets which Uber subsequently benefitted from. Levandowski, while not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, has been barred by presiding Judge William Alsup from working on Lidar technology - the technology covered by the allegedly stolen documents. Waymo also wanted to block Uber's driverless car research altogether, but this request was not granted. Alsup has, however, referred the case to criminal prosecutors, which could spell trouble for the company. "Waymo has supplied a compelling record that Levandowski pilfered over 14,000 files from Waymo, and that Uber knew or should have known as much when it brought him on board," Alsup wrote. Throughout the case, Levandowski has made use of his fifth-amendment right to not incriminate himself, and has thus far refused to testify. Now, however, Uber's lawyers have handed him an ultimatum. According to Levandowski's lawyers, Uber's general counsel Salle Yoo told the executive in a letter that he was expected to either deny the charges, or to hand over the purloined files immediately. If he does not, the letter states, the company will take "adverse employment action" against him, which may result in his termination from the company. Referring to the Judge's order to do everything it can to compel Levandowski to produce the documents, Yoo's letter apparently read: "Uber takes its obligations under the Order very seriously, intends to comply fully, and expects you to do the same". Levandowksi's lawyers, however, are arguing that this is unconstitutional. They claim that the court is giving Uber no choice but to fire him unless he violates his fifth-amendment rights. "It is an act by the judicial branch of our federal government compelling an individual to choose between preserving his livelihood and preserving his constitutional rights," Levandowski's legal team wrote in the court filings. "Nearly fifty years of Supreme Court precedent forbid the government from putting an individual to such an unconstitutionally coercive choice," it said. "The Hobson's Choice that Mr. Levandowski now faces is a direct product of government action." 15/05/2017:  Waymo and Lyft are coming together to work on self-driving cars, in a bid to challenge rival Uber. The Google-owned autonomous vehicle firm will be partnering with Uber's main business rival in a non-exclusive deal that aims to bring driverless taxis to market before Uber. According to a Reuters source, talks on the deal began last summer. Uber has notably clashed with both companies. It is currently embroiled in a legal battle with Waymo after being accused of poaching one of its executives, who allegedly brought 14,000 confidential documents with him. Lyft has predominantly been exploring autonomous technology through partnerships, such as a $500 million investment deal with General Motors that will see the two companies work together on similar tech. Lyft says that this new agreement will not affect its relationship with GM. 12/05/2017: A US judge has called for an immediate investigation into the allegations of stolen trade secrets, which have surfaced during a court battle between Uber and Google over self-driving car technology. Google initially filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing app in February, which alleged that former engineer Anthony Levandowksi downloaded 14,000 files without authorisation while working on its self-driving car research. Levandowski is said to have then left Google's Waymo to found his own startup, Otto, which was then later purchased by Uber for $680 million. Google claims that the documents travelled with him, which Uber then used to fast track its own autonomous vehicle research. US District Judge William Alsup stated in a ruling that the case "contains ample evidence" to merit an investigation, and has forwarded a recommendation to the US attorney "based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC's claims for trade secret misappropriation". "The Court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney," the order states. Alsup also partially granted Google's bid to force an injunction against Uber's self-driving car unit, which if successful could determine the future of the company's operations in the technology. This ruling, which could be decided as early as tomorrow, has been made under temporary seal, so the exact scope of the injunction is unclear. The case has been complicated somewhat by Levandowski, who has invoked his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination and refuses to testify, leaving the two companies to fight it out in court. A spokesperson for Uber said in an email to IT Pro: "It is unfortunate that Waymo will be permitted to avoid abiding by the arbitration promise it requires its employees to make. We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum". The company also said it would not be commenting on the case referral to the US Attorney, but stated that the result of the partial preliminary injunction, currently under seal, would most likely be "status quo". Uber initially argued that Waymo's trade secret allegations should be held in private arbitration, however because Levandowski is not a defendant, Uber could not use his arbitration agreement with Waymo to force the proceedings behind closed doors, and as such was rejected by the judge. Uber doesn't dispute the claim that Levandowski stole the documents in question, but argues that trade secrets never made their way into the company's research, and that Google needs to prove that Uber "derived its knowledge from Levandowski". 28/04/2017: Uber self-driving car boss steps down amid Waymo lawsuit Uber's self-driving car chief has left his position after allegations that he stole critical research from his former employers at Waymo, Alphabet's own driverless car unit. Anthony Levandowski will continue to work for Uber, according to an internal memo published by Business Insider, but will no longer head up the company's Advanced Technologies Group or manage its work on autonomous vehicles. "Travis and I have decided that I will be recused from all LiDAR-related work and management at Uber, through the remainder of the Waymo litigation," Levandowski wrote in an email to staff. "This change means that Eric Meyhofer will be the head of ATG, reporting to Travis, and I will report to Eric. My other responsibilities will not change." "This organizational change means I will have absolutely no oversight over or input into our LiDAR work. Going forward, please make sure not to include me in meetings or email threads related to LiDAR, or ask me for advice on the topic." Levandowski's departure comes amid allegations from his former employers, Waymo. The Alphabet-owned self-driving car company claims that when he left to join Uber, Levandowski took vital technology and information on the company's research and development efforts with him. For Uber's part, it claims that its work is "fundamentally different" to Waymo's and that Levandowski's role was focused on management rather than engineering. As part of the ongoing case, the presiding judge has asked the company to provide details of Levandowski's role, which could result in an injunction stopping Lewandowski from working on Uber's autonomous vehicle programme altogether. Uber declined to comment, but referred IT Pro to the email published by Business Insider. 26/04/2017: Leading US carmakers have petitioned the state of California to revise its proposed regulations on autonomous vehicle testing, stating that authorities ignored their earlier concerns that the rules would become too restrictive. Self-driving car manufacturers raised their objections at a public hearing in Sacramento on Tuesday, the recording of which was seen by Reuters, saying that the planned additional regulations should be dropped, and that oversight should be handed to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) instead. In the consultation, hosted via a webcast, automaker groups including the Association of Global Automakers described the proposed regulations as going "too far". The group also opposes California's plans to introduce a permit system, which would be required by all automakers wishing to test self-driving cars in the state. Ride-hailing firm Uber was driven out of San Francisco last year after it refused to apply for a permit to test its autonomous vehicle fleet. Automakers now believe requiring a permit is no longer an effective approach to regulating tests, and object to the proposal that the state could revoke permissions even if a company adheres to federal requirements. If the proposals were to be accepted, the automakers would be liable for any crashes that occur during the tests, even if they were not to blame. General Motors official Paul Hemmersbaugh said that regulations like these could have a "chilling effect on testing and deployment of self-driving cars". It could also see the introduction of a scheme that would ask automakers to submit a voluntary assessment to the NHTSA, outlining specific details of their self-driving vehicle systems. However, according to lawyers representing Google, Ford, and Uber, this would effectively be a mandatory clause. Other self-driving manufacturers, including Alphabet's Waymo and Ford, asked California to relax current regulations that restrict the testing of vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds, which would include rides with multiple passengers. However safety advocates believe harsher regulations would ensure the public is kept safe from potential accidents. Group president for the Consumers for Auto Reliability, Rosemary Shahan, said: "We do not trust the auto manufacturers or the tech industry to protect the public in the absence of federal motors vehicle safety standards." Alphabet's Ron Medford urged the state to quickly issue definitive guidelines "to provide manufacturers with the certainty that they need", although it is clear that lawmakers are still unsure how best to regulate the emerging technology. 24/04/2017: UK tech firms today received funding to test self-driving cars on Britain's roads, reaping the benefits of a recent government pledge to back the development of emerging technologies. Two consortiums have already secured backing as part of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, a government commitment announced on Friday set to invest almost £5 billion into research and development over the next four years. Streetwise, a group led by Cambridge-based AI startup firm FiveAI, is currently working on a trial that will allow commuters to order self-driving cars using a mobile app. This will include the development of new insurance and safety protocols governing the use of the technology. The trial, which is set to launch in 2019, has received £12.8 million in government support and will be developed with input from Direct Line, Transport for London, the Transport Research Laboratory, and the University of Oxford. "It's about delivering to the consumer an autonomous Uber-type service in London," said FiveAI CEO Stan Boland, speaking to the Telegraph. "It's insane for people to buy a car and the leave it parked for 94% of the time and only have one user per car, in the future vehicles can be shared." Driverless shuttle tests are already underway in Greenwich Driven, an initiative led by Oxbotica that has received £8.6 million in government funding, aims to develop self-driving technology over the course of a 30-month programme that started in April, aimed at linking London and Oxford with an autonomous shuttle. Commuters are able to test the technology today on the streets of Greenwich. Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith said: "Today’s news is truly ground-breaking. No company, group or consortium of autonomy experts has ever attempted what DRIVEN is planning over the next 30-months.We are seeking to address some of the most fundamental challenges preventing the future commercial deployment of fully autonomous vehicles. I have full confidence in Driven’s world-leading and internationally respected team of specialists to deliver this project." Telefonica, the UK Atomic Energy Authority's R&D lab Race, UK domain registry firm Nominet, Oxford Robotics Institute, and Oxfordshire Council, will join Oxbotica in the consortium, as well as the Transport Research Laboratory, which is also supporting FiveAI. The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund is the latest government initiative to foster development of some emerging technology innovations, and offer alternate ways for commuters to travel to and from the capital. Speaking alongside the announcement, business and energy secretary Greg Clark said: "As part of our Plan for Britain this government wants to create a modern Industrial Strategy to support the key sectors of our economy and spread jobs, prosperity and opportunity around the whole country." "The funding I am announcing today, providing hundreds of millions of pounds of support to develop the next generation of technologies across a range of sectors, shows our determination and commitment to making sure the UK remains at the very forefront of research and innovation." Picture courtesy of The Gateway Project 19/04/2017: Baidu to open its autonomous driving platform Chinese tech giant Baidu has announced it's to provide an open software platform beginning in July for the automotive and autonomous driving industry to help develop autonomous driving systems. Baidu stated it wants to "build a collaborative ecosystem, utilising its strengths in artificial intelligence (AI) technology to work together with other companies to promote the development and popularisation of autonomous driving technology". The initiative has been named Project Apollo after the US' lunar landing programme, as the company believes autonomous driving has the same potential to change the world as its namesake did. Apollo will include a vehicle platform, hardware platform, software platform and cloud data services. The company is planning to open source obstacle perception code and capabilities, trajectory planning, vehicle control, and vehicle operating systems, as well as testing tools. Baidu President and CEO Qi Lu said: "AI has great potential to drive social development, and one of AI's biggest opportunities is intelligent vehicles." The company is also going to set up  alliances with partners "who will provide the best and most compatible vehicles, sensors, and other components, to achieve broad participation and collaboration and to provide references and recommendations to participants of a rapidly expanding ecosystem enabled by Project Apollo". It hopes that this will make it easier and more efficient to research and develop self driving car technology. Baidu will restrictively open its technology in July and then open it fully towards the end of the year. It also plans to introduce fully autonomous driving capabilities on highways and open city roads by 2020. 05/04/2017: A recent disengagement report from Alphabet's Waymo shows that the company's driverless cars are some of the most reliable in the self-driving industry. According to the report, Waymo's autonomous vehicles drove 635,868 cumulative miles over the past year and had 124 disengagements, which are defined as instances where a human needed to take over driving. This means that these vehicles only experienced roughly one disengagement every 5,128 miles. When compared to the competition, results indicated that Waymo's vehicles are significantly more reliable at this point. While Ford only reported three disengagements over the past year, their autonomous vehicles only traveled 590 cumulative miles - a fraction what Waymo's vehicles have completed. BMW didn't fare much better, reporting one disengagement over 638 miles. Despite Waymo's proven reliability, the self-driving company doesn't stack up to the rest of the competition in terms of overall progress. Navigant Research's leaderboard report on autonomous driving suggests that Waymo is ranked seventh on a list of top 10 vendors. BMW and Ford, whose disengagement reports fared worse results, both top Waymo on the list, with Ford considered the number one vendor. The report rated these self-driving industry players in ten categories: vision, go-to market strategy, partners, production strategy, technology, product capability, product quality and reliability, product portfolio, staying power, and sales, marketing and distribution. While the rankings show that Waymo features the most advanced technology, the report found that the company has no production capacity or production deals. 28/03/2017: Uber's San Francisco-based driverless car trials are back online following a short pause after one of its vehicles crashed in Arizona last week. “We are resuming our development operations in San Francisco this morning,” an Uber spokeswoman told TechCrunch yesterday morning. However, its Arizona and Pittsburgh-based trials will remain grounded until the company can investigate properly what went wrong when another car allegedly ploughed into the automated vehicle, knocking it over. Although Uber's cars can be driven without a driver, they all have manual controls built in too, so a human can take over when required. It would seem there was not enough time for the driver to take over and avoid the accident in Arizona, although it's still under investigation. TechCrunch explained that the cars used in the taxi firm's Californian trials are newer and therefore safer to drive. It's thought the trials in Pittsburgh and Arizona will resume ometime in the future, but Uber hasn't said when it's likely to happen yet. 27/03/2017: One of Uber's driverless vehicles has crashed during testing in the US, the company has confirmed. Pictures and a video of the incident were distributed on Twitter via @FrescoNews, where the source explained the accident happened in Tempe, Arizona, and no one was injured during the crash. "BREAKING: Self-driving Uber vehicle on it’s side after a collision in Tempe, AZ. Photos by @fresconews user Mark Beach," the news site said, followed by: "#UPDATE: No injuries yet reported in an accident involving a self-driving #uber, captured by @fresconews user Mark Beach in Tempe, AZ." Another source, local newspaper ABC15, said a normal passenger-operated car didn't stop for the automated vehicle and hit it. Uber's self-driving SUV fell on its side, witnesses said, and the driver of the manned car was given a talking to by police. There was a human behind the wheel and although initial reports said there was someone in the back of the autonomous car, Uber later said this wasn't the case. “We are continuing to look into this incident and can confirm we had no backseat passengers in the vehicle," Uber confirmed to TechCrunch in a statement. Uber has since paused its driverless cars trial programme in Arizona, but the company hasn't said how long for or whether schemes in other parts of the US have ground to a halt too. This is the second incident an Uber self-driving car has been involved in. The previous crash happened in California last December, when one of its vehicles failed to stop at a red light. 15/03/2017:  Intel has announced a $15.3 billion (£12.5 billion) proposal to acquire Jerusalem-based technology firm Mobileye, developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. The two companies have been collaborating alongside BMW since last year on a project aiming to produce driverless cars by 2021. Mobileye makes software and camera sensors for driverless cars, selling to companies such as General Motors, Nissan, and Hyundai. Intel said the acquisition expands its strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that strengthen the company’s computing and connectivity capabilities.  According to Intel, the driverless technology market could be worth up to $70 billion by 2030, and the acquisition of Mobileye gives it a major boost in the autonomous driving race. “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” said Mobileye CEO, President and Co-Founder, Ziv Aviram. He explained that by merging the infrastructure and resources of the two companies, their combined knowledge in areas like virtual driving, simulators, and hardware can be enhanced. “Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry,” Aviram added. The acquisition is not only a step-up for Intel, but it’s also groundbreaking for the Israeli tech industry. The deal marks the largest-ever purchase of high-tech Israeli technology, significantly surpassing the previous record-holding deal of $4.7 billion paid by Lucent Technologies for Chromatis Networks in 2000. 14/03/2017: California's Department of Motor Vehicles has revealed it is looking at allowing driverless car manufacturers to test their vehicles without a human driver in the front seat. "Since the adoption of the current testing regulations, the capabilities of autonomous technology has proceeded to the point where manufacturers have developed systems that re capable of operating without the presence of a driver inside the vehicle," the proposal explained. "The department is amending Article 3.7 to include the testing of vehicles that do not require the presence of a driver inside the vehicle and ensure the testing of such vehicles is conducted on California public roads in a safe manner." Companies wanting to trial their cars without a driver inside must apply for a new type of licence -  Manufacturer's Testing Permit -Driverless Vehicles. The governmental organisation said it has changed its view towards autonomous vehicles to promote the development of autonomous technology that will lead to safer driving practices, it explained. "These rules expand our existing autonomous vehicle testing programme to include testing vehicles where no driver is present," said Jean Shiomoto, director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles. "This is the next step in eventually allowing driverless autonomous vehicles on California roadways." The department has invited the public to out forward their arguments for and against allowing such vehicles to be tested on the road, minus a driver. Written comments can be submitted until 24 April. 03/03/2017: After being driven out of San Francisco for failing to secure a testing permit, Uber has announced it will now cooperate with California regulators as it seeks to restart its driverless car trials in the state. California's Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed to Reuters that it had held discussions with Uber to assist the application process for a self-driving permit, something that Uber originally claimed was unnecessary. Uber launched its self-driving pilot programme in San Francisco last December without state permission, arguing that because its cars were not fully autonomous and required "active physical control or monitoring", they did not meet state requirements for the $150 permit. The state DMV, however, disagreed, arguing that not only did Uber fail to seek the correct permits, but also failed to properly mark their fleet as test vehicles. It also pointed to the number of other companies operating self-driving cars in the state, including Google, Tesla and Ford, who had all correctly secured testing permits. As a result, the DMV revoked the registrations of 16 Uber vehicles, only one week into the trial, with the threat of further legal action if they continued to test. Uber has since relocated those test vehicles to Arizona, where the company has received a warm welcome from Republican state governor Doug Ducey, but has reapplied for permission to test vehicles in California. An Uber spokesperson said in a statement to IT Pro: "These cars are legally registered and are being driven manually. We are taking steps to complete our application to apply for a DMV testing permit. As we said in December, Uber remains 100% committed to California." It comes just says after the firm's CEO, Travis Kalanick, said he needed to "grow up" and seek leadership advice. 24/02/2017: Alphabet's Waymo — Google's self-driving car project — has sued Uber, accusing it of stealing 14,000 files to copy its sensing tech. Waymo said Uber and the autonomous trucking firm Otto, which Uber bought last year, had stolen plans for Waymo's Lidar, a laser based sensing technology. The complaint filed in California said: "Uber's Lidar technology is actually Waymo's Lidar technology." Lidar bounces light off objects to "see" where they are — it's not a new technology, but Waymo's version is reportedly a tenth of the price of existing systems, according to Reuters. "Hundreds of Waymo engineers have spent thousands of hours, and our company has invested millions of dollars to design a highly specialised and unique Lidar system," the company said in a post on Medium. "Waymo engineers have driven down the cost of Lidar dramatically even as we’ve improved the quality and reliability of its performance. The configuration and specifications of our Lidar sensors are unique to Waymo. Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company." Waymo said building the technology has taken seven years, while Uber's Otto appears to have done the same over nine months. The accusations centre on Anthony Levandowski, the founder of self-driving truck firm Otto, which hit the roads last year by shipping a lorry-load of Budweiser beer. In August, Uber bought the company. Before founding Otto, Levandowski worked on Google's self-driving project, now dubbed Waymo. It alleges that he downloaded 14,000 files before he resigned in January 2016 — including Lidar designs. "To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Mr. Levandowski searched for and installed specialised software onto his company-issued laptop," the Waymo blog post alleges. "Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation. Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr. Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints." Waymo said it spotted the knockoff design via an email slip-up. "Recently, we received an unexpected email," the company said. "One of our suppliers specialising in Lidar components sent us an attachment (apparently inadvertently) of machine drawings of what was purported to be Uber’s Lidar circuit board  —  except its design bore a striking resemblance to Waymo’s unique Lidar design." Uber said it took the allegations "seriously" and would "review this matter carefully". Waymo is seeking unspecified damages, but asked for Uber to be banned from using the Lidar information. "Competition in the self-driving space is a good thing; it pushes everyone to develop better, safer and more affordable technology," Waymo said in the blog post. "But we believe that competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions." It's not the first legal battle in the self-driving arena: in January, Tesla sued a former director of its Autopilot automation project for poaching its staff. 22/02/2017: Just over two months to the day after being kicked out of San Francisco, Uber has begun trials of its self-driving fleet in Arizona, this time with the permission of the state's authorities.  Self-driving Ubers are hitting the road in the Grand Canyon State. pic.twitter.com/tOgiw4GD1d — Uber (@Uber) February 21, 2017 Arizona Republican governor Doug Ducey is expected to be 'Rider Zero' on the latest trial for the autonomous ride-hailing service, which is available to residents of Tempe starting today Uber's previous test of 16 self-driving cars in California in December was met with opposition from the Department of Motor Vehicles, which claimed the company failed to apply for the correct test permits. Uber always maintained that because a human was always behind the wheel, the cars did not fit the criteria for the $150 permit. It appears, however, that Arizona has taken an entirely different approach to the testing of autonomous vehicles. In August 2015, Ducey signed an executive order in support of the development of self-driving technology, urging authorities to "undertake any necessary steps to support the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles" on roads within Arizona. AZ Gov @dougducey taking a ride in @Uber_AZ's new self driving car. Pretty slick looking machine! pic.twitter.com/1zFoDNYUKV — Ty Brennan (@TyFox10) February 21, 2017 Customers in Tempe are now able to hail a self-driving Volvo XC90 SUV on the Uber service, which will be overseen by two Uber engineers in the front seats, in case a situation arises that requires human intervention. This signifies a much needed win for Uber given a series of bad press reports over the past few months. Aside from the controversy in California, the technology is far from perfect and has been caught running red lights, as well as narrowly avoiding a collision in San Francisco. The company itself has come under fire this week, with claims of rampant sexism from a former Uber engineer. Uber has said it plans to expand testing to other cities in Arizona within the next few weeks. 17/02/2017: Google patents car that 'prevents harm' in accidents Google has patented a technology that could prevent injuries in the event of an accident. The company has filed a patent with the US patent office for "adjusting a shear pin to minimize an impact force felt by an object in a collision with a vehicle". This means its self-driving cars' computers could analyse the amount of force needed to prevent injury or damage to the person, animal or object it's about the crash into. “Computing devices within a vehicle may determine that an impact with an object cannot be avoided by way of braking, steering, and/or accelerating the vehicle,” the patent explained. “When this is the case, the computing devices may work to adjust the amount of force necessary to break one or more shear pins which are holding a panel of the vehicle in place. The force of impact on the object which the vehicle collides may be reduced, thereby limiting the severity of injuries and/or damage to the object.” The computer device inside an autonomous car would receive data that it is about to collide with an object and the shear pin, which determines what will happen to a vehicle when it is subjected to pressure, would move into a position that would cause it to break, meaning the car's panels would slide back and absorb the impact. “The characteristics of the object with which impact is imminent may be used to determine to adjust the amount of shear force necessary to break the one or more shear pins, in an effort to minimize the impact force felt by the object,” the patent said. “The size of an object may be used to estimate its mass. This in turn may be used to determine the appropriate amount of shear force for the shear pins.” Google's automated car company, Waymo, hasn't revealed whether the technology will be integrated into its cars or if it will license the technology to other automated car makers. 16/02/2017: Microsoft India has just announced a partnership deal with India's Tata Motors, collaborating on technologies designed to make driving a more personalised experience. The new partnership will focus around AI, IoT and machine learning technologies, and will provide Tata vehicles with advanced telematics, remote monitoring and sophisticated navigation technologies. The first vehicle produced as part of the new agreement will be shown off at the Geneva International Motor Show on 7 March. The company wants to create "a highly personalised, smart and safer driving experience across the digital life of a vehicle owner", according to Tata Motors managing director, Guenter Butschek. "In the first phase, the advanced offerings will incorporate technologies such as cloud computing, analytics, geo-spatial and mapping and increased human-machine interface, creating a new benchmark in the industry for connected vehicles," he said. "Using the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, we will provide the vehicle owners here as well as across the world a safe, productive and fun-driving experience," said Microsoft India's president, Anant Maheshwari, adding that Microsoft expects 90% of cars to be completely connected within three years. 13/02/2017: Ford is to invest $1 billion dollars into an AI startup over the next five years, comprised of ex-Google and Uber engineers who have worked on autonomous car projects. Argo AI will be led by CEO Bryan Salesky, formerly of Google, and Uber's Peter Rander as company COO, both of whom were leaders of their companies' self-driving car teams. The organisation, based at Ford's Pittsburgh headquarters, is expected to have more than 200 members by the end of the year. This represents the latest push by a car manufacturer into autonomous technology, which has become a highly competitive market over the past few years. Audi, Nissan, Tesla, and even companies traditionally not associated with vehicles, such as graphics processing firm Nvidia, are working on their own technology. "The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," said Ford CEO Mark Fields. "We believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term, and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future." The deal will see Ford focus on its development of vehicle hardware, including the exterior and interior design of autonomous cars, and the integration of new systems. Argo AI will latch onto Ford's current software development teams and help the company scale up its production. If all goes to plan, Ford intends to have a fully autonomous, level 4-capable vehicle for the commercial market by 2021. This, according to the Society of Automated Engineers (SAE), is one rank behind "fully autonomous", in which the AI is able to fully control every aspect of the driving and does not rely on the input of a human driver. "We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move," said Salesky, Argo AI's CEO. "We believe this partnership will enable self-driving cars to be commercialised and deployed at scale to extend affordable mobility to all." Although Argo AI will initially focus on supporting the production of Ford vehicles, the company has stated that future plans could include the licensing out of its technology to other firms wishing to move into the autonomous sector.

The Department for Transport is set to unveil plans for the two-in-one policy as it attempts to reduce the legal hurdles preventing self-driving cars from hitting the road in the UK. Who would ultimately be responsible for the cause of a driverless accident has been the cause of significant debate for legal bodies across the world. The latest plans will introduce policies that cover drivers while they are at the wheel, and then allows responsibility to be handed over to AI while in driverless mode. Claims made against accidents involving AI will be covered by the insurance company who will recuperate losses from the party responsible, which may include the car manufacturer. The government hopes this will make it easier for victims of crashes involving driverless vehicles to access compensation. "Automated vehicles have the potential to transform our roads in the future and make them even safer and easier to use, as well as promising new mobility for those who cannot drive," said transport secretary Chris Grayling, in a statement to the Telegraph. "But we must ensure the public is protected in the event of an incident and this week we are introducing the framework to allow insurance for these new technologies." Accidents involving driverless cars have raised questions as to who exactly is to blame for a crash. In June last year a driver was killed when his Tesla Model S collided with a tractor trailer after failing to break. But the government is keen to encourage the growth of the driverless car industry in the UK, an industry analysts predict will be worth almost $42 billion globally by 2025. Ian Crowder, head of public relations at AA, argued that although improving policies will make insurance claims more streamlined, there is no way to predict how other human drivers will respond to an increase in driverless vehicles.  "In the longer term the number of claims should dramatically fall," said Crowder. "However there are concerns relating to the behaviour of drivers of human-driven cars mixing with autonomous vehicles, which could lead to an increase in collisions." "For example, frustration at autonomous vehicles sticking to the speed limit; human drivers attempting to fit into smaller spaces between autonomous vehicles etc... which could lead to an increased number of collisions so that could lead in turn, to an increase in premiums overall," added Crowder. Japanese car manufacturer Nissan is expected to go ahead with its plans to test driverless cars on the streets of London later this month, following successful preliminary tests in Milton Keynes last year. 01/02/2017: A deal with automaker Mercedes-Benz will see its range of vehicles join Uber's ever-expanding fleet of self-driving cars. The partnership will see Germany's Daimler join forces with the popular ride-hailing service to introduce and operate its own self-driving cars on Uber's network. "Auto manufacturers like Daimler are crucial to our strategy because Uber has no experience making cars," said Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick. "This became very clear to me after I visited an auto manufacturing plant and saw how much effort goes into designing, testing and building cars." "That's why instead of building them ourselves, we want to partner with the best auto manufacturers in the world," he added. "We can combine Uber's global ridesharing network with the world-class vehicles of companies like Daimler, so that Uber riders can have a great experience getting around their cities." Uber has so far declined to offer the financial details of the new deal, however Daimler represents the first company to take advantage of Uber's new policy allowing third-party manufacturers to add their own self-driving cars. As a result of a $300 million deal with automaker Volvo, vehicles have already been piloted in Pennsylvania and Arizona using self-driving kits developed by Uber. However unlike previous deals, Uber will not own or manage the new fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, or be responsible for the research and development of the AI led software. Instead, Uber has simply added the Daimler manufactured cars to its self-driving vehicle range. 20/01/2017: Tesla semi-autonomous cars won't be recalled in US Tesla semiautonomous cars won't be recalled in the US, despite the technology inside one of its cars resulting in the death of a customer. Joshua Brown was killed when the Tesla he was driving collided with a lorry in May 2016. However, Tesla had claimed this wasn't because of its Autopilot technology failing, but rather user error, because although the autonomous system can be used as an assistance to the driver, drivers should never take their hands off the wheel. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which conducted an investigation into the crash, said data from the car's onboard tracking system revealed Brown had not made any attempt to brake, steer or do anything else to avoid the collision. He would have seen he was going to hit the lorry for seven seconds, which was enough for him to take action and override the Autopilot system, but he decided not to. "These systems require continual and full attention of the driver," Bryan Thomas from the NHSTA said. "It's not enough to put [information] in the owner's manual and hope drivers are going to read that. "Manufacturers must anticipate how drivers would use the functionality, and that some don't read the manual." The NHTSA said it would not take any action against Tesla, and found no faults with the vehicle, but would be monitoring the situation carefully to ensure it does not pose a risk to drivers. 04/01/2017: Oxford driverless car firm releases camera mapping Oxford self-driving car company Oxbotica has announced that the localisation and mapping software used in its prototype vehicles is now ready for general release. Comprising one part of the company's Selenium OS for autonomous cars, the firm has used its Dub4 software tool in the GATEway pods operating in Greenwich and in the company's own prototype vehicles, which were demonstrated in Milton Keynes last year. Oxbotica is competing in the same space as Google and Uber, but what sets it apart from other projects is that rather than the expensive laser and GPS systems seen in other cars, Oxbotica's mapping system can rely purely on vehicle-mounted cameras. "The software uses a single stereo camera mounted onto the car to determine its precise position and orientation in the world," the company explained in a statement. "With this localisation information, the software is then able to create and navigate using vision-based maps in highly unstructured environments without any reliance on GPS or expensive laser-based techniques." By negating the need for costly LIDAR systems, Dub4 has the potential to make self-driving technology much cheaper to produce, while Oxbotica claims it doesn't require specialised equipment to run; it can be installed and operated on off-the-shelf commodity PC hardware. "We're excited to be working on deployment of our class-leading Dub4 software solution, as part of our mission to achieve Level 4 autonomy by 2020," said Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith. "What we've done with Dub4 has never been done before and it represents a seismic shift for the self-driving vehicle industry, enabling a move away from GPS and 3D laser-based approaches. We're paving the way for more affordable and accurate solutions in the industry." How do self-driving cars work? Self-driving cars use a battery of sensors to detect their surroundings, including radar, lasers and camera arrays. The vehicle's onboard computer then uses specialised software to react to this input in real-time, adjusting the car's steering and acceleration to suit the situation. While some vehicles, such as the Google prototypes which have popularised the idea, are totally autonomous, other cars only automate certain aspects of driving. Tesla's Autopilot feature, for example, features adaptive cruise control, which maintains a safe speed and distance from other vehicles when driving on the motorway. It also features basic automated steering to ensure you don't accidentally drift into the wrong lane, and although it can perform basic steering maneuvers automatically, it is not intended to replace a human driver altogether. Are self-driving cars safe? There is still much debate over whether or not fully autonomous cars should be made widely available. Some say that their safety record is impeccable, while others argue that automobiles are simply too dangerous to be operated by an algorithm. This debate has been reignited by a number of high-profile Tesla crashes, one of which has been blamed on an Autopilot malfunction. The incidents have raised questions over whether or not self-driving technology is ready for implementation. On the other hand, Google has emphasised how safe its fleet of self-driving cars are. As part of the testing programme for its autonomous vehicles, the company has posted regular safety logs detailing any crashes the vehicles are involved in, with the vast majority being caused by human drivers in other cars. Experts remain divided, however, and if self-driving cars are ever likely to be widely commercially available, they will doubtless be heavily regulated, monitored and tested. When will self-driving cars hit the road? In many cases, they already have. Some high-end luxury vehicles already feature 'assisted driving' elements that are close to fully autonomous driving, with Tesla being the obvious example. Elsewhere, testing of various driverless car projects is underway in the US, with California, Texas, Seattle and more all hosting autonomous vehicle test runs. The UK government has also given the green light for similar trials in Britain, so UK commuters may soon be sharing the roads with autonomous shuttles. As for when driverless cars will become commercially available, however, that is yet to be seen. As the technology is young and comparatively untested, it is likely that substantial tests will have to be conducted in partnership with government and regulatory bodies before the vehicles are available for public purchase. There is also a question as to whether or not the average driver will be able to purchase one at all. Even if fully autonomous cars are allowed to be sold, the price of each vehicle is likely to be prohibitively expensive due to the large amount of sophisticated technology that goes into them. As such, it's likely to be at least a few years before autonomous cars are approved for general road use, and most likely another few years after that before they become a commonplace sight. Are driverless cars legal? As no fully autonomous cars have yet made it to the mass-production phase, no legislation currently exists to govern their public use. However, transport authorities both in the UK and in the US are currently in the process of drawing up new laws or amending old ones to account for driverless vehicles. In the UK, for example, companies need no permits or authorisation to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. "Real-world testing of automated technologies is possible in the UK today," the government's Pathway to Driverless Cars report reads, "providing a test driver is present and takes responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle; and that the vehicle can be used compatibly with road traffic law." The UK also plans to amend the Highway Code to allow vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems to change lanes on the motorway and be parked via remote control. Changes to car insurance would extend it to cover product liabilities for automated vehicles. Insurers would pay out to victims, then reclaim the money from the manufacturers. The US has also granted testing permits for driverless cars in four states, as well as publishing a 15-point safety checklist for manufacturers of autonomous vehicles in order to better regulate the emerging industry. Published by the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency, the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy also marks the agency's move to the SAE scale, which measures a vehicle's level of autonomy. The scale runs from zero, where the driver has total control of the vehicles, all the way to five - a totally autonomous car requiring no human input. Vehicles that measure two or three on the SAE scale - such as the Tesla and other semi-autonomous vehicles - are already road-legal both here and in the US, as the human driver is considered to be in control for the majority of the time. While many countries have committed to fostering a supportive environment for the development of autonomous cars, concrete legislation governing their use is still likely to be some years away, as the technology itself has not yet been fully finished. Who manufactures self-driving cars? The most well-known companies exploring self-driving cars are Google and Tesla, but there are very few companies connected to the automotive industry that aren't exploring the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber, for example, is currently testing its own fleet of autonomous taxis in Pittsburgh. Apple has also long been rumoured to be exploring the self-driving car field in some form, and has been linked to multiple different auto manufacturers, including McLaren. In addition to tech companies, however, regular car makers are also getting in on the act. Audi, Ford, BWM, Honda, Daimler, Volvo and more have all been dabbling in some form of autonomous driving project. Luxury passenger vehicles have also been experimenting with using the tech in industrial vehicles such as heavy goods lorries.

The report shows that IT procurement specialists in the U.S. and UK are under pressure due to the rapid pace of change and employer demands for new technologies. As a result, many are still focused on cost control, with nearly two-thirds saying their role is evaluated on returns on IT investment, compared with 49 percent citing satisfaction among business users. However, the survey identifies some progressive procurement experts who focus on supporting business value. These more often report to the IT department than the finance department and are evaluated on "the quality of technology they provide". The report suggests that IT procurement execs build an understanding of both business and technology trends and establish "a collaborative approach" with other departments within their organization. Intel's promotions Intel has announced three internal executive promotions. The new GM of Intel's Data Center Group (DCG), Navin Shenoy, has been promoted from SVP to EVP.

Gregory Bryant was promoted from corporate VP to SVP. He is GM of Intel's "largest and most profitable business", the Client Computing Group, which includes PCs, home gateways and other compute devices. GM of Intel's network platforms group, Sandra Rivera, was promoted from corporate VP to SVP. She manages the P&L and strategy and product development for solution and service providers and heads up the vendor's 5G strategy. Salesforce's channel app Salesforce has unveiled a new app designed to simplify the building of portals for its customers' channel partners. The CRM software giant says the new Sales Cloud Partner Relationship Management (PRM) app enables partners, distributors and resellers to build branded portals "with clicks, not code". Describing traditional partner portals as "inflexible, archaic systems creating disconnected silos", Salesforce says Sales Cloud will unite partner and direct sales functions. The PRM allows customers to configure, customize and deploy features, like lead distribution, deal registration and marketing development funds. In addition, it can assign partners into tiers and provide targeted promotions and customized content, among other features. Sales Cloud PRM is currently available with the Partner Community Cloud License for $25 per member, per month. In addition, Salesforce has lifted the lid on a new $50 million SI (system integrator) Trailblazer Fundand a new SI Trailblazer Alliance, which are both said to be designed to help cloud consulting firms grow business. The fund will provide companies with the capital to deploy the full Salesforce portfolio to customers, while the Alliance offers companies access to a range of partner-focused concierge resources, training and tools.

But it turns out AMD’s high-end chip will one-up Intel’s in another way. The Core i9 Extreme Edition has 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes. The Ryzen Threadripper chip has 64. We’ll probably need to wait a little while to know which chip offers better all-around performance, but the additional PCIe 3.0 lanes gives you more options for connecting high-performance graphics cards, storage solutions, or other peripherals.   AMD is also hinting that there won’t just be a single Threadripper chip. Instead, there will be multiple options, including models with “up to” 16 cores and 32 threads. But every version will have the same 64 PCIe 3.0 lanes, 4-channel DDR4 memory support, and X399 chipset. AMD says ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI all plan to launch Threadripper-compatible motherboards this summer. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

AMD is trying to muscle in on one of the few attractive parts of the PC market with new products the company began offering in the first quarter. Intel estimates that video game enthusiasts and others who are willing to pay for the best computer performance represent a market that will grow as much as 20% a year. That’s amid a total PC market that has shed more than 100 million units since it peaked in 2011, declining each year since then. Underlining just how profitable the high-end processor market can be, the top of Intel’s new range -- called the i9-7980XE -- will go on sale for $1,999 per chip. That’s more than most people will pay for their entire computer. Intel has maintained more than 80% market share and higher average selling prices in PC chips by consistently providing processors that outperform rival offerings. Its strength forced out competitors leaving only AMD, a company that hasn’t turned a profit in five years. But there are those who are still trying to crack Intel’s stronghold. ARM Holdings Plc., announced recently a new design of chips that targets the PC and server markets dominated by Intel. Apple is said to be working on a processor devoted specifically to artificial intelligence-related tasks such as facial recognition and speech recognition. -- Bloomberg E-mail | Print |     From / email :     To :     E-mail (required) :     Message :     Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.    MORE STORIES Intel tries to squash rival AMD with new high-end PC chips Review: "Lenovo Yoga Book" Robots star of Taiwan tech fair Father of Android Andy Rubin unveils bezel-less Essential PH-1 smartphone Microsoft unveils new Surface Pro to reverse declining sales Review: "Review: Samsung Galaxy S8+" Google AI beats master in ancient game of Go Market for pet wearables growing in China Vivo V5s: a slight improvement from Vivo's best-selling flagship model Apple plans laptop upgrades as Microsoft enters market    MOST READ    MOST E-MAILED 1.

The current standard Z270 motherboard chipset is a "consumer" product, and the new X-series processors have a different pin layout, and are designed for a slightly more demanding customer with deeper pockets. The X299 isn't a huge upgrade over the Z270, but it's a major leap past the X99 boards, which hosted the last generation of Intel's most extreme chips. X299 chipsets support up to 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, compared to the paltry eight PCIe 2.0 lanes on X99. Paired with the new processors, you're looking at an embarrassment of I/O — you can load a system up with multi-gigabit Ethernet, a few GPUs, and a couple of M.2 SSDs, and still have headroom to spare for your USB 3.1 daisy chain, Thunderbolt, and a handful of SATA devices. Unfortunately, the fact that Intel is giving two fairly different CPUs (Skylake and Kaby Lake) the X-series treatment means not all X299 motherboards will be created equally. Depending on which CPU you pick, you'll have different amounts of I/O support, and different compatible RAM configurations. That means, depending on your chosen pairing, you can conceivably buy a motherboard with a lot of "features" that you can't make use of, or a CPU that's held back by the motherboard's limits. It sounds as if the whole reason Intel is even offering the lower-end Skylake chips is to let people get a fancy new X299 motherboard now, and upgrade the CPU when budget allows. But if that's the case, anyone with a competent Z270 system on their desk right now won't probably have much of a reason to sidegrade. As Anandtech writes: "This is arguably a big mess." Anyway, let's look at these motherboards! Image: Gigabyte Gigabyte's Auros Gaming series motherboards highlight something most of these systems have in common: some sort of M.2 cooling or monitoring to make sure your fastest SSD drives don't throttle down due to heat concerns. All three models in the series support up to three M.2 drives, which is a nice upgrade over the one or two slots you can expect on most Z270 boards. Because this series is all about gaming, Gigabyte also packed in a bunch of RGB fluff. Image: Asus Asus has an absurd seven different X299 motherboards right out of the gate. The top-end ROG Rampage VI supports four-way SLI, has a 10Gb Ethernet chipset, and 802.11ad Wi-Fi. There's also a little OLED display for peeking your stats. Image: MSI MSI's Gaming M7 ACK has dual Killer E2500 Ethernet controllers and Killer 1535 Wi-Fi which can all be combined into a single connection. EVGA has an overclocking-focused board called the X299 Dark, which supports four-way SLI and also includes dedicated M.2 cooling. There's also triple BIOS support, which is amazing. EVGA also has a micro-ATX form factor board which supports two-way SLI. ASRock managed to make a mini-ITX form factor X299 board, which still includes four memory slots and three M.2 slots, but cuts the GPU opportunities down to one. ASRock's Gaming i9 board meanwhile has 10Gb Ethernet built in. I'm going to wait for some reviews (or at least price tags) to start rolling in before I try and choose a candidate for an X299 build. To be honest, most of the specs are probably overkill for my purposes — and I still haven't put together a Ryzen system! But it's exciting to see this much power and expandability available out of the gate for these long-awaited CPUs.

The Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 packs about everything that that is possible, including advanced VRMs, multiple PCIe slots, a Wi-Fi module, as well as a 10 GbE port. Despite being extremely feature-rich, the new product is not going to be too expensive. Since Intel’s new X299 platform supports a very diverse range of processors that cost from sub-$300 all the way to $1999, makers of motherboards are trying to address different setups with their products accordingly. Some X299 platforms can be considered as “entry-level” (of the ultra high-end) based on their moderate feature set, others may be considered as mid-range and the most advanced models fit into the “extreme” or “workstation-grade” category for prosumers who need every bit of performance they may get. The ASRock Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 belongs to the latter category and is thus aimed at systems without compromises that run processors with 10 or more cores, feature multiple graphics cards, up to a dozen of storage devices, and so on. One of the important features of the ASRock Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 is its 13-phase digital VRM that uses high endurance coils as well as solid-state capacitors and designed to ensure high overclocking potential. ASRock claims that this PWM can handle 720 A and deliver up to 1300 W of power, which is well above any CPU can consume (or survive). The motherboard carries eight DDR4 DIMM slots and the manufacturer supports memory overclocking up to DDR-4400 and beyond. Previous-gen Intel Core Extreme (Broadwell-E) processors could not run DDR4 at extreme data transfer rates in quad-channel mode and it isn't clear whether the new multi-core Skylake-X will handle DDR4 at 4000+ GT/s in quad-channel mode. However since the X299 platform also supports quad-core Kaby Lake-X CPUs with a dual-channel memory controller that can handle high memory frequencies, support for high DDR4 frequencies may prove especially important for Kaby Lake-X. Another key selling point of the ASRock Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 is the the Aquantia AQtion 10 Gb/s Ethernet controller (presumably the AQN-107) that also supports 2.5G and 5G operation. Installing this specific controller on a motherboard that is priced significantly below $500 makes a great deal of sense, as 10 GbE infrastructure (routers, switches) is still very expensive for most users (even those who buy Intel Core X-series CPUs), whereas 2.5G and 5G equipment promises to be a lot cheaper. Whether or not the owner of the X299 Professional Gaming i9 plans to invest in 10 GbE hardware, they will be ready for everything faster than GbE, and that adds value to the motherboard. In addition to the 10 GbE port, the mainboard also has two GbE headers enabled by controllers from Intel. For scenarios when wired connections are unavailable, the motherboard has a 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.2 module (based on an Intel controller). Next up is expandability. The Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 has four PCIe 3.0 x16 slots (2 × x16, 2 × x8): three can be used for graphics cards running in AMD CrossFireX or NVIDIA SLI multi-GPU mode, the fourth can be used for an SSD or any other device. Besides, the board has 10 SATA 6 Gbps connectors for systems that need a huge number of SATA storage devices. ASRock's Fatal1ty X299 for Intel Core X-Series   Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 CPU Support Intel Core i9 Intel Core i7 Intel Core i5 CPUs in LGA2066 form-factor Graphics 4 × PCIe 3.0 x16 (2 × x16, 2 × x8) 3-way AMD CrossFireX and NVIDIA SLI supported Chipset Intel X299 Memory Eight DDR4 DIMM slots Ethernet 1 × Aquantia AQtion AQN-107 10 GbE 2 × Intel GbE controllers Storage 10 × SATA 6 Gbps 3 × M.2 (PCIe 3.0 x4 or SATA) Audio Realtek ALC1220 7.1 channel audio USB 8 × USB 3.0 Type-A 6 × USB 3.0 Type-A 1 × USB 3.1 (Gen 2) Type-A 1 × USB 3.1 (Gen 2) Type-C 1 × USB 3.1 internal header ASMedia ASM3142 controller for USB 3.1 Other I/O Dual band 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.2 Form-Factor ATX MSRP $350 When it comes to connectivity, the Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 has something to brag about even beyond its vast networking capabilities. The motherboard uses ASMedia’s latest ASM3142 controller that is backed by a PCIe 3.0 x2 connect (instead of x1 in case of the ASM1142) and thus offers higher bandwidth than its predecessor. In total, the board supports eight USB 3.0 Type-A ports, six USB 2.0 connectors, two USB 3.1 (Gen 2) receptacles (Type-A, Type-C) as well as one USB 3.1 (Gen 2) header for a USB-C port on the front of the PC that can deliver 36 W of power. Finally, the platform has a 7.1-channel audio sub-system (enabled by the Realtek ALC1220 controller) with the Sound Blaster Cinema 3 software enhancements by Creative. The ASRock Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 will be available in the coming months for about $350. For those, who don’t need a 10G Ethernet port, 36 W power delivery on the front USB-C port and some other minor things, ASRock will offer the X299 Taichi motherboard that uses the same PCB, but without the aforementioned features, at around $300.

The Surface Pro looks like a 12-inch tablet, but it’s more than just another tablet. The hardware inside lets users install touch-friendly apps from Microsoft’s Windows Store and programs from the internet. The keyboards and built-in kickstands let buyers use them as laptops when they need to get work done. The Surface Pro 4 and Surface Pro 3 account for most Surface sales, according to Microsoft. Together with the Surface Laptop, Surface Studio and Surface Book, the new Surface Pro finally gives Microsoft an up-to-date line-up for every kind of Windows user. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2017 Surface Pro release, including its new features and updated accessories. 2017 Surface Pro Features The 2017 Surface Pro is more than a processor upgrade and less than a complete redesign. It’s still a tablet with the internals of a laptop. The device’s magnesium body is one-third of an inch thick, making it just as thin as the Surface Pro 4. The 2736 x 1824 12.3-inch display isn’t any sharper or brighter than the Surface Pro 4’s. Most of the upgrades are for Surface Pen lovers. The 2017 Surface Pro has a display technology that can sense when users are tilting the new $99 Surface Pen while drawing or taking notes. It’s now capable of sensing 4,096 different levels of pressure from the accessory, too. Microsoft plans to deliver updated Office programs that include these new pen features. Kickstand upgrades let the 2017 Surface Pro achieve a 165-degree angle. Microsoft says that this new angle boosts comfort for users who draw and take notes. This new Windows 2-in-1 isn’t any thinner or lighter than its predecessor, but it is a better tablet and laptop. Using 7th Generation Intel Core processors and new cooling techniques allowed Microsoft to get rid of the fans on the Intel Core m3 and Intel Core i5 models. Nothing is more distracting than the hum the fans in older Surface devices make when you are watching a movie, reading a book or listening to music. The 2017 Surface Pro lasts for 13.5 hours of video playback, which is far more than the 9 hours the Surface Pro 4 is capable of. Loud 1.6-watt Dolby Premium Audio speakers let the tablet fill a room with sound while keeping down distortion. The 2017 Surface Pro will have LTE mobile data. That’s the same technology that lets iPads connect to the internet when there’s no Wi-Fi. The iPad and iPad Pro have had LTE for years, but Microsoft has never included it in a Surface Pro. Read: iPad Pro Review: Why I Returned the 2017 iPad 2017 Surface Pro Release Date & Pre-Orders The 2017 Surface Pro release date is June 15th. Past Surface Pro launches have happened in stages, but this launch is different. The 2017 Surface Pro will come to 26 countries on release day. Both Best Buy and the Microsoft Store have 2017 Surface Pro pre-orders available. More stores and websites than these two should offer pre-orders as we get closer to launch. 2017 Surface Pro Specs & Price Excluding the RAM, processor and storage, every 2017 Surface Pro has the same features. Each of them gets the 13.5 hours of video playback that Microsoft promises. They all have a 5-megapixel front-facing camera that lets users sign in with Windows Hello and a rear-facing 8-megapixel camera that supports autofocus. A microSDXC card reader, Surface Connect charging, headphone jack, Mini DisplayPort and a place to connect a Surface Type Cover come in each. The new Surface Pro starts at $799. This model has an Intel Core m3 processor, 128GB of solid-state storage and 4GB of RAM. It uses Intel HD Graphics 615, which can’t power demanding games, but handles photo editing just fine. The $799 2017 Surface Pro lacks a fan because the Core m3 processor doesn’t need one. The Intel Core i5 model has 128GB of solid state storage, 4GB of RAM and no fan for the processor. Intel HD Graphics 620 are inside, which slightly boosts its performance for really basic games. This model costs $999. There is just a single upgrade option for the new Surface with Core i5 processor. Shoppers can replace the model’s 128GB of storage with 256GB of storage and double its RAM to 8GB. These upgrades cost $1,299. The $1,599 model with Intel Core i7 has Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 for better performance in games, video editing and 3D modeling. This 2017 Surface Pro’s processor has a fan to expel heat. Two upgrades for the model with Intel Core i7 processor are available.  The $2,199 model adds 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM. Shoppers can boost the Core i7 model’s storage to 1TB and add 16GB of RAM for a total cost of $2,699. 2017 Surface Pro Accessories & Accessory Compatibility The 2017 Surface Pro works with all existing Surface accessories. The Type Covers from Surface Pro 4 and Surface Pro 3 dock to its connector just fine. It works with the older Surface Pen, but without the additional levels of pressure and tilt sensitivity for drawing. Docking though the Surface Connect port still works. The 2017 Surface Pro doesn’t come with a Surface Dial. That’s the $99 accessory that lets Surface users change settings in apps and programs. Buyers can place the Surface Dial on the 2017 Surface Pro’s screen to get options tailored to their apps. New 2017 Surface Pro accessories are coming. Unfortunately, Microsoft has stopped including the Surface Pen with the Surface Pro. The new Surface Pen costs $99 and comes in black, silver, burgundy and cobalt. It no longer has a clip for securing it to a shirt pocket or the cover. Instead, its magnets let it snap to the left side of the 2017 Surface Pro. Another generation of Surface Type Covers is on the way. These 2017 covers come in silver, burgundy and cobalt and are covered in Alcantara fabric. Microsoft says that Alcantara is softer than the fabric on the Surface Pro 4 covers. Each of these covers costs $159.99. 2017 Surface Pro Deals Best Buy has two 2017 Surface Pro deals. Shoppers that pre-order there can get $100 off their new device. The savings requires a College Student Deals membership, which is free but restricted to students. Best Buy will set up the Windows 2-in-1 and transfer any information that you have on your PC for free. 5 Best Surface Pro 4 Alternatives in 2017 Huawei MateBook - $399   1 / 5 The Huawei MateBook has an attractive price and two configurations for shoppers to pick from. This machine offers 4GB of RAM and an Intel Core m3 processor for just $399. More expensive configurations add an Intel Core m5 processor, up to 8GB of RAM and 512GB of solid state storage. Buyers eager for a Windows 2-in-1 without lots of extra ports and distractions may like this device. Its metal frame has just a USB Type-C port, a headset jack and a connection for its add-on keyboard. The front is dominated by a 12-inch 2160 x 11440 display, putting what you're working on or watching at the forefront of your experience. Read: Huawei MateBook Review: If iPad and Surface Mated You’ll need to factor in the cost of the digital pen and the keyboard because neither of these comes with the Huawei MateBook. They, like the tablet itself, are cheaper than what Surface offers. The MatePen is just $49 from the Microsoft Store. The keyboard, which has a kickstand for propping the device up and backlit keys, costs $99. A Surface Type Cover costs $129.99. The Surface Pen sells for $59.99.

Intel is looking to transform how new features are delivered to connected devices with its new Compute Card. By Liam Tung | May 31, 2017 -- 13:50 GMT (06:50 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Intel's Compute Card is slightly longer than a credit card and can plug into a dock. Image: Intel Intel has launched Compute Card, a slim, modular PC that it wants other brands to incorporate into connected things, such as kiosks, smart TVs, different form factor PCs, and home appliances. The top-tier model features a seventh-generation Intel i5-7Y57 CPU, 4GB RAM, up to a 128GB solid-state drive, and wireless chip. The Compute Card differs from Intel's Compute Stick, which was for consumers who needed a small PC to plug into a living-room display. Instead, the Compute Card will show up in devices like an all-in-one and mini PC from Foxconn, LG smart monitors, Sharp digital signage, and a range of other traditional computing devices. The Compute Card's modular design is meant to make it easier for consumers to upgrade smart features in their connected devices, simply by slotting in a new card. Manufacturers would benefit by incorporating a compatible slot into their connected products, cutting the need, for example, to develop their own circuit boards. Lenovo, Dell, and HP are working on Compute Card-powered products, but they're not ready for showing yet, according to Intel. Intel unveiled the Compute Card at CES earlier this year and is now gearing up to ship the devices in August. Intel has released a Compute Card Device Design Kit for product developers, which includes guides and reference designs to support the card. To get developers started, it's also built its own Card Compute Dock with a 19V DC power supply, HDMI port and USB 3.0 ports to connect displays and other peripherals. Though the dock would appeal to consumers, it appears to be aimed at product developers who support customer signage and conference-room systems. It also has a reference design dock that can be customized to fit other connected products. Intel is encouraging would-be Compute Card developers to consider how they would embed, cool, and eject the compute module in a way that meets its requirements for a mechanical secure lock. The Compute Card will be available in four configurations outlined below. Intel's Compute Card comes in four configurations.

An eSIM is an embedded chip which can remove the need to buy a SIM card – and insert it into a device’s SIM tray – when a user wants to connect to a cellular network. When Apple launched its iPad Pro in 2016, the company included an Apple SIM embedded in the device. The embedded Apple SIM supported networks in the US and UK at the time.

Photographer: John Angelillo/Pool via Bloomberg President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, agreed Tuesday to turn over a limited number of documents sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee for its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Flynn has agreed to initially produce documents the committee subpoenaed from his two companies, Flynn Intel LLC and Flynn Intel Inc., according to a person with knowledge of Flynn’s negotiations with the committee. It wasn’t yet determined what kind of documents will be handed over, the person said. The committee also had issued a separate subpoena for Flynn to turn over personal documents and to testify. Although Flynn initially opposed that subpoena, the committee has since narrowed its focus, the person said. Flynn has now agreed to turn over personal documents that the committee, through legal standards, can prove exist, the person said, but he hasn’t agreed to testify before the committee. Flynn will start producing documents on June 6, with more to follow, the person said, adding that Flynn wants to cooperate with the committee to the fullest extent possible as long as doing so doesn’t jeopardize his constitutional rights. Flynn, who was forced to resign in February after revelations that he misled administration officials about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador, had been under threat of a contempt citation after turning down the panel’s request for documents and an interview. His lawyer cited the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination, arguing that the committee’s request was overly broad. Russian Influence The committee is investigating Russian meddling in the presidential race and the possibility of collusion by members of Trump’s campaign. Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was a top adviser to Trump during his run for president. He has become a central figure in congressional investigations as well an FBI probe that now is being overseen by a special counsel, former FBI Director Robert Mueller.

Sign Up The investigations have entangled a number of Trump advisers and associates, including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who serves as a senior White House adviser. In December, before Trump took office, Kushner and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak met in New York and talked about possibly setting up a secure and secretive communications channel between the Kremlin and Trump’s transition team, according to a person familiar with the matter. That’s led some Democrats to call for revocation of Kushner’s security clearance. Separately, Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, turned down requests from House and Senate investigators for information and testimony, saying their questions were “poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered.” Like the president and his other allies, Cohen questioned why the investigation was continuing. Blanket Denial “To date, there has not been a single witness, document or piece of evidence linking me to this fake Russian conspiracy,” Cohen said. “This is not surprising to me because there is none.” Russian officials also deny any collusion. The Kremlin sees “hourly” attempts at “fomenting and maintaining Russophobic sentiments” in the U.S., spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday. “It has a very negative impact overall on the atmosphere of our bilateral relations,” Peskov said. Flynn has been under scrutiny since being ousted from the administration. He previously offered to testify to Congress in exchange for immunity from prosecution, a request lawmakers rejected. Representative Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said last week that Flynn may have lied in his application for a security clearance by saying that his paid speech at a Moscow gala for a Russian TV network in 2015 had been “funded by U.S. companies.” Documents previously released by congressional Democrats show he received more than $45,000 from RT, the Russian government-backed television network, for his participation at a gala where he sat at President Vladimir Putin’s table.

Lewandowski explained that "when you have a communications team, they have to have that relationship with the president, to understand how he communicates, because he is the greatest communicator as a president that we've ever had." While the implication that one must already understand how Trump communicates in order to see he's a great communicator may seem dubious, White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks also effused Tuesday that Trump "has an unparalleled ability to communicate with people." The communications shakeup at the White House could see Lewandowski returning to the employ of his former boss. Trump is reportedly considering adding Lewandowski to the communications department; Trump had also considered adding his former deputy campaign manager, David Bossie, although Bossie has since expressed his wish not to join the White House. Press Secretary Sean Spicer's on-camera appearances are nevertheless expected to be rolled back and the Great Communicator will reportedly be holding more press conferences on his own.

  Corey Lewandowski raves that Trump is 'the greatest communicator as a president that we've ever had' May 31, 2017 Watch this Edit Watch this surprisingly poignant fake documentary short about Trump's spray-tanner 2:56 a.m. ET   President Trump's unusual skin tone has led to some unkind nicknames, like "Angry Creamsicle" and "Golf Cart Cheeto." But Funny or Die didn't go in for any of those cheap laughs in its new short, The President's Sun, released Wednesday by site co-founder Adam McKay. The mock documentary introduces the world to Khoren Dartanian (Ken Davitian, Borat, The Artist), an Armenian emigrant and the only man allowed to spray-tan Trump. "I met the president back in 1987," Dartanian says. "He told me, 'Khoren, I want a tan that makes other tans feel weak. My tan wins, and their tan loses.'" The president's colorist returns to the theme of Trump's spray-tan as the source of his power later on in the video, and he ends with a surprisingly touching soliloquy on Trump's apparent use of artificial melanin. "I'm guessing there really is one person and one person only who spray-tans the president," McKay explained to Vanity Fair. "It's a very private act. I started wondering who that person is." You can watch his imaginative, briefly NSFW (language) exposition below.

The 16 Trump dispensations from ethics rules he signed include visible figures like Kellyanne Conway, who was given permission to interact with clients of her polling firm, and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who can talk freely with the Republican National Committee. Six of the waivers went to White House lawyers, including counsel Don McGahn, allowing them to communicate with their former law firm, Jones Day. And four White House officials got waivers to work on issues they focused on as lobbyists: Michael Catanzaro, who worked against Obama-era environmental rules as an energy lobbyist, can oversee the office trying to repeal those rules; Shahira Knight, who left her job as a top lobbyist for Fidelity Investments, is allowed to work on tax and retirement policy; Andrew Olmem, who lobbied on bankruptcy and securities issues as a partner at the law firm Venable, can work with former clients in his role as financial policy adviser; and Joshua Pitcock, Pence's chief of staff, can work on issues that affect Indiana, which he lobbied for. Chief strategist Steve Bannon, former head of Breitbart News, was the apparent target for a blanket waiver retroactively allowing all Trump White House appointees to communicate "with news organizations on matters of broad policy" including "a former employer or former client." The White House released the waivers under pressure from the Office of Government Ethics, which requested waiver information in April for all federal agencies; along with the White House waivers released Wednesday night, information about dispensations to other federal appointees are expected to be made public in coming days. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said that the Trump administration had tried "to the furthest extent possible" to get staffers "to recuse from conflicting conduct rather than being granted waivers," so, for example, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn did not need a waiver because he voluntarily recuses himself from matters specific to Goldman Sachs, where he was a top executive. Waivers became more common under former President Barack Obama, made necessary by ethics rules he put in place to block lobbyists; over eight years, he issued 17 total waivers for White House employees, including three in the first few months, and about 70 to all federal appointees.

Alcantara was set to graduate from Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing in New York City on Tuesday morning, and left early enough so he would arrive well before the ceremony began at 9:15 a.m. His Manhattan-bound train came to a stop, and "after 45 minutes, I knew I was already late, but I kept hoping that I'd at least make it to walking the stage," he told New York Magazine's Select All. As the minutes ticked by, Alcantara — donning his cap and gown — knew he wouldn't get there in time, and that's when the train came together to throw him an impromptu ceremony. "It wasn't so much an idea, but something that just happened," he said. "Everyone was getting antsy and impatient, so I figured I'd lighten the mood by thanking everyone for coming out. That led to applause, and the rest just followed." His friend created a diploma on his cellphone, a rider started to play music on his phone, and everyone watched as Alcantara received his own private ceremony. The train was ultimately delayed three hours, and by the time Alcantara arrived on campus, his fellow graduates were leaving. That didn't stop Alcantara's friends and family from holding another spontaneous ceremony, this time alone inside the auditorium. "It was a great time," Alcantara said.

On Wednesday morning, it was reported that Trump will likely withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris Climate Agreement, signed by former President Barack Obama in 2015, which commits to reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent within a decade. Later in the day, Musk, a member of Trump's business advisory council and manufacturing jobs initiative, tweeted that he didn't know "which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain." A follower asked Musk what he'll do if Trump does leave the agreement, and Musk replied, "Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case." Trump tweeted Wednesday night that he will announce his decision at 3 p.m. Thursday in the White House Rose Garden. Musk also disagreed with Trump on his travel ban that targeted people from seven Muslim-majority countries, tweeting in February that while he opposed the ban, "advisory councils simply advise and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the administration." Catherine Garcia   Elon Musk says he'll leave Trump advisory councils over Paris climate deal 1:07 a.m. The Daily Showdown Edit Trevor Noah has a good laugh over 'covfefe,' then makes a serious point about Trump 12:17 a.m. ET   If we generously set the statute of limitations for "covfefe" jokes at 24 hours, Hillary Clinton made it in just under the wire, and so did Trevor Noah. "I don't know about America, but Donald Trump has definitely made Twitter great again — say what you want," he said on Wednesday's Daily Show. "And I'm just going to enjoy this moment," when "people were searching 'covfefe' on the internet like it was a Kim Kardashian nude." People have different theories on why President Trump left an unfinished late-night tweet ending in a nonsense word up for six hours before deleting it, and Noah offered his own, involving couch cushions, CNN, jet lag, and Obama's birth certificate. "As much as 'covfefe' was a gaffe, it must have been nice for the White House to have a Trump blunder that, for a change, didn't threaten national security," Noah said. "And more importantly, it provided welcome distraction from the fallout that came from his recent foreign trip." The Trump team, of course, just created its own narrative of the Trump trip, and it involved a lot of superlatives and Sean Spicer. "Did you see how incredible that was?" he asked after a highlight reel of Spicer obsequiousness. "Not only is the administration ignoring all the criticism of the trip, they're basically saying it was the greatest presidential trip of all time." He illustrated his point with a restaurant analogy, then explained why Spicer, with a straight face, can "say that Donald Trump now is the patron saint of diplomacy: Well, it's because he knows that there's a large part of the population — you may know them as Republicans — who believe that Donald Trump is far more credible than most news outlets." So when Trump says Obama wiretapped him, they believe it, Noah said, and "if Trump says 'covfefe,' look, they don't know what it means, but damnit, they believe it. Trump's whole political career has taught him that he doesn't need anybody's reality but his own." He ends with a bit of his own imagined reality — a Gandhi-Ellen chimera — and maybe with this ends covfefe covfever? Watch below.

They are specifically trying to determine if a private meeting took place between Sessions and Kislyak on April 26, 2016, at Washington, D.C.'s Mayflower Hotel. That day, candidate Donald Trump gave his first major foreign policy speech at the hotel, and both Sessions, then a Republican senator from Alabama, and Kislyak attended a reception prior to his address. Sessions, who has previously failed to disclose meetings he held with Russian officials, has been asked to hand over additional information, including his schedules. After saying during his confirmation hearing that he "did not have any communications with the Russians" during the campaign, it came out that Sessions did in fact meet with Kislyak twice; Sessions later said he didn't think he needed to share this information because the meetings took place as part of his Senate duties. Catherine Garcia   Report: Congress investigating another possible meeting between Sessions, Russian ambassador May 31, 2017 tit for tat Edit Clinton, Trump taunt each other on Twitter May 31, 2017   Pool/Getty Images The election was nearly seven months ago, but the Republican and Democratic nominees can't stop getting their jabs in. President Trump got the ball rolling, tweeting Wednesday night, "Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC." Trump was likely referring to comments Clinton made earlier in the day at Recode's CodeCon, when she said she inherited "nothing" from the Democratic National Committee once she became the nominee, adding that the DNC was "bankrupt" and had data that was "mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong." Clinton hit back quickly, pouncing on Trump's weird half-finished tweet that was up for most of last night, tweeting, "People in covfefe houses shouldn't throw covfefe." Clinton was most certainly referring to the fact that there are several government investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, ensnaring many of his closest aides, including son-in-law Jared Kushner, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, and personal attorney Michael Cohen.

Already the overclocking crews at Computex have been pushing key products from this HEDT CPU range to their limits and are breaking OC and benchmark world records. Intel Core-X TIM and delidding While it's great to see the capabilities of these chips, and the platform, easily exceed those that came before them, that fact is tempered with some not-so-good news. Sadly Intel's most premium consumer processors still use a 'conventional paste' thermal interface material (TIM). They aren't soldered, so getting the best extreme clock speeds from these parts requires delidding (German language, toggle on the English subtitles), says OC expert der8auer. Skylake-X delidded In the linked video you can see first a Kaby Lake-X processor die (with the lid removed). It is the same size as previously available dies but comes on a bigger and thicker package which facilitates higher clocks thanks to better signalling, more VCC and GND pins, explains the overclocking expert. Moving onto Skylake-X it's an altogether trickier delidding process as the die on a raised level under the lid and surrounded by many tiny raised-up capacitors and resistors. Thus der8auer has designed a tool to help you delid a Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processor, called the Delid Die Mate X (available by the end of June). HWBot world records Moving onto the achievements of the new Intel Core-X processors on X299 motherboards, numerous overclocking world record have already been broken. If you head on over to the world record page of HWBot you can see plenty of new records from the last couple of days. Within the CPU benchmarks table, reproduce above, five out of the 12 listed records have been broken by Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processors in the past two days. It looks like the Intel Core i7 7740K and Intel Core i9 7900X are particularly popular with overclockers with records broken in PiFast, SuperPi, and more. You will also find a slew of GPU and application world records broken by overclockers using the new Intel Core i7 7740K and Intel Core i9 7900X as you scroll down through the HWBot world record page. Intel's 8th generation Core processors Here's another important Intel News segment from Computex.

Posted by Corky34 - Wed 31 May 2017 14:37 Every time someone accuses Intel of using a poor quality TIM i want to scream, do people really think a company that spends $12.7 billion on R&D is going to penny pinch when it comes to TIM for nothing but financial reasons. Posted by MonkFish - Wed 31 May 2017 14:41 Iota For the prices they are charging, you would have thought they would be soldered. Another reason for me to buy AMD. I agree but solder costs money i mean they would have to add at least another $100 to solder the lids on te cpus. (sarcasm) They are bareley scracping by charging what they do, i mean look at all the innovation they have brough us in the last few years (/sarcasm). I have a feeling in a couple of years we will start to see the same anti competative practises admissions from some OEMs (not by the OEMs but by Intel) which we heard in the past when thunderbird etc could nbot get a foothold in the market despite being better. I mean look at whats already happening with the forcing of optane on motherboard manufacturers… Posted by MonkFish - Wed 31 May 2017 14:43 Corky34 Every time someone accuses Intel of using a poor quality TIM i want to scream, do people really think a company that spends $12.7 billion on R&D is going to penny pinch when it comes to TIM for nothing but financial reasons. Why not, it happens everywhere else. Motor manufacturers spend vast amounts of R&D yet still have to issue recalls because they cheap out on a component. Posted by Corky34 - Wed 31 May 2017 15:04 MonkFish Why not, it happens everywhere else. Motor manufacturers spend vast amounts of R&D yet still have to issue recalls because they cheap out on a component. Because CPUs and material sciences isn't comparable to motor manufacturers where cheaping out on a component isn't financially, let alone scientifically, provable to be detrimental to the final product. And before anyone jumps down my throat I'm not saying Intel uses the best quality TIM full stop, I'm saying they use a TIM best suited for their specific needs and those needs do not include cutting costs, a TIM needs to do more than just provide low thermal resistance.

The Snapdragon 835 processor, which has been used in smartphones, will power the new computers Intel's processors are still more powerful, however Todd Haselton | @robotodd 17 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters New Windows 10 PCs will run on Qualcomm chips, but Intel investors shouldn't worry just yet    13 Hours Ago | 00:51 HP, Asus and Lenovo will build new Windows 10 computers running on Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips, Qualcomm said on Wednesday. It may sound like something Intel should worry about, but investors shouldn't sound the alarm just yet. First, some backstory: It's the first time Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips have been used to power a full version of Windows, which usually runs on processors from AMD or Intel. Microsoft has tried Qualcomm chips with lighter versions of its OS such as Windows RT, but those efforts failed because the computers couldn't run most apps designed for Windows. That's what changes now. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor, typically reserved for smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S8, will power the new Windows 10 computers and will offer constant connectivity. That means folks who buy a new computer from Asus, HP or Lenovo should expect it to come with the option to add it to their wireless carrier for data service when Wi-Fi isn't available. Qualcomm said the new computers will be "lighter and more portable than any other laptop currently available," while also offering longer battery life than current solutions on the market. It sounds appealing, but here's why Intel shouldn't worry. While the Snapdragon 835 is a powerful-enough chip for smartphones, you shouldn't expect these computers to offer robust support for rendering in Photoshop or video editing, even though Qualcomm promises support for "all Windows applications." Those functions might work in some regard, but don't expect these machines to be the most powerful on the market. Qualcomm's chips are becoming more and more powerful, but they're still not a match for a full-fledged seventh-generation Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processor, the sorts that are used in the latest flagship computers from companies such as Dell and Microsoft, and which we expect to launch in Apple's new MacBooks as soon as next week. These are some of Qualcomm's first steps onto Intel's territory, where Intel has mainly had to worry about AMD as a competitor, so it's still a move worth watching. A final point: we still don't know when the first Qualcomm-powered Windows 10 computers will launch, or how much they'll cost, the latter of which will be important if Qualcomm wants to take share from Intel.

The new X299E-ITX/ac is small, but it takes full advantage of Intel’s new X299 platform, offering support for all CPUs with up to 18 cores, quad-channel DDR4 memory on the higher-end CPUs, three PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 slots as well as everything that one might expect from a Mini-ITX board, including Wi-Fi. Besides being a miniature motherboard for Intel's HEDT processors, the most important aspect of the ASRock X299E-ITX/ac is support for quad-channel memory in this form-factor. The company’s previous-gen Intel X99-based Mini-ITX mainboard was feature-packed, but one of the things it missed was the quad-channel memory sub-system, which had an expected negative effect on performance in applications that required high memory bandwidth. By contrast, the new unit has four SO-DIMM DDR4 memory slots and even supports DDR4 overclocking (assuming that there are SO-DIMMs that can be significantly overclocked). In fact, putting four memory slots onto a small motherboard while also fitting the LGA 2066 socket and required high-capactiy VRMs is a rather remarkable engineering achievement. The flip side however is that the very tightly packed design of the X299E-ITX/ac may impose certain limitations on compatibility with large cooling systems. Just like every other Mini-ITX motherboard around, the ASRock X299E-ITX/ac has only one PCIe 3.0 x16 slot for graphics cards. In the meantime, the X299E-ITX/ac is the first miniature mainboard to feature three M.2 slots (PCIe 3.0 x4 or SATA) for SSDs. In addition, the board carries six SATA 6 Gbps headers for builds that require multiple storage devices in drive form-factor. It is noteworthy that in order to fit everything it wanted onto a Mini-ITX PCB, ASRock had to place the USB 3.1 controller, SATA ports and one M.2 slot on custom DIMM-like modules - essentially going vertical when they ran out of horizontal space. Such modules add certain dimension-related limitations to the size of CPU radiators (plus, it remains to be seen how higher-end M.2 SSDs perform when located near a CPU cooler), but this is a tradeoff that the manufacturer had to take. As for connectivity, the X299E-ITX/ac comes with a 2x2 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.2 module (based on an Intel controller), two GbE ports (Intel controllers too), two USB 3.1 headers  (Type-A and Type-C), six USB 3.0 connectors, 7.1-channel audio sub-system (enabled by the Realtek ALC1220 controller) and so on. ASRock's Mini-ITX Motherboard for Intel Core X-Series   X299E-ITX/ac CPU Support Intel Core i9 Intel Core i7 Intel Core i5 CPUs in LGA2066 form-factor Graphics PCIe 3.0 x16 Chipset Intel X299 Memory Four DDR4 SO-DIMM slots Ethernet 2 × Intel GbE controllers Storage 6 × SATA 6 Gbps 3 × M.2 (PCIe 3.0 x4 or SATA) Audio Realtek ALC1220 7.1 channel audio USB 6 × USB 3.0 Type-A 1 × USB 3.1 Type-A 1 × USB 3.1 Type-C Other I/O Dual band 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.2 Form-Factor Mini-ITX MSRP $280 ~ $300 The ASRock X299E-ITC/ac will be available in the coming months for about $280 - $300, depending on the region and other factors. Such a price point is considerably higher than MSRPs of most Mini-ITX motherboards, but given the fact that this is a very high-end platform (with equally high component requirements) aimed at enthusiasts, it is not unusual. In fact, from many standpoint it may be considered as an entry-level X299 board simply because it does not provide opulence of its bigger brethren.

Reply Cygni - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link There are multiple AMD articles in the last few days, so I don't really know what you are talking about. Plus AMD didn't really announce anything that they haven't already covered before or strongly hinted, so there isn't a lot to say yet. When Vega actually lands, or AIB partners launch designs, or threadripper actually shows up, or we actually get more than 3-4 board designs... sure! But none of that has happened yet.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

Shopping for a new computer can be a time-consuming hassle, so we’ve handpicked some of the best current discounts to spare you some work. Along with offering a selection of discounted computers from name-brand makers like Apple and HP, our laptop deal roundup highlights a variety of models suited for different needs — from general use to hardcore gaming — to help you find the PC that best fits your lifestyle. The budget option: Acer Aspire ES 15 ES1-572-31KW First on our laptop deal roundup is the budget-friendly Acer Aspire ES 15 ES1-572-31KW, which is available for just $300 on Amazon after a $20 discount. This PC features a 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080 LED display which utilizes CineCrystal technology for a crisp and color-rich HD picture. The sixth-generation Intel Core i3-6100U 2.3GHz processor, 4GB of RAM, and Intel HD Graphics 520 GPU work together to provide sufficient power for work, light gaming, and general use, making the Aspire E5-575-33BM a great choice for an affordable everyday laptop. The computer comes with a 1TB hard drive for plenty of internal storage, and the battery can last more than six hours on a single charge so you have enough power for a day’s work on the go. $300 from Amazon The workhorse: Asus P-Series P2540UA-AB51 Asus manufactures a wide lineup of affordable laptop computers, and if you’re in need of a reliable work companion, consider the Asus P-Series P2540UA-AB51. A step up specs-wise from the Acer Aspire, the Asus P-Series comes equipped with a sixth-generation Intel Core i5-7200U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. The 15.6-inch widescreen display offers a 1080p resolution to let you enjoy your games, videos, and pictures in full HD, while the embedded TPM Security chip and fingerprint scanner keep your important work files safe. Asus Business Manager software makes it easy to set up and customize your system as well. The Asus P-Series P2540UA-AB51 normally goes for $599, but Amazon has it on sale for $100 off, bringing this workhorse laptop down to just $499. $499 from Amazon The slimline option: HP Envy 13-ab016nr Notebook For those wanting something a bit smaller, the HP Envy 13-ab016nr Notebook is a solid option. This slim laptop features a 13-inch display, a 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-7200U CPU, and 8GB of RAM, while the 256GB SSD gives you improved disk speeds over traditional hard drives. The Envy’s metal construction and scratch-resistant glass screen increase its durability for when you’re on the move. The lid hinge has a built-in riser that slightly raises the laptop when it’s open, allowing for a more natural typing posture, as well as extra air flow underneath the unit. The full-size keyboard is backlit as well. The HP Envy 13-ab016nr comes in at just $620 on Amazon, which is a nice $180 discount off of its usual price. $620 from Amazon The 2-in-1 option: HP Pavilion x360 Convertible Laptop Tablets are great for their portability and touchscreen functionality, but the lack of a mouse and keyboard makes them less suitable for work and extended use. Enter the 2-in-1 HP Pavilion x360 convertible laptop. This PC functions as a normal 15-inch notebook complete with keyboard and touchpad, but features a Full HD touchscreen display that can be flipped around and folded down for use as a tablet. An Intel Core i5-7200U CPU, 8GB of RAM, and 1TB hard drive also deliver more than enough power and storage for most needs. The HP Pavilion x360 convertible laptop is currently on sale for $550 on Amazon, giving you a whopping 39 percent discount of $350 for a limited time. Also included with the computer is a Woov laptop sleeve, a $60 value that is yours for free. $550 from Amazon For the Gamer: Acer Aspire VX 15 New on the scene for 2017, the Acer Aspire VX 15 is a laptop built for gamers that – unlike many portable gaming machines – won’t cost you a fortune. With its Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU, the VX 15 is the only laptop on our list equipped with a dedicated graphics card. The seventh-generation Core i7-7700HQ processor can be clocked up to 3.8GHz with Intel Turbo technology, which, when paired with a mighty 16GB of RAM, should give you lots of power for demanding games. The 15.6-inch IPS display lets you enjoy your gaming in full HD, and makes the laptop a good desktop replacement without being too bulky to carry around. The distinctive angular lines and red-and-black color scheme are accented by a red backlit keyboard. Still new on the market, the Acer Aspire VX 15 can be difficult to find, but Amazon now has it available for $1,000 after a $50 discount. $1,000 from Amazon For the Apple lover: MacBook Pro with 13.3” Retina display MacBooks can be expensive but you can score some awesome deals and save hundreds by buying a professionally refurbished model directly from the experts at Apple. The Apple store is currently offering a generous $200 discount on a refurbished 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display, bringing the cost down to $1,099 from its standard $1,299 price tag. Apple’s famous Retina display technology features an impressive resolution of 2,560 x 1,600, giving you an extremely crisp picture for a compact 13-inch screen. Under the hood, the MacBook Pro comes loaded with a fifth-generation dual-core Intel Core i5 2.7GHz processor, 8GB of installed RAM, and 128GB of flash storage. Two Thunderbolt 2 connector ports allow for high-speed data transfers, and the integrated battery provides up to 10 hours of power. $1,099 from Apple
Digital Trends Home > Computing > HyperX revamped its Predator-branded DDR4 lineup… HyperX revamped its Predator-branded DDR4 lineup to include 4,000MHz sticks By Kevin Parrish — Updated May 31, 2017 1:02 am Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you PC builders and customers looking to update their current memory configuration now have a load of options from HyperX, including kits running at 4,000MHz. Talk about quick thinking! Kingston Technology’s HyperX gaming division introduced new HyperX Predator DDR4 system memory kits with speeds (frequencies) of up to a staggering 4,000MHz. The company also added kits with high storage capacities of up to 128GB clocked at 3,000MHz. All memory sticks provided in the new kits support Intel’s Extreme Memory Profile (XMP) technology for easy and safe overclocking. Here is what HyperX now offers: Single sticks: Part Number Capacity Frequency Latency HX424C12PB3/8 8GB 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3/8 8GB 2,666MHz CL13 HX430C15PB3/8 8GB 3,000MHz CL15 HX424C12PB3/16 16GB 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3/16 16GB 2,666MHz CL13 HX430C15PB3/16 16GB 3,000MHz CL15 Two-pack kit: Part Number Capacity Frequency Latency HX424C12PB3K2/16 16GB (2x 8GB) 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3K2/16 16GB (2x 8GB) 2,666MHz CL13 HX436C17PB3K2/16 16GB (2x 8GB) 3,600MHz CL17 HX440C19PB3K2/16 16GB (2x 8GB) 4,000MHz CL19 HX424C12PB3K2/32 32GB (2x 32GB) 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3K2/32 32GB (2x 32GB) 2,666MHz CL13 Four-pack kit: Part Number Capacity Frequency Latency HX424C12PB3K4/32 32GB (4x 8GB) 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3K4/32 32GB (4x 8GB) 2,666MHz CL13 HX433C16PB3K4/32 32GB (4x 8GB) 3,333MHz CL16 HX436C17PB3K4/32 32GB (4x 8GB) 3,600MHz CL17 HX424C12PB3K4/64 64GB (4x 16GB) 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3K4/64 64GB (4x 16GB) 2,666MHz CL13 Eight-pack kit: Part Number Capacity Frequency Latency HX430C15PB3K8/128 128GB (8x 16GB) 3,000MHz CL15 Regarding latency, that “CL” designation is short for Column Access Strobe Latency. The typical memory stick consists of the printed circuit board (PCB), storage modules soldered onto that PCB, and input/output pins on the PCB that make an electrical connection to the motherboard’s memory socket. Latency starts when the motherboard’s memory controller tells the memory stick to access data stored on one of its modules, and ends when that data is made available on the PCB/stick’s input-output pins. That said, a DDR4 memory stick clocked at 2,400 with a CL17 latency will see that data retrieval process completed in around 14.17 nanoseconds. Typically, the faster the stick’s frequency/speed, the lower the latency. Yet despite the Intel-based XMP overclocking profiles, the HyperX Predator memory sticks work just fine in the latest AMD-based PCs as well. Overall, each Predator-branded stick provided in the HyperX kits consumes up to 1.35 volts of energy, and has an operating temperature ranging from zero degrees Celsius to 85 degrees Celsius. They also measure approximately 133.35mm x 42.2mm. “HyperX continues to lead the gaming memory market with high quality, high-performance memory for anyone building a new DDR4 rig,” says Kristy Ernt, global memory business manager, HyperX. “If you are a fan of AMD or Intel, HyperX memory offers the enhanced performance needed to game at your best.” HyperX didn’t provide any pricing at the time this article went live, but the company appears to have completely revamped its lineup of Predator DDR4 kits with this new rollout. HyperX also mentioned a two-pack kit of 8GB (2x 4GB) in its Computex announcement on Tuesday, May 30, but didn’t list the part number along with all the other kits posted above. We expect more information will surface once Computex comes to a close later this week.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Buying a new MacBook this week is a really bad idea - here's why Apple is expected to update its MacBook range at its annual WWDC event on 5 June. By Alistair Charlton May 31, 2017 13:13 BST Put that MacBook down. Apple is set to update its laptop range on 5 JuneReuters Step away from the Apple Store and put your credit card away, because now is a really bad time to buy a new MacBook. Let us explain. Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference, or WWDC, kicks off on 5 June with a keynote address led by company CEO Tim Cook. New products are always expected from WWDC, but this year the volume of rumours surrounding an update to Apple's laptop lineup mean you should hold off for now. The MacBook Pro, MacBook Air and regular MacBook lines are all expected to be updated at WWDC, according to Bloomberg, which has a strong track record for Apple gossip. The website reported: "Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp...Apple is also working on a new version of the 12in MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company is also considering updating the aging 12in MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple's cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said." By adopting Kaby Lake processors, the MacBook Pro range is expected to get a boost to both performance and battery life. The entire Mac lineup is marked as 'don't buy' or 'caution' by the MacRumors buying guide, which tracks how often Apple traditionally updates each product, then states how many days it has been since the last refresh and whether consumers should buy now or wait. At the time of publication, the MacBook, Apple's smallest laptop, has not been updated for 407 days compared to an average of 375 days. The MacBook Air, however, has gone 814 days since an update compared to an average of 350. The MacBook Pro is the newest of the Apple laptop family, having seen an update 216 days ago. This is just over 100 days short of the computer's average, but MacRumors has applied a caution note to it regardless. Further evidence of a refresh comes from the online Apple Store, which reports a week-long delivery time for some models of MacBook Pro, suggesting that stock is drying up in anticipation of something new. As Apple blog 9to5Mac states: "When shipping dates lapse at the Apple Online Store, it is often a good indicator that a new version is coming soon. When those dates coincide with an Apple event, it's an even stronger signal." The iMac, Apple's desktop computer, is also well overdue an update at 596 days compared to an average of 317 and the Mac Mini sits at 958 days, over double the average update cycle. But, for now, all rumours point towards WWDC 2017 being about MacBooks - and an Amazon Echo rival dubbed the Siri Speaker.

Given the fact that this is a high-end platform, GIGABYTE has opted to use their premium AORUS brand for all three initial models, which are the X299 AORUS Gaming 9, X299 AORUS Gaming 7, and X299 AORUS Gaming 3. Starting off with the flagship X299 AORUS Gaming 9, we get to see GIGABYTE's unconstrained vision for this new HEDT platform. The X299 AORUS Gaming 9 has what appears to be a 12-phase CPU power design, and features Nippon Chemi-Con 10K Durable Black solid capacitors everywhere but in the audio subsystem. There are two 8-pin CPU/EPS power connectors, which should come in handy if a high TDP 18-core Skylake-X processor is installed or just when doing some extreme overclocking. Making full use of this platform numerous PCIe lanes, there are five mechanical PCIe x16 slots, all of which have been mechanically reinforced with steel and additional anchor points for improved retention and shearing resistance. Two of the slots run at x16, one of the slots runs at x8, and the other two are limited to x4, which means that this motherboard will 'only' be able to handle up to three-way graphics card configurations. Storage connectivity appears to be excellent with eight SATA 6Gb/s ports and three M.2 slots that support SATA, PCI-E, NVMe M.2 solid state drives and Intel's new Optane Memory technology. All three slots feature a Thermal Guard cover to help protect and cool the M.2 drives. For those who need a fourth M.2 slot, GIGABYTE have also included an M.2 add-in card in the accessories bundle. If the lack of an U.2 port is a concern, worry not since there is also a  M.2 to U.2 adapter included. This motherboard also supports four USB 2.0 ports (two headers), eight USB 3.0 ports (four rear, two headers), and seven USB 3.1 Gen2 ports (five rear, one header). Focusing on the full-speed USB 3.1 Gen2 ports, there are an impressive four Type-A ports and one Type-C port on the rear I/O panel, and a USB 3.1 Gen2 front-panel internal header next to the memory slots. At least some of this USB 3.1 Gen2 connectivity is courtesy of the brand new ASMedia 3142 controller. When it comes to networking, there are two gigabit LAN ports, one powered by an Intel controller and one by a Rivet Networks Killer E2500 chip. The onboard dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi is courtesy of a Killer Wireless-AC 1535 module that supports transfer rates of up to 867Mbps. The wired and wireless Killer interfaces can be used together via the Killer DoubleShot Pro feature to direct high priority traffic to the fastest interface or they can be combined to create one very high throughput interface. While the name might be familiar - Amp-Up Audio - this motherboard features a brand new high-end onboard audio design. It is based on the familiar Realtek ALC1220 codec, but it has been bolstered by some pretty serious components, like a ESS SABRE 9018K2M DAC, Texas Instruments LME 49720 and OPA1622 OP-AMPs, and WIMA audio capacitors. They have also included Creative's Sound BlasterX 720° audio engine software. As should be pretty clear from the above picture, the X299 AORUS Gaming 9 has been outfitted with a ton of RGB LED lighting zones. There are LEDs between the individual memory slots, on both sides of each of the the PCIe slots, built into the chipset cooler, and there's even LED strips integrated into the I/O and audio section covers. Even the rear I/O shield glows! If that's not enough, there are also three headers on which you can plug LED light strips. Speaking of headers, there are seven fan headers, including three water pump headers, one of which is a high current 3 amp version. Apparently some of these Hybrid Fan headers that can provide up-to-the-second information on flow-rate and water temperature and can be monitored in the Smart Fan 5 software suite. The two onboard temperature sensor headers should also be able to feed data into the utility. The bottom edge of the motherboards features an interesting assortment of power and reset buttons, clear CMOS button, ECO button, OC button, and a Debug LED. Last, but not least, the back of the motherboard is covered by a metal armor plate, which will add structural rigidity and protect the various components, solder points, and traces. The X299 AORUS Gaming 7 is far more similar to the Gaming 9 than it is different. When it comes to expansion slots and storage connectivity everything is exactly the same. The only differences are that two of the three M.2 Thermal Guards are missing, and the M.2 to U.2 adapter is not included in the accessories bundle. The onboard audio features the greatest change, with a swap from the ESS Sabre ES9018K2M to the ES9018Q2Ca and the removal of one of the two op-amps. The X299 AORUS Gaming 7 is also missing the fancy glowing I/O shield, though the other RGB FUSION lighting features all remain identical. Since there is no Gaming 5 model yet, the step down from the X299 AORUS Gaming 7 to the X299 AORUS Gaming 3 is a little more severe than between the two previous models. Most notably, the Gaming 3 only has one 8-pin CPU/EPS power connector and only two of its PCIe x16 slots are steel-reinforced. The other clear difference is that there is only two M.2 slots - down one from the higher-end models - and there are no M.2 Thermal Guards at all. The USB 3.1 Gen2 front-panel connector has been replaced with a USB 3.0 version, and three of the USB 3.1 Gen2 ports on the rear I/O panel have been replaced by USB 3.0 ports. So in total, this model has four USB 2.0 ports (two headers), ten USB 3.0 ports (six rear, two headers), and two USB 3.1 Gen2 ports (two rear). Speaking of rear I/O, there is only one gigabit LAN port and no Wi-Fi on the X299 AUROS Gaming 3. The onboard audio has also been demoted, with no DAC or op-amps, and no plastic shroud covering that area either. The RGB FUSION lighting feature has also been cut-down a bit, with no LEDs in between the memory slots and only the two primary PCIe x16 slots being lit instead of all five. While we don't yet have any pricing information for any of the models, the GIGABYTE X299 AORUS Gaming series will be available for purchase sometime in June 2017.

School Zone Latest insights, news in education Features Education Sentinel School Zone Trinity Prep student wins a top award in prestigious Intel science competition Amber Yang, 18, a senior at Trinity Preparatory School created a project that tracks space debris in orbit that won a top prize, $50,000 scholarship, in prestigious Intel Foundation Young Scientist competition. Amber Yang, 18, a senior at Trinity Preparatory School created a project that tracks space debris in orbit that won a top prize, $50,000 scholarship, in prestigious Intel Foundation Young Scientist competition. Leslie PostalContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Years ago, Amber Yang’s mother decided to feed her daughter’s budding interest in science by hanging a poster of famous scientists in the hallway outside her bedroom. The poster, hung low enough so the then-second grader could read about all their achievements, seems to have done its job. Still on the wall in the family’s Windermere-area home, the poster is now surrounded by plaques and awards celebrating the 18-year-old’s success in science competitions. The latest addition is from earlier this month, a top prize from the prestigious Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Yang won a “young scientist award” — and a $50,000 prize — for a mathematical analysis used to predict the location of space debris. Her project involves a computer simulation that detects the space junk and then figures out where it will travel next. The goal is to help avoid collisions with spacecraft. The award was an “incredible honor,” she said, and validation of three years of work. She spent hours on her laptop in her room, reading astrophysics journals and learning a computer program to help with her project. She even turned down her mother’s offer to take a cruise during Christmas break last year because she wanted to spend the time on her research. The award also was a huge confidence boost for the teenager who said she had plenty of days when she doubted her efforts, in part because several attempts led to nothing but red error messages on her laptop screen. “This path to success was not easy,” she said. The final round of the competition, held in Los Angeles, was intense and rewarding, giving her a chance to spend time with other teenagers equally passionate about studying science. “It was this great gathering of nerds,” she added with a laugh. Yang’s work stood out even among other excellent projects, said Len Duda, who just retired from the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., and served as a coach for the physics and astronomy division at the Intel competition. “I think everyone was just kind of amazed with what she did,” Duda said. The Intel competition “is like the Super Bowl of science fairs,” bringing together some 1,700 student projects from across the country and the world, he said. “To me, just being able to get there is an accomplishment.” Yang won “best in category” in her division and then one of the three top prizes overall. The prize money will help offset costs at Stanford University, where the senior at Trinity Preparatory School will enroll this fall. She plans to major in physics, with a concentration in astrophysics. At Trinity, Yang was a top student who took Advanced Placement chemistry and calculus as a 10th grader — far sooner than most students do — and plenty of other tough courses in the following years. “What’s great is really the way she throws herself into learning,” said Stephanie Dryden, Trinity’s co-director of college counseling. Yang impressed teachers not only with her academic achievements, but also with how down-to-earth and well-rounded she is and how well she tackled challenges, Dryden said. The teenager also played the violin and piano, served as an editor for the student newspaper and read voraciously. As a child, Yang said she was always “the weird kid who was obsessed with space” and loved trips the Kennedy Space Center. Her parents, Joyce Teng and Brian Yang, are both engineers who work at Lockheed Martin and encouraged her interests. Yang liked reading about the scientists on her poster, from Aristotle to Stephen Hawking. But early on, she had a question for her mom: “Why are there so few women? They’re all guys.” As she got older, she realized women remain underrepresented in the sciences, particularly in the field she hopes to pursue, and girls often leave the math-science pipeline well before college. She understands why. In middle school, she was the only girl on her school’s robotics team, and the boys left her out, seemingly convinced she had nothing to offer. That discouraged her. But as she explained in a December TEDx talk she gave in Jacksonville, a high school science teacher who said, “Amber Yang can do whatever she wants, if she puts her mind to it” made a difference. “The next time you see the only girl in the room, ask her for her ideas on how to build that robot,” she told the audience at the event meant to showcase “inspiring ideas.” Yang applied to speak at the annual gathering. Her talk was about her efforts to complete her research and to find her place. Yang, who earned a second-place prize at the Intel fair last year and was a finalist in another national competition, said she began her project after reading news reports about an exploded Chinese space satellite and how the debris posed a possible threat to other spacecraft. When she learned data on space debris was publicly available, she knew she could do her project on her laptop, from her pink bedroom stacked with textbooks and notebooks befitting her academic interests and a few relics of her younger years, including stuffed animals and a Hello Kitty pillow. In the years ahead, she hopes to encourage other girls to stick with science, if that is their passion, and some day hopefully help create a different looking famous-scientists poster. “I see myself as having this duty to encourage girls to pursue that,” she added. lpostal@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5273 Student's love of math adds up to big prize » Caption Central Florida’s third graders scored better on the state’s key reading exam this year than last, mirroring an increase seen across Florida.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is reportedly hammering out the details: "They're deciding on whether to initiate a full, formal withdrawal — which could take three years — or exit the underlying United Nations Treaty, which would be faster but more extreme," Axios writes. The Paris agreement, dealing with greenhouse gas emissions, has been signed by every nation except Nicaragua and Syria. Pruitt and Trump have called the global agreement "a bad deal for America." Climate scientists have expressed alarm at the United States' exit: "A Trump presidency might be game over for the climate. It might make it impossible to stabilize planetary warming below dangerous levels," scientist Michael Mann said. "If Trump makes good on his campaign promises and pulls out of the Paris Treaty, it is difficult to see a path forward to keeping warming below dangerous levels." Read more about why the Paris climate agreement is a big deal and why ditching the agreement could have global consequences. Jeva Lange   Trump has reportedly decided to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord May 31, 2017 Watch this Edit Watch this surprisingly poignant fake documentary short about Trump's spray-tanner 2:56 a.m. ET   President Trump's unusual skin tone has led to some unkind nicknames, like "Angry Creamsicle" and "Golf Cart Cheeto." But Funny or Die didn't go in for any of those cheap laughs in its new short, The President's Sun, released Wednesday by site co-founder Adam McKay. The mock documentary introduces the world to Khoren Dartanian (Ken Davitian, Borat, The Artist), an Armenian emigrant and the only man allowed to spray-tan Trump. "I met the president back in 1987," Dartanian says. "He told me, 'Khoren, I want a tan that makes other tans feel weak. My tan wins, and their tan loses.'" The president's colorist returns to the theme of Trump's spray-tan as the source of his power later on in the video, and he ends with a surprisingly touching soliloquy on Trump's apparent use of artificial melanin. "I'm guessing there really is one person and one person only who spray-tans the president," McKay explained to Vanity Fair. "It's a very private act. I started wondering who that person is." You can watch his imaginative, briefly NSFW (language) exposition below. Peter Weber   Watch this surprisingly poignant fake documentary short about Trump's spray-tanner 2:56 a.m. Name the swamp Edit White House discloses ethics waivers for 17 Trump officials, including 4 lobbyists 2:03 a.m. ET   Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images On Wednesday night, the White House released information on the ethics waivers it has granted to White House employees working for President Trump and, in one case, Vice President Mike Pence. The 16 Trump dispensations from ethics rules he signed include visible figures like Kellyanne Conway, who was given permission to interact with clients of her polling firm, and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who can talk freely with the Republican National Committee. Six of the waivers went to White House lawyers, including counsel Don McGahn, allowing them to communicate with their former law firm, Jones Day. And four White House officials got waivers to work on issues they focused on as lobbyists: Michael Catanzaro, who worked against Obama-era environmental rules as an energy lobbyist, can oversee the office trying to repeal those rules; Shahira Knight, who left her job as a top lobbyist for Fidelity Investments, is allowed to work on tax and retirement policy; Andrew Olmem, who lobbied on bankruptcy and securities issues as a partner at the law firm Venable, can work with former clients in his role as financial policy adviser; and Joshua Pitcock, Pence's chief of staff, can work on issues that affect Indiana, which he lobbied for. Chief strategist Steve Bannon, former head of Breitbart News, was the apparent target for a blanket waiver retroactively allowing all Trump White House appointees to communicate "with news organizations on matters of broad policy" including "a former employer or former client." The White House released the waivers under pressure from the Office of Government Ethics, which requested waiver information in April for all federal agencies; along with the White House waivers released Wednesday night, information about dispensations to other federal appointees are expected to be made public in coming days. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said that the Trump administration had tried "to the furthest extent possible" to get staffers "to recuse from conflicting conduct rather than being granted waivers," so, for example, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn did not need a waiver because he voluntarily recuses himself from matters specific to Goldman Sachs, where he was a top executive. Waivers became more common under former President Barack Obama, made necessary by ethics rules he put in place to block lobbyists; over eight years, he issued 17 total waivers for White House employees, including three in the first few months, and about 70 to all federal appointees. Peter Weber   White House discloses ethics waivers for 17 Trump officials, including 4 lobbyists 2:03 a.m. It wasn't all bad Edit Graduate stuck on delayed subway gets underground ceremony 1:43 a.m. ET   A delayed train kept Jerich Marco Alcantara from his official graduation ceremony, but it didn't stop his friends, family, and fellow subway riders from ensuring he experienced some pomp and circumstance. Alcantara was set to graduate from Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing in New York City on Tuesday morning, and left early enough so he would arrive well before the ceremony began at 9:15 a.m. His Manhattan-bound train came to a stop, and "after 45 minutes, I knew I was already late, but I kept hoping that I'd at least make it to walking the stage," he told New York Magazine's Select All. As the minutes ticked by, Alcantara — donning his cap and gown — knew he wouldn't get there in time, and that's when the train came together to throw him an impromptu ceremony. "It wasn't so much an idea, but something that just happened," he said. "Everyone was getting antsy and impatient, so I figured I'd lighten the mood by thanking everyone for coming out. That led to applause, and the rest just followed." His friend created a diploma on his cellphone, a rider started to play music on his phone, and everyone watched as Alcantara received his own private ceremony. The train was ultimately delayed three hours, and by the time Alcantara arrived on campus, his fellow graduates were leaving. That didn't stop Alcantara's friends and family from holding another spontaneous ceremony, this time alone inside the auditorium. "It was a great time," Alcantara said. Catherine Garcia   Graduate stuck on delayed subway gets underground ceremony 1:43 a.m. Climate change Edit Elon Musk says he'll leave Trump advisory councils over Paris climate deal 1:07 a.m. ET   Mike Windle/Getty Images Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says if President Trump ditches the Paris Agreement, he'll ditch him. On Wednesday morning, it was reported that Trump will likely withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris Climate Agreement, signed by former President Barack Obama in 2015, which commits to reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent within a decade. Later in the day, Musk, a member of Trump's business advisory council and manufacturing jobs initiative, tweeted that he didn't know "which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain." A follower asked Musk what he'll do if Trump does leave the agreement, and Musk replied, "Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case." Trump tweeted Wednesday night that he will announce his decision at 3 p.m. Thursday in the White House Rose Garden. Musk also disagreed with Trump on his travel ban that targeted people from seven Muslim-majority countries, tweeting in February that while he opposed the ban, "advisory councils simply advise and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the administration." Catherine Garcia   Elon Musk says he'll leave Trump advisory councils over Paris climate deal 1:07 a.m. The Daily Showdown Edit Trevor Noah has a good laugh over 'covfefe,' then makes a serious point about Trump 12:17 a.m. ET   If we generously set the statute of limitations for "covfefe" jokes at 24 hours, Hillary Clinton made it in just under the wire, and so did Trevor Noah. "I don't know about America, but Donald Trump has definitely made Twitter great again — say what you want," he said on Wednesday's Daily Show. "And I'm just going to enjoy this moment," when "people were searching 'covfefe' on the internet like it was a Kim Kardashian nude." People have different theories on why President Trump left an unfinished late-night tweet ending in a nonsense word up for six hours before deleting it, and Noah offered his own, involving couch cushions, CNN, jet lag, and Obama's birth certificate. "As much as 'covfefe' was a gaffe, it must have been nice for the White House to have a Trump blunder that, for a change, didn't threaten national security," Noah said. "And more importantly, it provided welcome distraction from the fallout that came from his recent foreign trip." The Trump team, of course, just created its own narrative of the Trump trip, and it involved a lot of superlatives and Sean Spicer. "Did you see how incredible that was?" he asked after a highlight reel of Spicer obsequiousness. "Not only is the administration ignoring all the criticism of the trip, they're basically saying it was the greatest presidential trip of all time." He illustrated his point with a restaurant analogy, then explained why Spicer, with a straight face, can "say that Donald Trump now is the patron saint of diplomacy: Well, it's because he knows that there's a large part of the population — you may know them as Republicans — who believe that Donald Trump is far more credible than most news outlets." So when Trump says Obama wiretapped him, they believe it, Noah said, and "if Trump says 'covfefe,' look, they don't know what it means, but damnit, they believe it. Trump's whole political career has taught him that he doesn't need anybody's reality but his own." He ends with a bit of his own imagined reality — a Gandhi-Ellen chimera — and maybe with this ends covfefe covfever? Watch below. Peter Weber   Trevor Noah has a good laugh over 'covfefe,' then makes a serious point about Trump 12:17 a.m. Russia Sessions Edit Report: Congress investigating another possible meeting between Sessions, Russian ambassador May 31, 2017   Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Congressional investigators are looking into whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions had yet another undisclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 presidential campaign, Democratic and Republican aides and intelligence officials told CNN Wednesday. They are specifically trying to determine if a private meeting took place between Sessions and Kislyak on April 26, 2016, at Washington, D.C.'s Mayflower Hotel. That day, candidate Donald Trump gave his first major foreign policy speech at the hotel, and both Sessions, then a Republican senator from Alabama, and Kislyak attended a reception prior to his address. Sessions, who has previously failed to disclose meetings he held with Russian officials, has been asked to hand over additional information, including his schedules. After saying during his confirmation hearing that he "did not have any communications with the Russians" during the campaign, it came out that Sessions did in fact meet with Kislyak twice; Sessions later said he didn't think he needed to share this information because the meetings took place as part of his Senate duties. Catherine Garcia   Report: Congress investigating another possible meeting between Sessions, Russian ambassador May 31, 2017 tit for tat Edit Clinton, Trump taunt each other on Twitter May 31, 2017   Pool/Getty Images The election was nearly seven months ago, but the Republican and Democratic nominees can't stop getting their jabs in. President Trump got the ball rolling, tweeting Wednesday night, "Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC." Trump was likely referring to comments Clinton made earlier in the day at Recode's CodeCon, when she said she inherited "nothing" from the Democratic National Committee once she became the nominee, adding that the DNC was "bankrupt" and had data that was "mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong." Clinton hit back quickly, pouncing on Trump's weird half-finished tweet that was up for most of last night, tweeting, "People in covfefe houses shouldn't throw covfefe." Clinton was most certainly referring to the fact that there are several government investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, ensnaring many of his closest aides, including son-in-law Jared Kushner, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, and personal attorney Michael Cohen.

While we’ll visit their booth for a product tour tomorrow, this evening that had the Republic of Gamers press conference. Targeted specifically at gamers and DiY enthusiasts ASUS introduced the Republic of Gamers (ROG) segment of products several years ago. The ROG branding these days is so big and special that there now are separate press conferences with product introductions for it.  The photo gallery covers all products launched and shown today, and you guys are in luck as seriously hot babe was presenting them all, so please do get your freak on. New items introduced are motherboards, the X399 and Intel X299 range. On stage also was Mr. Huang, CEO of Nvidia talking all things games, VR, and AR.  ASUS has a ton of stuff to show. A new card VROC that can house up-to eight M2 units and reach silly performance in RAID mode over a full X16 PCI-Express link. The unit default towards software RAID, hardware raid needs to be enabled (unlocked) through a physical unlock key and only allows usage of Intel based M2 units. The RAID 0/1 solution will be expensive and starts at 150 USD, for RAID 5 you need to pay roughly 250 USD. We'll post more info later. At the event we also learned that in the Intel procs launched initially are up-to 12-cores, which verifies that the 14, 16 and 18 core parts will be released in a much later stage in time. In the photos you can see a screenshot of a 10-core Intel processor, ASUS did not even have a 12-core part available for testing. So this means the Intel processor launch certainly isn't a hard-launch. We'll have to wait and see when the many core procs are available.  Now I can write a million words here, but well who am I kidding as chances are pretty good that your focus will be the the hotty presenting the products. Once your blood returns to the head, please do check out the ASUS ROG hardware photos. I’ll try and add some more specs and info once I have time for it. ASUS Talks Aura sync as universal implementation for  everything and anything RGB in the PC platform. ASUS is releasing an AURA SDK that can be used by other manufacturers that want to do RGB. ASUS also shows the PG35VQ monitor, a 35" monitor. We will look at that one tomorrow with the ASUS booth tour and take some photos. ASUS on the ROG event also announced its all new gaming notebook called Zyphyrus. This Core i5 and i7 driven laptop is powered by a GTX 1080, and is a slim laptop, actually the slimmest gaming laptop in the world. The laptop is 16.9mm up-to to 17.9mm tick (on it's thickest spot).  Have a browse through the photos of the ROG event. Tagged as: Computex 2017 Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ...

However, the company also teased its upcoming 8th-generation “Coffee Lake” processors which will be powering Apple’s MacBooks in next year. Intel’s Coffee Lake processors will be able to deliver 30 percent more performance than the 7th-generation Kaby Lake chips. “We will have more to say about the 8th Gen Intel Core processor in the future but it’s exciting to share that in the latest testing, we’re seeing a performance improvement of more than 30 percent over the 7th Gen Intel Core processor,” Intel senior executive Gregory Bryant said. Intel’s most recent testing results appear to be more than what the company initially claimed back in February. At the time, Intel said that the 8th-generation chip would only see a 15 percent improvement. Intel used the benchmark tool SYSmark 2014 version 1.5 to test one processor from each generation, accoridng to Apple Insider. For Kaby Lake, Intel used the 17-7500U with 8GB of DDR4-2133 RAM, while Coffee Lake used an undisclosed “estimates” for a processor with DDR4-2400 memory. The turbo clock speed of the Coffee Lake processor is up to 4GHz, but it’s base clock speed was not given. Although the tests shows that the Coffee Lake processor is indeed a huge improvement from its Kaby Lake counterpart, Intel says that estimates are “Pre-Silicon and are subject to change, with a 7 percent margin of error. Even with that in mind, Intel’s Coffee Lake processors will surely deliver on improved performance. Intel says that it plans to make its Coffee Lake lineup available to computer makers sometime during the second half of 2017. This should mean that the first wave computer rocking the next-generation chips will arrive sometime during the holiday season. The Coffee Lake chips should also be able to provide faster performance and longer battery life for MacBooks. Apple’s current Mac lineup isn’t even using the Kaby Lake yet chips yet, so it’s very likely that MacBooks with Coffee Lake chips will arrive next year. With Intel already teasing its Coffee Lake processors, the new chip seems like a promising feature that will come included on next year’s MacBook Pro lineup. However, the new chip has some caveats. It’s very unlikely that Apple’s future MacBook Pro will feature 32GB of RAM. Coffee Lake doesn’t support LPDDR4 RAM which makes it possible it possible to have that much memory. When Apple starts using Intel’s Coffee Lake chips for its MacBook Pro lineup, users will only be able to get a maximum of 16GB of RAM. IBT reported yesterday that Apple is planning to announce new versions of its 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. There’s also rumors floating around that the MacBook Air, which hasn’t been updated for years now, might also see an upgrade as well. Apple’s upgraded MacBook Pro is said to finally feature Intel’s Kaby Lake processors. As for the rest of the lineup, those will also receive some upgrades as well, but the Kaby Lake processors have not bee confirmed to be included. Apple is also reportedly woking on making its own chips which will be used for its future MacBook Pros. It remains to be seen if Apple will announce its plans during WWDC 2017. Apple's 2018 MacBook Pro lineup might feature Intel's Coffee Lake processors.

(2:48) Intel's new Core i9 and Asus Hyper M.2 lets you build a bootable M.2 array with up to 20 drives Here's what eight M.2 drives in RAID looks like on Intel's new X299 More like this Every X299 motherboard revealed: Intel's counterparts for Core i9 and Skylake-X Intel's massive 18-core Core i9 chip starts a bloody battle for enthusiast PCs Ryzen review: AMD is back Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD Storage buffs will get a massive dose of fun when Intel’s X299 chipset launches. The new Core i9 chipset will support up to 20 devices in a bootable RAID partition. The overlooked featured is called Virtual RAID On CPU (VROC). We got taste of it courtesy of Asus, which showed the feature running in its new X299 motherboards using a 10-core Skylake-X CPU. Few motherboards support more than three M.2 slots, so Asus used its new Hyper M.2 PCIe card. The Hyper M.2 lets you load up to four M.2 NVME PCIe drives into a single x16 card. You don’t have to worry about heat, because the Hyper M.2 features a beefy heat sink, thermal pads, and an active fan. [ Further reading: We tear apart a hard drive and SSD to show you how they work ] IDG/Gordon Mah Ung The Asus Hyper M.2 features active cooling to keep your drives from overheating If you populated the Hyper M.2 with four drives and dropped it into a slot even on an older motherboard, it would work, but all you would see is four individual M.2 drives. What’s new is the ability to RAID it. All you have to do is boot into the board’s BIOS and enable Intel’s VROC feature. IDG/Gordon Mah Ung You enable VROC simply by going into the Hyper M.2 PCIe card's BIOS. Once you’ve done that you can see your drives. For this demonstration, Asus used eight Intel M.2 600P SSDs. IDG/Gordon Mah Ung The VROC demo used eight Intel 512GB SSDs. But wait, you say, you can only put four drives into the Hyper M.2 card—how did we do eight drives? Just use two Hyper M.2 drives. As Coach Madden says: Boom. IDG/Gordon Mah Ung And yes, you can build a RAID with two Hyper M.2 cards. For a quick performance run, Asus used the industry-standard Iometer test as well as Crystal Disk Mark. Below is what it looks like to have a bootable Windows partition with eight M.2 drives. IDG/Gordon Mah Ung With eight Intel SSDs, this Asus X299 motherboard can hit 12GBps of transfer speed. Yes, that’s 12GBps. What’s crazy is that it’s nowhere close to the maximum that VROC supports. With 20 devices, Intel says it can, in theory, hit 128GBps. Asus officials say right now they’re seeing as high as 13GBps, and they thinks there’s more performance to be wrung out of VROC as it matures. What’s the catch? There’s always a catch, and with Intel’s VROC there’s actually multiple catches. The Asus Hyper M.2 card works perfectly fine with, say, a Samsung 960 Pro, and you could see four individual Samsung drives in RAID. If you want to use VROC to create a bootable partition, though, you can use only Intel SSDs. Here's another catch: X299 will launch with Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X CPUs, but Intel VROC will work only with Skylake-X.  What may the biggest catch is this little thing right here: IDG/Gordon Mah Ung Intel’s Virtual RAID On CPU supports up to 20 drives in RAID 0 for free, but if you want more RAID 1 or other redundant setups, you need to buy this key from Intel. No, we’re not making this up. That little dongle is a key that Intel will sell to consumers. Out of the box, if you have Intel drives, an Asus Hyper M.2, and a Skylake-X, you can build a RAID 0 partition. But if you want to enable RAID 1, RAID 5, or other RAID schemes with redundancy to protect your data, you have to buy this Intel key to enable it. If you scroll back to the first BIOS shot, you can see the “premium” mode is enabled, which means it supports the premium RAID support. How much? No one seems to know. So why would Intel put all this work into a feature and then add a surcharge which could kill its adoption? Intel officials weren’t on hand to say, but the surcharge is related to the enterprise underpinnings of the Core i9 and X299 platform, where the feature is an up-sell. Intel can’t sell it to one customer and give it away to another, can they? To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

One thing the senators — and a federal grand jury in Virginia, and the FBI — will likely find, The Wall Street Journal reports, is a documentary-style film about Turkey that Flynn's consulting firm worked on last year but never finished. The film apparently makes up the bulk of the $530,000 the Flynn Intel Group was paid by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman close to Turkey's president. Alptekin says he hired the Flynn Intel Group to help burnish Turkey's image after a failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Erdogan's subsequent crackdown. Erdogan has blamed the coup on a Turkish imam in Pennsylvania, Fethullah Gulen, and Alptekin tells the Journal he envisioned the documentary as "a small, 60 Minutes kind of a thing" to expose America to the purported dangers Gulen poses. The U.S. has so far rebuffed Erdogan's demands for Gulen's extradition. Bijan Kian, the head of Flynn Intel Group, told the film crew different things, and some of them — including Rudi Bakhtiar, a former CNN anchor, and ex-VICE News correspondent David Enders — say they were badly misled. Bakhtiar told the Journal that it quickly became clear she was working on a hit-piece on Gulen. Enders said Kian did not want his or Flynn's fingerprints on this: "He said: 'We don't want anyone to know the Flynn Intel Group has anything to do with this.'" The Journal's Dion Nissenbaum has an overview of the documentary: Alptekin paid the Flynn Intel Group in three installments, saying the money came from his firm, not Turkey's government; with each payment, Flynn's group sent back $40,000 in "consulting fees" that Alptekin insists were really rebates. The last payment was on Nov. 14, two days before Trump named Flynn as his national security adviser. The film was shelved. On Nov. 8, Flynn published an op-ed in The Hill urging the U.S. to extradite Gulen, using an image a PR firm had produced to promote the documentary. In March, after he was pushed out of the White House, Flynn belatedly registered as a foreign agent for his work with Turkey. You can read more at The Wall Street Journal. Peter Weber   Michael Flynn's firm apparently made an unfinished film targeting an Erdogan critic May 31, 2017 Watch this Edit Watch this surprisingly poignant fake documentary short about Trump's spray-tanner 2:56 a.m. ET   President Trump's unusual skin tone has led to some unkind nicknames, like "Angry Creamsicle" and "Golf Cart Cheeto." But Funny or Die didn't go in for any of those cheap laughs in its new short, The President's Sun, released Wednesday by site co-founder Adam McKay. The mock documentary introduces the world to Khoren Dartanian (Ken Davitian, Borat, The Artist), an Armenian emigrant and the only man allowed to spray-tan Trump. "I met the president back in 1987," Dartanian says. "He told me, 'Khoren, I want a tan that makes other tans feel weak. My tan wins, and their tan loses.'" The president's colorist returns to the theme of Trump's spray-tan as the source of his power later on in the video, and he ends with a surprisingly touching soliloquy on Trump's apparent use of artificial melanin. "I'm guessing there really is one person and one person only who spray-tans the president," McKay explained to Vanity Fair. "It's a very private act. I started wondering who that person is." You can watch his imaginative, briefly NSFW (language) exposition below. Peter Weber   Watch this surprisingly poignant fake documentary short about Trump's spray-tanner 2:56 a.m. Name the swamp Edit White House discloses ethics waivers for 17 Trump officials, including 4 lobbyists 2:03 a.m. ET   Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images On Wednesday night, the White House released information on the ethics waivers it has granted to White House employees working for President Trump and, in one case, Vice President Mike Pence. The 16 Trump dispensations from ethics rules he signed include visible figures like Kellyanne Conway, who was given permission to interact with clients of her polling firm, and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who can talk freely with the Republican National Committee. Six of the waivers went to White House lawyers, including counsel Don McGahn, allowing them to communicate with their former law firm, Jones Day. And four White House officials got waivers to work on issues they focused on as lobbyists: Michael Catanzaro, who worked against Obama-era environmental rules as an energy lobbyist, can oversee the office trying to repeal those rules; Shahira Knight, who left her job as a top lobbyist for Fidelity Investments, is allowed to work on tax and retirement policy; Andrew Olmem, who lobbied on bankruptcy and securities issues as a partner at the law firm Venable, can work with former clients in his role as financial policy adviser; and Joshua Pitcock, Pence's chief of staff, can work on issues that affect Indiana, which he lobbied for. Chief strategist Steve Bannon, former head of Breitbart News, was the apparent target for a blanket waiver retroactively allowing all Trump White House appointees to communicate "with news organizations on matters of broad policy" including "a former employer or former client." The White House released the waivers under pressure from the Office of Government Ethics, which requested waiver information in April for all federal agencies; along with the White House waivers released Wednesday night, information about dispensations to other federal appointees are expected to be made public in coming days. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said that the Trump administration had tried "to the furthest extent possible" to get staffers "to recuse from conflicting conduct rather than being granted waivers," so, for example, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn did not need a waiver because he voluntarily recuses himself from matters specific to Goldman Sachs, where he was a top executive. Waivers became more common under former President Barack Obama, made necessary by ethics rules he put in place to block lobbyists; over eight years, he issued 17 total waivers for White House employees, including three in the first few months, and about 70 to all federal appointees. Peter Weber   White House discloses ethics waivers for 17 Trump officials, including 4 lobbyists 2:03 a.m. It wasn't all bad Edit Graduate stuck on delayed subway gets underground ceremony 1:43 a.m. ET   A delayed train kept Jerich Marco Alcantara from his official graduation ceremony, but it didn't stop his friends, family, and fellow subway riders from ensuring he experienced some pomp and circumstance. Alcantara was set to graduate from Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing in New York City on Tuesday morning, and left early enough so he would arrive well before the ceremony began at 9:15 a.m. His Manhattan-bound train came to a stop, and "after 45 minutes, I knew I was already late, but I kept hoping that I'd at least make it to walking the stage," he told New York Magazine's Select All. As the minutes ticked by, Alcantara — donning his cap and gown — knew he wouldn't get there in time, and that's when the train came together to throw him an impromptu ceremony. "It wasn't so much an idea, but something that just happened," he said. "Everyone was getting antsy and impatient, so I figured I'd lighten the mood by thanking everyone for coming out. That led to applause, and the rest just followed." His friend created a diploma on his cellphone, a rider started to play music on his phone, and everyone watched as Alcantara received his own private ceremony. The train was ultimately delayed three hours, and by the time Alcantara arrived on campus, his fellow graduates were leaving. That didn't stop Alcantara's friends and family from holding another spontaneous ceremony, this time alone inside the auditorium. "It was a great time," Alcantara said. Catherine Garcia   Graduate stuck on delayed subway gets underground ceremony 1:43 a.m. Climate change Edit Elon Musk says he'll leave Trump advisory councils over Paris climate deal 1:07 a.m. ET   Mike Windle/Getty Images Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says if President Trump ditches the Paris Agreement, he'll ditch him. On Wednesday morning, it was reported that Trump will likely withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris Climate Agreement, signed by former President Barack Obama in 2015, which commits to reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent within a decade. Later in the day, Musk, a member of Trump's business advisory council and manufacturing jobs initiative, tweeted that he didn't know "which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain." A follower asked Musk what he'll do if Trump does leave the agreement, and Musk replied, "Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case." Trump tweeted Wednesday night that he will announce his decision at 3 p.m. Thursday in the White House Rose Garden. Musk also disagreed with Trump on his travel ban that targeted people from seven Muslim-majority countries, tweeting in February that while he opposed the ban, "advisory councils simply advise and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the administration." Catherine Garcia   Elon Musk says he'll leave Trump advisory councils over Paris climate deal 1:07 a.m. The Daily Showdown Edit Trevor Noah has a good laugh over 'covfefe,' then makes a serious point about Trump 12:17 a.m. ET   If we generously set the statute of limitations for "covfefe" jokes at 24 hours, Hillary Clinton made it in just under the wire, and so did Trevor Noah. "I don't know about America, but Donald Trump has definitely made Twitter great again — say what you want," he said on Wednesday's Daily Show. "And I'm just going to enjoy this moment," when "people were searching 'covfefe' on the internet like it was a Kim Kardashian nude." People have different theories on why President Trump left an unfinished late-night tweet ending in a nonsense word up for six hours before deleting it, and Noah offered his own, involving couch cushions, CNN, jet lag, and Obama's birth certificate. "As much as 'covfefe' was a gaffe, it must have been nice for the White House to have a Trump blunder that, for a change, didn't threaten national security," Noah said. "And more importantly, it provided welcome distraction from the fallout that came from his recent foreign trip." The Trump team, of course, just created its own narrative of the Trump trip, and it involved a lot of superlatives and Sean Spicer. "Did you see how incredible that was?" he asked after a highlight reel of Spicer obsequiousness. "Not only is the administration ignoring all the criticism of the trip, they're basically saying it was the greatest presidential trip of all time." He illustrated his point with a restaurant analogy, then explained why Spicer, with a straight face, can "say that Donald Trump now is the patron saint of diplomacy: Well, it's because he knows that there's a large part of the population — you may know them as Republicans — who believe that Donald Trump is far more credible than most news outlets." So when Trump says Obama wiretapped him, they believe it, Noah said, and "if Trump says 'covfefe,' look, they don't know what it means, but damnit, they believe it. Trump's whole political career has taught him that he doesn't need anybody's reality but his own." He ends with a bit of his own imagined reality — a Gandhi-Ellen chimera — and maybe with this ends covfefe covfever? Watch below. Peter Weber   Trevor Noah has a good laugh over 'covfefe,' then makes a serious point about Trump 12:17 a.m. Russia Sessions Edit Report: Congress investigating another possible meeting between Sessions, Russian ambassador May 31, 2017   Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Congressional investigators are looking into whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions had yet another undisclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 presidential campaign, Democratic and Republican aides and intelligence officials told CNN Wednesday. They are specifically trying to determine if a private meeting took place between Sessions and Kislyak on April 26, 2016, at Washington, D.C.'s Mayflower Hotel. That day, candidate Donald Trump gave his first major foreign policy speech at the hotel, and both Sessions, then a Republican senator from Alabama, and Kislyak attended a reception prior to his address. Sessions, who has previously failed to disclose meetings he held with Russian officials, has been asked to hand over additional information, including his schedules. After saying during his confirmation hearing that he "did not have any communications with the Russians" during the campaign, it came out that Sessions did in fact meet with Kislyak twice; Sessions later said he didn't think he needed to share this information because the meetings took place as part of his Senate duties. Catherine Garcia   Report: Congress investigating another possible meeting between Sessions, Russian ambassador May 31, 2017 tit for tat Edit Clinton, Trump taunt each other on Twitter May 31, 2017   Pool/Getty Images The election was nearly seven months ago, but the Republican and Democratic nominees can't stop getting their jabs in. President Trump got the ball rolling, tweeting Wednesday night, "Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC." Trump was likely referring to comments Clinton made earlier in the day at Recode's CodeCon, when she said she inherited "nothing" from the Democratic National Committee once she became the nominee, adding that the DNC was "bankrupt" and had data that was "mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong." Clinton hit back quickly, pouncing on Trump's weird half-finished tweet that was up for most of last night, tweeting, "People in covfefe houses shouldn't throw covfefe." Clinton was most certainly referring to the fact that there are several government investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, ensnaring many of his closest aides, including son-in-law Jared Kushner, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, and personal attorney Michael Cohen.

By Ian Allison Updated May 31, 2017 12:08 BST There were many exciting announcements at Consensus 2017, the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry's annual gathering. A particularly nice one involves the continuing marriage between a team of distributed systems experts from Cornell University and Intel SGX (software guard extensions). The latter is a set of new instructions from Intel that allows user-level code to allocate private regions of memory called enclaves. Cornell's Initiative For CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3) was demonstrating the newest version of "Teechain", an off-chain transaction protocol which uses SGX (incidentally, IC3 was not the only team touting interesting blockchain applications using SGX; watch this space for more to come). Teechain can offer state channel-like transaction rates, while addressing the problem of transaction malleability: if you have any piece of data that can be altered in the transaction without having the transaction itself becoming invalid you have a case of malleability. Payment channels offer a very powerful way to remove pressure from the blockchain by netting together transactions in series, while only having to place the opening and closing transactions on the blockchain. However, transaction malleability means it is not safe to accept a chain of unconfirmed transactions because the later transactions will depend on the hashes of the previous transactions, and those hashes can be changed, up until they are confirmed in a block. To counter the potential risk here, both parties would have to closely scan the blockchain for what the other is doing, and know what to look out for. A useful analogy would be cheque kiting, whereby a fraud can be committed when cheques are used as a form of unauthorised credit to make use of non-existent funds in a bank account. Cornell associate professor Emin Gün Sirer said: "The problem until now has been that the existing solutions require changes to the blockchain, they require that the blockchain be non-malleable. "The existing solutions are highly dependent on being able to watch that blockchain. There are rumours, claims that maybe you could get Lightning to not be dependent on this kind of thing, but I have never seen them properly specified; I have never seen them actually implemented. "So everybody wants this non-malleability. It's a good feature to have, but it's one that wasn't being deployed." Teechain, short for "trusted execution environments", uses SGX secure hardware to prevent this sort of cheque kiting, ensuring parties cannot manufacture or push old state onto the blockchain. It also achieves enormous speed ups in off chain transactions. Gün Sirer said: "We are doing UK to US transactions at a rate of about 50,000 transactions per second. So that means a transaction every 20 microseconds. That's a lot of transactions. And you can be doing any number of these in parallel. "So between any two parties it can do 50,000 tsx/s; in fact if the parties are closer together it can do even better than that, and it can do it with multiple pairs of participants at the same time." So if the solution to scaling blockchains lies in hardware, why isn't everyone using this approach? "Partly because it's non-trivial to do that transition," said Gün Sirer. "You need to have some expertise on how to build software on top of these hardware platforms, and partly because the hardware platforms are becoming ubiquitous only now." He also pointed out that signing keys to use Intel's SGX have not been given out willy-nilly; some major players in the blockchain space were denied the right because Intel did not trust them. "Essentially you will be handling people's money so you need to be vetted, in this case by the manufacturer of the hardware platform. They don't want you using their hardware for malfeasance, building Ponzi schemes, say, and they don't want you writing bad code that will lose people's money." In a nutshell, SGX hardware hardware allows the user to perform computations on the chip that are unmolested and that are guaranteed to be isolated from any and all malware. So even if there was a hacker on your machine, he or she could not get to the code that is running inside this encrypted enclave. The other key ability is called remote attestation: the chip running this code securely in this enclave can prove to a third party what exact code is running. "So you can prove that to me that you are running the code I trust and now we have a basis for building up something much more complicated. "Most complications in distributed systems stem from not knowing what the counterparties will do, and so the protocols get complex because you have to deal with anything and everything that the other party might decide to do at any time." Gün Sirer said the Teechain solution would be good for Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. "We are quite excited about this. In fact it doesn't have to be for either of those things, it could also be for SWIFT; you could use it for sending money. They could probably use some of our techniques."

(Getty Images) New Delhi: As cricket lovers get ready for the ICC Champions Trophy starting in Britain from June 1, Intel technologies has announced advanced pitch analysis by an Intel drone, profiling the bat swing using a bat sensor and a virtual reality (VR) packed experience for the fans at the stadiums. The Intel Falcon 8 Drone, equipped with HD and infrared cameras, will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match. Images captured by the drone will offer rich visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts. "We couldn't be more excited to have Intel as our 'Official Innovation Partner' of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017," said David Richardson, CEO, ICC. "The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort," Richardson added in a statement. The bat sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling in broadcast. "Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitisation and personalisation of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports," said Sandra Lopez, Vice President, Intel Sports Group. Intel will also showcase VR experience zones at The Oval and Edgbaston, to allow fans to experience facing a virtual bowler in an immersive cricketing environment. Using a head mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skill against a virtual bowler. Using the Intel Curie technology-enabled cricket bat, the player will be able to see data from their swing such as bat speed and back-lift angle as well as a simulated score from the VR session. "Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside has the potential to transform cricket across a varied audience from coaches to aspiring self-taught cricketers," said Atul Srivastava, Managing Director, Speculur which is a Bengaluru-based smart wearables and cognitive computing company. With "Speculur BatSense", aspiring cricketers can measure, track and improve their batting skills. The company plans to make 'Speculur BatSense' available in Australia, India, the United States and Britain in the second half of this year. australiaBritainchampions trophy 2017eoin morganICC Champions Trophy 2017Indiasteve smithvirat kohli First Published: May 31, 2017, 9:47 AM IST UPCOMING MATCHES ICC Champions Trophy | Match 2 | 02 Jun, 2017 AUS v NZ Birmingham AFG in WI | 1st T20I | 03 Jun, 2017 WI v AFG Basseterre St Kitts ICC Champions Trophy | Match 3 | 03 Jun, 2017 SL v SA London AFG in WI | 2nd T20I | 04 Jun, 2017 WI v AFG Basseterre St Kitts Team Rankings Test ODI T20i Rank Team Points Rating 1 India 3925 123 2 South Africa 3050 117 3 Australia 3087 100 4 England 3362 99 5 New Zealand 3114 97 FULL Ranking Rank Team Points Rating 1 South Africa 5711 122 2 Australia 5442 118 3 India 3632 117 4 New Zealand 5019 114 5 England 5129 112 FULL Ranking Rank Team Points Rating 1 New Zealand 1625 125 2 England 1579 121 3 Pakistan 2417 121 4 India 2119 118 5 South Africa 1668 111 FULL Ranking About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact us follow us on © Copyright Network18 Media and Investments Ltd 2017.

Reuters/Albert Gea With the Worldwide Developers Conference fast approaching, most are keeping their fingers crossed for the much-talked about release of an upgraded MacBook Pro. While most know that the refreshed notebook will most likely sport an Intel Kaby Lake chipset, it seems logical that an eventual MacBook Pro 2018 will come with a more powerful chipset. Coffee powered MacBook Pro in 2018? According to Apple Insider, the Cupertino company teased the potential release of a MacBook Pro 2018 backed by an Intel Coffee Lake SoC. This would be Intel’s 8th generation processor, pegged to be 30 percent faster than the current Intel Kaby Lake chipset.  Those should be angles worth looking into, though the amount of power in the Intel Coffee Lake chipsets comes a bit of a surprise. This is mainly because of the fact that Intel previously claimed that the next chips would offer performance improvement of only 15 percent.  Intel brands the Intel Coffee Lake as an optimisation of the current Intel Kaby Lake. They are targeting the second half of 2017 to release these new chips.  Going back to the fate of future MacBook Pros, the release date of the Intel Coffee Lake will be crucial. Most know that the Intel Skylake-backed MacBook Pro 2016 garnered disappointment. A lot of it had to do with the timing of the release of the Intel Kaby Lake chipset, something that only stabilised earlier this year.  The 16 GB RAM problem is back While the added power to a MacBook Pro 2018 should be something, there may be bumps ahead. The problem rekindles an issue tied to the MacBook Pro 2016 – the RAM.  In the event that the MacBook Pro 2018 comes with Intel Coffee Lake, it will not include support for LPDDR4. This means that such would allow quantities of memory to be used without requiring the use of a new RAM controller. Instead, it may be best for the MacBook Pro 2018 to consider using the Intel Cannon Lake. These are chipsets produced using a 10-nm process – something that offers a reduction in power usage. The only problem is that there is no certainty when these chips will be shipped.  For now, it would be best to focus on whether an upgraded MacBook Pro 2017 will be shown at the WWDC 2017 on June 5. A launch could hamper the regular schedule of the Cupertino company and may eventually dictate when to expect a MacBook Pro 2018.

Nier: Automata sales hit 1.5m units HTC and Intel team up to bring WiGig wireless tech to Vive by Katharine Byrne Tuesday, May 30th 2017 at 11:36AM BST Print this page Email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Google Share on LinkedIn HTC and Intel have teamed up to bring Intel's WiGig wireless VR tech to the Vive, the companies announced today at Computex. HTC will also be taking on manufacturing duties for the WiGig wireless VR accessory. This isn't the first wireless accessory that will be coming to the Vive, as TPCast's wireless upgrade pack is currently due to go on sale in Q2 this year. TPCast was one of the companies borne out of HTC's ViveX accelerator program, and its $249 tether-less upgrade kit is designed to sit on top of the main head strap. Judging by the prototype unveiled at this year's Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona, it seems Intel's WiGig accessory will be incorporated into the headset in much the same way, but we'll have to wait until E3 before the company reveals exact details.  Either way, it should dramatically improve the headset's overall VR experience. Based on the 802.11ad standard (which is about 11x faster than 802.11n), Intel's WiGig tech works solely in the interference-free 60GHz band, allowing for high throughput and low latency in both directions between a PC and Vive headset.  This should mean video quality with a latency time of under 7ms in any environment, with HTC stating it should also support multiple users in the same space – something that will be good news for anyone interested in setting up location-based VR facilities.  More details are coming soon, but those heading to E3 in a few weeks time will be able to see HTC's proof of concept on display at its booth.  Advertisement Tags: intel , virtual reality , htc vive Follow us on Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

With the focus firmly on enhancing the tournament experience for fans, players, media and broadcasters, the innovations will use data, analytics and visualisation and ensure cricket remains at the forefront of technological advancements. The technology being introduced at the ICC Champions Trophy includes an Intel drone that will provide advanced pitch analysis, a bat sensor powered by an Intel Curie module that will allow for profiling of the bat swing and a VR experience for fans at the stadium. "We couldn't be more excited to have Intel as our Official Innovation Partner of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017," said David Richardson, Chief Executive of the ICC. "The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort." Intel Sports Group vice president Sandra Lopez highlighted the role of technology in transforming the way sport is played and viewed. With higher levels of digitisation, Intel is in a unique position to enable the sports industry to capture and analyse data to uncover and respond to new insights in real time. "Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitisation and personalization of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports," Lopez added. In a first at the Champions Trophy, the Intel Falcon 8 Drone, equipped with HD and infrared cameras will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match. Images captured by the drone will offer rich visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health, and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts. The new bat sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology that can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games at the 2017 Champions Trophy, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling in broadcast. Analytics from the sensor will be available for fans to analyse.

(hpq) to sell Windows laptops running on its newest mobile chips. Qualcomm had announced in December that it was working with Microsoft to create a version of Windows 10 that could run on the Snapdragon 835 chip that typically is used in cutting-edge smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S8. Windows PCs usually run on Intel's x86 line of chips. The move marks the counter punch, perhaps, to Intel getting into one of Qualcomm's main lines of mobile chip business. Intel started making its own wireless modem chips to compete with Qualcomm, and last year signed up Apple (aapl) as a customer. About half of the new models of the iPhone 7 contained Intel modems instead of those made by Qualcomm. Both Qualcomm and Intel (intc) face challenges finding growth as their largest markets mature. Intel has been dealing with the declining PC market for years and has since targeted higher growth markets like cloud data centers, wireless modems, and smart devices, or the Internet of things. Qualcomm is seeing mobile device growth slow and also is turning to the Internet of things and data centers for growth, along with the new push into Windows laptops. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. At the Computex trade show in Taiwan on Wednesday, Qualcomm unveiled its three PC partners. Windows laptops running on the Snapdragon chips would gain the benefits of longer battery life and wireless modem capability to get online via mobile networks at up to 1 gigabit-per-second speeds, Qualcomm said. That's exactly what many PC users want, according to Jeff Meredith, senior vice president at Lenovo. "Today’s PC users want solutions that provide better battery life and the ability to connect anytime, anywhere, while also being lighter and more portable than any other laptop currently available," he said in a statement. The laptops will be able to run any Windows software, including Microsoft (msft) Office, Qualcomm (qcom) said. But none of the laptop models was ready for a public unveiling. That will happen in the second half of this year, Qualcomm executives have said. Just how well the new Snapdragon-based laptops will run Windows apps is a key question, because poor performance killed earlier efforts to run Windows on chips like Qualcomm's that use ARM Holdings' basic designs. On the new laptops, some programs will run with code that is completely compatible with ARM, but many more will have to use an emulation mode, notes analyst Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy. "This emulation results in a performance hit of unknown percent and may be one of the major make or break points for Windows on ARM," Moorhead wrote in a post on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Intel was showing off connected Windows 10 laptops at Computex running on both its CPU and wireless modem chips. Acer, Dell and many other PC makers are on board with its connected laptop push, Intel said.

The Best Choice Awards, established in 2002, are organized by Computex Taiwan and honor products that display excellence in innovation, functionality, and market potential. ASUS Zenbo ASUS Zenbo won three awards at Computex 2017: Best Choice of the Year Award, Best Choice Golden Award, and Computex d&i Award. Zenbo is the first commercially available home robot designed to provide assistance, entertainment, and companionship to families. Zenbo is a fun and educational playmate for kids, entertaining them with interactive storytelling and learning games that foster their creativity and logical thinking skills. As a hands-free household keeper, Zenbo enriches the home with a broad range of skills that make life easier and more enjoyable. He can control many smart home devices, assist in the kitchen by reading recipes out loud and function as a voice-controlled timer, serve as a family photographer with his built-in camera, and operate as a home security camera to give homeowners peace of mind when they are away. Additionally, Zenbo helps senior family members safeguard their health and well-being by monitoring the home for emergency situations – such as falls – and immediately respond to them by notifying family members. During emergencies, Zenbo can assist through a feature, developed in collaboration with the National Police Agency in Taiwan, which enables families to contact their local police department and to speak with an officer using Zenbo’s built-in video calling. He also helps seniors enjoy a connected digital life by making it easy to accomplish online tasks, such as making video calls, using social media and shopping. Best Choice Award and Computex d&i Award winners ROG Horus GK2000 RGB ROG Horus GK2000 RGB mechanical gaming keyboard has a premium, high-quality feel and features CNC-processed aluminum accents with a special topcoat finish.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Intel Brings The Fight to AMD With New X-Series Processors Haamiz Ahmed 1 day ago A few weeks ago, AMD revealed an ace up its sleeve – the 16 core, 32 thread ThreadRipper. Aimed at the high-end desktop (HEDT) market, the processor was meant only for the PC enthusiasts, software developers or CAD designers. At Computex, Intel revealed its own HEDT platform, stepping it up a notch. The new platform uses the X299 chipset with X-series of processors. The biggest and baddest of them all, Intel Core i9-7980XE will come with a whopping 18 cores and 36 threads. Unlike the consumer friendly version, the HEDT platform are more of a “prestige part” thing. Regular Joes won’t be able to make full use of the processors threads and cores but software developers or video streamers can. Intel is aiming for them with the X-series. Kaby Lake-X Starting at the bottom, we have the Intel Core i5-7640X and i7-7740X. These two fall under the Kaby Lake-X sub category. These two are very similar to the regular Kaby Lake counterparts with four cores and four threads (or eight threads with the i7), two memory channels and 16 PCIe 3. The difference is in the power draw and clock rates. TDP has gone up from 91 W (non X) to 112 W (Kaby Lake-X). The base clock for the i5-7640X is now 4.0 GHz, up from 3.8 GHz with a turbo clock of 4.2 GHz. The i7-7740X also has a slightly higher base clock of 4.3 GHz, up from 4.2 GHz with a turbo clock of 4.5 GHz. Skylake-X Moving up you get the 6, 8 and 10 core processors. They’re called the Skylake-X processors and feature double the memory channels compared the Kaby Lake-X counterparts as well as a higher power draw of 140W. Another feature in the Skylake-X processors is Turbo Boost Max 3.0 (limited to i7-7820X and i9-7900X) which boosts the base clock even further than Turbo Boost 2.0. PCIe 3.0 lanes also increase from 16 to 28 for the i7-7800X, 7820X. The i9-7900X, however, gets 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes. The final 4 processors, i9-7920X, 7940X, 7960X and 7980XE feature 12, 14, 16 and 18 cores respectively (double the thread count). They will also have a TDP of 165W. The rest of the details weren’t revealed by Intel for now. All of these processors use the same LGA 2066 socket which can give you a strong upgrade path if you start with the lower end processors. All of the processors will be have unlocked multipliers, which makes them easier to overclock. Additionally the chips will Intel Optane Memory, up to three PCIe/NVMe SSDs, 8 SATA ports, and 10 USB 3.1 generation 1 ports. No Intention of Backing Down The new series shows that Intel isn’t changing its strategy because of AMD. The 8 core i7-7820-X costs $599 which is a $100 higher than AMD’s corresponding processor. The price premium is still there. One area where Intel has the advantage is the single threaded performance where AMD lags behind. The Intel X299 motherboards and chips will be available in coming weeks.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

Images captured by the drone will offer visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health, and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts.   Bat Sensor This one is a new solution. In this, a sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology that can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Former English Captain turned commentator, Nasser Hussain, said “ technology has and will continue to impact cricket in a lot of ways positively. Player performance, Game strategy, adjudication and fan experiences will all change with the introduction of new technologies to the sport.”   Virtual Reality At the stadium,   Intel is also creating Virtual Reality (VR) experience zones for spectators as well players. Using a head-mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skill against a virtual bowler.   Intel ICC 2017 First Published : Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - 11:07 <a href='//ade.themobileindian.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a2df830c&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='//ade.themobileindian.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=2&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a2df830c' border='0' alt='' /></a> Advertisement Similar News Top 5 Smartphones under Rs 25000: May 2017 Travelling to Indian airports, Avoid Reliance Jio Nikon launched Coolpix W300, claims to be freeze and shock proof Will Essential smartphone be launched in India?

The Worldwide Developers Conference event to be held in San Jose, CA on June 5 is said to the be venue for the announcement. While this may sound exciting to Apple fans, perhaps looking at what the future might bring for the MacBook 2018 might give them some more enjoyment. Intel just announced yesterday at the Computex 2017 event in Taiwan that is has successfully tested its latest processor architecture. The company registered a 30-percent performance improvement on its Coffee Lake processors. This performance boost, compared to the current Kaby Lake lineup is quite impressive in the scheme of things. In addition to announcing the said performance gains, Intel also said that it will make the Coffee Lake processors available in the market as early as the second half of 2017. MacBook lineup (via engadget.com) This could mean that MacBook 2018 releases will be able to take advantage of the new processors’ performance gains. This and longer battery life due to the improved efficiency of the new processors. At the moment, the current MacBook laptops are still on older Intel processors, mostly with Skylake architecture. Many consumers expected Apple to release the MacBook Pro on Kaby Lake processors. Unfortunately, the availability made it impossible at the time. This is why Apple is reported to be planning a release of Kaby Lake-powered MacBook laptops next month. Having an updated MacBook 2018 release is a welcomed change especially for hardcore Mac fans. For now, it is still too soon to tell whether Intel will be able to deliver its promise for the Coffee Lake processors. Last year, the company experienced some major delays in the release of the Kaby Lake processors that inevitably affected the MacBook Pro.

Both solutions offer wireless connectivity to the HTC Vive VR headset and the host computer. In addition to these two, HTC has partnered with Intel to bring the very first WiGig Wi-Fi technology to the HTC Vive. According to Digital Trends, Intel has announced in yesterday’s Computex 2017 opening that it is working closely with HTC to bring faster wireless connectivity to the Vive VR headset. In the presentation, Intel did a first public demo of the WiGig Wi-Fi technology with the Vive. The new wireless connectivity technology, otherwise known as 802.11ad, offers transmit rates of up to 7Gbps over various frequency bands. This rate is more than enough to carry data across the host computer and first generation VR headsets. Furthermore, the bandwidth of the WiGig system can even support uncompressed data transmission with as little latency as possible. TPCast (via pcauthority.com) Although there are third-party wireless VR headset interfaces available in the market, like the TPCAST and KwikVR Wireless Kit, the Intel WiGig interface offers much faster connectivity. Furthermore, these third party interfaces rely heavily on compression algorithms in order to transmit massive amounts of data. This affects video quality to certain extent. On other notes, the WiGig interface will make use of DisplayLink XR Codec. This means that there will be some measure of data compression involved. Nevertheless, it would still be less than the compression rates offered by current wireless VR solutions. Unfortunately, at the moment, it is not clear yet when exactly the device will hit the market. However, Intel and HTC claimed that it will be ready sometime in early 2018. As for the price, perhaps consumers would have to wait until Intel and HTC makes to official announcement later this year.

If we were to give a brief history of the CPU space in the personal computer (PC) market, we can summarise it as follows: Intel had a monopoly on the PC space since at least 2006 and nothing from only rival AMD has even come close to dethroning Intel. Intel allegedly took advantage of its position to keep the price of computing performance high. It wasn’t until AMD got its act together and released Ryzen, a new CPU that democratised computing power, that Intel started to get worried. When it comes to computing performance, two things matter a great deal, core count and IPC efficiency. The latter relates to the efficiency with which each core can perform calculations. With Ryzen, AMD doubled the core count compared to Intel’s offering in the same price range. This move, despite Ryzen’s lower IPC, suddenly resulted in customers having dramatically more computing power at their fingertips. Of course, there are some caveats, most notably with regards to Ryzen’s gaming performance, but these are being sorted out. Intel enjoyed a monopoly for a long time, but it also did good work in that time. Intel’s processors are still the best overall option for most high-end consumers, but AMD wasn’t that far behind. High-end processors, especially in serious workstations and servers, is Intel’s core strength. It had to do something to counter Ryzen and it looks like Skylake-X and the Core i9 is the answer. The Core i9 lineup looks like this: Intel Core i9 7900X – 10C/20T @ 3.3 GHz (TurboBoost 3.0 up to 4.5 GHz) for $999 Intel Core i9 7920X – 12C/24T for $1,199 Intel Core i9 7940X – 14C/28T for $1,399 Intel Core i9 7960X – 16C/32T for $1,699 Intel Core i9 7980XE – 18C/36T for $1,999 Details of only the Core i9 7900X are available. As it stands, the base model core i9 7900X will have 10 cores and 20 threads, operate from 3.3 GHz to 4.5 GHz and have a 140 W TDP. You’ll get 44 PCIe lanes and 13.75 MB of L3 cache as well. The 12-core model goes up to 165 W and the rest might be rated higher. One can extrapolate on the specifications of the rest of the lineup based on this. The top of the line Core i9 7980XE is claimed to be the first CPU ever to cross the one teraflop mark. Rounding off the Skylake-X lineup are the Intel i7-7800X and the i7 7820X. These are 6C/12T and 8C/16T parts clocked at 3.5 GHz and 3.6 GHz respectively. These will be priced at $389 and $599 respectively. Also included in the lineup are two Kaby Lake X processors. These are the i5 7640X and the i7 7740X. Both of these are 4-core parts, where the i7 supports hyper-threading, which means that it supports 8 threads. These CPUs are priced at $242 and $339 respectively. These processors are rated at 112 W TDP. As you can see, Intel hasn’t dropped the prices or increased the core counts on its mid-range and higher end processors. These processes will be released on a new LGA-2066 socket, but it will apparently be backward compatible with the 2011 socket. While all these processors are overclockable, the ace up Intel’s sleeve is that the cores on Skylake-X at the very least can be individually overclocked. This is something that AMD can’t do yet. Oh, and did we mention that Skylake-X will come with a bundled liquid cooler? At that asking price, Intel had better provide one anyway. For now, let the information sink in. We’re getting a brand new processor lineup and a slightly revamped architecture. We’ll delve into the details of the new CPUs at a later date. Until then, be sure you stay tuned for more of our coverage on Computex 2017.

And it has, with a new line-up of Core i5, i7 and a new i9 with as many as 18 cores and 36 hyperthreading threads. They'll be phenomenally fast, of course, but will have a price tag that puts any other PC component you could think of to shame. Introduced at Computex in Taipei, Intel's latest CPUs use a new X299 chipset and new 2066-pin socket. CPUs with from four to 18 physical cores are on offer, so there's a huge range of options at — a huge range of prices. The cheapest quad-core Core i5-7640X (with no hyperthreading) is a $US242 part, for example, while the top of the line 10-core (and 20 thread) i9-7900X is an eye-bleeding $US999. Image: Intel Those 4, 6, 8, and 10-core chips will launch first around the world, and 12, 14, 16, and 18-core CPUs will follow soon enough. All the chips have comparatively very high TDP thermal thresholds, so you'll need to invest in a gutsy water or air cooler to let these Core X processors run free without throttling back under load. Where Intel's mainstream desktop CPUs top out at around 90 Watts, these ones will hit 140 — and Intel's recommending water cooling as standard for the first time. Intel says it's by far the most extreme desktop processor it's ever produced, and it's taken a page from the book of its server-grade Xeon chips to put the new hardware together. Compared to its previous generation of "most powerful ever" Extreme chips, the company is quoting a 10 and 15 per cent jump in multi- and single-threaded performance respectively. Ryzen must have Intel spooked, because AMD's massively multi-core chips represented the first time that 8-core CPUs hit the mainstream desktop PC market. AMD's Ryzen is a superlative multi-core performer and brings that "mega-tasking" multi-tasking — gaming, streaming, saving content — to the mainstream in a way that the company hasn't seen success with in years. It has a new server and high-end desktop CPU, too, called Threadripper — up to 16 cores and 32 threads — and likely at a competitive price. Intel also took the opportunity to hint at its 8th-gen Core processors, still a few weeks away from an official unveiling — expect up to 30 per cent better performance, it says, bringing quad-core and eight-thread performance to its mainstream Core i7-7500U equivalent mobile chips which are currently only dual-core. Laptops could be getting a significant speed boost in the near future. Gizmodo traveled to Computex as a guest of Dell.

Because you had no competitionfor 10+ years you have been drip feeding consumers with minimal, yet expensive, upgrades each generation. Now that AMD are making a comeback you up your game and announce a crap load of new chips. Yes, its "business", but it doesnt stop you from being opportunistic, gouging arseholes. Reply 2 miak @miak May 31, 2017, 1:28pm Yeah there's a reason I'm still running with my 6-year old i5 2500k ... their incremental upgrades have generally been pathetic and I still have no problem running freshly released games at stable frame rates. I keep telling myself "next generation I'll upgrade" and then change my mind when I see I'm still only gaining 10-15% in raw power, unless I want to go to an i7. At this rate, I'll be using my current setup until it finally breaks down (and it's somewhat surprising it hasn't done that already). Reply 0 yld_1 @yld_1 May 31, 2017, 2:15pm +1 to the i5 2500K I have the i7 2600K the top of the line Kaby Lake has only a 25% increase in power and better power 25% in 6 years? WTF Reply 0 Cody @ynefel May 31, 2017, 2:37pm To be fair, we're practically at the speed limit of silicon. There's not a lot of extra speed to be had without overhauling the way we make CPUs in a major way - carbon, etc. That's why they're moving towards more and more cores - 4-5Ghz has been the magic ceiling for standard CPUs for a long time - hell, even late model Pentium 4s were getting close to 4Ghz, and how many years ago was that? And extra cores are great, but unless you're utilising software that's written to take full advantage of extra cores, or you're doing something like VMs where you can allocate specific cores, it doesn't benefit the average user. Until more software is made to utilise the extra cores. Last edited May 31, 2017 2:38 pm Reply 2 soldant @soldant May 31, 2017, 3:21pm This. People might remember back to the early-mid 2000s when CPUs basically stagnated until dual core CPUs came out. The limitations aren't just about complacency. Also AMD had its own period of complacency where it kept churning out comparatively worse CPUs. They share some of the blame. Reply 0 Cody @ynefel May 31, 2017, 1:33pm Yes and no. These CPUs aren't intended for gamers or average desktop users. Hell, 99% of the PC users in the world would have zero need for anything above a quad core. These are for high end users - people using virtual machines, doing video encoding, streaming, compiling, etc. Everything Intel is overpriced, but you also have to realise anything above a quad core is going to start costing a lot more. I'm still using a six core 3930K I originally bought because I thought it being six core meant it would destroy everything at the time. Then I learnt it was getting beaten in gaming benchmarks by my friend's 4770K quad core with less L3 cache. It all depends on your intended use. If you're just a desktop user/gamer, you'll get absolutely nothing out of anything more than a bog quad core i7. I wouldn't get too offended, you're not missing out on much unless you're a super-high end user.

Just food for thought. I know the Australian market is heavily regulated by the ACCC to encourage competition between brands. Reply 0 os42 @os42 May 31, 2017, 4:16pm To be fair, there's not been much reason to own a hyperthreaded 18-core CPU for gaming until recent years - a lot of games up to 2014-15 were still CPU-capped by their main thread. I remember deliberately skimping a little on my CPU for my current rig (admittedly nearly five years old by now) by going for the 3570k because the only difference between it and the first step into the i7 range was about $200 for hyperthreading, and I've only noticed it being much of an issue in the last 12 months or so. Reply 0 vaegrand @vaegrand May 31, 2017, 1:18pm I haven't really been paying attention. Do we have confirmation on the socket set? Might be nearly time for an upgrade (my 4771 is getting a little long in the tooth). Reply 0 Cody @ynefel May 31, 2017, 1:25pm I was looking at upgrading my 4790K when Skylake originally dropped and promptly decided not to. Even moving up to 6th/7th gen Intel and DDR4, there honestly wasn't an earth-shattering performance benefit to be had for dropping almost a grand on a new CPU/mobo/RAM. Depending on what your needs are, you'd be better off saving your money. If you were on a 1st gen i7 or something, that'd be a different story. Reply 0 vaegrand @vaegrand May 31, 2017, 1:58pm Its more than just the performance though. I live in Alice, which means that heat is a constant issue when it comes to parts wear. Even with a pretty good single bin water cooling unit I still see issues with keeping parts cool and thats before overclock. More powerful parts means running cooler due to lower overall cpu loading. Reply 0 Cody @ynefel May 31, 2017, 2:16pm Yeah, that makes sense. Just need to be careful you don't catch a tick instead of a tock. 4770Ks were actually fairly warm compared to the 4790K, which was the Haswell refresh. I hear the Kaby Lakes are better on the heat front compared to Skylake too. Lucky being in Melbourne, the central heat would probably wreak havoc on my water loop. Reply 0 vaegrand @vaegrand May 31, 2017, 3:47pm It gets so hot that even with the pump on high I experience throttling (though my 970 isn't helping). Thankfully winter sees a flip, but if I decide that I wanna have a day on the computer it still sees a bit of slowdown after a few hours. Reply 0 yld_1 @yld_1 May 31, 2017, 2:17pm There really is no need unless your constantly hitting 100% and believe that extra 10% boost will be enough?

Reply 6 fermian @fermian May 31, 2017, 6:13pm Is Intel's top new extreme crazy way-more-than-four core CPU being US$999 especially noteworthy? That's about $1350 in AUDs right now, though of course we'll have to pay GST and Australia Tax... But the i7-6950X came out last year and still costs $2400. The i7-6900K is $1299. The i7-980X from 2010 was US$999. They always have a top-dog zany super-CPU and it always costs US$999. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Funsters port WannaCrypt to Commodore, Cisco, Nintendo and Tesla 41 Personal Tech Intel gives the world a Core i9 desktop CPU to play with Chipzilla's Compute Card also comes into focus in four models 31 May 2017 at 02:15, Simon Sharwood Intel's Core range of CPUs now comes in a new "family" and has a new upper limit. Unveiled at the Computex trade show in Taiwan, the new family is dubbed the “Intel Core X-series processors family”. One member of the family is a the Core i9 Extreme Edition, which takes the Core range's upper limit from a “7” to a “9”. The Register imagines the next step might be a Core 11 and Spinal Tap jokes. But we digress. The new Skylake-based X-series starts at the i5, compared to the i3 at the bottom of the barrel for plain old Core CPUs. Here's the new lineup. Intel's new Core-X CPU range But wait, there's more! Intel says before too much time has passed it will add models with 18, 16, 14, and 12 cores. For now, Chipzilla is pitching the range at enthusiasts and gamers. But an 18-core, 36-thread beast may well excite some workstation buyers especially when paired with Intel's new X299 motherboard chipset as that product offers up to 24 PCI Express lanes, 14 USB ports (10 of them USB 3.0) eight SATA slots and the ability to handle RAID 0,1, 5 or 10. Chipzilla's also shown off partners' efforts to employ more about the Compute Card it showed off earlier this year. The 94.5 mm x 55 mm x 5 mm computer will come in the four configurations below. Partners signed up to play with the device include Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sharp, Seneca Data, InFocus, Contec, Dtx, TabletKiosk and Pasuntech.

Intel expects the Compute Card to go wherever small form factor computers are required. The Register last year tested an Intel Compute Stick, but didn't review it because we found almost nothing nice to say. Above all, the device was just inconvenient because it was so big that your correspondent's telly needed an adjacent HDMI slot to be empty if the Stick was going to fit. Intel thoughtfully supplied a short HDMI cable with the stick, but that just made it dangle unpleasantly. Hopefully Intel's partners will make that problem go away this time around – and they should because the Card connects over USB-C, a rather more flexible interface than HDMI! ® Tips and corrections 41 Comments MORE Intel Processors Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Intel, Samsung join Apple, FTC firing squad against rival Qualcomm Two more chip heavyweights enter the patent fray 4 Comments Apple weans itself off Intel with 'more ARM chips' for future Macs Cook bakes up another Chipzilla-free component for fruity computers – report 33 Comments Sysadmin 'trashed old bosses' Oracle database with ticking logic bomb' Always ensure the office laptop gets returned 68 Comments Oracle gets to Wercker, dines on container biz Larry goes Dutch on Docker support 3 Comments Oracle crushes Apiary's hope in slightly awkward email to customers We OWN you, WE review the products, WE say what stays 19 Comments A quiet market?

The company announced today at Computex 2017 that it has partnered with Intel to create a "wireless VR accessory" for the Vive HMD. That accessory will rely on WiGig, the wireless tech Intel created to let you connect basically everything to your PC without having to plug in a single wire, and is expected to work with existing Vive HMDs. This is how HTC described the accessory in its announcement: The WiGig technology, based on 802.11ad standard, works solely in the interference- free 60GHz band, and enables high throughput and low latency in both directions, from the PC to HMD and from HMD to PC. This means pristine video quality with <7ms latency in any environment, supporting multiple users sharing the same space. All of this results in the seamless wireless VR with the Vive! The extent to which the wireless VR is "seamless" depends on how much lower than 7ms latency HTC manages to get. Low latency is crucial to VR--too much can hurt your sense of immersion at best and make you feel sick at worst. The good news is we might not have to wait long to find out how well this accessory works: HTC said it's going to show off a proof of concept when it heads to E3 from June 13-15. In the meantime, we can take comfort in knowing HTC isn't the only company that's chasing that wireless VR dream. AMD acquired an Austin startup called Nitero for its wireless XR technology in April, and we recently went hands-on with Sixa's Rivvr wireless VR system. Oh, and Oculus is also working on a self-contained, untethered HMD with Project Santa Cruz. Hopefully we can bid adieu to all these wires sooner than later.

POST A COMMENT 8 Comments View All Comments boeush - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link So, here's what I don't get. If these wireless VR headsets are intended to display video content rendered on an external graphics card, then let's see: 90 [FPS - 'meh', I'd rather see closer to 120, but OK] x (1080 x 1200 x 2 [kinda 'meh', IMO, but OK]) x 24 [bpp - no HDR, sorry] =~ 5.6 Gbps WiGig is only capable of up to 7 Gbps (under ideal conditions, and only by simultaneously using 60, 5, and 2.4 Ghz bands in a tri-band configuration.) So how are they planning on "supporting multiple users sharing the same space"? (And what is 'multiple' - do they seriously mean more than 2 ?!?) Sure, they can try to compress the hell out of the video stream. But intensive decompression workloads would help kill the battery of the headset even faster than the constant-on WiGig streaming, video display to both eyes, and audio to both ears would be doing already... Also, what is 'XR'? Reply MrHollow - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link Well i think they meant multiple users but with a different PC and HMD and not one PC and multiple HMDs. Reply boeush - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link That wasn't the point: the point is all those users would be sharing the same spectrum in the same room, and within that room there are only so many bits that can be flying around at any given time (any more, and packets would be getting dropped due to signal interference.) Reply yhselp - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link Isn't there some compression happening along the way? HDMI 2.0 supports 4K@60fps with HDR, which by your calculations would require 28.8 Gbps, and yet HDMI 2.0 only allows for 18 Gbps. Is there something I'm missing? Reply boeush - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link Not sure how you get to the 28.8 number. 3840 x 2160 (4K) x 60 (Hz) * 30 (bpp, at 10 bpc) =~ 15 Gbps. At 12 bpc, it would be still only ~18 Gbps... Reply BoyBawang - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link There is one they called Foveated Rendering. The resolution is increased only on the small area where your eyeballs are focused. The rest is rendered in low resolution. Big bandwith & CPU saver. Needs an eyeball tracker to work. Reply boeush - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link A very rapid eyeball tracker, at that... (saccades are super-fast, and the eyes are constantly jittering on a small angular scale and at a very rapid rate that we aren't consciously aware of, and then there's the whole issue of head-motion on top of it all...) Insofar as foveated rendering goes, my impression is that the point was mostly to reduce load on the GPU -- though I can certainly see how it might be leveraged for video signal compression (still, this kind of a non-uniform compression scheme would be pretty novel, as far as I know.) And I'd still question the ultimate efficiency of any such compression vs. the impact on visual quality (and attendant nausea-inducing lag or compression artifacts...) Reply Luminair - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link They can compress it however they want, including with AV1 http://aomedia.org/about-us/ Video compression/decompression is very resource intensive, which is why Intel and Nvidia like to talk about how well they can do it in every new product they try to sell you. Which codec they pick is a matter of cost and market size. I assume they'll pick h264 for the demo because common off the shelf parts can do it.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Teases 8th-Generation Core Processors The chip giant has repackaged some old claims around its upcoming eighth-generation Core processors to make them seem new. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 30, 2017 at 8:00PM In addition to launching its new Skylake-X processor family for the high-end desktop market, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently teased its upcoming eighth-generation Core processor for the notebook market. The company had previously said that it expected that its eighth-generation Core processors to deliver a ">15%" performance improvement over its currently available seventh-generation Core processors. Now, Intel claims that its eighth-generation Core processors deliver "more than 30% improvement performance" relative to those seventh-generation Core chips. Image source: Intel. Let's dissect Intel's claims and then put this announcement into broader business context. Moving the goalposts In a footnote accompanying the performance claim, Intel said that this 30% performance improvement compares the Core i7-7500U notebook processor with an unnamed eighth-generation Core i7 chip. Both chips have a value known as PL1 ("power level 1") set to 15 watts. Per Intel, PL1 is "a threshold for average power that will not exceed." In other words, both chips are set to consume the same amount of power on average. The i7-7500U, Intel says, has two cores and four hardware threads (two per core) with a turbo frequency of 3.5GHz. The unnamed eighth-generation Core chip has four cores and eight hardware threads, with a turbo of "up to 4GHz." The performance lift within the same power envelope is certainly nice, but it's important to note that when Intel put its original ">15%" claim out there, it compared seemingly the same unnamed eighth-generation Core processor with a seventh-generation Core chip known as the Core i7-7600U. The 7600U runs at a maximum turbo speed of 3.9GHz, an 11.4% boost compared to the maximum turbo on the 7500U. Indeed, it's clear that the fundamental characteristics of the eighth-generation Core chip haven't improved since the last time that Intel talked about it -- it just picked a weaker seventh-generation Core chip to compare this upcoming eighth-generation Core notebook chip with. Eighth-generation Core still looks good Although I'm not a fan of Intel moving the goalposts to try to paint its upcoming eighth-generation Core chips in a better light, I do think that what Intel has cooking with its eighth-generation Core processors looks quite good. If Intel delivers its eighth-generation Core processors this holiday, as the company claims it will, then that will mark two years in a row of the company delivering new, meaningfully improved processor families for the personal computer market. Now, Intel has had it a bit easier than it did in the past, as it is delivering refined versions of the same basic Skylake architecture and 14-nanometer manufacturing technologies to enable this improvement, rather than radical changes in either the chip architecture or in the underlying manufacturing technology. As I've noted before, I'm waiting to see if Intel can continue this momentum in the years ahead, especially as the company faces a transition to newer, more complex 10-nanometer manufacturing technologies and brand-new chip architectures. If Intel can, then I won't be able to help but become incrementally more enthusiastic about the company's execution and ultimately its long-term business prospects. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Stocks That Look a Lot Like Intel 30 Years Ago Will Proofpoint, SunPower, and Axon Enterprise transform their industries the way Intel did? Rich Duprey, Daniel Miller, and Matthew DiLallo (TMFCop) May 30, 2017 at 6:24PM Thirty years ago, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the world's largest computer chip maker, a position it still holds today, but it was on the cusp of transforming itself and the industry in ways unforeseen at the time. We've asked three top Motley Fool contributors to identify a company they think can similarly change the way they're seen in their industry, and how their industry can transform as well. Read on to find out why they think Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT), SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR), and Axon Enterprises (NASDAQ:AAXN) sit on the threshold of change. Intel changed the world, these stocks could do the same. Image Source: Getty Images. Solution for growing threats Daniel Miller (Proofpoint, Inc.): When you think of Intel 30 years ago, you conjure the image of a young technology company with innovative products. Intel's chips would bring processing and memory capacities that helped usher in the worldwide adoption of PCs. One company that also conjures the image of a young tech company that could alter the landscape of its industry is cyber security company Proofpoint, Inc. PFPT data by YCharts. For those who haven't heard of Proofpoint, it's a security-as-a-service provider with data protection solutions. Those services and solutions include threat protection, data governance, and secure communication, among many others. Just recently, the company launched its Digital Risk Defense service, which, according to Proofpoint, is the industry's first integrated phishing and fraud defense solution across critical digital channels. The good news for investors? The cyber security company has high renewal rates (90%-plus last year), and it consistently ropes in new clients and consumers. Take the first quarter of 2017 as an example: Its total revenue was up 43% year over year, its billings were up a similar 40%, and it nearly tripled its cash flow. More good news for investors: These problems aren't going away. Email threats remain a huge concern, with over 17,642 organizations victimized in the U.S. alone, according to Proofpoint's Analyst Day presentation in 2016. These concerns will only elevate with the expanding mobile and social networking presence in our lives. You'll have to pay a premium to own shares of Proofpoint, but it's a small price to pay if it can indeed change the industry's landscape as Intel did 30 years ago.  Image source: Getty Images. The Intel of solar technology Matt DiLallo (SunPower): While the solar industry has been around for decades, it's just starting to gain traction in the mainstream. Fueled by climate-change worries and economics, solar installations around the globe are growing rapidly, with America's installed capacity, for example, doubling last year alone. Meanwhile, there's plenty of growth up ahead, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, for example, anticipating that the nation's utility-scale solar generation capacity could increase another 48% by the end of next year. Despite that stunning growth, solar would still only account for about 1% of the country's total utility-scale electric generation. While that massive addressable market alone is a big-time opportunity for leading solar technology company SunPower, what makes it stand apart from the crowd is its Intel-like innovation focus. That drive has enabled the company to build products that are light-years ahead of the commoditized components of its rivals when it comes to energy efficiency. For example, its Maxeon solar cells harness substantially more of the sun's power than a conventional panel, with its latest iteration expected to produce 70% more energy over the first 25 years than competitors' products. The company's efficiency lead should continue to widen in the future thanks to its investments in research and development that are driving improvements in energy production and cost. It's SunPower's focus on always setting the bar higher that reminds me so much of Intel. It's why I think its stock could one day rival the tech giant's success and be a powerful value creator for investors.  Image source: Axon Enterprises. A stunning transformation Rich Duprey (Axon Enterprise): Being able to reimagine your core business and transform yourself into a wholly new -- but related enterprise -- is how I see Intel, and it's how I picture Axon Enterprise. While Intel is still closely linked with processors that came to define computing, today, it is so much more, and it's deeply embedded in the digital world around us. That's what I see Axon doing. It is still very much the same company that came to define stun guns and has seen its Taser become synonymous with the less-than-lethal weapon, but it has now expanded beyond those narrow confines and opened up for itself new avenues of growth. According to TASER's own figures, almost 98% of the 18,250 or so police departments in the country have purchased its stun guns. Certainly, there will be a need for upgrades and replacements over time, but it has pretty much tapped out that market. It's in body cameras and evidence management where the best opportunities lie. As of the end of the first quarter, 36 of the country's 68 major city law enforcement agencies have purchased Axon's body cameras, its digital evidence management systems, or both. And it's the latter that ought to be the real driving force, because not only does it provide Axon with recurring streams of revenue, but it makes itself sticky in that once a department dedicates its evidence management to Evidence.com, switching costs rise astronomically. Unlike a department swapping out a Smith & Wesson duty weapon for a Sig Sauer if features or firepower improve from one manufacturer to the other, logging evidence would seemingly have a huge cost in time and money if a department wanted to switch. It's much easier and cheaper to continue with what you've got. That may ultimately prove to make Axon Enterprise even more of a transformational company than Intel, since swapping processors doesn't necessarily incur the same problems. And it's easy to see Axon moving beyond its close association with law enforcement -- perhaps even into the consumer realm. Daniel Miller has no position in any stocks mentioned. Matt DiLallo has no position in any stocks mentioned. Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Axon Enterprise.

Ai-Mask's ROG Moto-Mod is reminiscent of his dream Ducati motorcycle, with Strix Z270-E Gaming as its powerful engine; while Oz Modz' Maximus IX Formula-based Halo Master Chief draws its inspiration from the lead character in the famous Microsoft game. ROG is very proud of both of these PC builds and excited to continue creating the best components to fuel future case modding projects.   ROG gaming monitors   ROG Swift PG35VQ   ROG Swift PG35VQ is a 35-inch UWQHD (3440 x 1440) curved gaming monitor with High Dynamic Range (HDR) technology.

MSI X299 SLI Plus is ready for heavy lifting by Eric Born  9:30 AM on May 31, 2017 Nothing shakes up the hardware market quite like a processor launch. In advance of Intel's Core X-series processors, manufacturers have been keeping us busy with a rapid-fire succession of new X299 motherboards. In addition to the slate of boards announced yesterday, MSI has another variant to add to the mix: the X299 SLI Plus. The X299 SLI Plus is a spacious ATX motherboard designed for systems that need a lot of memory and even more GPU horsepower. Builders can populate the board's eight memory slots with up to 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 RAM. MSI claims that the motherboard's optimized traces and isolated memory circuits help ensure stable memory performance even at high frequencies.  As users may well be loading up the board with heavy graphics cards, MSI used steel to reinforce the PCI-e slots. Other niceties include titanium chokes and ESD protection around the mounting holes. In the storage department, there are dual M.2 slots with support for Intel's Optane memory, along with a U.2 connector and eight SATA ports. The board also ships with a cooling solution for one of the M.2 slots. The rear I/O panel provides further connectivity with a USB 3.1 Type-C port and nine previous-generation USB connectors. Ethernet connections come courtesy of dual Intel Ethernet adapters, while audio services are provided by a Realtek ALC12220 codec. As with many of our other motherboard announcements this week, we don't have information on pricing and availability. Do expect manufacturers to get these products onto shelves in time to be purchased alongside Intel's Core X processors, though.

EK Fluid Gaming kits make custom loops easier and cheaper by Wayne Manion  4:00 PM on May 31, 2017 Liquid-cooled PC components are all the rage these days, and custom open-loop setups have the highest cool factor in both senses of the word. Those full-bore systems with their discrete pumps, reservoirs, and CNC-machined copper waterblocks tend to be much pricier than their all-in-one siblings, though. EK Waterblocks' Fluid Gaming line of open-loop kits wants to put custom liquid-cooling gear within the fiduciary capabilities of more gamers. There are three different kits: one with a universal CPU waterblock and a 120-mm radiator, a set with a CPU block and a 240-mm radiator, and finally one with both CPU and GPU waterblocks and a 240-mm radiator. Aluminum parts are generally frowned upon in open-loop liquid-cooling setups owing to their position close to the top of the metal reactivity series. Mixing parts made of aluminum and less-reactive metals in the same loop is usually a bad idea since it makes the aluminum vulnerable to corrosion. EK's solution is to offer complete kits with aluminum radiators, waterblocks, and fittings, along with an aluminum-compatible reservoir-and-pump unit. It's worth noting that AIO makers are free to use aluminum because they have complete control over the composition of the metals and the liquid. EK says the radiators have dense fin arrays and a profile less than 1.1" (28 mm) thick, and has branded them with an EK-Alustream label. The EK-Supremacy AX CPU block is made from CNC-machined aluminum and fits Intel sockets with 1150 to 2011 pins, as well as AMD's AM4 socket. The company didn't mention Intel's shiny new LGA 2066 socket, though LGA 2011 coolers should be compatible. Support for AMD's upcoming Threadripper TR4 socket seems unlikely without some kind of upgrade kit. Gerbils clinging to Core 2 Quad and AMD FX CPUs need to look elsewhere. The top-of-the-line kit includes an EK-AC GeForce GTX Pascal aluminum water block designed for use with GeForce GTX 1060, 1070, 1080, and 1080 Ti cards, as well as the Titan X Pascal and the Titan Xp. EK said that a Vega-compatible kit will be offered in the future, though it made no mention of other Radeons. Owners of cards based on non-reference PCBs might want to do a little investigation before clicking any "buy" buttons. All the fans in the kits are EK Vardar models, and the included pump-and-reservoir is an SPC-series unit. Standard gear for all the kits includes transparent flexible tubing EK-ACF aluminum fittings, EK-CryoFuel coolant, and the required cabling. The company says that all the kits come with detailed instruction books, though its promised installation tutorials on YouTube sounds like they'll be more helpful. The Fluid Gaming A120 kit with a CPU block and a 120-mm radiator costs $150, the A240 set with a CPU block and 240-mm radiator costs $160, and the A240G kit with both CPU and graphics card blocks plus a 240-mm radiator will run you up $240. The kits are available through EK's web store immediately and will be offered at TR-favorite Newegg soon. Guru3D has already gotten its hands on the Fluid Gaming A240G kit.

REUTERS/Jim Bourg/Files 1/2 left right Michael Cohen, attorney for The Trump Organization, arrives at Trump Tower in New York City, U.S. January 17, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith 2/2 By Jonathan Landay and Mark Hosenball | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON A political feud erupted on Wednesday over the U.S. House Intelligence Committee's probe of suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, with charges that the panel's Republican chairman subpoenaed the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency without telling Democratic members. Committee aides complained that the chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, who publicly recused himself from leading the Russia probe in April following a secret visit he paid to White House officials, failed to consult Democrats on the subpoenas. The subpoenas asked the agencies to provide details of any requests made by two top Obama administration aides and the former CIA director to "unmask" names of Trump campaign advisers inadvertently picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts, congressional sources said. The former officials named in the subpoenas were Obama national security adviser Susan Rice, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power and former CIA Director John Brennan. "Subpoenas related to the 'unmasking' issue would have been sent by Chairman Nunes acting separately from the committee's Russia investigation. This action would have been taken without the minority's (Democrats') agreement," said a senior committee aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. Another congressional source, who also requested anonymity, said Democrats were "informed and consulted" before the subpoenas were issued. The CIA declined to comment on the subpoenas and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and NSA did not immediate respond to requests for comment. U.S. privacy laws and intelligence regulations require that Americans' names picked up in foreign communications intercepts be concealed unless senior officials request them to be disclosed for intelligence or law enforcement purposes. Any such requests undergo rigorous legal reviews. Several U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that all such requests by Obama administration officials were properly scrutinized and appropriate. SUBPOENAS FOR TRUMP LAWYER, EX-AIDE The spy agency subpoenas were not mentioned in a bipartisan announcement on Wednesday that the panel approved subpoenas for President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in connection with the Russia probe. The committee also approved subpoenas to the two men's firms, Flynn Intel Llc, and Michael D. Cohen and Associates PC, the committee statement said. "As part of our ongoing investigation into Russian active measures during the 2016 campaign, today we approved subpoenas for several individuals for testimony, personal documents and business records," Republican Representative Mike Conaway and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, who are leading the committee probe, said in a joint statement. Conaway assumed Republican leadership of the probe after Nunes recused himself. Nunes retained his power to issue subpoenas. U.S. intelligence agencies reported in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw a campaign of computer hacking, fake news and propaganda intended to swing the election to Republican Trump over his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Putin has denied conducting such a campaign. Trump denies any collusion between Russia and his campaign and has questioned the veracity of the U.S. intelligence finding. Trump fired Flynn in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. The retired Army general is the subject of congressional, Justice Department and Defense Department investigations into his apparent failure to disclose payments he received from Russian and Turkish entities. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an FBI examination of possible contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia, according to the New York Times. It reported that Cohen was involved in a back-channel plan, which never came to fruition, that would have involved a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, and the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Moscow. CNN reported on Wednesday night that congressional investigators were looking into whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions had an undisclosed private meeting with Kislyak during the campaign, citing Republican and Democratic sources in Congress and intelligence officials briefed on the probe. The focus of the probe is on whether such a meeting took place on April 27, 2016, at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, where Trump delivered his first major foreign policy address, CNN reported. During his confirmation hearing in January, Sessions testified that he "did not have any communications with the Russians" during the campaign and said in a written statement given to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was not in contact with anyone linked to the Russian government during the campaign. It was reported in March that he met with Kislyak twice during the campaign, once at the Republican National Convention in July and once in his Senate office in September. Sessions later admitted having the meetings but said they were part of his Senate duties and were unrelated to the campaign. He later recused himself from the Russia probe.

"We will continue to pursue this investigation wherever the facts may lead."The approval of the seven subpoenas appeared to represent a political compromise between the House of Representatives panel's majority Republicans, who have joined Trump in demanding investigations into leaks of classified information to news organizations, and minority Democrats, who are pushing for an aggressive investigation into possible collusion between Russia and Trump campaign aides. Separately, federal prosecutors pursuing a criminal investigation into Flynn have issued subpoenas to people and businesses who have done business with him seeking information, including bank records and communications, related to Flynn, the Flynn Intel Group and Invovo BV, a Dutch company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.

Zombie Teacher Another retailer is listing a standalone release for CoD: Modern Warfare Remastered Posted on May 31, 2017 by John Scalzo A few weeks ago, a landing page for a standalone re-release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered popped up on GameFly. Modern Warfare Remastered is currently available as bonus content for Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare‘s Legacy Edition, and Activision has previously said it wouldn’t be sold on its own. And yet, according to Charlie Intel, a listing for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered was added to Amazon Japan yesterday. The retailer quickly corrected their mistake and deleted the listing, but it featured the same June 20 (for PS4) and July 20 (for Xbox One) release dates as GameFly did. Activision has also made Modern Warfare Remastered available for the PC through Infinite Warfare’s Legacy Edition, and a standalone launch through digital storefronts on the PC, such as Steam and GOG, is probably also in the works for July 20. If Activision is going to release Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered as a standalone game (and it’s looking increasingly likely that they are), the publisher is probably planning a “surprise” announcement for this year’s E3 Expo. But they’d better hurry up, because June 20 is just three weeks away. Who's Got Next? Share This Article With Your Friends...

As part of the "unmasking" investigation, in addition to the NSA, the House committee also subpoeaned the FBI and the CIA for information on how and why Trump-linked names were exposed to the entire US intel community, and led to an avalanche of "unnamed sources" stories. Recall that typically information about Americans intercepted in foreign surveillance is redacted, even in classified reports distributed within the government, unless a compelling need exists to reveal them. Unmasking requests aren’t uncommon by top intelligence community officials *but Republicans want to know whether any of the unmaskings of Trump campaign officials during the transition were politically motivated. * According to the WSJ, Republicans on the committee have been pushing for a thorough investigation of how the names of Trump campaign officials became exposed in classified intelligence reports based off intelligence community intercepts. Specifically, the three "unmaksing" subpoenas seek information on requests made by former national security adviser Susan Rice, former CIA Director John Brennan and former United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power for names to be unmasked in classified material. *The name of Samantha Power hasn’t previously been reported as a potential witness in the probe, and her inclusion in the subpoenas means that Republicans are also broadening their areas of investigation, the WSJ reports. * The House Intelligence Committee is one of two bodies currently probing the question of whether Russian meddled in the 2016 election and whether anyone from Trump’s campaign played a role. Concurrently, the Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting its own investigation and has already issued subpoenas to Flynn and his businesses. Trump has said there was no collusion with Russia and called the investigation a witch hunt. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: KETK - 1 week ago< > Embed House Intel Committee/Russia Probe House Intel Committee/Russia Probe Recent related news House Intel Committee wants to hear from Trump lawyer, ex-Trump surrogateBoris Epshteyn, Michael Cohen on Committee list of more than 20 people it wants to interview CBS News 1 day ago - Front Page FBI Withholds Russia Probe Docs Requested By House Intel CommitteeHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said today that the FBI had *decided to withhold documents, including memos, notes, summaries, and recordings,...

Subpoenas were approved Wednesday for Flynn and his company, Flynn Intel Group, and Cohen and his firm, Michael D. Cohen & Associates. Reps. Mike Conaway and Adam Schiff, who are leading the committee's probe, say the panel approved the subpoenas to compel certain individuals to testify and to obtain personal documents and business records. Cohen earlier rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. ___ 3:40 p.m. An associate of James Comey says the special counsel overseeing an investigation into possible Russian coordination with the Trump campaign has approved the former FBI director to testify before a Senate committee. The associate wouldn't discuss what Comey plans to tell the Senate intelligence committee. But the associate says Comey has received approval from special counsel Robert Mueller to make certain statements. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Sen. Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican who chairs the committee, says the committee would welcome Comey's testimony. Congress is due back in session next week. The Associated Press reported on May 19 that Comey had agreed to testify before the committee after Memorial Day. The associate wasn't authorized to discuss details of Comey's testimony and so spoke on condition of anonymity. — By Jake Pearson in New York. ___ 3:44 a.m. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn will provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee as part of its probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. The Associated Press has learned of Flynn's cooperation that was the first signal that he and the Senate panel have found common ground. Flynn's decision Tuesday came as President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, rejected a House intelligence committee request for information. Former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the House investigation.

The committee also issued subpoenas to former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, who resigned under pressure after failing to disclose meetings with Russian officials, as well as businesses owned by the two men. Cohen, known within the Trump Organization as Donald Trump’s “pit bull,” had previously received an “invitation to provide information and testimony” to the committee, which has no legal bearing. Cohen did not cooperate with that request, telling CNN on Tuesday that the request “was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered,” and that he considered it a “total fishing expedition.” Cohen also told CNN that if he was subpoenaed, “I will comply — and gladly — as I have nothing to hide. There is no shred of evidence that implicates me.” The New York Times reported earlier this year that Cohen hand-delivered to Flynn a proposal by a Ukrainian lawmaker to lift American sanctions on Russia in return for the withdrawal of pro-Russia separatists from Eastern Ukraine.

Committee aides complained that the chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, who publicly recused himself from leading the Russia probe in April following a secret visit he paid to White House officials, failed to consult Democrats on the subpoenas. The subpoenas asked the agencies to provide details of any requests made by two top Obama administration aides and the former CIA director to "unmask" names of Trump campaign advisers inadvertently picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts, congressional sources said. The former officials named in the subpoenas were Obama national security adviser Susan Rice, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power and former CIA Director John Brennan. "Subpoenas related to the 'unmasking' issue would have been sent by Chairman Nunes acting separately from the committee's Russia investigation. This action would have been taken without the minority's (Democrats') agreement," said a senior committee aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. Another congressional source, who also requested anonymity, said Democrats were "informed and consulted" before the subpoenas were issued. The CIA declined to comment on the subpoenas and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and NSA did not immediate respond to requests for comment. U.S. privacy laws and intelligence regulations require that Americans' names picked up in foreign communications intercepts be concealed unless senior officials request them to be disclosed for intelligence or law enforcement purposes. Any such requests undergo rigorous legal reviews. Several U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that all such requests by Obama administration officials were properly scrutinized and appropriate. SUBPOENAS FOR TRUMP LAWYER, EX-AIDE The spy agency subpoenas were not mentioned in a bipartisan announcement on Wednesday that the panel approved subpoenas for President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in connection with the Russia probe. The committee also approved subpoenas to the two men's firms, Flynn Intel Llc, and Michael D. Cohen and Associates PC, the committee statement said. "As part of our ongoing investigation into Russian active measures during the 2016 campaign, today we approved subpoenas for several individuals for testimony, personal documents and business records," Republican Representative Mike Conaway and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, who are leading the committee probe, said in a joint statement. Conaway assumed Republican leadership of the probe after Nunes recused himself. Nunes retained his power to issue subpoenas. U.S. intelligence agencies reported in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw a campaign of computer hacking, fake news and propaganda intended to swing the election to Republican Trump over his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Putin has denied conducting such a campaign. Trump denies any collusion between Russia and his campaign and has questioned the veracity of the U.S. intelligence finding. Trump fired Flynn in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. The retired Army general is the subject of congressional, Justice Department and Defense Department investigations into his apparent failure to disclose payments he received from Russian and Turkish entities. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an FBI examination of possible contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia, according to the New York Times. It reported that Cohen was involved in a back-channel plan, which never came to fruition, that would have involved a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, and the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Moscow. CNN reported on Wednesday night that congressional investigators were looking into whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions had an undisclosed private meeting with Kislyak during the campaign, citing Republican and Democratic sources in Congress and intelligence officials briefed on the probe. The focus of the probe is on whether such a meeting took place on April 27, 2016, at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, where Trump delivered his first major foreign policy address, CNN reported. During his confirmation hearing in January, Sessions testified that he "did not have any communications with the Russians" during the campaign and said in a written statement given to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was not in contact with anyone linked to the Russian government during the campaign. It was reported in March that he met with Kislyak twice during the campaign, once at the Republican National Convention in July and once in his Senate office in September. Sessions later admitted having the meetings but said they were part of his Senate duties and were unrelated to the campaign. He later recused himself from the Russia probe.

Wednesday, May 31, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Intel to Integrate Thunderbolt 3, Eliminate Royalties Joe Rossignol: Intel today announced that it plans to drive large-scale mainstream adoption of Thunderbolt by releasing the protocol’s specification to the industry next year under a nonexclusive, royalty-free license. […] Intel also revealed plans to integrate Thunderbolt 3 into its future CPUs, but it didn’t provide a timeline as to when. The all-in-one design will take up less space on a Mac or PC’s logic board, and reduce power consumption by eliminating the need for a standalone Thunderbolt controller. Hopefully this isn’t too late to avoid a FireWire-like fate. Update (2017-05-31): Colin Cornaby: FWIW I think Thunderbolt 3 is seeing a lot more success on the PC side than Firewire ever did, and it’s still growing. So that’s the weird thing is that the PC companies have been shipping a whole bunch of docks. Meantime the Mac is a mess. The higher end PC docks have GPUs, which isn’t supported under macOS. Apple blocked certain chipsets. Other stuff seems glitch on macOS.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Qualcomm Inks Deal to Build Snapdragon 835 PCs With HP, Lenovo, Asus Qualcomm Inks Deal to Build Snapdragon 835 PCs With HP, Lenovo, Asus By Joel Hruska on May 31, 2017 at 2:21 pm Comment At Computex, Qualcomm announced it would build Windows 10 systems with major traditional PC OEMs. That’s a major step forward for the company, which flirted with building mobile PCs during the Windows 8 era when Windows RT (née Windows on ARM) was in development. The bulk of that market, such as it was, appears to have mostly gone to Nvidia and its Tegra 3 and Tegra 4 SoCs. Qualcomm has never worked with any of the major PC OEMs to build Windows systems, and the Snapdragon 835’s gigabit wireless support could help it stand out compared with other Windows devices in the same approximate market. Qualcomm is claiming that these devices can deliver up to 50 percent more battery life than equivalent x86 devices, with 4-5x longer stand-by times. They’ll also build on the Connected Standby feature found in Windows PCs already, with the ability to wake up, check email or update applications, and then return to sleep. The devices will contain Qualcomm’s X16 LTE modem, which can offer up to gigabit performance. Having an LTE modem inside a Windows portable also means you won’t have to worry about Wi-Fi to get online. That said, the mobile data plans telcos like AT&T and Verizon offer tend to have eye-watering costs per gigabyte if you go over your plan allotment, and it’s arguably easier to do that on PC than on a mobile device, depending on how you use it. Image by Anandtech At Computex, Qualcomm showed off its own circuit board designs compared with those it claimed would be required for an x86-equivalent design. The Qualcomm board is significantly smaller (50.2cm versus 98.1cm). To Boldly Go Where We’ve Been Trying to Go For Years Let’s get a few things out of the way up front. It’s entirely possible that close collaboration between Qualcomm and Microsoft has been to the mutual benefit of both companies. Qualcomm knows how to build great radios, Microsoft knows Windows 10 inside and out, and it’s not hard to imagine the two companies working together to create a great hardware platform. There are two major features Qualcomm will need to offer, however, to make this platform attractive to existing x86 customers. First, emulation performance has to be strong. Back when Windows RT debuted, plenty of users wanted Windows x86 compatibility on the platform, but the old Cortex-A9 simply wasn’t strong enough to provide a satisfactory experience. The Snapdragon 835 is vastly more powerful and Microsoft has had years to work on the problem, so getting emulation working well shouldn’t be impossible. It will, however, have an impact on both battery life and overall performance compared to a native x86 chip. It’s possible that one reason Qualcomm still feels confident about winning these comparisons because ARM has continued to iterate on its CPU designs, while Intel’s last major refresh of its smartphone and tablet division was back in 2012, with the launch of Bay Trail. While 14nm Cherry Trail chips launched as recently as Q1 2016, these were die-shrunk Bay Trail parts, not a brand-new architecture. Second, Qualcomm needs to be able to deliver on its battery life claims. Years ago, this would have been a given. New processes (10nm in this case) meant higher clocks, lower power consumption, and improved battery life, all at the same time. Today, these gains tend to be much more workload-dependent. Doing a lot of video encoding and decoding? Then new enhancements in that area from Intel, AMD, or ARM will give you much better battery life and/or improved performance. Still running garden-variety applications? Not so much. And that’s before we talk about how browser choice impacts battery life. I’ll be surprised if Qualcomm can deliver massive across-the-board improvements on the above front. That’s not because I doubt the quality of the company’s engineering, but because studies of ISA efficiency have generally found that above the microcontroller and embedded markets, it doesn’t really matter which ISA you choose. ARM and x86 have been found to compete fairly well in that regard. Finally, I’m uncertain how much these new announcements will fundamentally reshape the PC market. Back in 2011, the IT industry (including this author) expected a major brawl between Intel and ARM as the former shrank down and headed for smartphones while the latter grew up and headed for laptops. Windows on ARM / Windows RT was actually seen as a product that was critical to Microsoft’s long-term future, if you can believe it. Despite oceans of virtual ink spilled on the topic, in the long run, not much happened. Windows RT failed, Intel remained focused on PCs (despite spending ten billion dollars or more trying to break into mobile), and ARM stayed supreme in the tablet and smartphone space. Clearly, Microsoft wants to take another stab at the Windows on ARM equation, but if the past is any precedent, it’s facing a steep uphill climb. Best case, ARM opens a new front against Intel in mobile while AMD goes after it in data centers and mainstream computing, and Microsoft sees its own market share rise in the total OS market. Worst case, Intel fends off both challenges, the Windows on ARM initiative collapses (again), and we all keep using Android and iOS devices with one type of CPU, and desktop and laptop PCs on another.

As reported previously, the committee sent document requests to Manafort and Stone, as well as Carter Page and Mike Flynn, seeking information related to dealings with Russia. So far Page has not yet complied, while Flynn it was confirmed today, planned to plead the Fifth as a reason not to comply with a committee subpoena, citing "escalating public frenzy" as part of the ongoing probe. According to NBC, the committee's letter to Page asked him "to list any Russian official or business executive he met with between June 16, 2015 and Jan. 20, 2017. It also asked him to provide information about Russia-related real estate transactions during that period. And it seeks all his email or other communications during that period with Russians, or with the Trump campaign about Russia or Russians." While the precise contents is unknown, similar letters were sent to Manafort and Stone, who then sent the requested information to investigators by last Friday's deadline. "I gave them all documents that were consistent with their specific request," Stone said in an email to NBC News. A spokesman for Manafort, Jason Maloni, confirmed that Manafort turned over documents, adding that Manafort remains interested in cooperating with the Senate investigation. NBC adds that it was too early to tell whether the documents from Manafort and Stone "suggested they had fully complied with the request." In a parallel process, as part of the FBI's Russia collusion investigation, federal grand juries have issued subpoenas for records relating to both Flynn and Manafort. Meanwhile, Flynn's assertion of the Fifth Amendment would make it difficult for the Senate to enforce its subpoena, NBC News reported citing Senate sources: "The Senate could go to court, or go ask the Justice Department to go to court to enforce it, but either actin would require the Republicans who control the chamber to agree." Trump fired Flynn as his national security advisor in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about conversations he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about U.S. sanctions on Russia. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit News - 1 week ago< > Embed Manafort, Stone Turn Over Russia Documents to Senate Intel Committee 00:40 Two former associates of President Donald Trump have turned over documents to the Senate Intelligence Committee in its Russia investigation.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Richard Drew Share Tweet Share Email Comments WASHINGTON (AP) — Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn will provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee as part of its probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, The Associated Press has learned. Flynn’s decision Tuesday came as President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, rejected a House intelligence committee request for information, and former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the House investigation. Meanwhile, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sounded similar tones as they criticized the ongoing U.S. scrutiny of Russia’s attempts to sway the presidential election. Flynn’s cooperation was the first signal that he and the Senate panel have found common ground. Congressional investigators continue to press for key documents in the ongoing investigation, and the retired lieutenant general is trying to limit damaging disclosures that hostile Democratic lawmakers could use against him. Flynn had previously invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination in declining an earlier subpoena from the committee, which sought a wide array of documents and information related to his contacts with Russia. Flynn’s attorneys had argued the request was too broad and would have required Flynn to turn over information that could have been used against him. In response, the Senate panel narrowed the scope of its request. It also issued subpoenas seeking records from Flynn’s businesses. One of the businesses, Flynn Intel Group Inc., did consulting work for a Turkish businessman that required Flynn to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent earlier this year. The other, Flynn Intel Group LLC, was used to accept money from Flynn’s paid speeches. Among the payments was more than $33,000 Flynn received from RT, the Russian state-sponsored television network that U.S. intelligence officials have branded as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin. On Tuesday, a person close to Flynn said he will turn over documents related to the two businesses as well as some personal documents the committee sought in the narrower request. Flynn plans to produce some of the documents by next week, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Flynn’s private interactions with the committee. While the Senate committee awaits documents from Flynn, Putin and Trump both dismissed the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic emails. In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Putin reaffirmed his strong denial of Russian involvement in the hacking. The interview was recorded during Putin’s Monday trip to Paris and released Tuesday. Putin also said the allegations are “fiction” invented by the Democrats in order to explain their loss. Trump made a similar claim in a tweet early Tuesday: “Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.” Meanwhile, Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney, told the AP that he turned down a request for information from the House intelligence committee looking into the Russian interference. “I declined the invitation to participate as the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered,” Cohen said. “I find it irresponsible and improper that the request sent to me was leaked by those working on the committee.” Earlier Tuesday, the AP reported, citing a congressional aide, that the House intelligence committee had subpoenaed Cohen. The aide later retracted the statement. Cohen said if he is subpoenaed, he will comply. Cohen, a longtime attorney for the Trump Organization, remains a personal lawyer for Trump. He served as a cable television surrogate for the Republican during the presidential campaign. Cohen told ABC News that he had been asked by both the House and Senate intelligence committees to provide information and testimony about contacts he had with Russian officials. Cohen’s ties with Russian interests came up in February when The New York Times reported that Cohen helped to broker a Ukraine peace plan that would call for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and a referendum to let Ukrainians decide whether the part of the country seized by Russia in 2014 should be leased to Moscow. The Russian government denied knowing anything about such a plan. The Times reported that the peace plan was the work of Felix Sater, a business associate who has helped Trump try to find business in Russia, and Cohen. Cohen was a fierce defender of Trump during the campaign, often haranguing probing reporters and famously challenging a CNN reporter live on-air to name the specific polls that showed then-candidate Trump behind his rival, Hillary Clinton. In the early 2000s, he formed his own firm working on a range of legal matters, including malpractice cases, business law and work on an ethanol business in Ukraine. Cohen also owned and operated a handful of taxi medallions, managing a fleet of cabs in New York. Cohen’s business associates in the taxi enterprise included a number of men from the former Soviet Union, including his Ukrainian-born father-in-law. Cohen has made his own unsuccessful attempts at public office, losing a city council race and briefly running for state assembly in New York. The House intelligence committee has also sought information from Epshteyn, a former staffer in the Trump White House. Epshteyn said in a statement that he has asked the committee questions to better understand what information it is seeking and will determine whether he can reasonably provide it. Epshteyn, who grew up in Moscow, worked a short time in the White House press office. He left in March and now works as a political analyst for right-leaning Sinclair Broadcasting. __ Associated Press writers Julie Bykowicz, Eileen Sullivan and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Chip Wars Rage at Computex, as AMD Debuts Threadripper By Jef Cozza / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: MAY 31 2017 Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) provided more details about its new high-end Ryzen desktop processor at Computex today, including demonstrations of some desktop systems from its OEM partners powered by the new chip. The top end of the Ryzen line, the Ryzen 9 1998X, will carry a total of 16 cores and start shipping this summer. Codenamed "Threadripper," the Ryzen 9 line also comes with up to 32 threads. The company’s announcement comes a day after Intel wowed audiences at the Computex IT trade show in Taipei, with its new i9 processors, which pack in up to 18 processing cores and 36 threads. Although AMD announced the launch of Threadripper about a month ago, the company took advantage of Computex to offer more information. Targeting High-End Desktops The Threadripper is targeted at the high-end desktop market, including gaming, 4K graphics rendering, and VR applications, AMD said. The company was able to show off a couple high-performance systems from OEMs such as ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI. Each has produced a motherboard to support the X399 chipset used by Threadripper. The new motherboards also feature quad-channel memory and support for up to 2 TB of RAM. The company also publicly demonstrated a Ryzen mobile APU in an ultraportable design, with four cores, eight threads, and the company’s Vega architecture-based graphics into a sub-15mm thickness notebook design. The demo featured the Ryzen mobile-powered notebook playing HD video content. But information about high-end desktop processors is not the only news AMD had to share at this year’s Computex. The company also announced the launch date for EPYC, its new family of high-performance processors for cloud-based and traditional on-premises datacenters. Previously codenamed "Naples," the first EPYC processor-based servers are scheduled to launch June 20. EPYC is based on the company's existing Zen x86 architecture. Graphics Cards and VR Ready AMD also took advantage of Computex to draw attention to its VR (virtual reality) bona fides. The company announced that all of its Ryzen desktop processors are approved for use with the Oculus VR platform. AMD has labeled some of its Radeon graphics cards as "VR Ready" and said it will soon begin labeling its processors as either "VR Ready" or "Ryzen VR Ready Premium." The chipmaker also provided some updates on its new Radeon graphics cards based on its Vega architecture. The new Radeon Vega Frontier Edition will be the first graphics card in the family to launch, and will be geared toward supporting machine learning and advanced visualization. AMD said the new card is expected to arrive in stores June 27. Meanwhile, the company also provided a demonstration of its new Radeon RX Vega graphics card, also based on the Vega architecture. The Radeon RX Vega, which is more geared toward gaming workloads, is expected to launch at SIGGRAPH 2017 in Los Angeles later this year. Image credit: AMD.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Qualcomm Snapdragon Chips To Power New Windows 10 PCs By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: MAY 31 2017 Asus, HP, and Lenovo are all coming out with Windows 10 PCs that will be powered by Qualcomm Technologies' Snapdragon 835 processors, although no release dates have been given yet. Qualcomm made the announcement today at Computex 2017, one of the largest IT trade shows in Asia. The new Snapdragon-powered devices will support a "hypermobile" experience with long battery life and fast LTE connectivity, Qualcomm said. The Snapdragon 835 is built using 10-nanometer FinFET (fin field effect transistor) technology, a relatively new process designed to minimize performance versus power tradeoffs in chip manufacturing. New-Gen, 'Always-Connected' PCs The new Qualcomm-powered devices from Asus, HP, and Lenovo represent a new category of "always connected PCs" using the Windows 10 operating system, Peter Han, Microsoft's vice president of partner devices and solutions, said in a Windows blog post today. "There is a new generation of users that need to be connected to the cloud at all times," Han said. "They are students, creators, freelancers, small businesses, and enterprises. This means sharing experiences across screens and leveraging the latest network technology like gigabit LTE and eSIM. We are collaborating with our ecosystem on a shared vision. This starts with a close partnership at the silicon layer, with Intel and Qualcomm and with our mobile operator partners to provide seamless eSIM connectivity." In a statement, Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm's executive vice president, said, "The Snapdragon Mobile PC Platform will enable Windows 10 hardware makers to develop next-generation modern device form factors and deliver unparalleled anything, anywhere creation experiences with up to Gigabit Class LTE connectivity." Download Speeds of 'Up to 1 Gbps' Microsoft and Qualcomm first announced their plans for Windows 10 devices powered by Snapdragon ARM processors late last year. However, that doesn't mean that Microsoft is moving away from devices powered by Intel's x86-based chips. In fact, there have already been a number of new Intel-powered Windows devices unveiled at Computex this year, including the new Zephyrus gaming laptop from Asus and Lenovo's new V720 laptop designed for small business users. "We’re excited to work with Microsoft and Qualcomm Technologies to bring a whole new class of devices to consumers that will change the future of personal computing," said Jeff Meredith, SVP and general manager for Lenovo’s PCs and smart devices consumer business unit, in the statement. The new Snapdragon-powered PCs coming out from Asus, HP and Lenovo will all feature fanless designs and integrated Snapdragon X16 Gigabit LTE modems. The built-in modem will be able to support peak download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second (Gbps), Qualcomm said. In addition, the Snapdragon 835's mobile PC platform will also feature 2x2 802.11ac MU-MIMO for "optimal Wi-Fi connectivity on the go," Qualcomm said. At Computex today, Microsoft also unveiled new Windows-based mixed-reality headsets from a variety of manufacturing partners and highlighted new Internet of Things offerings it plans to develop for vertical markets including energy, manufacturing, and retail.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    An unfinished documentary designed to burnish the image of Turkey provides some insight as to the kind of publicity work Michael Flynn was doing on behalf of the country, The Wall Street Journal reported. It's also at the center of several investigations into the erstwhile national security adviser. While Flynn was out campaigning for then-candidate Donald Trump, his associate at the Flynn Intel Group was putting together the pieces of a pro-Turkey documentary, the Journal reported. A Turkey businessman had paid the Flynn Intel Group $530,000 to help with its image after a failed coup earlier in the year, the Journal reported. Bijan Kian, Flynn's business partner, hired professionals — including a former CNN anchor to be the face of it — to do a "60 Minutes"— type documentary, all while simultaneously trying to conceal who was behind it. "Bijan said they did not want to be connected to this in any way," one of those hired told the Journal. "He said: 'We don't want anyone to know the Flynn Intel Group has anything to do with this.'" The project, though never completed once Flynn took on a role in the White House, is at the center of investigations into Flynn, accused of improperly concealing his business dealings with Turkey — and Russia. Flynn has been subpoenaed by the Senate Intelligence Committee — which he's largely ignoring — and his consulting company was issued subpoenas by a federal court in Virginia. The House Intel Committee also is expected to issue subpoenas to Flynn, too. Flynn was fired as NSA just 24 days into the job for failing to disclose conversations he had with Russian diplomats to Vice President Mike Pence.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Computex / Computex: MSI unleashes new range of X299 motherboards Computex: MSI unleashes new range of X299 motherboards Matthew Wilson 15 hours ago Computex, Featured Tech News, Motherboard Computex has been full of announcements this year, which is partially down to the fact that Intel has launched its new X299 platform and Core-X processors. We have seen new X299 motherboard ranges from Gigabyte and ASUS already and now, we get to take a look at what MSI has to offer. For starters, most of MSI’s different motherboard flavours will be available in X299 form, including the GAMING M7, Gaming Pro Carbon, Tomahawk and SLI PLUS. Each motherboard brings along its own set of new features. The X299 Gaming M7 ACK for instance uses a 10 phase Digital power design with Loadline calibration and MSI’s turbo socket for overclocking. The Gaming M7 also features its own M.2 shield to keep your M.2 drive protected from any hot air that might be pumping through your system. Beyond that, it also comes with its own RGB lighting setup, Audio Boost Pro 4 and Killer E2500 Ethernet connectors. The Gaming Pro Carbon on the other hand features the same 10 phase power design with Loadline calibration and turbo socket but adds in Titanium Chokes. The X299 Tomahawk is a bit different, focussing on a stainless steel design for the heatsinks and offering front panel USB Type-C connections. The MSI X299 SLI PLUS is the final board on our list for today, featuring Military Class VI components to make it one of the strongest motherboards MSI has ever built. This board adopts dual Intel LAN which optimises for maximum transfer speeds by reducing CPU overhead and offering high TCP and UDP throughput. It also has 15KV protection, shielding your network from static. In all, this board is built to be stable and reliable. There are of course some features that carry across the whole range, including USB 3.1 Gen 2 support and the ASMedia ASM3142 3.1 controller. All of these boards carry the Forzr M.2 shield too, while most feature RGB lighting. At the time of writing, we only have pictures of two motherboards to share with you. However, later this week we are due to visit MSI’s booth at Computex, so we will be sure to get some images of the entire range then and update this article with them. KitGuru Says: There have been a lot of motherboard announcements in the last 24 hours. Are any of you thinking about making the jump to X299 and a Core-X CPU?

Miller May 30, 2017 10 Comments In the last few weeks, there have been a number of important introductions of new computing platforms designed specifically for working on deep neural networks for machine learning. In the last few weeks, there have been a number of important introductions of new computing platforms designed specifically for working on deep neural networks for machine learning, including Google's new "cloud TPUs" and Nvidia's new Volta design. To me, this is the most interesting trend in computer architecture—even more than AMD and now Intel introducing 16-core and 18-core CPUs. Of course, there are other alternative approaches, but Nvidia and Google are deservedly getting a lot of attention for their unique approaches. At Google I/O, I saw it introduce what a "cloud TPU" (for Tensor Processing Unit, indicating that it is optimized for Google's TensorFlow machine learning framework). The previous generation TPU, introduced at last year's show, is an ASIC designed primarily for inferencing—running machine learning operations—but the new version is designed for inferencing and training such algorithms. In a recent paper, Google gave more details on the original TPU, which it described as containing a matrix of 256-by-256 multiple-accumulate (MAC) units (65,536 in total) with a peak performance of 92 teraops (trillion operations per second). It gets its instructions from a host CPU over PCIe Gen 3 bus. Google said this was a 28nm die that was less than half the size of an Intel Haswell Xeon 22nm processor, and that it outperformed that processor and Nvidia's 28nm K80 processor. The new version, dubbed TPU 2.0 or cloud TPU, (seen above), actually contains four processors on the board, and Google said each board is capable of reaching 180 teraflops (180 trillion floating point operations per second). Just as importantly, the boards are designed to work together, using a custom high-speed network, so they act as a single machine learning supercomputing that Google calls a "TPU pod." This TPU pod contains 64 second-generation TPUs and provides up to 11.5 petaflops to accelerate the training of a single large machine learning model. At the conference, Fei Fei Li, who heads Google's AI research, said that while one of the company's large-scale learning models for translation takes a full day to train on 32 of the best commercially available GPUs, it can now be training to the same accuracy in an afternoon using one-eighth of a TPU pod. That's a big jump. Understand that these are not small systems—a Pod looks to be about the size of four normal computing racks. And each of the individual processors seem to have very large heat sinks, meaning the boards can't be stacked too tightly. Google hasn't yet given a lot of detail on what has changed in this version of the processors or the interconnect, but it's likely this as well is based around 8-bit MACs. The week before, Nvidia introduced its latest entry in this category, a massive chip known as the Telsa V100 Volta, which it described as the first CPU with this new Volta architecture, designed for high-end GPUs. Nvidia said the new chip is capable of 120 TensorFlow teraflops (or 15 32-bit TFLOPS or 7.5 64-bit ones.) This uses a new architecture that includes 80 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), each of which includes eight new "Tensor Cores" and is a 4x4x4 array capable of performing 64 FMA (Fused Multiply-Add) operations per clock. Nvidia said it will offer the chip in its DGX-1V workstations with 8 V100 boards in the third quarter, following the firm's earlier DGX-1 that used the earlier P100 architecture. The company said this $149,000 box should deliver 960 teraflops of training performance, using 3200 watts. Later on, the first said, it would ship a Personal DGX Station with a four V100s, and in the fourth quarter, it said the big server vendors will ship V100 servers. This chip is the first announced to use TSMC's 12nm processor, and it will be a huge chip with 21.1 billion transistors on 815 square millimeter die. Nvidia cited both Microsoft and Amazon as early customers for the chip. Related The Coolest Things From Google I/O 2017 The Coolest Things From Google I/O 2017 Note there are big differences between these approaches. The Google TPUs are really custom chips, designed for TensorFlow applications, while the Nvidia V100 is a somewhat more general chip, capable of different kinds of math for other applications. Meanwhile, the other big cloud providers are looking at alternatives, with Microsoft using both GPUs for training and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for inferencing, and offering both to customers. Amazon Web Services now make both GPU and FPGA instances available to developers. And Intel has been pushing FPGAs and a host of other techniques. Meanwhile, a number of new start-ups are working on alternative approaches. In some ways, this is the most drastic change we've seen in workstation and server processors in years, at least since developers first started using "GPU compute" several years ago. It will be fascinating to see how this develops. Back to top Previous : AMD Introduces Epyc Server Chip, 16-Core Desktop Chip Google Apps, Tools Aim to 'Democratize AI' Next : By Michael J.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman COMPUTEX CPX Conference Keynotes Focus on Future Technology Trends TAIPEI, Taiwan–(BUSINESS WIRE)–COMPUTEX 2017, the leading global ICT show with a complete supply chain, and IoT and startup ecosystems, kicked-off the first day of its three-day CPX Conference, “From Mobility to Intelligence,” with keynote presentations focusing on future technology trends. Information and communications technology (ICT) industry heavyweights creating and implementing strategies for leading technology companies, ARM, Dell, Foxconn (Hon Hai Technology Group), Intel and Qualcomm, presented how their companies are adapting to current trends and unlocking future opportunities. Lu Fang-ming, corporate executive vice president of Foxconn (Hon Hai Technology Group), and chairman of Asia Pacific Telecom Group, said Foxconn was heavily investing in some of today’s most important advanced manufacturing technologies, such as predictive analytics, smart connected IoT products, and smart factories. “As we migrate from a components company to a high-tech company, we want to go beyond physical manufacturing to integrate the cyber and the physical to address next-generation requirements,” said Lu Fang-ming. Lu stressed the world is moving toward more connected people and devices, with seven billion connected people and 30 billion connected devices predicted by 2020. However, the focus should be not only on more connectivity, but also on more precision. Foxconn (Hon Hai Technology Group) is embracing next-generation 8K + 5G technologies as the new convention for smart-factory imaging. Lu said this would create endless opportunities for predictive analytics and non-stop recording in ultra-high resolution, also applicable to other disciplines such as surgery and security. The path to 5G Forum attendees also received a masterclass in the possibilities and pervasive impact of 5G from Qualcomm. Jim Cathey, regional president of Asia-Pacific and India and vice president of Qualcomm Technologies, said, “We’re talking about untethered gaming and VR. 5G could be so pervasive across so many industries that it is almost as important as electricity. The economic value of 5G-related goods and services will exceed US$12 trillion in 2035, and 5G will enable products and services that have not been invented. The high reliability, low latency, lower cost per bit and high availability of 5G will empower more immersive experiences, making VR and AR available to everyone.” Security risks in the hyper-connected world Echoing a common concern for security underlying technology trends, Rene Haas, president of ARM’s Intellectual Property Group, said computer vision, capturing images and instantly making intelligent decisions based on them, is one of the areas his team is most excited about. Haas cited an example of intelligent security cameras equipped with real-time learning capabilities, that could take images at select times and analyze massive volumes of security footage which is currently left unutilized. “We are heading toward a significantly system-based world, and these learning-based systems with a high level of complexity would require a high level of security,” Haas said. Is the edge eating the cloud? Andy Rhodes, global vice president of the IoT Solutions Group at Dell, began his presentation tracing the factors behind the hype over IoT in the past few years, including the accessible price point of silicon, an ubiquitous wireless environment, the cloud and the notion of data scientists. “But the cloud has its limits,” he said. “The cloud will sustain. There will always be cloud computing, but the edge will start to expand. People will need to decide which type of analytics to process in the cloud or at the edge, depending on their use case, their things and their network setup, among others. And they will need to understand how to push their analytics down from the cloud to the edge,” Rhodes explained. Rhodes noted the edge is the place where data is created or very close to where it is created, citing examples such as drones and robots. It has a vastly different operating environment from data centers, while also having radically different proprietary protocols to capture and transport data. “As people strive for innovation, the latency issue of driving data to the cloud to get processed and then sent back would never be realistic,” Rhodes continued. Robert B. Crooke, senior vice president and general manager of the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group at Intel, spoke about how Intel is redesigning data centers to become more agile and efficient. “Our next-gen scalable data center technology will fundamentally change the way data centers are built, managed and expanded,” Crooke concluded. Following the keynotes on future technology trends, the CPX Conference at COMPUTEX continues with forums on artificial intelligence, IoT+ and innovations and startups.

Close Drivers of BMW iNext will be able to sleep behind the wheel Viknesh Vijayenthiran May 31, 2017 Follow Viknesh Add to circle BMW is currently working with tech giant Intel and vehicle sensor firm Mobileye to develop a highly-capable self-driving system which the automaker plans to deploy in 2021. The system will debut in a technological flagship code-named the iNext and be so robust that BMW predicts drivers in certain situations will be able to sleep behind the wheel. The iNext won’t be a fully self-driving car devoid of a steering wheel and pedals, the likes of which Ford and Waymo have promised. You’ll still require a driver’s license to  be able to operate it, but in certain situations the car will have Level 3 and even Level 4 self-driving capability. BMW self-driving technologyEnlarge Photo The most advanced cars at present have Level 2 self-driving capability. This is where constant monitoring by the driver is required in case of an emergency. Level 3 is robust enough that the driver can take their eyes off the road for long enough to read a text message or enjoy the scenery, but they need to remain alert should they be required to take over following a brief warning period, normally a few seconds. Similar to Level3, Level 4 allows a driver to take their eyes off the road. The key difference, though, is that in a Level 4 car the timespan for the driver to take over control is far longer. And in the situation that the driver fails to take over control, the car is able to safely stop by the side of a road. BMW self-driving car prototypeEnlarge Photo Level 5, the ultimate goal, is where no driver is required. BMW predicts Level 5 cars will be ready before 2030. We’ll likely see them introduced initially on a trial basis and restricted to certain zones. According to BMW, the iNext will be able to operate in Level 3 self-driving mode in traffic that is moving in the same direction and separated from oncoming traffic. The automaker says the iNext will be able to operate in Level 4 self-driving mode in urban centers and eventually in traffic that is moving in the same direction and separated from oncoming traffic. It’s this latter situation where BMW predicts drivers of the iNext will be able to nod off. In parallel to developing self-driving technology, BMW and its partners are working on standards, platforms and a backend for the future of self-driving cars. BMW is also open to other firms joining the alliance.

This book is not covering the technical details of the radio equipment or chips, Qualcomm and Intel have done a pretty good job of covering that. Don’t worry, Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung will explain it to the carriers with great detail. The goal was to respond to all of your questions about the practical deployment of 5G in today’s wireless networks. How can others outside of the carrier domain deploy? You wanted to know the foundation, well here it is. Business case summaries and all. From the author of the blog, www.wade4wireless.com and the founder of www.techfecta.com. Here is another installment of the Wireless Deployment Handbook (WDH) series. Many people ask me about 4G and 5G and how we get there from here. Well, since you asked I thought I would cover the deployment part of the networks. Are you interested in how to deploy and how the transition happens? You all know that 5G is coming and it is going to open the doors to new applications such as wireless virtual reality, new IOT ideas, Artificial Intelligence applications, low-latency offerings, wireless cloud computing, and so much more. It’s a game changer if it’s done right. Will the network be more than a cool this? It’s becoming a necessity for any of us to do business. The broadband connections need to be made available anywhere making this the new utility. We already see it with the mandates coming from the US Government that broadband is a necessity for growth and business. We all need electricity in our homes, right, now let’s add broadband. The telephone has been replaced with the broadband connection. The difference is that the phone was in every home, now the phone and a broadband connection is with you every minute of the day, by your side as a smartphone, tablet, or laptop. We all feel the need to be connected most of the time. This constant connection is such an addiction in most countries that we see addictions to being connected. The need to stay in touch has totally overwhelmed some people, even me. I now know that I can manage my priorities in life. Staying connected can be a good thing. Look how families can live remote yet communicate every day for pennies. They don’t have to talk, but they can text and take pictures. Remote family members can see their relatives, children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, brothers, and sisters daily and even over holidays without taking the time or expense to visit. We can talk anytime and share those special moments with all of them with the click of a button on your smartphone. How cool is that? See, technology is a good thing when properly managed. So, let’s dive into the networks that make all of this happen. Let’s look at the new generation, 5G, and how to deploy it so that we don’t let these families down. Let’s support them and increase the functions and ways to stay in touch. Let’s make all of this happen. It is up to you, the deployment teams, the unsung heroes that make this happen with little or no recognition from anyone, even the customer who wanted this system. Sure, they will take most of the credit, but you have the bragging rights knowing that they could not have done it without you! Congratulations on taking the first step her, now, today!

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts Microsoft’s latest initiative brings always-on LTE notebooks with embedded SIM technology Christian Zibreg on May 31, 2017 0 Windows maker Microsoft’s new “Always Connected PCs” initiative focuses on helping computer manufacturers bring to market LTE-enabled notebooks that incorporate eSIM technology (not to be confused with Apple SIM). The company said at the Computex 2017 show this morning in Taipei that it will partner with PC vendors, carriers and chip makers like Intel and Qualcomm on the new initiative. Created a year ago by Apple, Samsung and other players, these SIMs are embedded directly into a device and cannot be removed. But perhaps more important than that, eSIMs are universally compatible with all carriers and as such allow customers to sign up for a wireless service right on their device. First LTE-enabled Windows notebooks featuring eSIM technology (via Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chipset) are on the way from ASUS, HP and Lenovo, said Microsoft. These new Intel x86-based devices will feature Windows 10, always-on LTE connectivity and “great battery life”. Huawei, VAIO and Xiaomi are committed to Always Connected PCs using eSIM technology, too. “There is a new generation of users that need to be connected to the cloud at all times. They are students, creators, freelancers, small businesses and enterprises,” said the Redmond firm. “This means sharing experiences across screens and leveraging the latest network technology like gigabit LTE and eSIM.” The eSIM standard works virtually anywhere in the world, meaning customers are able to switch carrier instantly, no paperwork or a physical SIM card required whatsoever. Apple owns a patent for an LTE-enabled MacBook with wireless antennas integrated within a hinge mechanism, as depicted on the patent drawing below. Updated Mac notebooks are expected at WWDC next week, according to Bloomberg. Ahead of the WWDC keynote, an Apple regulatory filing in Russia has identified five unreleased Mac notebooks, plus a next-generation Magic Keyboard and new iPad Pro models. It’s unclear if these refreshed MacBooks will feature embedded LTE connectivity, but if a next-generation MacBook with an eSIM is lying around somewhere in Jony Ive’s basement now would be a good time to bring it to market.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Computex / Computex: Gigabyte shows off new range of X299 motherboards Computex: Gigabyte shows off new range of X299 motherboards Matthew Wilson 20 hours ago Computex, Featured Tech News, Motherboard Yesterday at Computex, Intel officially announced its new Core-X family of processors so naturally, motherboard makers are now showing off all of their new X299 designs. Today, we had a chance to swing by the Gigabyte booth at Computex and got a good look at their new range of X299 Aorus motherboards. These new motherboards come with several new hardware improvements, including a new ESS Sabre Audio chip and an Asmedia ASM3142 USB 3.1 controller. Beyond that, new features like Smart Fan 5 and RGB fusion aim to give users more customizability in terms of looks and functionality. All of Gigabyte’s new motherboards featured redesigned ‘armor and plating’, with a new baseplate that offers better support for heavier graphics cards and larger CPU coolers. Similarly to other motherboard makers, Gigabyte is also offering a new gaming oriented network feature. This is known as the Gamers Private Network (GPN) and is developed in partnership with WTFast. This feature essentially aims to optimise your connection to improve things like latency in-game. Like most hardware and peripheral makers these days, Gigabyte is taking part in the RGB craze, so these motherboards do feature ‘RGB Fusion’. This essentially places LEDs on the motherboard in various locations and using software, you can control the effect, pattern and colour of the system. Outside of that, this new Aorus Gaming X299 range also supports Smart Fan 5 with Fan Stop technology, essentially allowing you to stop the fans from spinning as long as the system is below a certain temperature threshold. Finally, these motherboards do support M.2 with Thermal Guard and Intel’s new Optane Memory. The entire range is expected to rollout in June 2017.

The move itself seems to be an attempt to recapture some of the fortunes Microsoft experienced during the 90s and 00s; essentially the period where Microsoft was top of the world and the tablet-horror show hadn’t started writing the obituary of the personal computer. Constant connectivity would allow Microsoft to potentially regain some of this fortune; it’s early days for the moment, but your correspondent finds the idea appealing. “There is a new generation of users that need to be connected to the cloud at all times. They are students, creators, freelancers, small businesses, and enterprises,” said Peter Han, VP of Partner Devices and Solutions at Microsoft. “This means sharing experiences across screens and leveraging the latest network technology like gigabit LTE and eSIM. “This starts with a close partnership at the silicon layer, with Intel and Qualcomm and with our mobile operator partners to provide seamless eSIM connectivity. Microsoft device partners ASUS, HP, Huawei, Lenovo, VAIO, and Xiaomi, are committed to this new category of Always Connected PCs using eSIM technology.” To support the dream, Intel will be making current and future modems compatible with e-SIMs, saving the hassle of fiddling around with SIM cards and easier connection to LTE networks. In theory, by entering account details, you should be able to access the cloud relatively simply. Microsoft will also be working alongside Qualcomm to develop mobile PCs powered by the Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform featuring the X16 LTE modem. It’s a useful little tie in as the chipsets currently power upmarket smartphone handsets including Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. Windows devices on Snapdragon will also come with embedded e-SIM support. “Today’s consumers experience mobility in nearly every aspect of their lives and they’ve come to expect more from their PCs than legacy computing models are able to provide,” said Cristiano Amon, EVP at Qualcomm Technologies. “With compatibility for the Windows 10 ecosystem, the Snapdragon Mobile PC Platform will enable Windows 10 hardware makers to develop next-generation modern device form factors and deliver unparalleled anything, anywhere creation experiences with up to Gigabit Class LTE connectivity.” Part of the attractiveness of the tablet is its accessibility. It’s smaller and lighter than a laptop, though there are still certain things you can’t do. It is most likely Microsoft will only be fighting to reclaim those customers who work on the go. For the more casual users, those who only want to watch movies for instance, a tablet will still be more attractive. That said, it doesn’t really matter. Reclaiming any of the lost revenues would certainly be a step in the right direction.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Qualcomm says it, not Intel, will power the next… Qualcomm says it, not Intel, will power the next generation of PCs By Mark Coppock — Updated May 30, 2017 8:05 pm Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Qualcomm seeks to threaten Intel's laptop dominance with its own line of Windows 10-capable processors. We now know Asus, HP, and Lenovo will be the first to debut these systems, though release dates remain MIA. For decades, Windows and Intel have been fairly synonymous, so much so that the term “Wintel” was coined to describe the ecosystem. But that’s about to change in a major way, at least if Qualcomm has anything to say about it. Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that Windows 10 on ARM will run all of the 16 million Windows desktop applications available. The first processor to run this new version of Windows 10 is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835, and now the first PC makers to produce systems supporting the platform have been announced. These partners include HP, Asus, and Lenovo, three companies that are among the leaders in the Windows PC ecosystem. They will be making highly compact systems based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip (SoC) that features the Kryo 280 CPU, the Adreno 540 GPU, and the X16 LTE mobile data modem. The result will be extremely thin, light, and fanless systems that are capable of running the full complement of Windows desktop applications, yet have all-day battery life and days-long standby performance. Qualcomm is promising up to 50 percent more battery life than Intel-based systems — 20 hours on average — and a more complete Connected Standby experience that will include instant-on, always connected data syncing, and Cortana active listening. Windows 10 on ARM systems will also benefit from the integrated Snapdragon X16 gigabit LTE modem that will enable the systems to enjoy full-time internet connectivity. That will enable the systems to leverage the increasing global availability of fast gigabit LTE networks. Qualcomm is pushing this is a major boon, as LTE-capable PCs are not common, and the option can add $50 to $100 onto the price of a new system. This development takes direct aim at Intel, and Qualcomm makes its desire to threaten its elder rival clear. Don McGuire, Qualcomm’s Vice President of Global Product Marketing, stated in a video that “when you put this all together […] you get the next generation of PC.” The implication is clear. Qualcomm thinks it can provide better, more portable, more affordable systems that will outmaneuver Intel’s expensive processors. Of course, that’s marketing. How it works in real life remains to be seen, and we’ll have to wait. While the announcement revealed Qualcomm’s partners, it provided exact word on when the first of these systems will arrive.

Cohen, has received and rejected a request for documents as part of Congress's ongoing investigation into Russia's election meddling and contacts with the Trump campaign. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) WASHINGTON — Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn will provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee as part of its probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, The Associated Press has learned. Flynn's decision Tuesday came as President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, rejected a House intelligence committee request for information, and former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the House investigation. Meanwhile, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sounded similar tones as they criticized the ongoing U.S. scrutiny of Russia's attempts to sway the presidential election. Flynn's cooperation was the first signal that he and the Senate panel have found common ground. Congressional investigators continue to press for key documents in the ongoing investigation, and the retired lieutenant general is trying to limit damaging disclosures that hostile Democratic lawmakers could use against him. Flynn had previously invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination in declining an earlier subpoena from the committee, which sought a wide array of documents and information related to his contacts with Russia. Flynn's attorneys had argued the request was too broad and would have required Flynn to turn over information that could have been used against him. In response, the Senate panel narrowed the scope of its request. It also issued subpoenas seeking records from Flynn's businesses. One of the businesses, Flynn Intel Group Inc., did consulting work for a Turkish businessman that required Flynn to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent earlier this year. The other, Flynn Intel Group LLC, was used to accept money from Flynn's paid speeches. Among the payments was more than $33,000 Flynn received from RT, the Russian state-sponsored television network that U.S. intelligence officials have branded as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin. On Tuesday, a person close to Flynn said he will turn over documents related to the two businesses as well as some personal documents the committee sought in the narrower request. Flynn plans to produce some of the documents by next week, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Flynn's private interactions with the committee. While the Senate committee awaits documents from Flynn, Putin and Trump both dismissed the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic emails. In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Putin reaffirmed his strong denial of Russian involvement in the hacking. The interview was recorded during Putin's Monday trip to Paris and released Tuesday. Putin also said the allegations are "fiction" invented by the Democrats in order to explain their loss. Trump made a similar claim in a tweet early Tuesday: "Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News." Meanwhile, Cohen, Trump's personal attorney, told the AP that he turned down a request for information from the House intelligence committee looking into the Russian interference. "I declined the invitation to participate as the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered," Cohen said. "I find it irresponsible and improper that the request sent to me was leaked by those working on the committee." Earlier Tuesday, the AP reported, citing a congressional aide, that the House intelligence committee had subpoenaed Cohen. The aide later retracted the statement. Cohen said if he is subpoenaed, he will comply. Cohen, a longtime attorney for the Trump Organization, remains a personal lawyer for Trump. He served as a cable television surrogate for the Republican during the presidential campaign. Cohen told ABC News that he had been asked by both the House and Senate intelligence committees to provide information and testimony about contacts he had with Russian officials. Cohen's ties with Russian interests came up in February when The New York Times reported that Cohen helped to broker a Ukraine peace plan that would call for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and a referendum to let Ukrainians decide whether the part of the country seized by Russia in 2014 should be leased to Moscow. The Russian government denied knowing anything about such a plan. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

The Times reported that the peace plan was the work of Felix Sater, a business associate who has helped Trump try to find business in Russia, and Cohen. Cohen was a fierce defender of Trump during the campaign, often haranguing probing reporters and famously challenging a CNN reporter live on-air to name the specific polls that showed then-candidate Trump behind his rival, Hillary Clinton. In the early 2000s, he formed his own firm working on a range of legal matters, including malpractice cases, business law and work on an ethanol business in Ukraine. Cohen also owned and operated a handful of taxi medallions, managing a fleet of cabs in New York. Cohen's business associates in the taxi enterprise included a number of men from the former Soviet Union, including his Ukrainian-born father-in-law. Cohen has made his own unsuccessful attempts at public office, losing a city council race and briefly running for state assembly in New York. The House intelligence committee has also sought information from Epshteyn, a former staffer in the Trump White House. Epshteyn said in a statement that he has asked the committee questions to better understand what information it is seeking and will determine whether he can reasonably provide it. Epshteyn, who grew up in Moscow, worked a short time in the White House press office. He left in March and now works as a political analyst for right-leaning Sinclair Broadcasting. __ Associated Press writers Julie Bykowicz, Eileen Sullivan and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.

Flynn’s decision Tuesday came as President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, rejected a House intelligence committee request for information, and former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the House investigation. Meanwhile, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sounded similar tones as they criticized the ongoing U.S. scrutiny of Russia’s attempts to sway the presidential election. Flynn’s cooperation was the first signal that he and the Senate panel have found common ground. Congressional investigators continue to press for key documents in the ongoing investigation, and the retired lieutenant general is trying to limit damaging disclosures that hostile Democratic lawmakers could use against him. Flynn had previously invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination in declining an earlier subpoena from the committee, which sought a wide array of documents and information related to his contacts with Russia. Flynn’s attorneys had argued the request was too broad and would have required Flynn to turn over information that could have been used against him. In response, the Senate panel narrowed the scope of its request. It also issued subpoenas seeking records from Flynn’s businesses. One of the businesses, Flynn Intel Group Inc., did consulting work for a Turkish businessman that required Flynn to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent earlier this year. The other, Flynn Intel Group LLC, was used to accept money from Flynn’s paid speeches. Among the payments was more than $33,000 Flynn received from RT, the Russian state-sponsored television network that U.S. intelligence officials have branded as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin. On Tuesday, a person close to Flynn said he will turn over documents related to the two businesses as well as some personal documents the committee sought in the narrower request. Flynn plans to produce some of the documents by next week, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Flynn’s private interactions with the committee. While the Senate committee awaits documents from Flynn, Putin and Trump both dismissed the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic emails. In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Putin reaffirmed his strong denial of Russian involvement in the hacking. The interview was recorded during Putin’s Monday trip to Paris and released Tuesday. Putin also said the allegations are “fiction” invented by the Democrats in order to explain their loss. Trump made a similar claim in a tweet early Tuesday: “Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.” Meanwhile, Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney, told the AP that he turned down a request for information from the House intelligence committee looking into the Russian interference. “I declined the invitation to participate as the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered,” Cohen said. “I find it irresponsible and improper that the request sent to me was leaked by those working on the committee.” Earlier Tuesday, the AP reported, citing a congressional aide, that the House intelligence committee had subpoenaed Cohen. The aide later retracted the statement. Cohen said if he is subpoenaed, he will comply. Cohen, a longtime attorney for the Trump Organization, remains a personal lawyer for Trump.

Blog Intel to Strike Thunderbolt in CPUs Ryan Shrout 5/31/2017 08:00 AM EDT  4 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet Thunderbolt is finally on the path to mass adoption thanks to Intel's move to integrate it in future processors and make licensing it easier. With speeds of 40 Gbits/second, plug-and-play support and a single unified cable design, Thunderbolt should be the most adopted and accepted cabling interface in the market today. But sullied by a quagmire of complications around ports, licenses, hardware integration and more, its uptake has been somewhat stagnant. When Thunderbolt was first released, the motherboards, systems and notebooks that integrated it had a significant price premium. With Thunderbolt 2 and now 3, costs have come down some, but accessories like expansion docks and external storage are still significantly more expensive than USB 3.0 or USB 3.1 counterparts. Unfortunately there’s a large amount of confusion in the market around the Type-C connector USB 3.1 and Thunderbolt 3 share. Type-C is a form factor of cable and port that can be used for USB 3.1 Gen1 (essentially running at USB 3.0 speeds), Gen2 (at up to 10 Gbits/s) and Thunderbolt 3 (up to 40 Gbits/s with other features). Many systems for sale today have USB Type-C ports that may support USB or Thunderbolt or both. To know the difference, the consumer is asked to read a tiny icon that differs from vendor to vendor on the side of their machine. In some instances, a machine might have multiple kinds of Type-C ports on it. Another drawback for Thunderbolt 3 is that support for true plug-and-play compatibility varies depending on the chipset on either side of the connection. TB3 promised USB-like connectivity without rebooting systems, but in some cases that process only works one-way (plugging in or unplugging) or it might be slightly unstable. The low quantity of Thunderbolt accessories on the market is another concern. External connectivity docks have been slow to come to market, external storage options are slim at full TB3 speed (and are expensive when found), and the number of Thunderbolt-ready displays is small. Intel thinks it has solution. The company will begin to integrate Thunderbolt 3 directly onto the CPU although it hasn’t specified when. Because the underlying architecture of Thunderbolt is PCI Express, Intel could either add additional PCIe lanes to future architectures or it could redistribute the existing ones into the necessary Thunderbolt processing logic on-package or on-die. This move will lower both cost and power draw. OEMs will not need a separate, external Thunderbolt controller and tracing on a motherboard, enabling thinner, lighter systems with longer battery life. I also assume integration will lower overall power consumption of the combined CPU+Thunderbolt product if Intel builds the controller on the same process technology node as the CPU. We should see a near universal adoption of Thunderbolt 3 on platforms using these processors. Rising numbers of Thunderbolt systems will inspire more vendors and accessory companies to build more products for the interconnect. Intel is also changing the licensing policy for Thunderbolt, moving to a non-exclusive, royalty-free license. This removes another cost restriction, allowing third parties to build Thunderbolt-capable controllers for storage, displays, docks and more without worrying about associated fees. Without the need for an Alpine Ridge chip from Intel, more accessories at lower prices will grow the market. No one can predict when this will happen until Intel says when it will release the integrated CPUs. Nevertheless, I fully expect this move will drive Thunderbolt into mass adoption and even to the universality we see in USB today. External storage, networking connectivity, high resolution HDR displays, external graphics solutions, productivity docks and many more products should flourish. --Ryan Shrout is the founder and lead analyst at Shrout Research and the owner of PC Perspective.

Ideally you want low cost, low power and wireless while delivering sufficient bandwidth and power. If you think about it , wired is more about power delivery than data transfer. USB is mostly used to charge phones or power peripherals/accessories that don't have their own power source. WiFi or 5G can't do power delivery yet but that would be the path forward, The world needs better batteries and better wireless charging as bandwidth is more than sufficient for most applications. Mechanical volume and cost is problematic today for wireless charging. Apple is rumored to be adding wireless charging this year. Short term they'll overcharge for the the charger and generate billions in revenue every year but beyond that the path forward is about more than just revenue. Could be interesting if they have a magnetic area on the back of the phone used not only for charging but that can wirelessly power accessories- just came up with the idea , yet to figure out how to best implement it and if it's feasible. Long story short, you got data and power, wireless has been focused on just data and needs to catch up.

You do realize that the PC has 10 years left to live, that units will drop bellow 200 million in just a few years, that most PCs are low end while fewer and fewer in consumer and that very very few peripherals require this kind of bandwidth. Intel lacks the scale to drive Thuderbolt adoption, those times are gone. Not that Thunderbolt is what the world needs.

Cohen also owned and operated a handful of taxi medallions, managing a fleet of cabs in New York. Cohen’s business associates in the taxi enterprise included a number of men from the former Soviet Union, including his Ukrainian-born father-in-law. Cohen has made his own unsuccessful attempts at public office, losing a city council race and briefly running for state assembly in New York. The House intelligence committee has also sought information from Epshteyn, a former staffer in the Trump White House. Epshteyn said in a statement that he has asked the committee questions to better understand what information it is seeking and will determine whether he can reasonably provide it. Epshteyn, who grew up in Moscow, worked a short time in the White House press office. He left in March and now works as a political analyst for right-leaning Sinclair Broadcasting. __ Associated Press writers Julie Bykowicz, Eileen Sullivan and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.

Here is your morning briefing. Weather The highs will be in the high 50s, with an overcast sky and early morning rain. Check your local forecast here. National and international headlines Kathy Griffin apologizes for severed Donald Trump head photo after backlash Comedian Kathy Griffin blows a kiss at photographers at the 20th Annual Fulfillment Fund Stars benefit gala in Beverly Hills, California in this Oct. 14, 2014 file photo. REUTERS file Comedian Kathy Griffin said she was “not afraid to do images that make noise.” But the picture of her holding a prop of President Donald Trump’s severed head would lead to an apology after criticism came from the president’s son, a Clinton and many more. In a video posted on Twitter and Instagram, Griffin said that she crossed the line and that the image was too disturbing. “I sincerely apologize I am just now seeing the reaction of these images,” she said of the picture first published by TMZ. She tweeted: “I am sorry. I went too far. I was wrong.” Trump targets ‘negative press covfefe’ in garbled midnight tweet President Donald Trump delivers remarks to U.S. troops at the Naval Air Station Sigonella before returning to Washington D.C. at Sigonella Air Force Base in Sigonella, Sicily, Italy, May 27, 2017. JONATHAN ERNST | REUTERS At 12:06 a.m. Wednesday, President Donald Trump tweeted a strange sentence fragment. “Despite the constant negative press covfefe,” it read. That was it. It ended abruptly, as if someone stopped him, or he stopped himself, or perhaps he never meant to send it. It’s a good guess that the word he was looking for was “coverage.” It came out “covfefe.” It was anybody’s guess what words were meant to follow. “Despite the constant negative press covfefe,” what? Within five hours, it had been retweeted more than 115,000 times and “liked” more than 146,000 times – making it one of his most popular tweets in months. Massive blast in the heart of Kabul’s diplomatic quarter kills scores Injured Afghans run from the site of a blast in Kabul, Afghanistan, May 31, 2017. OMAR SOBHANI | REUTERS A massive blast Wednesday tore through the diplomatic quarter of the Afghan capital of Kabul killing at least 80 people, according to officials, underlining the fragility of the country as it buckles under a wave of rebel attacks. The Interior Ministry said the blast was triggered by huge quantity of explosives hidden in a water tank that went off during the peak of the morning rush hour on a busy road in Wazir Akbar Khan area of the city. Wahid Majroh, spokesman of the Health Ministry, said at least 350 people were also wounded. “I felt like it was an earthquake and after that I do not know what happened,” said Mohammed Hassan, 21, who had been attending a bank training program. “All the staff around me, everyone, was injured.” Trump pulling US out of Paris climate deal Participants are seen in silhouette as they look at a screen showing a world map with climate anomalies during the World Climate Change Conference 2015 (COP21) at Le Bourget, near Paris, France, Dec. 8, 2015. Stephane Mahe | REUTERS President Donald Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, Axios news outlet reported Wednesday, citing two unidentified sources with direct knowledge of the decision. Trump, who has previously called global warming a hoax, refused to endorse the landmark climate change accord at a summit of the G7 group of wealthy nations on Saturday, saying he needed more time to decide. He then tweeted that he would make an announcement this week. Fox News also cited an unidentified source confirming the pullout. The decision will put the United States in league with Syria and Nicaragua as the world’s only non-participants in the Paris Climate Agreement. Flynn to hand over documents in response to Senate panel’s subpoena Carlos Barria | REUTERS Former national security adviser Michael Flynn will hand over documents and records to the Senate Intelligence Committee in response to a set of subpoenas for information from his businesses and personal files related to the committee’s probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, according to a person close to Flynn. The subpoenas were issued for two companies Flynn owns, Flynn Intel Group Inc. and Flynn Intel Group LLC. The committee also reissued a third subpoena for personal records, the focus of which was narrowed after Flynn rejected the committee’s initial demand for personal records relating to his contacts with Russian authorities, claiming it was too broad and would jeopardize his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Poll: Most Americans want Senate to change or ditch House health care bill Most Americans hold an unfavorable view of the House-passed health care bill and want the Senate to change it substantially or block it entirely, according to the latest Kaiser Health Tracking Poll. A 55 percent majority of Americans view the Republican-backed American Health Care Act negatively, the same proportion who want the Senate to make major changes to the legislation or reject it, the survey finds. Only 8 percent want the legislation, which would repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, approved as it now stands. Massachusetts heroin trade crackdown leads to 30 arrests A crackdown on Massachusetts’ heroin trade led to the arrests of 30 people on Tuesday on charges they were running a drug-trafficking ring that law enforcement officials said was one of the largest they had ever seen in the state. Authorities said 27 people were arrested in early-morning raids around Lawrence and charged with running a ring that dealt heroin, cocaine and the deadly painkiller fentanyl in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. Three people already had been in custody. Local headlines Why more police departments in Maine are recruiting dogs to their ranks Belfast’s newest officer in training can pinpoint a piece of discarded evidence hidden in thick grass, hurdle an obstacle three times his height, and track down a person even in Maine’s densest wilderness. And he’s only a year old. His name is Dex, a German-Dutch shepherd mix set to become Belfast Police Department’s first police dog since 1989 when its last K-9 handler left for a job with Maine State Police. Dex is among the latest in a growing number of dogs working on behalf of town, county and state police agencies across the state. K-9 units are growing in favor, often thanks to of their ability to track down missing people — whether they be suspects in a crime or children who wandered away from home. In a rural place like Maine, quick access to a dog team can, and does, save lives.

Police: Former bank manager drove getaway car in Bangor robberies The husband and wife accused of robbing a Stillwater Avenue TD Bank branch picked the location because she used to work for the company and is familiar with its policies, police said.

Living and events From trash to table, RSU 19 is seeking to put its food waste to better use Students at Etna-Dixmont Elementary School work on cleaning out the weeds and old plants from the school’s vegetable garden last week. RSU 19 is in the process of overhauling how the school handles its food waste and is working to use more food grown on site in the school’s cafeteria. Gabor Degre | BDN Mid-afternoon on a recent Thursday the students at the Etna-Dixmont School were outside frolicking through a field on the left side of the school. While a passerby might mistake the children’s high spirits for a typical recess session, they were actually participating in a schoolwide garden clean out day. With rakes and rubber boots, the students ripped out remnants of last year’s garden to make way for this year’s planting. The quarter-acre garden at the Etna-Dixmont School is entering its third season of production, but thanks to a massive overhaul of how Regional School Unit 19 handles its food waste, school administrators are hoping the scene at the grade school will soon be the case districtwide. Maine Whoopie Pie Festival seeking bakers and volunteers The 2017 Maine Whoopie Pie Festival, scheduled for June 24, has several open slots remaining for bakers.

Business headlines Maine looks to funnel more tourism dollars to smaller communities A tug-of-war contest held at Belfast Common during the Sixth Maine Celtic Celebration in 2012. BDN file A bill that would boost tourism marketing in Maine’s small towns could be headed for enactment after positive votes in the House and Senate. The bill, sponsored by House Majority Leader Erin Herbig, D-Belfast, and co-sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Garrett Mason, R-Lisbon Falls, is arguably minor in scope. It would earmark $10,000 per year for tourism grants for communities with fewer than 7,000 residents but supporters argued that it could make an outsized difference for rural Maine towns and organizations that have little or no money to promote events. Greater Bangor’s growing food truck scene expands to nine eateries in the area Abby Freethy, the owner of Northwoods Gourmet Girl in Greenville, in the food truck that will be operating in Brewer. Gabor Degre | BDN The food truck scene in greater Bangor has exploded in recent years, hitting a peak this year with nine trucks slated for serving up food around the area. Four trucks have received permits to serve on the Bangor Waterfront. Two have reached agreements to serve in the Bangor Mall area. There will be one on Odlin Road as well. And on Sundays, at the Bangor Farmers’ Market, there’s a truck serving up crepes. A ninth truck is set for the Brewer Waterfront. Bangor’s community and economic development director Tanya Emery says it took a few years for the eating public here to get used to the idea of food trucks in the first place. “Nationally, food trucks have become way more popular in the past five years, and as with many trends, we get them a few years later,” Emery said. “I think it just took people a few seasons to get used to the idea. And now people love it.” Consumers spend at fastest pace in four months in a sign of spring economic rebound Americans ratcheted up their spending in April at the fastest pace in four months in a sign the economy has rebounded this spring after a lackluster winter. The new data also could help push Federal Reserve officials to hike a key interest rate again when they meet in two weeks. Personal consumption expenditures increased 0.4 percent in April, up from 0.3 percent the previous month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Americans had more money to spend, with personal incomes also rising 0.4 percent — twice the pace of growth in March. “Consumers are back out in force this quarter, spending their hearts away after taking the first quarter of the year off,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Mitsubishi UFG Union Bank in New York. Opinion headlines Trump sends a mixed message on addiction treatment U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to President Donald Trump, visited the State House earlier this month for a round-table listening session on the state and nation’s opioid addiction crisis. BDN file If there is one bright spot in President Donald Trump’s proposed budget, it is that his administration reversed course and now wants to maintain funding for the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The administration had proposed eliminating the office and, more recently, suggesting that its funding be cut by 95 percent, which essentially would end its operations. Now, thanks to outcry from lawmakers, including Sen. Angus King, the Trump administration will keep the office and most of its funding. This is good news, but the administration’s growing emphasis on law enforcement and incarceration as the major tools used to ease the nation’s opioid crisis remains concerning. Access to quality health care should be as treasured as our right to free speech George Danby | BDN Whereas few Americans would argue that full equality at birth is an un-American concept or that access to health care should be directly tied to financial capacity, there can be little doubt that most Americans would favor a health care system that increases efficiency, reduces costs and optimizes outcomes. If we can all agree on those values, universal health care should be as treasured as our right to free speech. In Mexico, journalism is the most dangerous profession A portrait of murdered journalist Javier Valdez is seen as a woman places photos of other journalists next to the national Mexican flag, during a demonstration against the killing of journalists in Mexico and to demand justice for the 43 missing students of Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers’ College outside Argentina’s Foreign Ministry in Buenos Aires, Argentina, May 24, 2017 MARCOS BRINDICCI | REUTERS In most countries, panic buttons are devices used by elderly folk who may need emergency care, or parents who want to keep tabs on wandering children and pets. But in Mexico, they’re part of the survival toolkit for journalists covering the drug war, corruption and other man-made miseries, enabling them to send a silent distress signal to authorities. Such is the state of news gathering in Latin America’s second largest nation, which has overtaken Colombia — now emerging from half a century of guerrilla insurgency — to become the Western Hemisphere’s deadliest place to be a journalist.

Flynn will provide some documents to the Senate intelligence committee as part of its probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. A person close to Flynn says that he will be turning over documents related to two of his businesses as well as some personal documents that the committee requested in May 2017. The person says that Flynn plans to produce documents by next week. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) Published May 31. 2017 5:57AM  By CHAD DAY and JAKE PEARSON, Associated Press WASHINGTON — Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn will provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee as part of its probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, The Associated Press has learned. Flynn's decision Tuesday came as President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, rejected a House intelligence committee request for information, and former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the House investigation. Meanwhile, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sounded similar tones as they criticized the ongoing U.S. scrutiny of Russia's attempts to sway the presidential election. Flynn's cooperation was the first signal that he and the Senate panel have found common ground. Congressional investigators continue to press for key documents in the ongoing investigation, and the retired lieutenant general is trying to limit damaging disclosures that hostile Democratic lawmakers could use against him. Flynn had previously invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination in declining an earlier subpoena from the committee, which sought a wide array of documents and information related to his contacts with Russia. Flynn's attorneys had argued the request was too broad and would have required Flynn to turn over information that could have been used against him. In response, the Senate panel narrowed the scope of its request. It also issued subpoenas seeking records from Flynn's businesses. One of the businesses, Flynn Intel Group Inc., did consulting work for a Turkish businessman that required Flynn to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent earlier this year. The other, Flynn Intel Group LLC, was used to accept money from Flynn's paid speeches. Among the payments was more than $33,000 Flynn received from RT, the Russian state-sponsored television network that U.S. intelligence officials have branded as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin. On Tuesday, a person close to Flynn said he will turn over documents related to the two businesses as well as some personal documents the committee sought in the narrower request. Flynn plans to produce some of the documents by next week, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Flynn's private interactions with the committee. While the Senate committee awaits documents from Flynn, Putin and Trump both dismissed the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic emails. In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Putin reaffirmed his strong denial of Russian involvement in the hacking. The interview was recorded during Putin's Monday trip to Paris and released Tuesday. Putin also said the allegations are "fiction" invented by the Democrats in order to explain their loss. Trump made a similar claim in a tweet early Tuesday: "Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News." Meanwhile, Cohen, Trump's personal attorney, told the AP that he turned down a request for information from the House intelligence committee looking into the Russian interference. "I declined the invitation to participate as the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered," Cohen said. "I find it irresponsible and improper that the request sent to me was leaked by those working on the committee." Earlier Tuesday, the AP reported, citing a congressional aide, that the House intelligence committee had subpoenaed Cohen. The aide later retracted the statement. Cohen said if he is subpoenaed, he will comply. Cohen, a longtime attorney for the Trump Organization, remains a personal lawyer for Trump. He served as a cable television surrogate for the Republican during the presidential campaign. Cohen told ABC News that he had been asked by both the House and Senate intelligence committees to provide information and testimony about contacts he had with Russian officials. Cohen's ties with Russian interests came up in February when The New York Times reported that Cohen helped to broker a Ukraine peace plan that would call for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and a referendum to let Ukrainians decide whether the part of the country seized by Russia in 2014 should be leased to Moscow. The Russian government denied knowing anything about such a plan. The Times reported that the peace plan was the work of Felix Sater, a business associate who has helped Trump try to find business in Russia, and Cohen. Cohen was a fierce defender of Trump during the campaign, often haranguing probing reporters and famously challenging a CNN reporter live on-air to name the specific polls that showed then-candidate Trump behind his rival, Hillary Clinton. In the early 2000s, he formed his own firm working on a range of legal matters, including malpractice cases, business law and work on an ethanol business in Ukraine. Cohen also owned and operated a handful of taxi medallions, managing a fleet of cabs in New York. Cohen's business associates in the taxi enterprise included a number of men from the former Soviet Union, including his Ukrainian-born father-in-law. Cohen has made his own unsuccessful attempts at public office, losing a city council race and briefly running for state assembly in New York. The House intelligence committee has also sought information from Epshteyn, a former staffer in the Trump White House. Epshteyn said in a statement that he has asked the committee questions to better understand what information it is seeking and will determine whether he can reasonably provide it. Epshteyn, who grew up in Moscow, worked a short time in the White House press office. He left in March and now works as a political analyst for right-leaning Sinclair Broadcasting. Associated Press writers Julie Bykowicz, Eileen Sullivan and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report. Pearson reported from New York.

To support that vision, Intel is making its current and future modems compatible with e-SIMs, so future laptops can connect to LTE networks without physical SIM-card trays. That's because the technology you'd typically find in a SIM card will be embedded into its modems, so you can connect your machine just by entering a phone number and avoid having to fiddle with a tiny tray, Engadget said. The chip maker says it is working on validating "e-SIM-enabled always-connected platforms with multiple carriers using the Intel XMMTM 7260 modem and our upcoming Intel XMM 7360 modem." At its keynote, Microsoft announced a slew of carriers that will support the e-SIM devices, including T-Mobile, AT&T, Vodafone and other international service providers. The always connected PC project is another part of the two brands' Project Evo collaboration to deliver Windows devices across multiple product categories.

(NASDAQ:MU) Invests In Hiroshima fab By John Heffernan on May 31, 2017No Comment Share on Facebook Follow on Facebook Add to Google+ Connect on Linked in Subscribe by Email Print This Post Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) Invests In Hiroshima fab Micron At A Three-And-A-Half-Year High Memory makers are starting to see the light—RGB lighting, that is. RGB illumination has exploded in popularity to the point where even memory modules are now shipping with multi-color LEDs. Micron is the latest to join the party through its Ballistix division. Micron is to spend $2 billion over the next two to three years equipping its Hiroshima fab, according to the Nikkei. The Hiroshima fab used to be owned by Elpida which Micron bought for $2.5 billion in 2013. The Elpida acquisition gave Micron a stronger position in mobile DRAM. Micron Technology, Inc. is engaged in semiconductor systems. The Company’s portfolio of memory technologies, including dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), negative-AND (NAND) Flash and NOR Flash are the basis for solid-state drives, modules, multi-chip packages and other system solutions. Its business segments include Compute and Networking Business Unit (CNBU), which includes memory products sold into compute, networking, graphics and cloud server markets; Mobile Business Unit (MBU), which includes memory products sold into smartphone, tablet and other mobile-device markets; Storage Business Unit (SBU), which includes memory products sold into enterprise, client, cloud and removable storage markets, and SBU also includes products sold to Intel through its Intel/Micron Flash Technology (IMFT) joint venture, and Embedded Business Unit (EBU), which includes memory products sold into automotive, industrial, connected home and consumer electronics markets. Overall, the bias in prices is: Upwards. Short term: Prices are moving. Intermediate term: Prices are trending. Note: this chart shows extraordinary price action to the upside. The projected upper bound is: 32.55. The projected lower bound is: 29.05. The projected closing price is: 30.80. MICRON TECH closed up 0.940 at 30.700. Volume was 100% below average (consolidating) and Bollinger Bands were 2% narrower than normal.

Summary MICRON TECH gapped up today (bullish) on light volume. Possibility of a Common Gap which usually coincides with a lack of interest in the security. Common Gaps are fairly irrelevent for forecasting purposes. Four types of price gaps exist – Common, Breakaway, Runaway, and Exhaustion. Gaps acts as support/resistance. MICRON TECH is currently 39.3% above its 200-period moving average and is in an upward trend. Volatility is high as compared to the average volatility over the last 10 periods. Our volume indicators reflect volume flowing into and out of MU.O at a relatively equal pace (neutral). Our trend forecasting oscillators are currently bullish on MU.O and have had this outlook for the last 3 periods. Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 94.6194. This is an overbought reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses below 80 The last signal was a buy 6 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 68.60. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 37 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 176.This is an overbought reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses below 100. The last signal was a buy 7 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 2 period(s) ago.   computer, heffx, highlights, Hiroshima, Micron, MU, NASDAQ, Ram, US Micron Technology, Inc.

Andrew Harnik, File AP Photo National Business May 31, 2017 7:32 PM House committee issues subpoenas; Comey OK'd to testify By DEB RIECHMANN and JAKE PEARSON Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON The House intelligence committee said Wednesday it is issuing subpoenas for former national security adviser Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as their businesses, as part of its investigation into Russian activities during last year's election. In addition to those four subpoenas, the committee has issued three others — to the National Security Agency, the FBI and the CIA — for information about requests that government officials made to "unmask" the identities of U.S. individuals named in classified intelligence reports, according to a congressional aide. The subpoenas were announced as the special counsel overseeing the government's investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia has approved former FBI Director James Comey to testify before the Senate intelligence committee, according to a Comey associate. At a Wednesday briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer said inquiries about the Russia investigation must be directed to Marc Kasowitz, another of Trump's personal attorneys. It marked the first time the White House had officially acknowledged that outside counsel had been retained. Calls and emails to Kasowitz's New York firm were not immediately returned Wednesday. The Comey associate, who wasn't authorized to discuss details of the testimony and spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to discuss the content of Comey's planned testimony. The associate did say that Robert Mueller, whom the Justice Department appointed earlier this month to lead the government's inquiry, is allowing Comey to make certain statements. Lawmakers are likely to ask Comey about his interactions with Trump as the bureau pursued its investigation into his campaign's contacts. Associates have said Comey wrote memos describing certain interactions with Trump that gave him pause in the months after the election, including details of a dinner in which he claimed the president asked him to pledge his loyalty, and a request to shut down the investigation of Flynn. A spokesman for Mueller, a former FBI director, declined to comment. Mueller's separate probe could conceivably look at the circumstances surrounding Comey's firing. Congress is currently out of session. It resumes next Tuesday. No date for Comey's testimony has been set. The Associated Press reported earlier this month that Comey planned to testify before the Senate committee after Memorial Day, but the approval from Mueller to do so could indicate that date is fast approaching. A spokeswoman for the committee's chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said the committee welcomes Comey's testimony, but declined to comment further. The House panel pursuing its own investigation of the Trump campaign and possible Russia ties has also sought information from Comey, asking the FBI to turn over documents related to his interactions with both the White House and the Justice Department. Subpoenas were approved Wednesday for Flynn and his company, Flynn Intel Group, and Cohen, and his firm, Michael D. Cohen & Associates. Cohen, who had refused an earlier request for information, saying it was "not capable of being answered," told The Associated Press on Wednesday, "If subpoenaed, I will work with my lawyers to cooperate with the various investigations." The subpoenas sent to government agencies were related to Trump's complaints that Obama administration officials had asked, for political reasons, to be told the names of Trump associates documented in intelligence reports. Officials only "unmask" the identities of Americans for certain reasons — for example, if the name of a person is needed to understand the intelligence being provided. Another senior committee aide said any subpoenas related to the unmasking issue would have been sent by committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who recused himself from the Russia investigation after being criticized for being too close to the White House. The committee aide, who wasn't authorized to discuss the issue and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the action would have been taken without agreement from the Democratic minority on the committee. Trump has repeatedly dismissed allegations that his campaign collaborated with Russia ahead of the presidential election. Early Wednesday morning, the president tweeted "Witch Hunt!" in reference to testimony by Comey and former CIA director John Brennan before Congress on the topic. Also Wednesday, a Justice Department official confirmed that Mueller had named a top Justice Department official to his team. Andrew Weissmann had been head of the criminal division's fraud section since 2015. The longtime Justice official previously served as FBI general counsel under Mueller. He began his career with Justice in 1991 at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York. He later joined and ran the Enron Task Force. The department official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to publicly announce the appointment.

Andrew Harnik, File AP Photo Business May 31, 2017 7:32 PM House committee issues subpoenas; Comey OK'd to testify By DEB RIECHMANN and JAKE PEARSON Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON The House intelligence committee said Wednesday it is issuing subpoenas for former national security adviser Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as their businesses, as part of its investigation into Russian activities during last year's election. In addition to those four subpoenas, the committee has issued three others — to the National Security Agency, the FBI and the CIA — for information about requests that government officials made to "unmask" the identities of U.S. individuals named in classified intelligence reports, according to a congressional aide. The subpoenas were announced as the special counsel overseeing the government's investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia has approved former FBI Director James Comey to testify before the Senate intelligence committee, according to a Comey associate. At a Wednesday briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer said inquiries about the Russia investigation must be directed to Marc Kasowitz, another of Trump's personal attorneys. It marked the first time the White House had officially acknowledged that outside counsel had been retained. Calls and emails to Kasowitz's New York firm were not immediately returned Wednesday. The Comey associate, who wasn't authorized to discuss details of the testimony and spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to discuss the content of Comey's planned testimony. The associate did say that Robert Mueller, whom the Justice Department appointed earlier this month to lead the government's inquiry, is allowing Comey to make certain statements. Lawmakers are likely to ask Comey about his interactions with Trump as the bureau pursued its investigation into his campaign's contacts. Associates have said Comey wrote memos describing certain interactions with Trump that gave him pause in the months after the election, including details of a dinner in which he claimed the president asked him to pledge his loyalty, and a request to shut down the investigation of Flynn. A spokesman for Mueller, a former FBI director, declined to comment. Mueller's separate probe could conceivably look at the circumstances surrounding Comey's firing. Congress is currently out of session. It resumes next Tuesday. No date for Comey's testimony has been set. The Associated Press reported earlier this month that Comey planned to testify before the Senate committee after Memorial Day, but the approval from Mueller to do so could indicate that date is fast approaching. A spokeswoman for the committee's chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said the committee welcomes Comey's testimony, but declined to comment further. The House panel pursuing its own investigation of the Trump campaign and possible Russia ties has also sought information from Comey, asking the FBI to turn over documents related to his interactions with both the White House and the Justice Department. Subpoenas were approved Wednesday for Flynn and his company, Flynn Intel Group, and Cohen, and his firm, Michael D. Cohen & Associates. Cohen, who had refused an earlier request for information, saying it was "not capable of being answered," told The Associated Press on Wednesday, "If subpoenaed, I will work with my lawyers to cooperate with the various investigations." The subpoenas sent to government agencies were related to Trump's complaints that Obama administration officials had asked, for political reasons, to be told the names of Trump associates documented in intelligence reports. Officials only "unmask" the identities of Americans for certain reasons — for example, if the name of a person is needed to understand the intelligence being provided. Another senior committee aide said any subpoenas related to the unmasking issue would have been sent by committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who recused himself from the Russia investigation after being criticized for being too close to the White House. The committee aide, who wasn't authorized to discuss the issue and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the action would have been taken without agreement from the Democratic minority on the committee. Trump has repeatedly dismissed allegations that his campaign collaborated with Russia ahead of the presidential election. Early Wednesday morning, the president tweeted "Witch Hunt!" in reference to testimony by Comey and former CIA director John Brennan before Congress on the topic. Also Wednesday, a Justice Department official confirmed that Mueller had named a top Justice Department official to his team. Andrew Weissmann had been head of the criminal division's fraud section since 2015. The longtime Justice official previously served as FBI general counsel under Mueller. He began his career with Justice in 1991 at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York. He later joined and ran the Enron Task Force. The department official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to publicly announce the appointment.

Andrew Harnik, File AP Photo National Business May 31, 2017 7:32 PM House committee issues subpoenas; Comey OK'd to testify By DEB RIECHMANN and JAKE PEARSON Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON The House intelligence committee said Wednesday it is issuing subpoenas for former national security adviser Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as their businesses, as part of its investigation into Russian activities during last year's election. In addition to those four subpoenas, the committee has issued three others — to the National Security Agency, the FBI and the CIA — for information about requests that government officials made to "unmask" the identities of U.S. individuals named in classified intelligence reports, according to a congressional aide. The subpoenas were announced as the special counsel overseeing the government's investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia has approved former FBI Director James Comey to testify before the Senate intelligence committee, according to a Comey associate. At a Wednesday briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer said inquiries about the Russia investigation must be directed to Marc Kasowitz, another of Trump's personal attorneys. It marked the first time the White House had officially acknowledged that outside counsel had been retained. Calls and emails to Kasowitz's New York firm were not immediately returned Wednesday. The Comey associate, who wasn't authorized to discuss details of the testimony and spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to discuss the content of Comey's planned testimony. The associate did say that Robert Mueller, whom the Justice Department appointed earlier this month to lead the government's inquiry, is allowing Comey to make certain statements. Lawmakers are likely to ask Comey about his interactions with Trump as the bureau pursued its investigation into his campaign's contacts. Associates have said Comey wrote memos describing certain interactions with Trump that gave him pause in the months after the election, including details of a dinner in which he claimed the president asked him to pledge his loyalty, and a request to shut down the investigation of Flynn. A spokesman for Mueller, a former FBI director, declined to comment. Mueller's separate probe could conceivably look at the circumstances surrounding Comey's firing. Congress is currently out of session. It resumes next Tuesday. No date for Comey's testimony has been set. The Associated Press reported earlier this month that Comey planned to testify before the Senate committee after Memorial Day, but the approval from Mueller to do so could indicate that date is fast approaching. A spokeswoman for the committee's chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said the committee welcomes Comey's testimony, but declined to comment further. The House panel pursuing its own investigation of the Trump campaign and possible Russia ties has also sought information from Comey, asking the FBI to turn over documents related to his interactions with both the White House and the Justice Department. Subpoenas were approved Wednesday for Flynn and his company, Flynn Intel Group, and Cohen, and his firm, Michael D. Cohen & Associates. Cohen, who had refused an earlier request for information, saying it was "not capable of being answered," told The Associated Press on Wednesday, "If subpoenaed, I will work with my lawyers to cooperate with the various investigations." The subpoenas sent to government agencies were related to Trump's complaints that Obama administration officials had asked, for political reasons, to be told the names of Trump associates documented in intelligence reports. Officials only "unmask" the identities of Americans for certain reasons — for example, if the name of a person is needed to understand the intelligence being provided. Another senior committee aide said any subpoenas related to the unmasking issue would have been sent by committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who recused himself from the Russia investigation after being criticized for being too close to the White House. The committee aide, who wasn't authorized to discuss the issue and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the action would have been taken without agreement from the Democratic minority on the committee. Trump has repeatedly dismissed allegations that his campaign collaborated with Russia ahead of the presidential election. Early Wednesday morning, the president tweeted "Witch Hunt!" in reference to testimony by Comey and former CIA director John Brennan before Congress on the topic. Also Wednesday, a Justice Department official confirmed that Mueller had named a top Justice Department official to his team. Andrew Weissmann had been head of the criminal division's fraud section since 2015. The longtime Justice official previously served as FBI general counsel under Mueller. He began his career with Justice in 1991 at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York. He later joined and ran the Enron Task Force. The department official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to publicly announce the appointment.

Comey's testimony will likely exclude details pertaining to the FBI's investigation into potential collusion between both parties. Comey has met with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to ensure he can testify without creating “legal entanglements as a result of his public account.” Since his abrupt firing, there has been much reporting done on the tense relationship that Comey kept record of in memos. Media: Wibbitz WASHINGTON (AP) — The House intelligence committee said Wednesday it is issuing subpoenas for former national security adviser Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as their businesses, as part of its investigation into Russian activities during last year's election. In addition to those four subpoenas, the committee has issued three others — to the National Security Agency, the FBI and the CIA — for information about requests that government officials made to "unmask" the identities of U.S. individuals named in classified intelligence reports, according to a congressional aide. The subpoenas were announced as the special counsel overseeing the government's investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia has approved former FBI Director James Comey to testify before the Senate intelligence committee, according to a Comey associate.

It marked the first time the White House had officially acknowledged that outside counsel had been retained. Calls and emails to Kasowitz's New York firm were not immediately returned Wednesday. The Comey associate, who wasn't authorized to discuss details of the testimony and spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to discuss the content of Comey's planned testimony. The associate did say that Robert Mueller, whom the Justice Department appointed earlier this month to lead the government's inquiry, is allowing Comey to make certain statements. Lawmakers are likely to ask Comey about his interactions with Trump as the bureau pursued its investigation into his campaign's contacts. Latest news videos Associates have said Comey wrote memos describing certain interactions with Trump that gave him pause in the months after the election, including details of a dinner in which he claimed the president asked him to pledge his loyalty, and a request to shut down the investigation of Flynn. A spokesman for Mueller, a former FBI director, declined to comment. Mueller's separate probe could conceivably look at the circumstances surrounding Comey's firing. Congress is currently out of session. It resumes next Tuesday. No date for Comey's testimony has been set. The Associated Press reported earlier this month that Comey planned to testify before the Senate committee after Memorial Day, but the approval from Mueller to do so could indicate that date is fast approaching. A spokeswoman for the committee's chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said the committee welcomes Comey's testimony, but declined to comment further. The House panel pursuing its own investigation of the Trump campaign and possible Russia ties has also sought information from Comey, asking the FBI to turn over documents related to his interactions with both the White House and the Justice Department. Subpoenas were approved Wednesday for Flynn and his company, Flynn Intel Group, and Cohen, and his firm, Michael D. Cohen & Associates. Cohen, who had refused an earlier request for information, saying it was "not capable of being answered," told The Associated Press on Wednesday, "If subpoenaed, I will work with my lawyers to cooperate with the various investigations." The subpoenas sent to government agencies were related to Trump's complaints that Obama administration officials had asked, for political reasons, to be told the names of Trump associates documented in intelligence reports. Officials only "unmask" the identities of Americans for certain reasons — for example, if the name of a person is needed to understand the intelligence being provided. Another senior committee aide said any subpoenas related to the unmasking issue would have been sent by committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who recused himself from the Russia investigation after being criticized for being too close to the White House. The committee aide, who wasn't authorized to discuss the issue and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the action would have been taken without agreement from the Democratic minority on the committee. Trump has repeatedly dismissed allegations that his campaign collaborated with Russia ahead of the presidential election. Early Wednesday morning, the president tweeted "Witch Hunt!" in reference to testimony by Comey and former CIA director John Brennan before Congress on the topic. Also Wednesday, a Justice Department official confirmed that Mueller had named a top Justice Department official to his team. Andrew Weissmann had been head of the criminal division's fraud section since 2015. The longtime Justice official previously served as FBI general counsel under Mueller. He began his career with Justice in 1991 at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York. He later joined and ran the Enron Task Force. The department official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to publicly announce the appointment. __ Pearson reported from New York.

The International Cricket Council's Cricket Committee treads cautiously on such matters as they have to take into consideration all the stakeholders of the game, including spectators and the players. Over the years, cricket has incorporated into the game a few of the latest technological advances available. At the same time, there have been a few rejections of technology. In 1992, when India took on South Africa in a Test match in Durban, the concept of third umpire came into existence, who in turn could be consulted for the decisions: run-outs, stumpings and boundaries. 16 years later, the Decision Review System was trialled during the Test series between India and Sri Lanka. The DRS provides the chance for the players to challenge decisions made by the on-field umpires, and have them referred to the third umpire. It led to new technologies like Hawk-Eye, UltraEdge, Snickometer, Hot Spot being used. SpiderCam, Stump Camera, Ball Spin RPM/ Rev Counter, PitchVision, LED Bails have also enhanced the game of cricket. For the upcoming Champions Trophy 2017 to be held in England, Intel, the reputed chip-maker, has created a string of amazing innovations that will be showcased at the eight-team tournament. Pitch Analysis Drones and Bat Sensor are two of the devices set to be showcased. The Intel Falcon 8 Drone, supplied with HD and infrared cameras, will be taken into consideration for advanced pitch analysis before every game. Images captured by the drone will provide "rich visual data on pitch conditions such as [the amount of] grass cover, grass health and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts". Bat Sensors are related to batsmen, who can analyse their game, and improve on it to get better results. It would also lead to new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling experience with regard to broadcasting. Intel has powered the sensor with its Curie technology that is attached to the bat handle to produce information for every shot the batsman plays. With the help of this technology, different variables like Bat Speed at Impact, maximum bat speed, back-lift angle (assessing the angle of the bat within the back-lift as the ball meets the willow), Time to Impact (gauging the time between the back-lift of the bat through to the resultant impact of the ball) and follow-through angle can be traced for every cricket shot. Intel is also expected to exhibit VR experience zones at The Oval and Edgbaston to help fans experience facing a virtual bowler in an 'immersive cricketing environment'. "We couldn't be more excited to have Intel as our 'Official Innovation Partner' of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017," said David Richardson, ICC's chief executive. "The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort," Richardson added in a statement. "Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitisation and personalisation of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports," said Sandra Lopez, Vice President, Intel Sports Group. © Cricbuzz Share Tweet Share TAGS ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 RELATED STORIES New Zealand to rely on aggression against Australia: Mike Hesson Coach controversy won't impact India's CT campaign, feels Laxman Mathews likely to miss South Africa clash View-Counterview: Should the Champions Trophy be scrapped?

WASHINGTON — Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn will provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee as part of its probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, The Associated Press has learned. Flynn’s decision Tuesday came as President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, rejected a House intelligence committee request for information, and former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the House investigation. Meanwhile, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sounded similar tones as they criticized the ongoing U.S. scrutiny of Russia’s attempts to sway the presidential election. Flynn’s cooperation was the first signal that he and the Senate panel have found common ground. Congressional investigators continue to press for key documents in the ongoing investigation, and the retired lieutenant general is trying to limit damaging disclosures that hostile Democratic lawmakers could use against him. Flynn had previously invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination in declining an earlier subpoena from the committee, which sought a wide array of documents and information related to his contacts with Russia. Flynn’s attorneys had argued the request was too broad and would have required Flynn to turn over information that could have been used against him. In response, the Senate panel narrowed the scope of its request. It also issued subpoenas seeking records from Flynn’s businesses. One of the businesses, Flynn Intel Group Inc., did consulting work for a Turkish businessman that required Flynn to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent earlier this year. The other, Flynn Intel Group LLC, was used to accept money from Flynn’s paid speeches. Among the payments was more than $33,000 Flynn received from RT, the Russian state-sponsored television network that U.S. intelligence officials have branded as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin. On Tuesday, a person close to Flynn said he will turn over documents related to the two businesses as well as some personal documents the committee sought in the narrower request. Flynn plans to produce some of the documents by next week, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Flynn’s private interactions with the committee. While the Senate committee awaits documents from Flynn, Putin and Trump both dismissed the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic emails. In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Putin reaffirmed his strong denial of Russian involvement in the hacking. The interview was recorded during Putin’s Monday trip to Paris and released Tuesday. Putin also said the allegations are “fiction” invented by the Democrats in order to explain their loss. Trump made a similar claim in a tweet early Tuesday: “Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.” Meanwhile, Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney, told the AP that he turned down a request for information from the House intelligence committee looking into the Russian interference. “I declined the invitation to participate as the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered,” Cohen said. “I find it irresponsible and improper that the request sent to me was leaked by those working on the committee.” Earlier Tuesday, the AP reported, citing a congressional aide, that the House intelligence committee had subpoenaed Cohen. The aide later retracted the statement. Cohen said if he is subpoenaed, he will comply. Cohen, a longtime attorney for the Trump Organization, remains a personal lawyer for Trump. He served as a cable television surrogate for the Republican during the presidential campaign. Cohen told ABC News that he had been asked by both the House and Senate intelligence committees to provide information and testimony about contacts he had with Russian officials. Cohen’s ties with Russian interests came up in February when The New York Times reported that Cohen helped to broker a Ukraine peace plan that would call for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and a referendum to let Ukrainians decide whether the part of the country seized by Russia in 2014 should be leased to Moscow. The Russian government denied knowing anything about such a plan. The Times reported that the peace plan was the work of Felix Sater, a business associate who has helped Trump try to find business in Russia, and Cohen. Cohen was a fierce defender of Trump during the campaign, often haranguing probing reporters and famously challenging a CNN reporter live on-air to name the specific polls that showed then-candidate Trump behind his rival, Hillary Clinton. In the early 2000s, he formed his own firm working on a range of legal matters, including malpractice cases, business law and work on an ethanol business in Ukraine. Cohen also owned and operated a handful of taxi medallions, managing a fleet of cabs in New York. Cohen’s business associates in the taxi enterprise included a number of men from the former Soviet Union, including his Ukrainian-born father-in-law. Cohen has made his own unsuccessful attempts at public office, losing a city council race and briefly running for state assembly in New York. The House intelligence committee has also sought information from Epshteyn, a former staffer in the Trump White House. Epshteyn said in a statement that he has asked the committee questions to better understand what information it is seeking and will determine whether he can reasonably provide it. Epshteyn, who grew up in Moscow, worked a short time in the White House press office. He left in March and now works as a political analyst for right-leaning Sinclair Broadcasting.   Most Read Changes likely ahead for Marysville Getchell High School MARYSVILLE — Some big changes might be coming to the four schools… May 30th, 2017 by Chris Winters Former insurance salesman accused of stealing from clients BOTHELL — A former insurance salesman is facing criminal charges after an… May 30th, 2017 by Diana Hefley Lake Stevens woman killed in collision on Whidbey Island CLINTON — A Lake Stevens woman was killed Monday in a crash… May 30th, 2017 by Herald Staff Detectives investigate woman’s death in south Everett EVERETT — Police located a car in Marysville that belonged to a… May 31st, 2017 by Herald Staff Aerospace blog Boeing continues to cut jobs, citing need to stay competitive EVERETT — The Boeing Co.’s workforce in Washington dropped by 1,582 in… May 31st, 2017 by Dan Catchpole © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

There aren't many details out in the wild right now, but HTC has confirmed that the WiGig will be based on the 802.11ad standard and will work solely in the interference-free 60GHz band.  That should ensure latency of less than 7ms in any environment, and allow multiple Vive wearers to share the same space.  Of course, this isn't the first wireless peripheral HTC has endorsed. Back in November, the company unveiled TPCast's own wireless solution, and revealed the nifty attachment will cost $220.  Much like the WiGig, TPCast says its compact add-on won't have a noticeable impact on headset performance. VRDC Fall 2017 will be taking place at the Hilton Union Square in San Francisco, CA September 21-22. Register today! Gamasutra, VRDC, and GDC are sibling organizations under parent UBM Americas.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 31 May 2017 Intel introduces Core i9 chip SAN FRANCISCO: Intel Corp, trying to head off a fledgling attempt by rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Inc to compete in the market for high-end personal computer processors, introduced a new, more powerful chip. The company will begin selling chips with as many as 18 processing cores under a new Core i9 brand aimed at gamers. The world’s largest chipmaker said it’s reaffirming its commitment to providing the fastest PC chips available. Intel’s only competition in PC processors, AMD, has demonstrated its new Ryzen product outperforming Intel chips. AMD is trying to muscle in on one of the few attractive parts of the PC market with new products the company began offering in the first quarter. Intel estimates that video game enthusiasts and others who are willing to pay for the best computer performance represent a market that will grow as much as 20% a year. That’s amid a total PC market that has shed more than 100 million units since it peaked in 2011, declining each year since then. Underlining just how profitable the high-end processor market can be, the top of Intel’s new range – called the i9-7980XE – will go on sale for US$1,999 per chip. That’s more than most people will pay for their entire computer. Intel has maintained more than 80% market share and higher average selling prices in PC chips by consistently providing processors that outperform rival offerings. Its strength forced out competitors leaving only AMD, a company that hasn’t turned a profit in five years. – Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Intel , AMD , chips Related Stories Related Stories Companies developing cloud-linked tracking sensors AMD betting on extra-fast WiFi KESM rides on auto growth Govt-backed fund may take minority stake in Toshiba unit Intel to buy Israeli driverless car-tech firm Mobileye for US$15bil You May Be Interested Sears says some Kmart customer credit card numbers compromised US companies sign billions in deals with Vietnam Mah Sing results in line with expectations Ringgit dips early Thursday versus US dollar 5 ways to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Police video shows unsteady, slurring Woods Sports therapist Ronald Fauvel passes away Giving modern-day parents more powerful solutions Property Related advertisement Latest News Australia's biggest state hikes taxes for foreign property buyers 'Axis of love': Saudi-Russia detente heralds new oil order Production falls for first time in four months Macau casinos post 10-month winning streak KLCI loses ground at midday Most Viewed in Business MH128 returns to Melbourne after passenger tied up with seat belts Malaysia slowly winning battle against forex speculators RHB-AMMB to begin merger talks Public Mutual declares RM502m distributions for 11 funds RHB Bank, AMMB suspended as merger talks begin Why Singapore casinos can’t collect from China’s high rollers Ringgit dips early Thursday versus US dollar Uber posts US$708 mln loss, finance head leaves Macau casinos post 10-month winning streak KLCI loses ground at midday advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Not only that, but we have quad-channel DDR4 support with up to 8 x DIMMs on high-end motherboards.   Considering Intel's new X299 chipset only has 44 PCIe lanes, AMD absolutely crushes them when it comes to PCIe connectivity. Intel's highest-end Core i9 processors will only have 44 PCIe lanes, so if you were to have a 2-way GPU setup with x16/x16 you'll only have 12 PCIe lanes left. Throw in a couple of M.2 drives and you're out of PCIe lanes. This won't be a problem with ThreadRipper, however.   AMD's exciting new ThreadRipper CPUs arrive on the TR4 socket with 4094 pins, up to 16C/32T, up to 32MB cache, and will be available in the coming months. We saw a slew of X399-based boards at Computex, with some truly exciting designs on the way.   All we need to see now is the mainstream gaming performance, as Ryzen 7 1800X isn't the best performing processor when it comes to mainstream games against Intel's Core i7-7700K which has half the cores and threads. If AMD can kill it with ThreadRipper and price it at something like $1199 versus the Core i9-7980XE at $1999... we might see a huge change in the CPU market over the next 6-12 months.   Bring it on. >> NEXT STORY: Intel Core i9-7900X @ 5.7GHz on LN2, sets world records << PREVIOUS STORY: G.SKILL Trident Z DDR4-4800 on Intel's new X299 chipset Related Tags AMD Intel Computex 2017 AMD ThreadRipper Subscribe to our Newsletter Latest News Posts AMD prepares 9 models of ThreadRipper, up to 16C/32T Intel Core i9-7900X @ 5.7GHz on LN2, sets world records AMD ThreadRipper: X399, 16C/32T, 64 PCIe lanes and more G.SKILL Trident Z DDR4-4800 on Intel's new X299 chipset AMD's mainstream Radeon RX Vega delayed until 2018?View More News Posts Forum Activity Amped Wireless Artemis-EX AC1300 Range Extender Review asrock fatal1ty x370 K4 GAMING - Cannot create RAID GA-Z87x-UD5H Only PS/2 Keyboard can be used with SETUP Plugable USBC-SATA-V USB 3.1 Gen 2 HDD Dock Review Intel Introduces X299, Kabylake-X, and Skylake-XView More Forum Posts Press Releases Next generation 3D NAND propels PCIe SSD adoption Tegila expands lifetime storage program, unveils controller-only refresh option ASUS Republic of Gamers showcases brand new gaming innovations at Computex 2017 AMD exhibits PC innovation leadership at Computex 2017 Thermaltake unveils the new 4 tempered glass View 71 TG Edition full-tower chassis with Tt LCS CertifiedView More Press Releases Home Sitemap Advertising Awards About Contact Price Search RSS FEEDS PRIVACY POLICY & AD CHOICES © 1999-2017 Tweak Town Pty Ltd.

Launched at Computex 2017, the new Brix Gaming PCs are seriously small and come in at just 220mm tall, with a footprint of 110 x 110mm. It’s like a tiny Mac Pro, but far better for gaming. Inside that tiny metal chassis you get the latest in CPU and graphics tech, with quad-core Intel Core i5 and i7 CPUs along with either Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (in the “UHD” model) or GTX 1060 (in the “VR” model). The VR name indicates this PC is indeed ready for virtual reality headsets. Related: Best desktop PCs They’re small, but they don’t lack connectivity. There’s a pair of USB 3.1 Type-C ports, three USB 3.0 connectors, three mini DisplayPorts and a full-size HDMI 2.0 port as well. There’s dual-band Wi-Fi antennas as well as gigabit Ethernet from Intel, and you can choose between SATA storage of high-speed M.2 drives. The two SO-DIMM memory slots support up to 2133MHz DDR4 memory for speedy, compact performance. You won’t be able to replace the processor or graphics chip (it uses an MXM connector instead of the standard PCIe), but if you get your tools out you’ll probably be able to replace most of the other components with a bit of effort. We don’t have pricing on these new compact PCs, but expect them to appear on store shelves later this year. 0 shares Read Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

Following Tesla (tsla) CEO Elon Musk's suggestion that he would quit his positions on several White House advisory councils if Trump's decision is to exit the deal, as has been widely reported, other firms and business leaders have also come out in favor of the pact. Oil giants ExxonMobil (xom) and ConocoPhillips (cop) were among companies that reiterated their support for the accord ahead of Trump's announcement, reports Bloomberg. "Energy needs are a function of population and living standards," Exxon CEO Darren Woods said at the company's annual investor meeting in Dallas Wednesday, according to Bloomberg. Woods' position in favor of staying in the deal is the same as his predecessor, current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. "When it comes to policy, the goal should be to reduce emissions at the lowest cost to society," Woods said, adding that demand for oil will keep growing even with the climate deal in place. ConocoPhillips thinks that being part of the Paris Agreement allows the U.S. to continue having a role in shaping efforts to reduce carbon emissions. "It gives the U.S. the ability to participate in future climate discussions to safeguard its economic and environmental best interests," company spokesman Daren Beaudo told Bloomberg in an email. It's also reported that Apple CEO Tim Cook called the White House Tuesday to argue the case in favor of staying, while Dow Chemical's Andrew Liveris backed an open letter by more than 30 top corporate executives. And a TV commercial urging the administration to stay and renegotiate the agreement's terms featured the names of CEOs like Musk, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and General Electric's Jeff Immelt.

For more on President Trump's Paris decision, watch Fortune's video: The last-minute scramble comes as Trump tweeted late Wednesday that he would announce his final decision on the climate pact Thursday afternoon in the White House Rose Garden, following initial reports that a decision to leave would be announced. Salesforce CEOMarc Benioff tweeted Wednesday an image of an earlier joint open letter from over 20 top companies based in the U.S. or having business stateside, in which they made a business case that the U.S. should remain a part of the accord. "Continued U.S. participation in the agreement benefits U.S. businesses and the U.S. economy in many ways," the companies argue. "As other countries invest in advance technologies and move forward with the Paris Agreement, we believe the United States can best exercise global leadership in advance U.S. interest by remaining a full partner in this vital global effort." Dear President Trump, as some of the largest companies in the US, we strongly urge you to keep the US in the Paris Agreement. pic.twitter.com/ztSXyYtRrm- Marc Benioff (@Benioff) June 1, 2017 Apple (aapl), Google (googl) and Facebook (fb) are all signatories, as are other major Silicon Valley players like Microsoft (msft), Adobe (adbe), Salesforce (crm), Intel (intc) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (hpe). They are joined by the likes of Gap (gps), Morgan Stanley (ms) and Unilever (ul). Corporate America has previously voiced opposition to other Trump policies like the travel ban and changes to the H-1B foreign worker visa, with Google's Eric Schmidt calling the latter America's "stupidest policy."

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search New Mac, iPad, and more spotted ahead of WWDC 2017 reveal Chris Davies - May 31, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple’s WWDC 2017 is just around the corner, but signs of new MacBook Pro models along with updated iPads and accessories have already been spotted. The Cupertino company’s annual developer conference has, for the past few years at least, been devoid of hardware announcements. That looks set to change, and in a big way, for 2017. Indeed, if the rumors are true Apple is planning a significant refresh across both its macOS and iOS lines. Arguably most exciting has been the promise of a number of fresh MacBook Pro laptops, using the same industrial design – and the controversial Touch Bar – of the current model, but upgrading the processor inside. That would give Apple an opportunity to switch to Intel’s latest 7th generation Kaby Lake chips. Now, evidence of just that has turned up. French site Consomac spotted five new Apple models, running macOS Sierra, in a Russian-language regulatory filing. The data, added recently to the Eurasian Economic Commission’s database for any products that pack encryption or cryptographic capabilities, doesn’t specify exactly model details. However, the A1289, A1347, A1418, A1419, and A1481 model numbers are believed to refer to new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro, four in total, with the fifth being a new 12-inch MacBook, MacRumors suggests. The “personal computers” aren’t the only filing, mind. In fact, there are several others. For instance, there’s are four “tablet PC” references, A1671, A1709, A1670, and A1701, in the database. That, it’s believed would refer to four new iPad Pro models. A “wireless input device (keyboard)”, according to Google Translate’s read of the page, would be model number A1843, meanwhile. Although it’s uncertain at this point, one possibility is that such a keyboard would add a Touch Bar and Touch ID sensor, and be intended for use with Apple’s desktop computers. That itself has been the subject of some rumors, while the biometric fingerprint sensor would presumably warrant the peripheral’s inclusion in the database. Not mentioned in the filing, though separately rumored, is Apple’s Siri speaker. Yet to be publicly named, the smart home device is expected to embody the personal assistant found currently on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, along with acting as a HomeKit hub for smart home control. Reports today suggested production of the smart speaker has already begun, though even if Apple unveils it at WWDC next week it’s unlikely to ship until later in 2017.

That would explain the MateBook X, the Chinese company's first laptop. However, as it tends to happen with Huawei (and a few other Chinese companies) for its first device it has looked at Apple for some inspiration, copying the design of MacBook in the MateBook X. However, similar designs aside there is one major difference between the MateBook X and the Matebook. The Huawei laptop is powered by Windows whereas the Apple MacBook uses Apple's own macOS. In terms of design, the Huawei laptop not only looks very similar to the MacBook, with the similar edges, lid design and metal body but also seemingly copies the keyboard design and large trackpad from Apple's machine. The result is that the MateBook X looks like a very attractive laptop, although we must caution that good looks are no guarantee for good performance or features similar to what Apple offers in the MacBook. In the last few years, starting with Intel's Ultrabooks, we have seen again and again companies trying to copy Apple's laptop design but failing to match the high-standards that MacBooks set in the mobile computing. In terms of specifications, the MateBook X looks like a competent laptop. It has a 13-inch screen and weighs 1.05 kilograms. It also comes with a Core i7 processor, 512GB or 256GB internal storage, and 8GB or 4GB RAM. One highlight of the MateBook X that its screen has a high resolution of 1440P, which is something still a rarity in the 13-inch laptops. It also comes with a fingerprint scanner and it uses Windows 10 Home edition. For now Huawei hasn't announced the price of the MateBook X. Along with the X variant, the company has also announced the D variant (bigger) and E variant (cheaper with cheaper hardware). However, pricing and launch details of the all the laptops are not yet revealed. It is safe to assume that the MateBook X and the other laptops in the series will first hit the global markets. Although Huawei often brings its latest smartphones to India with some urgency, the company may not show the same for the MateBook considering the fact that premium laptop market in India is still relatively small.

"As part of our ongoing investigation into Russian active measures during the 2016 campaign, we approved subpoenas for several individuals for testimony, personal documents and business records," Republican Mike Conaway of Texas, who is leading the probe, and Adam Schiff of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the House panel, said in a joint statement. "We hope and expect that anyone called to testify or provide documents will comply with that request, so that we may gain all the information within the scope of our investigation." Subpoenas were also approved by the committee for documents possessed by the Flynn Intel Group LLC and Michael D. Cohen & Associates PC. The panel is investigating Russian efforts to influence the U.S. election, as well as leaks of classified information and reports that identities of Trump associates captured in spy intercepts may have been improperly unmasked. Flynn, who previously asserted a Fifth Amendment right not to turn over documents or testify, is preparing to offer some documents in separate negotiations with the Senate Intelligence Committee, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday. ‘I Would Comply’ Cohen has dismissed any talk of collusion with Russia. “To date, there has not been a single witness, document or piece of evidence linking me to this fake Russian conspiracy," Cohen said in a statement Tuesday. "This is not surprising to me because there is none." As of Tuesday night, Cohen said he hadn’t yet been subpoenaed, but added, "If I was, I would comply." The committee’s announcement doesn’t detail whether the subpoenas to Flynn and Cohen contain specific deadlines. Three other subpoenas tied to the Russia investigation were issued by the House panel for information related to so-called "unmasking" of some Trump associates’ names appearing on classified reports during the Obama administration, said officials with knowledge of the subpoenas. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up Those subpoenas were issued to the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency for information on any such unmasking requests made by several Obama administration officials, including former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, former CIA Director John Brennan and former United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power, according to one official. There is disagreement about whether those three subpoenas were issued without the knowledge of committee Democrats. A senior committee aide said any subpoenas related to unmasking weren’t part of the Russia probe run by Conaway and Schiff. The aide said any such subpoenas would have been issued by Representative Devin Nunes of California, the committee’s chairman, who has recused himself from the Russia investigation. Nunes, who served on Trump’s transition team, stepped back from the probe after he was criticized over his handling of classified material shown him by White House staff about alleged unmasking of the identities of Trump associates mentioned in surveillance of foreign individuals. Presidential Transition Questions have been raised -- including by Republicans on the committee -- about why those names weren’t redacted and were distributed between intelligence agencies during the transition period between the two presidential administrations. Flynn was fired by Trump in February after revelations that he misled administration officials about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador. He has become a central figure in congressional investigations, as well an FBI probe that now is being overseen by a special counsel, former FBI Director Robert Mueller. A retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn was a top adviser to Trump during his run for president. Cohen previously served as as executive vice president of the Trump Organization. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

This will usher in a new era of mobile computing that will allow for even smaller and thinner devices that blur the line between smartphones, tablets, and traditional laptops.   Snapdragon 835 is made on the 10nm process and powers a slew of flagship smartphones, but the upcoming mobile PC platform is going to do an Apple, and really change everything. Until now the Windows ecosystem has been dominated by Intel designs, but Intel's SoC attempts have been futile, while Qualcomm continues to innovate and push the boundaries of what we thought was possible.   What are the advantages of a Snapdragon 835-powered Windows 10 PC? Well, 4-5x longer standby, up to 50% more battery life, and Gigabit LTE.   We don't know when the Snapdragon 835-powered Windows 10 products will be revealed, but we should expect Q4 2017 at a minimum. We will keep you updated on these movements, as it's one of the most exciting changes to the PC in a very, very long time.   >> NEXT STORY: AMD's mainstream Radeon RX Vega delayed until 2018? << PREVIOUS STORY: The Essential PH-1 smartphone ships in 30 days Related Tags Qualcomm Computex 2017 Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Windows 10 ASUS HP Lenovo Microsoft Apple Intel Subscribe to our Newsletter Latest News Posts AMD prepares 9 models of ThreadRipper, up to 16C/32T Intel Core i9-7900X @ 5.7GHz on LN2, sets world records AMD ThreadRipper: X399, 16C/32T, 64 PCIe lanes and more G.SKILL Trident Z DDR4-4800 on Intel's new X299 chipset AMD's mainstream Radeon RX Vega delayed until 2018?View More News Posts Forum Activity Amped Wireless Artemis-EX AC1300 Range Extender Review asrock fatal1ty x370 K4 GAMING - Cannot create RAID GA-Z87x-UD5H Only PS/2 Keyboard can be used with SETUP Plugable USBC-SATA-V USB 3.1 Gen 2 HDD Dock Review Intel Introduces X299, Kabylake-X, and Skylake-XView More Forum Posts Press Releases Next generation 3D NAND propels PCIe SSD adoption Tegila expands lifetime storage program, unveils controller-only refresh option ASUS Republic of Gamers showcases brand new gaming innovations at Computex 2017 AMD exhibits PC innovation leadership at Computex 2017 Thermaltake unveils the new 4 tempered glass View 71 TG Edition full-tower chassis with Tt LCS CertifiedView More Press Releases Home Sitemap Advertising Awards About Contact Price Search RSS FEEDS PRIVACY POLICY & AD CHOICES © 1999-2017 Tweak Town Pty Ltd.

Been waiting a while? Get Flash to see this player. And some TridentZ running at 4,800MHz, no less. G.Skill is no stranger to pushing memory to the limit. At Computex 2017, the company was showcasing its TridentZ RGB kits running on the brand-new Intel X299 platform. We saw demonstrations ranging from 4,000MHz to 4,400MHz. Given that memory capacity may be key for potential X299 users, it was good to see eight modules running at 4,200MHz, offering lots of juicy bandwidth. We guess G.Skill is saying that having LEDs on top of modules don't interfere with top-tier performance, and we found pretty much the same thing in our review a few months' ago. Separately, pushing things right to the wire, we saw a TridentZ (non-RGB) kit run at 4,800MHz on an ASRock X299 OC Formula board. Tasty speeds, right?

Clinton told an audience at the annual Code Conference in Ranchos Palos Verdes, California, on Wednesday that the most important lesson from the election was the new “war” on information.  Clinton, 69, said she takes responsibility for “every decision” she made, but added, “That's not why I lost.” Her comments sparked outrage from many on Twitter, including President Donald Trump, who said Clinton “refuses to say she was a terrible candidate.” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange called Clinton’s comments “sad.” Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 1, 2017 It's sad to see language like this from Hillary @Recode "I take responsibility for every decision I made but that's not why we lost."— Julian Assange (@JulianAssange) May 31, 2017 Clinton then went on to cite all the reasons she lost, including the media coverage of her use of a private email server “like it was Pearl Harbor,” when really it was “the biggest 'nothing burger' ever,” she said. Hillary Clinton appears totally and completely incapable of self-reflection about the email behavior that arguably cost her the presidency.— Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) May 31, 2017 However, at the same time, Clinton also feels she was “the victim of the very broad assumption” that she was going to win. Read more ‘Never thought she was a great candidate’: Joe Biden blasts Clinton “I never believed it, I always thought it would be a close election because our elections are always close.” Clinton said. Clinton also cited alleged Russian interference with the election as one of the major reasons for her loss, stating that Americans helped “weaponize” information to use against her campaign. "The Russians, in my opinion, and based on the Intel and Counter-Intel people I've talked to, could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided," Clinton said, adding that they were “guided by Americans.” She went on to say that the “vast majority” of news about her on Facebook was “fake,” and said stories like “Pizzagate” helped swing “low-information voters.” She claimed that there were “1,000 Russian agents involved in delivering those messages,” but did not cite a source. Clinton also blamed the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which she described as “bankrupt” and “on the verge of insolvency” during her campaign. She claimed that the DNC’s data was “mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong” and claims she had to inject money into the DNC to keep it running.  Hillary spent, what, twice as much as Trump and is now blaming an underfunded DNC?— jimgeraghty (@jimgeraghty) May 31, 2017 When asked why she didn’t visit Wisconsin or other states that Trump won, Clinton blamed the DNC’s bad information.  She then compared it to the Republican National Committee, which she called a “tried and true, effective foundation.” The panel asked Clinton about several judgments she made before and during the election, which could have caused her to lose. At one point, they asked her about the three speeches she made to Goldman Sachs just before running for president. When the conference moderators asked her why she made the speeches, Clinton answered simply: “They paid me.” Clinton is asked why she did Goldman Sachs speeches. HC: "Why do you have Goldman Sachs here?" Recode: "They paid us." HC: "They paid me"— Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) May 31, 2017 Clinton was paid a total of $675,000 for the three Goldman Sachs speeches. When Clinton was asked if she would consider running for president again, she simply replied, “No.” Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2017.
