The South Korean company, one of Qualcomm’s largest customers, and Intel, one of its biggest competitors, filed arguments Friday in support of the FTC’s case against Qualcomm. Both contend the San Diego-based company stops them from competing fairly against it by leveraging patents that cover the fundamentals of modern phone systems. “Intel is ready, willing, and able to compete on the merits in this market that Qualcomm has dominated for years,” Intel said in a posting on its website. “But Qualcomm has maintained an interlocking web of abusive patent and commercial practices that subverts competition on the merits.” Samsung claims its in-house chip unit is artificially held back by Qualcomm’s unwillingness to license its technology.  License Refused “Despite having requested a license from Qualcomm, Samsung cannot sell licensed Exynos chipsets to non-Samsung entities because Qualcomm has refused to license Samsung to make and sell licensed chipsets,” Samsung said in a filing. Samsung, the world’s biggest smartphone maker, uses a mixture of suppliers -- including itself and Qualcomm -- for the crucial components in its handsets. Qualcomm didn’t immediately respond to requests seeking comment on the filings. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up The company is trying to fend off a series of legal and regulatory challenges to its business practices around the world, including a suit by Apple Inc., one of its largest customers. The chipmaker gets most of its profits from selling the rights to use patents that are essential to all modern mobile phone systems. Many of the cases target the link between those license fees and its semiconductor business. Earlier Friday, the FTC urged a judge to reject Qualcomm’s request for dismissal of the agency’s case. The allegations “present a forceful antitrust case,” the commission said in a filing in federal court in San Jose, California. A hearing is set for June 15. Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said last month that the FTC’s complaint is riddled with ”fallacies and failures.” “The Federal Trade Commission’s latest submission to the court does nothing to cure the fundamental flaws in its complaint against Qualcomm: no coherent theory of competitive harm and no allegations of the type of conduct that the antitrust laws are designed to address,” Qualcomm said Friday in a statement. “The complaint therefore should be dismissed.” Shares of Qualcomm, the world’s fourth-largest chipmaker, have slumped this year on concern that the growing legal challenges will hurt its main source of profit. The stock has lost 15 percent in 2017 compared with a 15 percent gain by the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Qualcomm Inc., 17-cv-00220, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Roston - May 12, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Intel recently took to the stage to introduce Loomo Go, an autonomous delivery robot created by Segway Robotics. The robot can be operated like an actual Segway, at least per the demonstration by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, but it is much more than that. Using various technologies, Loomo is able to perceive the world around it and operate through it, doing so as part of an overall delivery process to bring humans objects. The robot was unveiled by Intel at the AUVSI XPONENTIAL 2017 event, where CEO Krzanich asked Loomo to get him a bottle of water. The robot heard his command and interacted with him via a request-appropriate response, then left to retrieve the water. When the robot returned, the bottle of water was inside of a delivery box connected to the robot. The creation is similar to the self-driving robots that are delivering pizzas in Europe. Most impressive, though, is the technology inside of the robot. Loomo operates with Intel RealSense technology, enabling it to both see and navigate in the regular world. The video above includes a live video from the robot’s visual processor, enabling everyone to see the world as Loomo sees it. RealSense includes precise gesture tracking able to detect movements from all 22 hand joints, scan its environment in 3D, recognize people via facial recognition, and detect human emotions. As the video shows, Loomo is capable of speaking to humans that interact with it; the robot understands both English and Chinese, according to Segway Robotics. Though the robot is capable of navigating by itself, operators can set the robot to follow them as they move around. Anticipated uses for Loomo include helping the elderly and others with medical conditions, aiding customers at stores and hotels, and more.

Intel has just added four new processors to its Itanium family. Now, this article does have a chance to be our last report on the ill-fated CPU lineup, since Intel confirmed to PCWorld that these processors will be its final Itanium chips. Processor Cores/threads Speed L3 cache TDP Itanium 9720 4/8 1.73 GHz 20 MB 130 W Itanium 9740 8/16 2.13 GHz 24 MB 170 W Itanium 9750 4/8 2.53 GHz 32 MB 170 W Itanium 9760 8/16 2.66 GHz 32 MB 170 W The new Itanium 9700-series processors are built on Intel's somewhat long-in-the-tooth 32-nm process. There are four variants: the quad-core Itanium 9720 and 9750, and the octa-core Itanium 9740 and 9760. All models feature Intel's hyper-threading, Turbo Boost, and virtualization technologies, and have a relatively high TDP. The three higher-end models have a 170W TDP, while the lightly-clocked Itanium 9270 has a 130W TDP. Intel originally launched the Itanium family way back in 2001 with grandiose plans for making it the successor to the x86 architecture, but those plans never quite materialized. While the associated instruction set was ambitious and there certainly was demand for 64-bit support, upgrading to Itanium involved both new hardware and a new ecosystem of software from a variety of companies. AMD's 64-bit extensions to the x86 instruction set proved to be much easier to adopt, seeing as even Intel ended up cross-licensing them for its Pentium 4, Xeon, and Core processors. The primary destination for the Itanium processors will likely be Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's Integrity servers, which have been powered by Itanium CPUs for many years. Intel no doubt wants to avoid the legal troubles Oracle faced when it tried to stop supporting these servers in 2012. The new Itanium processors, then, appear to be one last round of chips made to satisfy a contract with HPE. We'd love to say that Itanium will be missed, but we very much doubt that's the case.

Apps include SuperDuper, a long-available tool that lets you create reliable disk clones, and Intel Power Gadget, a handy way to monitor CPU performance on macOS. But it doesn’t stop there, have a look at our full list and video for a brief look at all of this week’s app selections. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? SuperDuper! If you’re looking to clone your Mac’s primary drive, then Shirt Pocket software’s SuperDuper is a tool that I can absolutely recommend. With just a few clicks, you can start a disk clone that can be easily restored via macOS’ built-in disk utility. I use SuperDuper (in concert with other backup options) to back up my MacBook Pro. I also use it to create a quick clone of my Hackintosh builds once I have them working just right. Price: Basic features are free, unlock full version for $27.95 Intel Power Gadget Intel Power Gadget is an app that lets you accurately monitor your CPU’s current frequency (clock speed), power usage, and temperature. The app even lets you monitor CPU usage over a period of time via a log file that can be activated via a menu bar option. Price: Free Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more videos Mr Stopwatch Mr Stopwatch is my go-to macOS stopwatch app for timing benchmarks. I like it because it’s simple to use, relatively inexpensive, and can be configured to always stay on top of other on-screen content. It’s far from the prettiest app (I’d go as far as to call it unattractive), but it’s always worked well for me. Price: $1.99 Magnet There are lots of window snapping tools available for macOS, but Magnet, with its current 80% discount, is one of the cheapest options. The app features three ways to initiate snapping — dragging windows, menu bar shortcuts, and customizable keyboard shortcuts. Magnet doesn’t inundate you with a bunch of other features that you may not be interested in; it’s an app that solely focuses on window snapping and nothing else. Price: $0.99 Amphetamine Many of us long time Mac users are familiar with Caffeine, a menu bar utility that could override Energy Saver settings and force your Mac to stay awake. William C. Gustafson’s Amphetamine 3 is like Caffeine, but much deeper and more customizable. More importantly, it’s still actively being developed, and is available as a free download from the Mac App Store. Amphetamine can keep your Mac awake indefinitely via a quick menu bar shortcut. You can also set a custom amount of wake time, or make it so that your Mac stays awake as long as a designated app is running. But the options don’t stop there, just have a look at the app’s preferences for a ton of additional customization features. Price: Free Conclusion Are there any must-have macOS utilities that you’d like to share? Feel free to sound off in the comments below.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 12, 2017 1:53 PM PT Credit: Intel More like this What one company learned from testing Intel's superfast Optane SSDs Intel claims storage speed record with first large-capacity Optane SSD Optane Memory review: Why you may want Intel's futuristic cache in your PC Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD In the next year or two, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will add support for Intel Optane memory and storage to its latest Unix servers. Optane is a new form of storage and memory that could replace today's SSDs and DRAM. It is significantly faster and denser than both. One new system that can be configured with Optane is HPE's new Integrity i6 server, which was released this week. Integrity i6 is based on Intel's Itanium 9700 processors, code-named Kittson, and runs the HP-UX OS. The server can also be linked to HP's all-flash 3Par storage arrays, which are due to get Optane support later. [ Further reading: We tear apart a hard drive and SSD to show you how they work ] Optane has stringent hardware and OS requirements. The first Optane products were low-capacity storage drives for PC caching and worked only with Intel's Kaby Lake chips and Windows 10. The first large-capacity Optane drive is the SSD DC P4800X Series, which has a capacity of 375GB and sells for $1,520. Like flash SSDs, it plugs into NVMe slots. Optane drivers for other kinds of configurations should be ready in the coming years, said Jeff Kyle, director of product management for enterprise servers. Next year, Intel will ship Optane memory DIMMs, which will run on the DRAM bus and be targeted at in-memory applications. But whether HPE customers adopt Optane immediately is a big question mark, Kyle said. Customers running mainframe-style mission-critical servers are averse to change and may not immediately adopt Optane, which is still spanking new technology. They may go for conventional NVMe SSDs, which are proven and reliable. Servers like Integrity i6 are used for more than five to 10 years, and it's not yet known if Optane can last that long, Kyle said. Intel provides a three-year warranty for its Optane SSD DC P4800X Series. But for those who adopt Optane, there will be benefits, Kyle said. Databases and other applications will run faster, and customers will need fewer CPU cores to process data, which adds up to lower licensing costs, he said. Optane was tested for more than two years on Linux servers hosted by IBM, Lenovo and Facebook. Another tester was database company Aerospike, which saw significant performance benefits. But details around overall performance, software cost, and licensing per core have yet to be sorted out, Kyle said.

Morgan Stanley expects very little, arguing the financial outlook is bound to be nothing new, and that prospects for AMD's new chips seem dim given Intel keeps "raising the bar." But Rosenblatt's Hans Mosesmann thinks the Street is seriously underestimating AMD's potential with new parts, and that Intel may be vulnerable on a number of fronts. By Tiernan Ray May 12, 2017 3:45 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices’s (AMD) annual meeting with Wall Street analysts takes place next Tuesday May 16th, at its headquarters in Silicon Valley, and the Street has been offering up their thoughts on what to expect. The meeting follows a Q1 report on May 2nd in which the the company raised questions about its comeback, and its challenge to Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA), given what seemed to some lower-than-expected gross profit margin. Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore doesn’t expect “any big surprises” from the day, he writes. Moore, who has an Equal Weight rating on the stock, thinks that “Intel continues to raise the bar": We don't expect to get new clarity on 2q or the year, but we would like to get a better sense for the Zen roadmap - Ryzen looks competitive, but Intel should move the bar forward in performance in 2h by close to 20%, and 10 nm ramps next year. We would expect some updates on Naples, the second half server product, but it is probably too early to get a tangible sense of customer partnerships; we see a small revenue opportunity this year. He expects to hear more about “Vega,” the company’s forthcoming “high-end” GPU chip. But he has “fairly low expectations.” We'd like to get new details on Vega, the new high end graphics solution that should start shipping late this quarter - and to get a sense for how it benchmarks against NVIDIA's Pascal products as well as the upcoming Volta family. Our best sense is that Vega with high bandwidth memory will be roughly competitive with NVIDIA's 1080 (which puts it 30% below NVIDIAs 1080ti at the high end), which prices at $500. We see limited impact if that is the case, given the high cost of high bandwidth memory implementations. As far as data center graphics, Volta has potentially significantly raised the bar for those performance sensitive applications. On the financial side, he thinks things will look pretty much the way they did back in 2015, with the company forecasting 50 cents per share per year in “earnings power,” even though he continues to think they can do only 30 cents. In contrast, Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities, who has a Buy rating on AMD stock, and a $20 price target, today writes that the event will be "an eye opener." "The street has yet to realize the significant market share up-side going forward on the notion of AMD just getting back to historical share levels with merely a competitive product,” writes Mosesmann. “If AMD were to have a better x86 CPU architecture, well then, we would be headed into uncharted territory." Mosesmann in fact thinks AMD can gain share because it has a better product than Intel on some counts: Today there are street observers that posit the view that AMD could not possibly gain share in any segment because AMD Ryzen (in early benchmarks in March) may not have been faster than Intel in extreme high end gaming; and as such don’t bother to even consider Zen on the merits of the architecture in the vast majority of x86 computing. We believe AMD may have a better multi-threaded architecture than Intel’s current x86 and this notion has serious implications in the datacenter where we are already seeing the disruption AI workloads are doing to system level architectures. We think AMD’s Zen in 2017/18 may be better than Intel x86 roadmaps based on Skylake, Kaby Lake, etc. Servers – AMD Naples 32 core (64 thread) will go up against Intel Skylake Purley 28 core (56 thread) this summer and both likely launch at Computex later this month. It is possible Intel may introduce a 32 core product to counter Naples, however it is not clear at this time. Naples will sport 8 DRAM channels vs. Skylake’s 6 DRAM channels for 33% memory bandwidth (this is hugely im- portant for hyperscalers). More cores, more threads, more bandwidth, better price performance, better performance/watt, for AMD. For an encore, AMD will likely detail the 7nm-based Starship server CPU with 48 cores (96 threads) coming likely in 2H18. We understand AMD is prepping a 16-core (32 threads) high-end desktop monster dubbed X399 (production may already be underway), which will do battle with new desktop Intel Skylake/Kaby Lake models that max out at 12 cores (thread count is not clear to us at this time). Intel may counter with its own 16 core part however it would have to be rushed. This is a fascinating dy- namic given that Intel is not used to getting challenged in high-end professional and enthusiast gaming. Mosesmann’s parting thought is that AMD is competitive even with Intel’s three-year manufacturing lead. "If AMD Zen CPUs that use lagging-edge GF 14nm are ‘competitive', then it is reasonable to consider that AMD Zen is more than a 2-year cycle as both companies move to their next nodes in 2018,” he concludes. "Actually, a case can be made that AMD skipping 10nm and going straight to 7nm, while Intel moves to 10nm, could see Intel’s process lead dissipate (thus making AMD incrementally stronger)."

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Gets New Client Computing Group Chief After the chipmaker's previous client computing group chief was tapped to run the company's data center group, it has quickly filled the vacancy in the former. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 12, 2017 at 2:00PM A little while back, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced that Diane Bryant, the company's long-term data center group (DCG) chief, had to take a six- to eight-month leave of absence to tend to a "personal family matter." As a result, Intel replaced Bryant with client computing group (CCG) chief Navin Shenoy. Shenoy had just replaced Kirk Skaugen a year ago. Navin Shenoy. Image source: Intel. With Shenoy now running DCG, this left a vacancy at the top of CCG. Intel said that Murthy Renduchintala, the head of the company's client and Internet of Things and system architecture (CISA) group, would temporarily fill Shenoy's vacancy until Shenoy's replacement had been found. On May 11, Intel announced Shenoy's successor: Gregory Bryant. Who is Gregory Bryant? Prior to his appointment as the head of CCG, Bryant "was leading the strategy and product development for Intel's Connected Home and Commercial Client (CHC) businesses," per the notice published on Intel's website announcing Bryant's promotion. On his LinkedIn page, Bryant says that he is "responsible for managing the [profit and loss], leading the strategy and product development for Intel's desktop product line including desktop PC, mini-PC, all-in-one, and enthusiast gaming platforms -- as well as Intel's PUMA gateway and set-top box business." Gregory Bryant. Image source: Fudzilla. It's clear that Bryant has a lot of relevant experience, so CCG should be in reasonably good hands. Something to keep in mind While Bryant seems qualified for the job, one thing that concerns me is the rapid turnover that Intel's CCG has had at the top over the last several years. In 2012, Skaugen took over the PC Client Group from executive Mooly Eden. Then, about four years later, Skaugen left, which led to Shenoy's appointment as CCG chief last year. And, now, CCG is getting yet another chief. The seemingly constant management turnover in CCG isn't great; strategic visions take time to implement, especially given that product development cycles in the computer processor market are relatively long, so Intel's CCG runs the risk of continued shifts in direction/vision that could trip the company up if it's not careful. On the plus side, while CCG's previous head was replaced just a year after he took the job, within Intel CCG is a sub-organization of the broader CISA group mentioned above. As a slide that Renduchintala showed at the company's analyst day back in February, his organization is responsible for key functions such as silicon engineering, platform development, software enablement, and the alignment of products and chip manufacturing technology. In other words, the turnover in CCG management probably won't have a huge impact on the underlying product and technology development related to CCG's products. I think Intel's CCG would benefit from stability at the top (assuming, of course, that Bryant does a good job as CCG chief; if he performs poorly, I'd prefer additional turnover to keeping in place suboptimal management). Foolish takeaway At the end of the day, I don't think the shift in CCG management is going to have a dramatic impact on the business performance of the segment. The business should be relatively straightforward to maintain and the company is putting somebody highly qualified in charge of it. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Schiff's statement is in response to a tweet from Trump early Friday threatening Comey not to leak anything to the press and suggesting that there are tapes of his conversations with Comey.  “James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” Trump tweeted. James Comey better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017 A number of reports emerged late Thursday revealing current and former FBI officials dispute Trump’s account of a meeting he had with Comey earlier this year. “If the President has ‘tapes’ of his conversations with Director Comey, it is because the president himself made them,” Schiff said in a statement. "For a President who baselessly accused his predecessor of illegally wiretapping him, that Mr. Trump would suggest that he, himself, may have engaged in such conduct is staggering." “The president should immediately provide any such recordings to Congress or admit, once again, to have made a deliberately misleading — and in this case threatening — statement,” Schiff added. The House Intelligence Committee is currently investigating the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia.   Tags Adam Schiff   View the discussion thread.

Dubbed the ROG Strix H270I Gaming and ROG Strix B250I Gaming, these two models differ when it comes to chipsets, but they are otherwise functionally identical in most respects. Up until now, the ROG Strix Z270I was the only 'high-end' mini-ITX model in the ASUS LGA1151 product line, and given the absence of a Maximus IX Impact it has served as the spiritual successor to the Maximus VIII Impact that we reviewed back in December 2015. The lineage between the ROG Strix Z270I and these two latest models is much more obvious. Aside from one less MOSFET heatsink, the chipset, and some different VRM components, all three of these motherboards are all largely indistinguishable. Having said that, whereas the higher-end Z270-based model supports both CPU and memory overclocking, these two new more affordable models are aimed at those running stock-clocked CPUs. As such, they are also limited to memory speeds of DDR4-2400. While we are on the subject of memory, both motherboards clearly only have two memory slots and therefore system memory is limited to 32GB. An interesting part of these mini-ITX models is that ASUS have managed to fit two M.2 connectors on a tiny PCB footprint. This is due to a double-decker heatsink design that allows an M.2 drive to be sandwiched between a top cover heatsink and a lower level PCH heatsink. The secondary M.2 connector is located on the back of the motherboard. Both M.2 connectors can handle full-speed PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSDs, as well as Intel Optane Memory, but only one of them supports SATA-based M.2 solid state drives. Both motherboards have four SATA 6Gb/s ports and support Intel Rapid Storage Technology, although only the Strix H270I has RAID 0, 1, 5, 10 and Intel SRT capabilities. There is a small divergence when it comes to USB connectivity, with the H270I supporting eight USB 3.0 ports (six rear, one header) and the B250I supporting six USB 3.0 ports (four rear, one header) and two USB 2.0 ports (two rear). The H270-based model also has two gigabit LAN ports (one powered by an Intel I219V and the other a Realtek RTL8111H) while the B250-based model only has a single gigabit LAN port courtesy of an Intel I219V controller. All of these LAN ports are protected by LANGuard surge protectors and can be managed using the ASUS GameFirst IV traffic management software. Both models also have onboard dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi with MU-MIMO, Bluetooth 4.1, and an included 2x2 external antenna. For those planning to use integrated graphics, both motherboards feature HDMI 1.4 and DisplayPort 1.2 video outputs. Given the obvious size constraints, the Strix H270I and Strix B250I only have one PCIe 3.0 x16 slot, and it is SafeSlot metal-reinforced (additional PCIe rigidity for heavy GPUs). Onboard audio duties are handled by an ROG SupremeFX eight-channel HD audio solution, which is based on the Realtek ALC1220A codec. There are dual headphone amplifiers, which means additional power and impedance sensing for both the front and rear headphone outputs. This onboard audio implementation also benefits from the ASUS audio software suite that consists of Sonic Studio III and Sonic Radar III. Since it is apparently the must-have feature of the second half of the decade, ASUS has added AURA RGB lighting to both of these models, in the form of a series of LEDs placed along the entire right side. There is also one RGB header that can power an LED light strip. Due to the Aura Sync feature, all of the lighting is controllable from within the AURA utility. While we are on the topic of cool features (Ed: Punny...), there are three total fan headers - one which can handle a water pump or high amperage fan - and all of which can be managed by the excellent Fan Xpert 4 UEFI and/or software fan controls. There's no word on availability or pricing, other than the fact that we expect the Strix H270I will cost a little bit more than the Strix B250I.

Reply DanNeely - Friday, May 12, 2017 - link For anyone else wondering: The second m.2 slot is on the back of the boards. Reply Srikzquest - Friday, May 12, 2017 - link I am pretty sure Asus charges a lot by adding that ROG and Strix branding and no USB Type-C/Thunderbolt port in the current generation is basically looting money from unsuspecting customers unless the motherboards cost less than $100. These are not smartphones where people change every other year and though Type C is not ubiquitous right now, pretty sure it will be in the next couple of years. Reply DanNeely - Friday, May 12, 2017 - link While 0 C ports does put these boards behind the curve, I haven't seen any with a really future looking set of USB ports. At most they seem to have a single C port, 2 of 6 or 4 of 10 would be a much better forward looking combination especially if they're all 10Gb 3.1g2 ports. TB on the desktop remains almost completely MIA. Partly due to cost and partly due to limited PCIe lanes. mITX is probably the only desktop form factor that has lanes to spare without playing games with sharing them or plonking $100 down on a PLX chip; but they're also the most limited in board space to put any extra controllers. Reply Srikzquest - Friday, May 12, 2017 - link I am actually not that interested on TB as majority of the people won't use it but Type-C should be a must. ASRock and I think MSI and Gigabyte also have Type C on their ITX boards I believe, though they are of Z270 chipset. Though this is H270 chipset which means not higher end but still having the ROG branding means they are going to price it like one. Hence, my argument... Reply HomeworldFound - Friday, May 12, 2017 - link I expect another level of reliability from Mini-ITX products that I doubt ASUS or the early chipsets can provide. Asus won't provide that and the platform is too new.

He was speaking at an event organised by Intel India, in association with the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) to felicitate 29 Student Innovators who are set to represent India at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) 2017 -- the world's largest pre-college Science and Engineering Fair -- in Los Angeles, US. "As we stand today, we look at how the world is changing in terms of innovation. Skills of yesterday and skills of tomorrow are very different. The question is do we want our future generations to be mere users of the technology or become innovators?" Kishore Balaji, Director of Corporate Affairs Intel South Asia, told IANS on the sidelines of the event. "At Intel we have been engaged in trying to see how we can bridge this innovation skill gap among youth with various initiatives because we believe that innovation is fundamental for the country in its efforts towards realising its vision of becoming a successful digital economy," Balaji added. The students and their 20 projects were shortlisted from the Initiative for Research and Innovation in Science (IRIS) National Fair 2016, and will compete at the ISEF beginning May 14-19. "ISEF is a really good platform for us to showcase our talent and our research work in order to convey our message and idea to the world," said a student from Bengaluru. "Intel ISEF is lots of fun, science. The best minds from all over the world will come and we will get lots of opportunities," said a student from Raipur. This group of young innovators will represent India to compete against approximately 1,750 finalists from over 70 countries for approximately $4 million in awards and scholarships. Till 2016, a total of 91 Indian students have won 121 awards and accolades at Intel ISEF competing against more than 6 million high school students from across the world. From 1999-2016, 19 students from India also have had the unique honour of having minor planets named after them. "The children from India have done incredibly well and made us feel proud and they would continue to do so," Balaji said. --IANS rt/vgu/vm (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Puts Out Long-Term Spending Target Intel aims to reduce its operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, apparently through revenue growth rather than operating-expense cuts. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 12, 2017 at 9:30AM At Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) meeting for financial analysts back in February, the company declined to give a long-term goal with respect to its operating expenses as a percentage of its revenue. "When you think about putting a profitability versus a growth, or a margin in an existing business, you run the risk of limiting investment," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich explained to investors in February. Image source: Intel. However, just two months later, on Intel's late-April earnings call, management provided investors with just such an operating-expense target. "We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue, which we expect to reach no later than 2020," CFO Robert Swan told investors. Why the 180-degree turn? Let's take a closer look. Appeasing the investment community At the end of the day, Intel's job -- as is the case for every publicly traded company -- is to try to deliver value for its stockholders. That means boosting revenue, driving profits up, and ultimately driving the stock price up. After Intel refused to set out an operating-margin target during its analyst day, the company received a downgrade from "outperform" to "neutral" from Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer -- who had been very bullish on the stock for years. Here was the rationale behind his downgrade: What remains is a positive view on the Company, especially longer term, but a solidly neutral view of the stock at least until we find evidence of peaking rates of investments and/or more significant and sustainable revenue growth and operating leverage. I don't think Pitzer's view is unique, either -- it likely reflects what many investors have been thinking for some time. By putting out that operating-expense target of 30% of revenue by 2020 (notice that the target is several years out), Intel is trying to show investors the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. How Intel plans to get there Krzanich said on that earnings call that this 30% target assumes mid-single-digit revenue growth over the next several years (a target that Intel put out at its investor meeting) with "cost reduction and efficiencies" serving to get Intel where it aims to go. To place this target into perspective, for 2017, Intel projects revenue of $60 billion and operating expenses of $20.5 billion, putting its expected operating expenses as a percentage of revenue at 34.2%. This means that by 2020, the company expects to reduce its operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 420 basis points. If we assume that Intel grows revenue at a 5% compounded annual growth rate through 2020 (Intel's goal is "mid-single digit" growth, and 5% is the midpoint of that range), then Intel should be bringing in about $70 billion in revenue in 2020. Thirty percent of $70 billion works out to $21 billion. So, what Intel is really saying is that it doesn't expect to grow its operating expenses by much over the next several years -- that is, the company is fully invested in its current long-term vision -- but it does expect to see enough revenue growth to bring down its operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.

Thanks to the brightest minds in Silicon Valley, however, they're rapidly becoming science fact. Google is nearing the final stages of testing for its autonomous car programme, Tesla drivers can enjoy an 'Autopilot' feature for hassle-free motorway driving, and Pittsburgh residents can hail an Uber that drives itself. But how do driverless cars work? Are they safe? When can we expect to try one out for ourselves? We answer all these questions, and more, below. Latest news 12/05/2017: A US judge has called for an immediate investigation into the allegations of stolen trade secrets, which have surfaced during a court battle between Uber and Google over self-driving car technology. Google initially filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing app in February, which alleged that former engineer Anthony Levandowksi downloaded 14,000 files without authorisation while working on its self-driving car research. Levandowski is said to have then left Google's Waymo to found his own startup, Otto, which was then later purchased by Uber for $680 million. Google claims that the documents travelled with him, which Uber then used to fast track its own autonomous vehicle research. US District Judge William Alsup stated in a ruling that the case "contains ample evidence" to merit an investigation, and has forwarded a recommendation to the US attorney "based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC's claims for trade secret misappropriation". "The Court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney," the order states. Alsup also partially granted Google's bid to force an injunction against Uber's self-driving car unit, which if successful could determine the future of the company's operations in the technology. This ruling, which could be decided as early as tomorrow, has been made under temporary seal, so the exact scope of the injunction is unclear. The case has been complicated somewhat by Levandowski, who has invoked his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination and refuses to testify, leaving the two companies to fight it out in court. A spokesperson for Uber said in an email to IT Pro: "It is unfortunate that Waymo will be permitted to avoid abiding by the arbitration promise it requires its employees to make. We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum". The company also said it would not be commenting on the case referral to the US Attorney, but stated that the result of the partial preliminary injunction, currently under seal, would most likely be "status quo". Uber initially argued that Waymo's trade secret allegations should be held in private arbitration, however because Levandowski is not a defendant, Uber could not use his arbitration agreement with Waymo to force the proceedings behind closed doors, and as such was rejected by the judge. Uber doesn't dispute the claim that Levandowski stole the documents in question, but argues that trade secrets never made their way into the company's research, and that Google needs to prove that Uber "derived its knowledge from Levandowski". 28/04/2017: Uber self-driving car boss steps down amid Waymo lawsuit Uber's self-driving car chief has left his position after allegations that he stole critical research from his former employers at Waymo, Alphabet's own driverless car unit. Anthony Levandowski will continue to work for Uber, according to an internal memo published by Business Insider, but will no longer head up the company's Advanced Technologies Group or manage its work on autonomous vehicles. "Travis and I have decided that I will be recused from all LiDAR-related work and management at Uber, through the remainder of the Waymo litigation," Levandowski wrote in an email to staff. "This change means that Eric Meyhofer will be the head of ATG, reporting to Travis, and I will report to Eric. My other responsibilities will not change." "This organizational change means I will have absolutely no oversight over or input into our LiDAR work. Going forward, please make sure not to include me in meetings or email threads related to LiDAR, or ask me for advice on the topic." Levandowski's departure comes amid allegations from his former employers, Waymo. The Alphabet-owned self-driving car company claims that when he left to join Uber, Levandowski took vital technology and information on the company's research and development efforts with him. For Uber's part, it claims that its work is "fundamentally different" to Waymo's and that Levandowski's role was focused on management rather than engineering. As part of the ongoing case, the presiding judge has asked the company to provide details of Levandowski's role, which could result in an injunction stopping Lewandowski from working on Uber's autonomous vehicle programme altogether. Uber declined to comment, but referred IT Pro to the email published by Business Insider. 26/04/2017: Leading US carmakers have petitioned the state of California to revise its proposed regulations on autonomous vehicle testing, stating that authorities ignored their earlier concerns that the rules would become too restrictive. Self-driving car manufacturers raised their objections at a public hearing in Sacramento on Tuesday, the recording of which was seen by Reuters, saying that the planned additional regulations should be dropped, and that oversight should be handed to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) instead. In the consultation, hosted via a webcast, automaker groups including the Association of Global Automakers described the proposed regulations as going "too far". The group also opposes California's plans to introduce a permit system, which would be required by all automakers wishing to test self-driving cars in the state. Ride-hailing firm Uber was driven out of San Francisco last year after it refused to apply for a permit to test its autonomous vehicle fleet. Automakers now believe requiring a permit is no longer an effective approach to regulating tests, and object to the proposal that the state could revoke permissions even if a company adheres to federal requirements. If the proposals were to be accepted, the automakers would be liable for any crashes that occur during the tests, even if they were not to blame. General Motors official Paul Hemmersbaugh said that regulations like these could have a "chilling effect on testing and deployment of self-driving cars". It could also see the introduction of a scheme that would ask automakers to submit a voluntary assessment to the NHTSA, outlining specific details of their self-driving vehicle systems. However, according to lawyers representing Google, Ford, and Uber, this would effectively be a mandatory clause. Other self-driving manufacturers, including Alphabet's Waymo and Ford, asked California to relax current regulations that restrict the testing of vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds, which would include rides with multiple passengers. However safety advocates believe harsher regulations would ensure the public is kept safe from potential accidents. Group president for the Consumers for Auto Reliability, Rosemary Shahan, said: "We do not trust the auto manufacturers or the tech industry to protect the public in the absence of federal motors vehicle safety standards." Alphabet's Ron Medford urged the state to quickly issue definitive guidelines "to provide manufacturers with the certainty that they need", although it is clear that lawmakers are still unsure how best to regulate the emerging technology. 24/04/2017: UK tech firms today received funding to test self-driving cars on Britain's roads, reaping the benefits of a recent government pledge to back the development of emerging technologies. Two consortiums have already secured backing as part of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, a government commitment announced on Friday set to invest almost £5 billion into research and development over the next four years. Streetwise, a group led by Cambridge-based AI startup firm FiveAI, is currently working on a trial that will allow commuters to order self-driving cars using a mobile app. This will include the development of new insurance and safety protocols governing the use of the technology. The trial, which is set to launch in 2019, has received £12.8 million in government support and will be developed with input from Direct Line, Transport for London, the Transport Research Laboratory, and the University of Oxford. "It's about delivering to the consumer an autonomous Uber-type service in London," said FiveAI CEO Stan Boland, speaking to the Telegraph. "It's insane for people to buy a car and the leave it parked for 94% of the time and only have one user per car, in the future vehicles can be shared." Driverless shuttle tests are already underway in Greenwich Driven, an initiative led by Oxbotica that has received £8.6 million in government funding, aims to develop self-driving technology over the course of a 30-month programme that started in April, aimed at linking London and Oxford with an autonomous shuttle. Commuters are able to test the technology today on the streets of Greenwich. Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith said: "Today’s news is truly ground-breaking. No company, group or consortium of autonomy experts has ever attempted what DRIVEN is planning over the next 30-months.We are seeking to address some of the most fundamental challenges preventing the future commercial deployment of fully autonomous vehicles. I have full confidence in Driven’s world-leading and internationally respected team of specialists to deliver this project." Telefonica, the UK Atomic Energy Authority's R&D lab Race, UK domain registry firm Nominet, Oxford Robotics Institute, and Oxfordshire Council, will join Oxbotica in the consortium, as well as the Transport Research Laboratory, which is also supporting FiveAI. The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund is the latest government initiative to foster development of some emerging technology innovations, and offer alternate ways for commuters to travel to and from the capital. Speaking alongside the announcement, business and energy secretary Greg Clark said: "As part of our Plan for Britain this government wants to create a modern Industrial Strategy to support the key sectors of our economy and spread jobs, prosperity and opportunity around the whole country." "The funding I am announcing today, providing hundreds of millions of pounds of support to develop the next generation of technologies across a range of sectors, shows our determination and commitment to making sure the UK remains at the very forefront of research and innovation."

Baidu stated it wants to "build a collaborative ecosystem, utilising its strengths in artificial intelligence (AI) technology to work together with other companies to promote the development and popularisation of autonomous driving technology". The initiative has been named Project Apollo after the US' lunar landing programme, as the company believes autonomous driving has the same potential to change the world as its namesake did. Apollo will include a vehicle platform, hardware platform, software platform and cloud data services. The company is planning to open source obstacle perception code and capabilities, trajectory planning, vehicle control, and vehicle operating systems, as well as testing tools. Baidu President and CEO Qi Lu said: "AI has great potential to drive social development, and one of AI's biggest opportunities is intelligent vehicles." The company is also going to set up  alliances with partners "who will provide the best and most compatible vehicles, sensors, and other components, to achieve broad participation and collaboration and to provide references and recommendations to participants of a rapidly expanding ecosystem enabled by Project Apollo". It hopes that this will make it easier and more efficient to research and develop self driving car technology. Baidu will restrictively open its technology in July and then open it fully towards the end of the year. It also plans to introduce fully autonomous driving capabilities on highways and open city roads by 2020. 05/04/2017: A recent disengagement report from Alphabet's Waymo shows that the company's driverless cars are some of the most reliable in the self-driving industry. According to the report, Waymo's autonomous vehicles drove 635,868 cumulative miles over the past year and had 124 disengagements, which are defined as instances where a human needed to take over driving. This means that these vehicles only experienced roughly one disengagement every 5,128 miles. When compared to the competition, results indicated that Waymo's vehicles are significantly more reliable at this point. While Ford only reported three disengagements over the past year, their autonomous vehicles only traveled 590 cumulative miles - a fraction what Waymo's vehicles have completed. BMW didn't fare much better, reporting one disengagement over 638 miles. Despite Waymo's proven reliability, the self-driving company doesn't stack up to the rest of the competition in terms of overall progress. Navigant Research's leaderboard report on autonomous driving suggests that Waymo is ranked seventh on a list of top 10 vendors. BMW and Ford, whose disengagement reports fared worse results, both top Waymo on the list, with Ford considered the number one vendor. The report rated these self-driving industry players in ten categories: vision, go-to market strategy, partners, production strategy, technology, product capability, product quality and reliability, product portfolio, staying power, and sales, marketing and distribution. While the rankings show that Waymo features the most advanced technology, the report found that the company has no production capacity or production deals. 28/03/2017: Uber's San Francisco-based driverless car trials are back online following a short pause after one of its vehicles crashed in Arizona last week. “We are resuming our development operations in San Francisco this morning,” an Uber spokeswoman told TechCrunch yesterday morning. However, its Arizona and Pittsburgh-based trials will remain grounded until the company can investigate properly what went wrong when another car allegedly ploughed into the automated vehicle, knocking it over. Although Uber's cars can be driven without a driver, they all have manual controls built in too, so a human can take over when required. It would seem there was not enough time for the driver to take over and avoid the accident in Arizona, although it's still under investigation. TechCrunch explained that the cars used in the taxi firm's Californian trials are newer and therefore safer to drive. It's thought the trials in Pittsburgh and Arizona will resume ometime in the future, but Uber hasn't said when it's likely to happen yet. 27/03/2017: One of Uber's driverless vehicles has crashed during testing in the US, the company has confirmed. Pictures and a video of the incident were distributed on Twitter via @FrescoNews, where the source explained the accident happened in Tempe, Arizona, and no one was injured during the crash. "BREAKING: Self-driving Uber vehicle on it’s side after a collision in Tempe, AZ. Photos by @fresconews user Mark Beach," the news site said, followed by: "#UPDATE: No injuries yet reported in an accident involving a self-driving #uber, captured by @fresconews user Mark Beach in Tempe, AZ." Another source, local newspaper ABC15, said a normal passenger-operated car didn't stop for the automated vehicle and hit it. Uber's self-driving SUV fell on its side, witnesses said, and the driver of the manned car was given a talking to by police. There was a human behind the wheel and although initial reports said there was someone in the back of the autonomous car, Uber later said this wasn't the case. “We are continuing to look into this incident and can confirm we had no backseat passengers in the vehicle," Uber confirmed to TechCrunch in a statement. Uber has since paused its driverless cars trial programme in Arizona, but the company hasn't said how long for or whether schemes in other parts of the US have ground to a halt too. This is the second incident an Uber self-driving car has been involved in. The previous crash happened in California last December, when one of its vehicles failed to stop at a red light. 15/03/2017:  Intel has announced a $15.3 billion (£12.5 billion) proposal to acquire Jerusalem-based technology firm Mobileye, developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. The two companies have been collaborating alongside BMW since last year on a project aiming to produce driverless cars by 2021. Mobileye makes software and camera sensors for driverless cars, selling to companies such as General Motors, Nissan, and Hyundai. Intel said the acquisition expands its strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that strengthen the company’s computing and connectivity capabilities.  According to Intel, the driverless technology market could be worth up to $70 billion by 2030, and the acquisition of Mobileye gives it a major boost in the autonomous driving race. “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” said Mobileye CEO, President and Co-Founder, Ziv Aviram. He explained that by merging the infrastructure and resources of the two companies, their combined knowledge in areas like virtual driving, simulators, and hardware can be enhanced. “Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry,” Aviram added. The acquisition is not only a step-up for Intel, but it’s also groundbreaking for the Israeli tech industry. The deal marks the largest-ever purchase of high-tech Israeli technology, significantly surpassing the previous record-holding deal of $4.7 billion paid by Lucent Technologies for Chromatis Networks in 2000. 14/03/2017: California's Department of Motor Vehicles has revealed it is looking at allowing driverless car manufacturers to test their vehicles without a human driver in the front seat. "Since the adoption of the current testing regulations, the capabilities of autonomous technology has proceeded to the point where manufacturers have developed systems that re capable of operating without the presence of a driver inside the vehicle," the proposal explained. "The department is amending Article 3.7 to include the testing of vehicles that do not require the presence of a driver inside the vehicle and ensure the testing of such vehicles is conducted on California public roads in a safe manner." Companies wanting to trial their cars without a driver inside must apply for a new type of licence -  Manufacturer's Testing Permit -Driverless Vehicles. The governmental organisation said it has changed its view towards autonomous vehicles to promote the development of autonomous technology that will lead to safer driving practices, it explained. "These rules expand our existing autonomous vehicle testing programme to include testing vehicles where no driver is present," said Jean Shiomoto, director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles. "This is the next step in eventually allowing driverless autonomous vehicles on California roadways." The department has invited the public to out forward their arguments for and against allowing such vehicles to be tested on the road, minus a driver. Written comments can be submitted until 24 April. 03/03/2017: After being driven out of San Francisco for failing to secure a testing permit, Uber has announced it will now cooperate with California regulators as it seeks to restart its driverless car trials in the state. California's Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed to Reuters that it had held discussions with Uber to assist the application process for a self-driving permit, something that Uber originally claimed was unnecessary. Uber launched its self-driving pilot programme in San Francisco last December without state permission, arguing that because its cars were not fully autonomous and required "active physical control or monitoring", they did not meet state requirements for the $150 permit. The state DMV, however, disagreed, arguing that not only did Uber fail to seek the correct permits, but also failed to properly mark their fleet as test vehicles. It also pointed to the number of other companies operating self-driving cars in the state, including Google, Tesla and Ford, who had all correctly secured testing permits. As a result, the DMV revoked the registrations of 16 Uber vehicles, only one week into the trial, with the threat of further legal action if they continued to test. Uber has since relocated those test vehicles to Arizona, where the company has received a warm welcome from Republican state governor Doug Ducey, but has reapplied for permission to test vehicles in California. An Uber spokesperson said in a statement to IT Pro: "These cars are legally registered and are being driven manually. We are taking steps to complete our application to apply for a DMV testing permit. As we said in December, Uber remains 100% committed to California." It comes just says after the firm's CEO, Travis Kalanick, said he needed to "grow up" and seek leadership advice. 24/02/2017: Alphabet's Waymo — Google's self-driving car project — has sued Uber, accusing it of stealing 14,000 files to copy its sensing tech. Waymo said Uber and the autonomous trucking firm Otto, which Uber bought last year, had stolen plans for Waymo's Lidar, a laser based sensing technology. The complaint filed in California said: "Uber's Lidar technology is actually Waymo's Lidar technology." Lidar bounces light off objects to "see" where they are — it's not a new technology, but Waymo's version is reportedly a tenth of the price of existing systems, according to Reuters. "Hundreds of Waymo engineers have spent thousands of hours, and our company has invested millions of dollars to design a highly specialised and unique Lidar system," the company said in a post on Medium. "Waymo engineers have driven down the cost of Lidar dramatically even as we’ve improved the quality and reliability of its performance. The configuration and specifications of our Lidar sensors are unique to Waymo. Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company." Waymo said building the technology has taken seven years, while Uber's Otto appears to have done the same over nine months. The accusations centre on Anthony Levandowski, the founder of self-driving truck firm Otto, which hit the roads last year by shipping a lorry-load of Budweiser beer. In August, Uber bought the company. Before founding Otto, Levandowski worked on Google's self-driving project, now dubbed Waymo. It alleges that he downloaded 14,000 files before he resigned in January 2016 — including Lidar designs. "To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Mr. Levandowski searched for and installed specialised software onto his company-issued laptop," the Waymo blog post alleges. "Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation. Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr. Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints." Waymo said it spotted the knockoff design via an email slip-up. "Recently, we received an unexpected email," the company said. "One of our suppliers specialising in Lidar components sent us an attachment (apparently inadvertently) of machine drawings of what was purported to be Uber’s Lidar circuit board  —  except its design bore a striking resemblance to Waymo’s unique Lidar design." Uber said it took the allegations "seriously" and would "review this matter carefully". Waymo is seeking unspecified damages, but asked for Uber to be banned from using the Lidar information. "Competition in the self-driving space is a good thing; it pushes everyone to develop better, safer and more affordable technology," Waymo said in the blog post. "But we believe that competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions." It's not the first legal battle in the self-driving arena: in January, Tesla sued a former director of its Autopilot automation project for poaching its staff. 22/02/2017: Just over two months to the day after being kicked out of San Francisco, Uber has begun trials of its self-driving fleet in Arizona, this time with the permission of the state's authorities.  Self-driving Ubers are hitting the road in the Grand Canyon State. pic.twitter.com/tOgiw4GD1d — Uber (@Uber) February 21, 2017 Arizona Republican governor Doug Ducey is expected to be 'Rider Zero' on the latest trial for the autonomous ride-hailing service, which is available to residents of Tempe starting today Uber's previous test of 16 self-driving cars in California in December was met with opposition from the Department of Motor Vehicles, which claimed the company failed to apply for the correct test permits. Uber always maintained that because a human was always behind the wheel, the cars did not fit the criteria for the $150 permit. It appears, however, that Arizona has taken an entirely different approach to the testing of autonomous vehicles. In August 2015, Ducey signed an executive order in support of the development of self-driving technology, urging authorities to "undertake any necessary steps to support the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles" on roads within Arizona. AZ Gov @dougducey taking a ride in @Uber_AZ's new self driving car. Pretty slick looking machine! pic.twitter.com/1zFoDNYUKV — Ty Brennan (@TyFox10) February 21, 2017 Customers in Tempe are now able to hail a self-driving Volvo XC90 SUV on the Uber service, which will be overseen by two Uber engineers in the front seats, in case a situation arises that requires human intervention. This signifies a much needed win for Uber given a series of bad press reports over the past few months. Aside from the controversy in California, the technology is far from perfect and has been caught running red lights, as well as narrowly avoiding a collision in San Francisco. The company itself has come under fire this week, with claims of rampant sexism from a former Uber engineer. Uber has said it plans to expand testing to other cities in Arizona within the next few weeks. 17/02/2017: Google patents car that 'prevents harm' in accidents Google has patented a technology that could prevent injuries in the event of an accident. The company has filed a patent with the US patent office for "adjusting a shear pin to minimize an impact force felt by an object in a collision with a vehicle". This means its self-driving cars' computers could analyse the amount of force needed to prevent injury or damage to the person, animal or object it's about the crash into. “Computing devices within a vehicle may determine that an impact with an object cannot be avoided by way of braking, steering, and/or accelerating the vehicle,” the patent explained. “When this is the case, the computing devices may work to adjust the amount of force necessary to break one or more shear pins which are holding a panel of the vehicle in place. The force of impact on the object which the vehicle collides may be reduced, thereby limiting the severity of injuries and/or damage to the object.” The computer device inside an autonomous car would receive data that it is about to collide with an object and the shear pin, which determines what will happen to a vehicle when it is subjected to pressure, would move into a position that would cause it to break, meaning the car's panels would slide back and absorb the impact. “The characteristics of the object with which impact is imminent may be used to determine to adjust the amount of shear force necessary to break the one or more shear pins, in an effort to minimize the impact force felt by the object,” the patent said. “The size of an object may be used to estimate its mass. This in turn may be used to determine the appropriate amount of shear force for the shear pins.” Google's automated car company, Waymo, hasn't revealed whether the technology will be integrated into its cars or if it will license the technology to other automated car makers. 16/02/2017: Microsoft India has just announced a partnership deal with India's Tata Motors, collaborating on technologies designed to make driving a more personalised experience. The new partnership will focus around AI, IoT and machine learning technologies, and will provide Tata vehicles with advanced telematics, remote monitoring and sophisticated navigation technologies. The first vehicle produced as part of the new agreement will be shown off at the Geneva International Motor Show on 7 March. The company wants to create "a highly personalised, smart and safer driving experience across the digital life of a vehicle owner", according to Tata Motors managing director, Guenter Butschek. "In the first phase, the advanced offerings will incorporate technologies such as cloud computing, analytics, geo-spatial and mapping and increased human-machine interface, creating a new benchmark in the industry for connected vehicles," he said. "Using the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, we will provide the vehicle owners here as well as across the world a safe, productive and fun-driving experience," said Microsoft India's president, Anant Maheshwari, adding that Microsoft expects 90% of cars to be completely connected within three years. 13/02/2017: Ford is to invest $1 billion dollars into an AI startup over the next five years, comprised of ex-Google and Uber engineers who have worked on autonomous car projects. Argo AI will be led by CEO Bryan Salesky, formerly of Google, and Uber's Peter Rander as company COO, both of whom were leaders of their companies' self-driving car teams. The organisation, based at Ford's Pittsburgh headquarters, is expected to have more than 200 members by the end of the year. This represents the latest push by a car manufacturer into autonomous technology, which has become a highly competitive market over the past few years. Audi, Nissan, Tesla, and even companies traditionally not associated with vehicles, such as graphics processing firm Nvidia, are working on their own technology. "The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," said Ford CEO Mark Fields. "We believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term, and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future." The deal will see Ford focus on its development of vehicle hardware, including the exterior and interior design of autonomous cars, and the integration of new systems. Argo AI will latch onto Ford's current software development teams and help the company scale up its production. If all goes to plan, Ford intends to have a fully autonomous, level 4-capable vehicle for the commercial market by 2021. This, according to the Society of Automated Engineers (SAE), is one rank behind "fully autonomous", in which the AI is able to fully control every aspect of the driving and does not rely on the input of a human driver. "We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move," said Salesky, Argo AI's CEO. "We believe this partnership will enable self-driving cars to be commercialised and deployed at scale to extend affordable mobility to all." Although Argo AI will initially focus on supporting the production of Ford vehicles, the company has stated that future plans could include the licensing out of its technology to other firms wishing to move into the autonomous sector.

The Department for Transport is set to unveil plans for the two-in-one policy as it attempts to reduce the legal hurdles preventing self-driving cars from hitting the road in the UK. Who would ultimately be responsible for the cause of a driverless accident has been the cause of significant debate for legal bodies across the world. The latest plans will introduce policies that cover drivers while they are at the wheel, and then allows responsibility to be handed over to AI while in driverless mode. Claims made against accidents involving AI will be covered by the insurance company who will recuperate losses from the party responsible, which may include the car manufacturer. The government hopes this will make it easier for victims of crashes involving driverless vehicles to access compensation. "Automated vehicles have the potential to transform our roads in the future and make them even safer and easier to use, as well as promising new mobility for those who cannot drive," said transport secretary Chris Grayling, in a statement to the Telegraph. "But we must ensure the public is protected in the event of an incident and this week we are introducing the framework to allow insurance for these new technologies." Accidents involving driverless cars have raised questions as to who exactly is to blame for a crash. In June last year a driver was killed when his Tesla Model S collided with a tractor trailer after failing to break. But the government is keen to encourage the growth of the driverless car industry in the UK, an industry analysts predict will be worth almost $42 billion globally by 2025. Ian Crowder, head of public relations at AA, argued that although improving policies will make insurance claims more streamlined, there is no way to predict how other human drivers will respond to an increase in driverless vehicles.  "In the longer term the number of claims should dramatically fall," said Crowder. "However there are concerns relating to the behaviour of drivers of human-driven cars mixing with autonomous vehicles, which could lead to an increase in collisions." "For example, frustration at autonomous vehicles sticking to the speed limit; human drivers attempting to fit into smaller spaces between autonomous vehicles etc... which could lead to an increased number of collisions so that could lead in turn, to an increase in premiums overall," added Crowder. Japanese car manufacturer Nissan is expected to go ahead with its plans to test driverless cars on the streets of London later this month, following successful preliminary tests in Milton Keynes last year. 01/02/2017: A deal with automaker Mercedes-Benz will see its range of vehicles join Uber's ever-expanding fleet of self-driving cars. The partnership will see Germany's Daimler join forces with the popular ride-hailing service to introduce and operate its own self-driving cars on Uber's network. "Auto manufacturers like Daimler are crucial to our strategy because Uber has no experience making cars," said Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick. "This became very clear to me after I visited an auto manufacturing plant and saw how much effort goes into designing, testing and building cars." "That's why instead of building them ourselves, we want to partner with the best auto manufacturers in the world," he added. "We can combine Uber's global ridesharing network with the world-class vehicles of companies like Daimler, so that Uber riders can have a great experience getting around their cities." Uber has so far declined to offer the financial details of the new deal, however Daimler represents the first company to take advantage of Uber's new policy allowing third-party manufacturers to add their own self-driving cars. As a result of a $300 million deal with automaker Volvo, vehicles have already been piloted in Pennsylvania and Arizona using self-driving kits developed by Uber. However unlike previous deals, Uber will not own or manage the new fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, or be responsible for the research and development of the AI led software. Instead, Uber has simply added the Daimler manufactured cars to its self-driving vehicle range. 20/01/2017: Tesla semi-autonomous cars won't be recalled in US Tesla semiautonomous cars won't be recalled in the US, despite the technology inside one of its cars resulting in the death of a customer. Joshua Brown was killed when the Tesla he was driving collided with a lorry in May 2016. However, Tesla had claimed this wasn't because of its Autopilot technology failing, but rather user error, because although the autonomous system can be used as an assistance to the driver, drivers should never take their hands off the wheel. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which conducted an investigation into the crash, said data from the car's onboard tracking system revealed Brown had not made any attempt to brake, steer or do anything else to avoid the collision. He would have seen he was going to hit the lorry for seven seconds, which was enough for him to take action and override the Autopilot system, but he decided not to. "These systems require continual and full attention of the driver," Bryan Thomas from the NHSTA said. "It's not enough to put [information] in the owner's manual and hope drivers are going to read that. "Manufacturers must anticipate how drivers would use the functionality, and that some don't read the manual." The NHTSA said it would not take any action against Tesla, and found no faults with the vehicle, but would be monitoring the situation carefully to ensure it does not pose a risk to drivers. 04/01/2017: Oxford driverless car firm releases camera mapping Oxford self-driving car company Oxbotica has announced that the localisation and mapping software used in its prototype vehicles is now ready for general release. Comprising one part of the company's Selenium OS for autonomous cars, the firm has used its Dub4 software tool in the GATEway pods operating in Greenwich and in the company's own prototype vehicles, which were demonstrated in Milton Keynes last year. Oxbotica is competing in the same space as Google and Uber, but what sets it apart from other projects is that rather than the expensive laser and GPS systems seen in other cars, Oxbotica's mapping system can rely purely on vehicle-mounted cameras. "The software uses a single stereo camera mounted onto the car to determine its precise position and orientation in the world," the company explained in a statement. "With this localisation information, the software is then able to create and navigate using vision-based maps in highly unstructured environments without any reliance on GPS or expensive laser-based techniques." By negating the need for costly LIDAR systems, Dub4 has the potential to make self-driving technology much cheaper to produce, while Oxbotica claims it doesn't require specialised equipment to run; it can be installed and operated on off-the-shelf commodity PC hardware. "We're excited to be working on deployment of our class-leading Dub4 software solution, as part of our mission to achieve Level 4 autonomy by 2020," said Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith. "What we've done with Dub4 has never been done before and it represents a seismic shift for the self-driving vehicle industry, enabling a move away from GPS and 3D laser-based approaches. We're paving the way for more affordable and accurate solutions in the industry." How do self-driving cars work? Self-driving cars use a battery of sensors to detect their surroundings, including radar, lasers and camera arrays. The vehicle's onboard computer then uses specialised software to react to this input in real-time, adjusting the car's steering and acceleration to suit the situation. While some vehicles, such as the Google prototypes which have popularised the idea, are totally autonomous, other cars only automate certain aspects of driving. Tesla's Autopilot feature, for example, features adaptive cruise control, which maintains a safe speed and distance from other vehicles when driving on the motorway. It also features basic automated steering to ensure you don't accidentally drift into the wrong lane, and although it can perform basic steering maneuvers automatically, it is not intended to replace a human driver altogether. Are self-driving cars safe? There is still much debate over whether or not fully autonomous cars should be made widely available. Some say that their safety record is impeccable, while others argue that automobiles are simply too dangerous to be operated by an algorithm. This debate has been reignited by a number of high-profile Tesla crashes, one of which has been blamed on an Autopilot malfunction. The incidents have raised questions over whether or not self-driving technology is ready for implementation. On the other hand, Google has emphasised how safe its fleet of self-driving cars are. As part of the testing programme for its autonomous vehicles, the company has posted regular safety logs detailing any crashes the vehicles are involved in, with the vast majority being caused by human drivers in other cars. Experts remain divided, however, and if self-driving cars are ever likely to be widely commercially available, they will doubtless be heavily regulated, monitored and tested. When will self-driving cars hit the road? In many cases, they already have. Some high-end luxury vehicles already feature 'assisted driving' elements that are close to fully autonomous driving, with Tesla being the obvious example. Elsewhere, testing of various driverless car projects is underway in the US, with California, Texas, Seattle and more all hosting autonomous vehicle test runs. The UK government has also given the green light for similar trials in Britain, so UK commuters may soon be sharing the roads with autonomous shuttles. As for when driverless cars will become commercially available, however, that is yet to be seen. As the technology is young and comparatively untested, it is likely that substantial tests will have to be conducted in partnership with government and regulatory bodies before the vehicles are available for public purchase. There is also a question as to whether or not the average driver will be able to purchase one at all. Even if fully autonomous cars are allowed to be sold, the price of each vehicle is likely to be prohibitively expensive due to the large amount of sophisticated technology that goes into them. As such, it's likely to be at least a few years before autonomous cars are approved for general road use, and most likely another few years after that before they become a commonplace sight. Are driverless cars legal? As no fully autonomous cars have yet made it to the mass-production phase, no legislation currently exists to govern their public use. However, transport authorities both in the UK and in the US are currently in the process of drawing up new laws or amending old ones to account for driverless vehicles. In the UK, for example, companies need no permits or authorisation to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. "Real-world testing of automated technologies is possible in the UK today," the government's Pathway to Driverless Cars report reads, "providing a test driver is present and takes responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle; and that the vehicle can be used compatibly with road traffic law." The UK also plans to amend the Highway Code to allow vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems to change lanes on the motorway and be parked via remote control. Changes to car insurance would extend it to cover product liabilities for automated vehicles. Insurers would pay out to victims, then reclaim the money from the manufacturers. The US has also granted testing permits for driverless cars in four states, as well as publishing a 15-point safety checklist for manufacturers of autonomous vehicles in order to better regulate the emerging industry. Published by the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency, the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy also marks the agency's move to the SAE scale, which measures a vehicle's level of autonomy. The scale runs from zero, where the driver has total control of the vehicles, all the way to five - a totally autonomous car requiring no human input. Vehicles that measure two or three on the SAE scale - such as the Tesla and other semi-autonomous vehicles - are already road-legal both here and in the US, as the human driver is considered to be in control for the majority of the time. While many countries have committed to fostering a supportive environment for the development of autonomous cars, concrete legislation governing their use is still likely to be some years away, as the technology itself has not yet been fully finished. Who manufactures self-driving cars? The most well-known companies exploring self-driving cars are Google and Tesla, but there are very few companies connected to the automotive industry that aren't exploring the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber, for example, is currently testing its own fleet of autonomous taxis in Pittsburgh. Apple has also long been rumoured to be exploring the self-driving car field in some form, and has been linked to multiple different auto manufacturers, including McLaren. In addition to tech companies, however, regular car makers are also getting in on the act. Audi, Ford, BWM, Honda, Daimler, Volvo and more have all been dabbling in some form of autonomous driving project. Luxury passenger vehicles have also been experimenting with using the tech in industrial vehicles such as heavy goods lorries.

The Itanium project did not work out as hoped for Intel. (Courtesy: Wikipedia) The Itanic is finally pulling into port. Intel announced Thursday that it will ship the last version of its notorious Itanium server processor, which it once hoped would form the basis of its future chip designs but wound up becoming a very expensive lesson in hubris. The new processors, the Itanium 9700 family, will allow whoever is left running Itanium systems to plug the new chips into their servers and get a little bit of a performance boost, according to an Intel blog post. Familiar mostly to enterprise tech reporters of a certain age, Itanium is based on a proprietary instruction set that Intel and Hewlett-Packard — which helped fund the project in the late 1990s — thought would be more powerful and responsive than the server processors used by Sun Microsystems, IBM, and other companies that owned the market for servers around that time. But Itanium was plagued by product delays, cost overruns, skeptical IT buyers, and poor software support. Intel poured millions into marketing the chip, but the “Itanic” nickname stuck. An HP Integrity server, based around Intel’s Itanium chip (courtesy Wikipedia) The original hope was that Itanium would prove to be a more compelling path to 64-bit computing, but it forced IT organizations to rewrite their critical applications to run on the chip, and few were willing to do that. As companies with big expensive servers from companies like Sun realized they could actually get better bang for their buck by linking together boatloads of cheap x86 servers from the likes of Dell and HP, rival Advanced Micro Devices gave server buyers a much easier path to 64-bit computing using existing software written for this new “scale-out” design, and Intel was eventually forced to copy its rival’s approach. The whole thing actually worked out pretty well for Intel: the scale-out approach quickly became dominant, and its x86 chips are now at the heart of nearly every major data center in the world, including the Big Three public cloud providers. Still, Intel invested huge sums of money in Itanium only to watch rival Advanced Micro Devices pave an easier path to 64-bit computing with its x86 Opteron processor, which Intel was eventually forced to copy. The x86 instruction set is the cockroach of technology: the thing just won’t die. Of course, while Intel was fighting to make Itanium relevant, nearly all smartphones now run chips based on the ARM instruction set. While ARM companies keep talking about challenging Intel in the server market, they’re made no traction. But if Microsoft follows through on some of the ARM server plans it discussed last month, Intel’s dream of moving the tech industry off the x86 instruction set might be accomplished by its longtime partner.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Cheap gaming chips from AMD Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s cheaper Ryzen 5 CPUs By Jeremy Laird on May 11th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Serving up eight pukka CPU cores at a price mere mortals can afford was easily the most compelling part of the initial AMD Ryzen proposition. But there’s been some filling out of the Ryzen range since last we alighted the subject. Specifically, a load of quad-core and six-core models have hit retail. They’re significantly cheaper than the beefy eight-core beasts. Might they actually make more sense for gaming than those slightly flawed eight-core chips? It’s little more than journalistic OCD and of absolutely no consequence to the end-user experience. But it very slightly winds me up that AMD, like Intel, spurns logic with its CPU nomenclature. AMD has announced that Ryzen will come in three flavours for the foreseeable. Ryzen 7 is the performance king, Ryzen 5 balances price and performance and Ryzen majors on value. There are also – again for the foreseeable – three different basic configurations for Ryzen. Eight-core, six-core and quad-core. You might think they map neatly and logically to Ryzen 7, 5 and 3. But no, that would make too much sense. Ryzen 5 includes both six and quad-core models. Ryzen 3 has yet to be detailed. Anyway, the first thing to note about the latest quad and six-cores models is that some make a lot more sense in value terms than others. There’s about a £60 gap between the priciest six-core Ryzen, the £260 Ryzen 5 1600X, and the cheapest eight-core chip, the Ryzen 7 1700, for instance. Add about 5% to those numbers (and all the prices that follow, for that matter) for US $ prices. Given that you’re certainly going to also need a new motherboard and very likely some sticks of memory, too, the 1700 is the no brainer in that comparison. After all, you’re looking at perhaps £150 minimum for a decent X370 motherboard plus maybe £75 for 8GB of memory and perhaps a few more quid for sundry items like a new cooler. Factor in the motherboard, RAM and more and the cost of upgrading to Ryzen certainly adds up The plain old Ryzen 5 1600 non-X surely makes more sense at £219 given that it’s also six cores and likewise unlocked for easy overclocking, if you care about that sort of thing. It’s fully a £100 jump to the cheapest eight-core model from the Ryzen 5 1600. A similar logic applies to the quad-core models. The Ryzen 5 1500X clocks in at £179, which looks likes poor value when you can have 50% more cores for just £40 extra. To be honest, even the £159 Ryzen 5 1400 quad-core chip looks like marginal value when you factor in the overall costs of upgrading to Ryzen. Predictably, I’ve had a go with the two most difficult to justify models in the Ryzen 5 range, the 1600X and the 1500X. The former is clocked at 3.7GHz base and 4GHz Turbo, the latter at 3.5Ghz base and 3.7GHz Turbo. Both are a little quicker than their core-count-parity but cheaper siblings, the 1600 and 1400. But the point is that they’re broadly representative of the gaming experience you can expect from the six and quad-core breeds. Gaming joy in a small box? As it happens, when Ryzen was originally announced it seemed like the six core models could be the bang-for-buck sweet spot. Relatively affordable, reasonably high clocks for single threaded performance, plenty of cores and threads for multi-threading. Remember, every Ryzen can process two software threads in parallel per core. That’s pretty much how it pans out in practice. The 1600X makes similarly priced Intel processors look very, very silly in any software that’s multi-threaded, like video encoding. The catch, as it has been from the get go with Ryzen, is that the gaming performance is ever so slightly patchy. All Ryzen CPUs use the full eight-core processor die and disable cores in the two quad-core modules within the chip in symmetrical pairs. So, the configurations are therefore 4:4, 3:3, and 2:2 The benchmark numbers mostly look solid. But there’s no getting away from the fact that some games run tangibly less smooth on Ryzen than Intel CPUs. I had a good hard look, for instance, at Total War: Attila and every Ryzen chip I’ve dabbled with exhibits some stutter from which Intel processors simply don’t suffer. I even sense checked what I was seeing with passing colleagues. It’s unmistakable. And you simply wouldn’t spot it in the relatively small gap in average frame rate. It’s not a total deal breaker and most games run without such hitches. But for me, it slightly undermines Ryzen’s appeal for a dedicated gaming rig. As it happens, the quad-core Ryzen chip is no worse and indeed knocks out similar frame rates to the six-core model in most games. So, of all the existing Ryzen processors, it’s perhaps the quad-core 1400 that’s most compelling. It’s cheapest and you lose little in games. For the same price from Intel you’re looking at the quad-core, quad-thread Core i5-7400, which rocks in at 3GHz base and 3.5GHz Turbo but no scope for significant overclocking. Overall, the choice between the Core i5-7400 and Ryzen 5 1400 is awfully tough. But if the decision is being driven primarily by gaming concerns, then with a somewhat heavy heart I still lean Intel. As things stand, I think you’re probably guaranteed a great gaming experience even with that relatively lowly Intel Core i5 processor. To be sure, the Ryzen chip will mostly be just as good. But just occasionally it will frustrate. The problem, therefore, is this. I reckon the mere knowledge that the Ryzen option might occasionally underperform can be quite damaging to one’s subjective enjoyment. I’m pretty sure every time a game felt a bit juddery I’d be wondering if the Ryzen CPU was to blame, even when the bottleneck was likely elsewhere. It’s a similar psychology that has always put me off multi-card graphics – that constant, niggling doubt whether it’s working properly. There’s not a lot in it, let’s be clear about that. But Intel retains its status as the go-to CPU option for gamers for now.

Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 00:19 GurtTractor says: From my experience of using my 1700x so far I can say that Total War Atilla is a bit of an outlier in terms of performance on these new CPUs. Empire Total War for example runs superbly, load is spread well across all threads, allowing me to run maximum size battles with no discernable slowdown. Total Warhammer has pretty consistent performance generally, though still can lag a bit in very large battles (maybe just because it is a bit more modern, though I get the impression that optimisation could be better). Atilla by comparison seems to run terribly, clearly lacking optimisation for high core count CPUs and/or the Ryzen architecture. Every other game that I have tried has seemed pretty solid on this CPU (Actually ARMA 3 is somewhat poorly optimised too). IMO the only two Intel chips that are worth buying at the moment are the low end Pentium G4560 which nearly matches the i3 chips at a much lower price, no competition from AMD for this one yet (Ryzen 3 should be soon), and the other chip that might be worthwhile is the i7 7700k which seems like the best chip if you really need that single core performance for high refresh gaming or productivity tasks that eat up clockspeed (I think some Photoshop stuff is mainly single core). Every other Intel CPU just seem seems like terrible value compared with the kind of general performance/price of the Ryzen chips. Like the 7600k vs the 1600 for example, 4 threads vs 12!! No 5Ghz overclock can really make up for that. Regarding the i5 7400 vs the 1400; you’re probably not going to be wanting to push the highest framerates with either CPU, but the eight threads of the 1400 vs the 4 of the 7400 should mean more consistent performance with most modern titles. Even if it is just for gaming I would definitely still go for the 1400 if that was my budget, here’s video comparing the two (not the most extensive of tests but I think it’s pretty fair) – link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 06:45 SquarePeg says: Thanks for the link at the bottom of your post. That was a very solid comparison between the Ryzen 1400 and the i5 7400. Seeing how so many games only make use of four threads I’m very interested to see how the Ryzen 3’s perform. A quick check on pcpartpicker shows the R5 1400 as low as $159.99 here in the US. So I’m wondering how low AMD will go with say the R3 1100. $99 to $119 at launch seems to be a reasonable expectation. If the Ryzen 1100 can easily overclock to 3800mhz+ it would be an fantastic value. Also, given that a socket AM4 system will be upgradeable for several more generations of Ryzen CPU’s it makes the Intel i5 7400 a hard sell. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 08:08 Vesperan says: Slight correction for article – the base clock of the Ryzen 1600X is 3.6ghz, not 3.7ghz. I have an issue with this article, and its one I share with damn near every review out there – with the notable exception of Anandtech’s Ryzen 5 review. Which is unbelievably detailed in the permutations of CPUs/GPUs/resolutions it tests. The issue I have is that its too simple to say Ryzen is worse than Intel at gaming. Yes it is true if you match it with an Nvidia 1080 and a high refresh rate 1080 resolution monitor. But it’s less true with an Nvidia 1070 or 1440p monitor(GPU constraint kicking in). Go 4k monitor and its irrelevant entirely. Have a bog standard 1080p monitor and a Nvidia 1080? What the hell are doing matching that with an Nvidia 1080 GPU? The monitor is pretty much maxed out. Drop the graphics drop down to an Nvidia 1060/Radeon 480 and below – the GPU is pretty much your entire constraint. And so – is Ryzen “worse” at gaming? Sure – if you have one helluva graphics card, and monitor to match. But if you’re like me on something like a mid-range RX470 and budget 1080p monitor? (which I would say is a lot of people) Well, you just picked up a CPU that smashes the comparable Intel i5 chip in a lot of ways, for effectively identical gaming performance.

Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 23:56 sweenish says: There is a reason that CPU benches are run like that. While you’re correct that no one runs a setup like that, the point is to benchmark the CPU, not the GPU. They did what they said they would, and benchmarked the CPU. It’s up to you to determine how the CPU performance stacks up against what you want to do, and you can do that, because you have accurate CPU performance numbers. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 08:52 Replikant says: I beg to disagree. The Ryzen processors are really good value for the money compared to Intels offerings and, in addition, they are probably a lot more future-proof, considering that newer games tend to have improved multi-core support and Intel is ramping up the core-count as well. Secondly, it’s a new platform, performance is bound to improve (wait for Zen+, maybe). Third, total cost of ownership of a Ryzen system should be lower than an Intel system, as far as I know, the AM4 socket is going to be around for a while. But, most importantly: We are just coming out of a ten year stretch when Intel ruled the (PC) world and followed the Way of the Dinosaurs: Become greedy, fat and lazy and hurt the (PC) environment as whole in consequence. AMD does not beat Intel in raw performance (that would be the i7 7700k) but has an advantage in terms of performance / price. So, having seen what a monopolized market looks like, we should all seriously consider buying AMD chips once in a while. Most of us probably won’t, though, because in Jeremy’s words: “The problem, therefore, is this. I reckon the mere knowledge that the Ryzen option might occasionally underperform can be quite damaging to one’s subjective enjoyment.” Funnily enough, gaming theory favors Intel.

Console game development probably points to the future of the bigger, high-sys-req PC games. This is where AMD’s long game with heterogeneous computing starts to pay off. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 09:15 Tyrmot says: I think as well while you *might* give intel the nod today, a very important consideration is that having 2 extra cores in your system right now is going to give a hell of a lot more future-proofing than going with 4. While it’s always wise to be a bit careful about future predictions, the scaling of software (including games) across more cores is, it’s reasonable to assume, pretty inevitable. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 09:27 Addie says: At the moment, having to buy a new motherboard and RAM (and probably a new graphics card to make use of the CPU) makes this look a not-too-compelling upgrade over my FX9370. But probably by the time they’re a significant improvement the prices will have come down a bit and any bugs will be squashed. I’d certainly be looking to buy an Ryzen system if I was building from new, though. Looks like the main difference between the x370 chipsets and the b350 chipsets is that the former supports SLI / CFx? I thought that dual graphics cards were basically dead in the water now anyway, being supported by very few new games, and that one graphics card at twice the price was a much more sensible investment? In which case, you can cut the price of the motherboard in half and buy more RAM instead. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 10:30 Arathorn says: The B350 motherboards might not be great for overclocking, at least that is how I understood it when I was researching for my build. Apart from that, it seems to be a great platform. It kind of depends on what you intend to do with it. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 13:09 GurtTractor says: I think most B350 boards should be fine for overclocking actually, you are more likely to hit the wall in the silicon lottery on your specific CPU than exceed the potential of the board chipset. Always a good idea to check reviews and forums for people’s overclocking results though. The main benefits to X370 are the greater number of ports and things like fan headers, many of the board’s VRMs and other components are in theory a little better but the difference is not huge. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 10:28 Arathorn says: An extra thing to keep in mind is that the 1600 comes with a bundled cooler, and the 1600X does not, so the plain 1600 is an even better price proposition than the X. RAM support for Ryzen is still somewhat crappy, making it hard to get fast RAM to work at full speed at the moment. And Ryzen benefits from fast RAM because its clock speed is linked to the communication speed between Ryzen’s two core complexes. I finally bought and built a PC with the 1600 and an RX 580 video card last week, and so far I’m very happy with it. I haven’t been able to test it with something heavy yet for lack of games, but Doom 2016 is on offer on Steam this weekend, so that sounds like a fine opportunity. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 16:05 Megadeth dude says: It’s a fallacy to assume you need “a decent X370 motherboard”. Why would you need at least that? You probably don’t know what the features are on an X370 and yet you’re assuming you need to spend the money for that. I personally got myself a cheap Gigabyte B350 Gaming (non-X even cheaper model) because I didn’t need crossfire or additional LED strip control. And this, for my Ryzen 7 1800X. And I am getting the most necessary feature, which is BIOS updates with new AGESA for memory compatibility updates. Disappointed in the article. Everyone, please watch AdoredTV’s vids on YouTube instead of taking advice from RPS. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 18:07 GurtTractor says: There’s even going to be X300 motherboards at some point which will be a cut-down small form factor (Mini-ITX) version with fewer USB ports and stuff but will allow overclocking. Should be great for a portable PC or living room console replacement. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 20:20 wodin says: I’m considering an update to the 1600 chip. Currently have a AMD 6300. Also it seems the new Ryzen and MB’s use PCI Express 3 at last. Priced a 1600 and a 370 MB for around £350. Will my current Mem be OK in the 370 Motherboard? Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 21:34 GurtTractor says: If you mean can you use your DDR3 RAM that you are currently using with your 6300, then unfortunately that wont work as DDR3 wont be compatible. Ryzen and the AM4 motherboards require DDR4 memory, which is sadly quite expensive at the moment. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 21:51 Megadeth dude says: In addition to what GurtTractor said, you might want to double check if you really need a 370 mobo. It has features that the majority don’t need, so perhaps you can save a few bucks with a 350 instead. That price difference might just as well go towards a 1600X.

Still not persuaded by AMD to buy their inferior cheap ass crap with awful drivers decade after decade written in a basement by a bunch of students somewhere in India. After a bunch of “value” videocards AMD is a “never again” company in my books. Sure it’s an awful thing to say but AMD, sadly, still isn’t a valid competition nor for NVIDIA nor for Intel and I see no point in supporting them just in case things get better somewhere in the future.

The company has started volume shipping four new Itanium CPUs which, barring any unforeseen circumstances, will be the final Itanium-branded chips to roll off Intel’s assembly lines. Codenamed Kittson, the new processors include the Itanium 9720, 9740, 9750 and 9760, all of which are quad-core components (save for the high-end 9760 which packs eight cores and 32MB of cache with a base clock frequency of 2.66GHz). They are manufactured using a dated 32nm process. A spokesperson for Intel confirmed with PCWorld that beyond Kittson, there will be no additional chips launching from the Itanium family. Itanium isn’t exactly a household name but there are a couple of good reasons for that. Aside from the fact that it’s a server market product, Itanium never really took off in the way that Intel and HP had hoped. It was plagued over the years by multiple setbacks and even earned the nickname “Itanic,” a reference to the “unsinkable” Titanic ship. With Itanium headed to the grave, Intel is now free to focus on Xeon which it rebranded just last week. Moving forward, Xeon chips will be classified as Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum categories.

These new cores, codenamed Kittson, will be the last Itanium processors Intel manufacturers. Kittson is the first update to Poulson, which debuted a new Itanium architecture back in 2012, but it includes no additional features or capabilities — just higher clock speeds in some cases. We’ve aligned the chart from Intel’s CPU database (available at ark.intel.com) to show the upgrades to the higher-end eight-core CPUs, and this is it for the CPU The Register once nicknamed “Itanic.” The highest-end eight-core Itanium CPU gets a 133MHz speed bump, while the lower-end eight-core doesn’t even get that — the 9740 is literally the same chip as the 9540, with the exact same clock speed. The quad-core models (not shown above) all pick up an additional 133MHz of clock speed, but nothing else. It’s a bit of a sad end to what was once billed as Intel’s most exciting, forward-looking design. Back in the late 1990s, Itanium was pitched as a joint project between HP and Intel, one that would produce a true successor to the various RISC architectures that were still in-market at that time. Intel and HP both spent huge amounts of money and burned an enormous amount of development time trying to bring a new type of microprocessor to market, only to see Itanium crash and burn while x86 boomed. So what went wrong with Itanium? A brief history Itanium uses a computing model called EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing), which grew out of VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word). One of its primary goals was to move the work of deciding what workloads to execute from the CPU back to the compiler. To understand why this was considered desirable, it helps to understand a bit of CPU history. In the 1970s and early 1980s, most CPUs were CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) designs. These designs ran at relatively low clock speed, but could perform highly complex operations in a single clock cycle. At the time, this made sense, since the cost of memory actually dominated the total cost of a computer and was extremely slow. The less memory your code required and the fewer memory accesses it depended on, the faster it could execute. Beginning in the 1980s, a new type of architecture, RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) began to become popular. RISC architecture reduced CPU design complexity, instituted simpler instruction sets and CPU designs, but clocked those designs at higher frequencies. Both MIPS and SPARC have their origins in early RISC research, for example, and all modern higher-end x86 chips decode x86 operations into RISC-style micro-ops for execution. Debates over whether RISC or CISC were ‘better’ somewhat misses the point; CISC made very good sense at one point in history, and RISC-like designs made good sense at another. This graph of expected Itanium sales shows part of why the chip was such a disaster — it was hyped as an overwhelming Next Big Thing and completely failed to take a leadership position. Image by Wikipedia EPIC isn’t directly related to RISC, but the engineers at HP and Intel were hoping EPIC would be a huge leap above the x86 designs of the early and mid-1990s in the same way that RISC designs had proven themselves superior to the CISC architectures of the 1970s. The goal for EPIC was to push instruction scheduling, branch prediction, and parallelism extraction on to the compiler. In theory, this would free up die space for additional execution units, which could then be used to execute parallel workloads even more quickly. Instead of using hardware blocks on the CPU to organize workloads for out-of-order optimal execution, the compiler would handle that task. All the CPU has to do is execute the code it gets handed in the order and manner it was told to execute it. The only problem was, it didn’t work well in practice. Memory accesses from cache and DRAM are non-deterministic, which meant the compiler can’t predict how long they will take — and if the compiler can’t predict how long they’ll take, it’s going to have a hard time scheduling workloads to fill the gap. Itanium was designed to present a huge array of execution resources that the compiler would intelligently fill, but if the compiler can’t keep them filled, it’s just wasted die space. Itanium was designed to extract and exploit instruction-level parallelism, but compilers of the time struggled to find enough ILP in most workloads to justify the expense and difficulty of running code on the platform. And EPIC was so radically different from any other architecture, there was no way to cleanly port an application. These days, we talk a lot about differences between x86 and ARM processors, but x86 and ARM are practically blood relatives to one another compared with EPIC and x86. Of course, technical reasons aren’t the only reason why Itanium failed. The chips were expensive, difficult to manufacture, and years behind schedule. Intel made a high-profile declaration that Itanium was the future of computing and represented its only 64-bit platform. Then AMD announced its own AMD64 instruction set, which extended 64-bit computing to the x86 architecture. Intel didn’t change course immediately, but it eventually cross-licensed AMD64. This was a tacit admission that Itanium would never come to the desktop. Then, a few years ago, a high-profile court case between Oracle and HP put a nail in Itanium’s coffin. Today’s chips are the very definition of a contract fulfillment, with no improvements, cache tweaks, or other architectural boosts. Most, I suspect, will shed no tears for Itanium, particularly given its impact on the development of other, more promising architectures like PA-RISC and Alpha. But its failure is also a testament to how some of the ‘facts’ that get passed around CPU industry aren’t as simple as we might think. x86 is often discussed in disparaging terms as an outdated and ancient architecture, as if no one had the guts to take it outside and shoot it. But in reality, Intel made multiple attempts to do just that, from the iAPX 432 (begun in 1975) to the i860 and i960, to Itanium itself. And despite an emphasis on parallelism that sounds superficially promising, given the difficulty modern programmers have had with scaling applications to use multiple threads in an effective manner, Itanium represented another dead-end branch of research that never managed to deliver the real-world performance it promised on paper.

The South Korean company, one of Qualcomm’s largest customers, and Intel, one of its biggest competitors, filed arguments Friday in support of the FTC’s case against Qualcomm. Both contend the San Diego-based company stops them from competing fairly against it by leveraging patents that cover the fundamentals of modern phone systems. More from Bloomberg.com: Trump Escalates War With FBI, and the Bureau Fights Back “Intel is ready, willing, and able to compete on the merits in this market that Qualcomm has dominated for years,” Intel said in a posting on its website . “But Qualcomm has maintained an interlocking web of abusive patent and commercial practices that subverts competition on the merits.” Samsung claims its in-house chip unit is artificially held back by Qualcomm’s unwillingness to license its technology.  License Refused “Despite having requested a license from Qualcomm, Samsung cannot sell licensed Exynos chipsets to non-Samsung entities because Qualcomm has refused to license Samsung to make and sell licensed chipsets,” Samsung said in a filing. Samsung, the world’s biggest smartphone maker, uses a mixture of suppliers -- including itself and Qualcomm -- for the crucial components in its handsets. More from Bloomberg.com: Trump’s Know-Nothing Tour de Force Qualcomm didn’t immediately respond to requests seeking comment on the filings. The company is trying to fend off a series of legal and regulatory challenges to its business practices around the world, including a suit by Apple Inc ., one of its largest customers. The chipmaker gets most of its profits from selling the rights to use patents that are essential to all modern mobile phone systems. Many of the cases target the link between those license fees and its semiconductor business. Earlier Friday, the FTC urged a judge to reject Qualcomm’s request for dismissal of the agency’s case. The allegations “present a forceful antitrust case,” the commission said in a filing in federal court in San Jose, California. A hearing is set for June 15. More from Bloomberg.com: White House Refuses to Say Whether Trump Tapes Conversations Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said last month that the FTC’s complaint is riddled with ”fallacies and failures.” “The Federal Trade Commission’s latest submission to the court does nothing to cure the fundamental flaws in its complaint against Qualcomm: no coherent theory of competitive harm and no allegations of the type of conduct that the antitrust laws are designed to address,” Qualcomm said Friday in a statement. “The complaint therefore should be dismissed.” Shares of Qualcomm, the world’s fourth-largest chipmaker, have slumped this year on concern that the growing legal challenges will hurt its main source of profit. The stock has lost 15 percent in 2017 compared with a 15 percent gain by the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Qualcomm Inc., 17-cv-00220, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). Updates with Samsung, Intel allegations in second paragraph.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Huh: Comey turns down Senate Intel Committee’s invitation to testify next week posted at 6:01 pm on May 12, 2017 by Allahpundit Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES It’s subpoena time. Senate Intel committee ranking member Mark Warner (D-VA) told MSNBC Friday that former FBI Director James Comey will not be appearing before the committee next Tuesday, despite an invitation to speak with the committee behind closed doors. That’s after a day of intrigue following President Trump taunting Comey over the prospect of “tapes” from their conversations before the firing. “He can’t look eager to shiv his old boss, can he?” tweeted my pal Karl, speculating about Comey’s motives. That’s probably right. With Trump immolating himself over this in interviews and on Twitter, replete with threats and insults, Comey’s better off getting out of Trump’s way and letting him continue to make trouble for himself. The narrative that’s being set up here for him by Trump’s critics is that he’s a flawed but well-meaning lawman who did his duty with the Russia probe and was punished for it by a lawless, vindictive president. If Comey goes up to the Hill and tears Trump up in front of the Intelligence Committee, he loses some of that perception that he’s above the fray, concerned only with duty. And if he cares as much about the FBI’s reputation as his allies claim, he must realize that ripping the president to a bunch of congressmen a week after he was fired won’t reflect well on a Bureau that’s already taken heavy flak for politicization. Or maybe the guy’s just tired of media heat and wants to let it cool down before he says something else in public: Source w/firsthand knowledge tells me Comey turned down Senate invite to testify b/c "wants to lay low for a while & take some time off" — Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) May 12, 2017 Worst-case scenario: The Committee subpoenas him and he goes to the Hill as the reluctant truthteller, forced to speak out against President Trump even though he was willing to stay home and not say a word. And if they don’t subpoena him, no worries. Comey himself is probably the source in at least half the stories this week citing a “source close to Comey” for his thinking. He has ways of getting his opinions out. Speaking of which, a … source close to Comey told Jake Tapper that Trump did ask him to pledge his loyalty at a dinner in January and that Comey was “taken aback” by it. Jeanine Pirro asked Trump if that’s true in an interview set to Saturday. Nope, said Trump — although he thought it wouldn’t be a bad question to ask and wouldn’t be inappropriate: Trump, after appearing to threaten the FBI director he just fired with a possible secret WH recording, now says he won't talk about it pic.twitter.com/qJnVJSqFdw — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) May 12, 2017 Here’s Chris Wallace and Shepard Smith aghast at the idea that Trump not only might have recorded his chat with Comey but would want to advertise that fact.

It is unclear what "tapes" Trump is referring to. White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Friday declined to clarify, and would not say whether Trump records conversations in the Oval Office. Both the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees are looking into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Members of both panels have requested more details on Comey's firing.  A committee aide for the Senate Intelligence Committee told The Huffington Post on Friday that they are exploring how to compel the White House to give them any records.  Sen.

I ask that you confirm that this is the case," she wrote.  She added that if there aren't any tapes McGahn should "confirm that fact in writing and explain the president's statements about possible recordings from earlier today."  Feinstein is giving McGahn a week to respond to her letter.

The skinny is this: if the info is accurate, Intel will be branding its purported quad-core Kaby Lake-X CPUs as Core i7s, while the rumored six-, eight-, 10-, and 12-core Skylake-X CPUs on the same platform will be known as Core i9s. Watch your sodium level as we dive in. This information comes courtesy of a few people on the Anandtech forums. Forum user Sweepr posted a list of upcoming processors and promised an image as proof, which was subsequently delivered by forum user dooon. The image appears to show an Intel presentation open in Powerpoint, displaying a list of LGA 2066 processors and their relevant specifications. We've reformatted the information in a table below.   Cores/threads Base clock Turbo "Turbo Max" L3 PCIe 3.0 Memory TDP Core i9-7920X 12/24 TBD TBD TBD 16.5 MB 44 lanes Quad-channel DDR4-2666 140W Core i9-7900X 10/20 3.3 GHz 4.3 GHz 4.5 GHz 13.75 MB 44 lanes Quad-channel DDR4-2666 140W Core i9-7820X 8/16 3.6 GHz 4.3 GHz 4.5 GHz 11 MB 28 lanes Quad-channel DDR4-2666 140W Core i9-7800X 6/12 3.5 GHz 4.0 GHz N/A 8.25 MB 28 lanes Quad-channel DDR4-2666 140W Core i7-7740K 4/8 4.3 GHz 4.5 GHz N/A 8 MB 16 lanes Dual-channel DDR4-2666 112W Core i7-7640K 4/4 4.0 GHz 4.2 GHz N/A 6 MB 16 lanes Dual-channel DDR4-2666 112W There's a lot to talk about here. Most profound is further fuel for the notion that Intel will once again be increasing the core count of its top-shelf Core-series processor, this time to 12 cores. The idea of having to buy a ten-core processor to run a pair of graphics cards with a full 16 lanes of PCIe 3.0 for each remains as annoying as ever. A few discrepancies popped up between the information posted by Sweepr and the information in the image posted by dooon. Sweepr claims that the Skylake-X-based Core i9 processors will have TDP specs ranging up to 160W, but all of the chips in the image appear to say 140W. Sweepr also claims that the Skylake-X processors will have 1 MB of L2 cache. That would be four times as much as today's Skylake and Kaby Lake processors, and might help to explain the relatively paltry amount of L3 cache in the Skylake-X CPUs. The Core i7-6950X ten-core CPU has 25MB of L3 cache, for comparison's sake. The information didn't come with any pricing details, so we'll have to wait and see what the bottom line looks like for these chips—assuming this information is even accurate. If so, that means we'll be seeing these parts next month save for the 12-core Core i9-7920X. That part is supposedly launching in August.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman #Tech News: Why Smaller and Safer Is the Key to NXT-ID (NASDAQ: $NXTD) Winning Big with the Internet of Things May 12, 2017 (Investorideas.com Newswire) There’s no denying the potential for the Internet of Things (IoT), the technology that connects mobile devices, wearables, homes, cars and, realistically, any object anywhere via the Internet. The growth projections are mind-boggling, including tech giants Cisco (CSCO) and Intel (INTC) estimating, respectively, that the number of connected devices will climb from 15 billion in 2016 to as many as 50 billion and 200 billion by 2020. Analysts at MarketsandMarkets forecast a 33.3% compound annual growth rate from 2016 to 2021 that will grow the IoT market size from $157.05 billion in 2016 to $661.74 billion by 2021. With these types of projections, it’s no surprise that companies are investing in IoT and wearables as new profit streams. Even Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), a company famous for steering clear of tech plays, is addressing the opportunity. Berkshire’s jewelry manufacturer subsidiary, the Richline Group, is introducing Ela, a wearable smart jewelry line. The common thread for IoT devices, however, is for tech companies and manufacturers to eliminate the two biggest barriers to wider consumer adoption: convenience and security concerns. Consumers just want their cool tech devices to work and not have to worry about them. This puts pressure on tech companies to create devices and products that don’t feel like technology at all. As a result, IoT devices are increasingly emphasizing on miniaturized hardware that is equally powerful while consuming less energy. At the same time, with the steady advance of IoT phenomenon, there is a steady advance threats as well, making privacy and security features paramount to safe implementation and industry growth. These are the driving forces in a number of applications and consumer acceptance for the IoT market. Addressing size and safety is a primary focus of NXT-ID, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXTD), a visionary technology company that with its business model centered on mitigating risks associated with IoT and smart devices, as well as mobile computing and m-commerce. To address the needs of these markets, NXT-ID has a spectrum of expertise covering digital payments, biometrics, miniaturization and encryption. „These four disciplines are part and parcel to the connected world today and of the future,” Gino Pereira, Chief Executive Officer of NXT-ID, told Equities.com of his company’s position in the industry. „They accurately identify who somebody is, complete a transaction, protect the integrity of the transaction and verify the data recipient on the other side. People initially think of payment applications – and rightfully so as fintech is a hot space – but we see the complete picture, meaning that our technologies are tantamount in any form of communication.” Where IoT and Digital Payments Converge Ultimately, NXT-ID’s technology focuses on enabling consumers to use IoT devices the way they were meant to be used, securely and intuitively. With upwards of 200 billion new IoT devices coming online over the next few years, the company’s technology could be positioned to serve as a conduit of sorts for the new industry. „Every single IoT device requires the type of applications we specialize in, which has us participating in an industry expected to grow into many hundreds of billions of dollars in short order,” Pereira told Equities. To get a sense of the potential for NXT-ID, just look at the company’s underlying technology in the fintech space, particularly digital payments. In March, NXT-ID expanded on this core segment of the company, announcing that it signed a letter of intent to merge businesses with Fit Pay, Inc., a privately-held provider of a white-label technology platform that provides payment, credential management, authentication, capabilities and other secure services to wearable and IoT devices. This merger is key going forward to NXT-ID because Fit Pay is already approved by Visa and MasterCard as a chip payment technology. This is a natural fit with synergies that will save on expenses and bring a whole new suite of products and sales channels to NXT-ID to cross sell products and services. „People are going to continue to demand more and more functionality from their devices,” Pereira said to Equities. „Our technology serves as a platform for which we can add bells and whistles upon demand. By the end of 2017, we’ll be shipping IoT products into the marketplace with some name brands that people at home know well. To that point, we’re only scratching the surface and still have a long way to run on that front.” Fit Pay CEO Michael Orlando says that the combination of the two companies will result in „offering transformational products and services to the marketplace.” As Fit Pay’s top executive, Orlando established relationships that can further catapult NXT-ID into a leadership position in the smart wearables market, including teaming with secure element manufacturer STMicroelectronics and G&D Mobile Security to offer manufacturers and financial institutions worldwide a turnkey service for deploying wearable payment devices, such as bracelets, watches and even key fobs. Long-Term Vision, Near-Term Results While NXT-ID certainly has its eyes fixated on the future of IoT, it is also actively diversifying to address many market segments. The company has partnered with travel and lifestyle community membership provider WorldVentures to market the flye smart card. With beta testing running, the flye card will soon be available exclusively to WorldVentures’ more than 500,000 DreamTrip members as a comprehensive wallet alternative. flye is built upon NXT-ID’s miniaturized wireless technology that combines up to 10 records (i.e. credit cards, loyalty cards, identification, etc.) in one small, secure device. The device can be used for any of the cards original applications, while at the same time earning reward points that can be used towards DreamTrip vacations. Even more uniquely, the device facilitates truly personalized experiences by privately announcing the user upon arrival at participating hotels, restaurants, venues and more. In the healthcare and medtech space, NXT-ID acquired LogicMark LLC in July 2016, bringing a leading provider of unmonitored personal emergency response devices (PERS) under its umbrella. LogicMark manufactures and distributes its PERS systems through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as dealers and distributors of durable medical equipment and security devices. By selling PERS products outright, LogicMark delivers a less cumbersome product to the consumer by eliminating the need for call centers and monthly contracts, while decreasing operational costs for the company. In a world with an aging population and a trend shift away from hospital and care settings to the home, LogicMark has an established position in the growing market. The impact of LogicMark has been felt immediately, as disclosed in preliminary results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Revenues for the quarter rose from $42,302 in Q1 2016 to about $6.6 million in Q1 2017 (+15,502%). Compared to Q4, a more apples-to-apples comparison given LogicMark was integrated in both quarters, revenues improved about 46%. Gross profit for the latest quarter was approximately $3.5 million, reversing from a gross loss of ($32,853) in the year prior quarter, while climbing sharply from gross profit of $2.0 million in Q4 2016. [embedded content] Independence With No Monthly Fees from LogicMark on Vimeo. „Our first quarter results for 2017 show continued substantial growth following the significant progress we reported in Q4 2016,” Pereira stated. „LogicMark had a record sales month during the first quarter and we have started to deliver the flye card in significant quantities to World Ventures in anticipation of their product launch. We remain confident that we will continue the improvement in our operating results during the remainder of 2017 and look forward to the forthcoming merger with Fit-Pay, Inc. to further broaden our capabilities and customers.” Complete results are expected on May 15, 2017 after the market close. On top of the improving financial performance thanks to expanded distribution of LogicMark devices, NXT-ID is applying the latest technologies to develop next generation medical bracelets. Pereira explained that the innovations take PERS devices from being much more than the „Help, I’ve fallen and can’t get up!”-type of just emergency uses to include devices that track healthcare and statistics, data that is important to clinicians, healthcare and insurance providers. „Medtech is an exciting opportunity. We’re also looking at some hospital systems in terms of their needs for verification systems for access to medical records and protecting medical records from breaches by implementing new technologies,” Pereira told Equities. The Technology Behind the Technology Pereira further emphasized the company’s model to stay squarely centered on a business-to-business (B2B) growth strategy. To achieve this, the company has meticulously built an impressive list of board and advisory board members with incredible reach, including William Fields, the former President and CEO of Wal-Mart Retail Stores and CEO of Viacom’s Blockbuster Entertainment Group. Other advisors and board members include Ken Moy, director of Global Payments and Emerging Commerce at Subway and formerly SVP and Group Head of US Emerging Payments at MasterCard Worldwide; Lawrence Flanagan, President and CEO of AARP Member Services; and retired Major General David Gust, a principal at his consulting firm specializing in the defense sector, to name a few. Pereira is adamant that you can’t put IoT into a box and that there are no clear lines between where wearables stop and IoT begins, or the same for smart card and IoT and so on. „IoT touches everything,” Pereira said. „The key point is that if everything is going to be interconnected frm our clothes to our homes to our personal information, we really need to make sure that the security is as solid as we can possibly make it. There were some 100 million-plus wearable devices in the consumer space last year, with roughly 63% of them payment enabled. The last thing that we need is those devices connected to other devices and for hackers to get in. Cutting edge technologies will lead the charge in increased security, which is where we come in.” WorldVentures, LogicMark and Fit Pay exemplify some of the opportunities that underpin both near- and long-term catalysts for NXT-ID. As such, the company and its investors find themselves uniquely positioned with revenue generating operations today through all three components, while traveling down the runway to mass adoption of IoT and advanced wearable devices, which the company is presciently positioning itself for right now.

The exercise provided weapons familiarization to Marines upon arriving in Afghanistan. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by Sgt. Demetrius Munnerlyn/Released)    Afghanistan Will Keep ‘Deteriorating’ Without Game-Changing New Strategy, Intel Chiefs Declare Saagar Enjeti Reporter 9:56 AM 05/12/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP The U.S. effort in Afghanistan will continue to suffer without a radical new approach, Defense Intelligence Agency chief Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart told Congress Thursday. Stewart further warned that continuation down the current road in Afghanistan could tip the battle in favor of Taliban insurgents, who currently control nearly one-third of the Afghan population. The Taliban also control more territory than at any time since the U.S. invasion in 2001. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats similarly testified that “the overall situation in Afghanistan will very likely continue to deteriorate, even if international support is sustained.” The Afghan National Security Forces and government are supported by NATO and the U.S. with billions of dollars in assistance per year. The U.S. also has nearly 8400 troops in Afghanistan to support the Afghans in train, advise, and assist missions. Coats testimony painted a particularly bleak picture of Afghanistan saying the Afghan’s “performance will probably worsen due to a combination of Taliban operations, ANSF combat casualties, desertions, poor logistics support, and weak leadership. The ANSF will almost certainly remain heavily dependent on foreign military and financial support to sustain themselves and preclude their collapse.” Coats’ and Stewart’s stark assessment of the war come amid serious discussions within the Trump administration about increasing the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Proponents of the plan say the new troops will be used to embed advisors at lower unit levels with the Afghan National Security Forces to better enable them in the fight against the Taliban. President Donald Trump is expected to rule on the plan before a meeting with NATO heads of state on May 25. NATO Secretary General Jans Stoltenberg has also indicated the alliance may join the Trump administration in a troop increase, if that course of action is taken. The U.S. and NATO proposal also includes changing the U.S. military’s rules of engagement while supporting ANSF. The goal is to curb the Taliban’s battlefield gains and push them into entering a peace process with the Afghan government.

Right, but also wrong. Certainly, they can be invaluable intel-gathering tools for those early on in their careers. But why on this earth would you think you’re “too old” to book a similar session in year five, 12, or 15 of your career? Often, people think this because they’re uncomfortable with the idea of asking for help once they’re supposed to be “seasoned professionals.” And so, they just chalk up their lack of initiative to age. Or poo-poo the idea as being overrated or useless. That’s not only dumb, but it could also lead to an important opportunity missed. Here’s why: 1. Informational Interviews May Lead to “Insider Scoop” Have you ever read a job description and then gone in for an interview, only to discover that the needs of the organization overall were way different than what you read online? This is a fairly common occurrence in the world of staffing and recruitment. They aren’t always “up-to-the-minute” because they could be age-old relics that the company dishes up over and over every time the position opens up. A conversation with someone on the inside—especially someone who knows how that department runs and what the hiring manager’s challenges are—may arm you with data that your competition simply will not have. This data could be mighty useful as you figure out how to approach and prepare for your interview. 2. Informational Interviews May Lead to an “Inside Connection” Even though the entire purpose of this conversation is to gather information (thus, the reason why they are not called “strong-arm-someone-at-my-dream-company-to-put-in-a-good-word-for-me” interviews), you could end up developing rapport with someone of influence at that company. This rapport, in the best of circumstances, could lead to a valuable introduction to the hiring manager or some other vital insider that could positively influence whether you land an interview, or not. Don’t get me wrong, you should never enter this type of meeting with the sole intention or hope of scoring such an introduction. But it’s certainly possible. It’s not possible if you rely 100% on an online application sent through a blind mailbox. If you conduct your entire job search in this passive manner, you’re missing out on an incredible opportunity to become a person in the overall equation, rather than a commodity. 3. Informational Interviews May Make You Change Your Mind This is especially relevant for anyone considering a career pivot. How much do you know about that job or industry that you’re thinking would be a great next career move? Not much? Well then, book a few informational interviews with people head-first in that sector. You may discover that you’re even more interested than ever after these conversations. Or, you might realize that things aren’t as rosy as you’d envisioned, and you’ll dodge the bullet before you get too invested in the move. 4. Informational Interviews Can Show Fearlessness and Proactivity Think about the professionals you admire the most. Are they timid order takers? Um, probably not. I can think of more than a handful of people who I consider the gold standard in the working world, and among the traits that earn them a spot on my short list, are fearlessness and proactivity. Nothing will stand in their way to explore what interests them, gather information, introduce themselves to thought leaders, and make a freaking mark. Don’t get me wrong. They’re not annoyingly relentless and ambush-like in their approach. Instead, they approach with genuine interest and curiosity. You’re competing with these people, and you’re going to be evaluated from your very first introduction point. That said, if your first introduction point hints to the person on the receiving end that you’re fearless in the best of ways? You could be off to a great start. (And, at the very least, you could collect some information that’ll help you move forward more quickly than the rest of the schlemps who are sitting around thinking they’re too old for informational interviews.) Now that I’ve convinced you that you’re never too old, here’s how you can reach out in a way that won’t make you feel like you just graduated yesterday: Hi Tom, In doing some research on XYZ Company, I noticed that you recently led the organization’s (most impressive) rebranding effort. I’m a marketing leader with specific experience with brand development and management. May I ask you just a couple of quick questions about your work at XYZ, and how you created such an impact in a relatively short amount of time? Thank you for your time, Courtney In this example, the person shows genuine, specific interest in the other person’s work and accomplishments (thoughtful flattery will get you everywhere). She then asks if she may get just a bit of information, thus making it an easy “yes.” Now, assuming that initial interaction goes well, the requester will then have an opportunity to build a bit of rapport and (perhaps) ask the person out for a quick coffee to discuss things further. Done. Labels can harm. “Too old,” “Too junior,” “Too newbie,” or “Too 15 years ago” are great ways to rationalize not reaching out to influential people at companies of interest. They’re great excuses that’ll enable you to avoid learning more about industries that you may want to transition into. And they’re great in that they’ll make life easy for you in the short-term. But, if informational interviews may help you accelerate your career transition or land something you may have never even known about had you not proactively reached out to the key players? Why on this earth are you avoiding them? Your competitors—whether they are 27 or 47—are meeting influencers through informational interviews. Don’t you think it might be smart for you to book some, too?

Legislators approved providing another $10 million in state income tax credits for “angel’’ investors who put money into qualified small businesses. They also revamped a fund designed to provide grants to “microenterprises.’’ Separately, they gave final approval to restoring lifetime eligibility for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to two years, the way it was before Gov. Doug Ducey signed legislation trimming that by half two years ago. But the measure includes some conditions on getting that second year of cash assistance, provisions Democrats said are designed to trip up recipients. But the big action Wednesday was the decision to provide even more financial incentives for manufacturers, some of whom already get special property tax treatment and a few of whom may be paying no state corporate income taxes at all. Senate President Steve Yarbrough did not dispute that existing laws and what is in SB 1416, approved by the Senate on a 21-6 and the House by a vote of 32-21, will minimize what some companies pay not only to the state but also in local property taxes that support the city and school districts. But he said that has to be weighed against the promise by Intel it will be investing more than $7 billion to refurbish and finally occupy a now-vacant chip-manufacturing facility it built years ago in Chandler, his home town. And that, he said, will create new revenue streams. “You’re missing all of those people who have jobs at Intel who make six-figure salaries, who pay income tax, who pay property taxes on their home, who pay sales taxes at all the places they buy stuff,’’ he said. But House Minority Leader Rebecca Rios said the record in Arizona disproves theory that tax breaks for business will grow the economy. She cited a recent report that various tax exemptions and credits total $14 billion, more than the $9.8 billion state budget. But Rios pointed out that the current state budget is essentially equal to what it was a decade ago, “with more than half a million more people in Arizona.’’ “Where’s all this revenue that’s flooding into the state?’’ she asked. “We have no proof that tax credits like this one actually working,’’ added Sen. Martin Quezada, D-Glendale. Rep. Pamela Powers Hannley, D-Tucson, took particular issue with provisions of the bill that extend special tax credits to firms to reimburse them for the cost of doing research and development. She said the state is forgoing millions of dollars of taxes. But Powers Hannley said that’s not the worst of it. “This bill also gives away millions of dollars in research royalties into the future, with no end date,’’ she said, research that was financed by taxpayers in the first place. “Giving away all the intellectual property rights is a huge potential loss of future revenues,’’ Powers Hannley continued. “When the voters fund research or fund anything, the voters should get a return on their investment.’’ She said the benefit to the state amounts to “trickle-down economics.’’ But not all the Democrats were opposed. “Not only will SB 1416 create thousands of high-paying jobs to thousands of Arizonans, but will catapult economic development in the right direction,’’ said Rep. Cessar Chavez, D-Phoenix. He said graduates from the state’s three universities are “fleeing’’ because there are not enough jobs available. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard, reflecting a philosophical difference between the parties, took particular issue with Rios’ contention the state is giving away tax breaks. “Not taxing something is not the same thing as giving it away,’’ he said. “ ‘Giving it away’ suggests we own it.’’ The money, he said, belongs to the taxpayers. “They own it and then we force it from them, yes, to provide services for various things,’’ Mesnard said. “But there’s a very important distinction.’’ The provisions in SB 1416 come on top of the special tax treatment that certain large corporations already get. There are those R & D tax credits, which can be equal to 24 percent of what a company spends. Arizona also has created “foreign trade zones,’’ where the property tax on businesses is just a fraction of what it is on firms whose facilities are located elsewhere. And multistate corporations are allowed to compute what they owe in Arizona corporate income taxes based entirely on what percentage of the products they make are sold in the state. That potentially reduces the liability to manufacturers whose products are made here and shipped elsewhere. That break is even more significant for firms like Intel, whose computer chips are sold to other firms nationally and worldwide, and Raytheon which has little Arizona audience for its missiles. SB 1416 makes three major changes in existing laws. It would extend and expand tax credits manufacturers already get for creating new jobs. That credit is currently set to expire at the end of June. Another provision extends the tax credits available for expenses on research and development. And it would create an accelerated depreciation schedule for any equipment purchased by manufacturers. That break relates to the fact that Arizona law imposes property taxes not only on land and buildings but also any business equipment, from major presses to computers and desks. The value of that equipment is based on the purchase price, a figure that is adjusted annually for depreciation. This legislation allows businesses to write off half the value in the first year alone, a move that provides an immediate break on what already is a reduced property tax rate. That will particularly help companies that are currently in the market for major new equipment, like Intel. Gov. Doug Ducey has generally been favorable to new business tax breaks. But he’s also getting something in the legislation he did not want. Rep. Jill Norgaard, R-Phoenix, slipped in language which says that the sale of partial ownership shares of corporate jets is not subject to the state sales tax. Ducey vetoed a bill with only that language earlier this year because of the revenue implications. But he will have to accept it if he wants the rest of what’s in SB 1416 because he lacks the constitutional power to excise provisions of new laws he does not like. There was no immediate response from his office to what Norgaard had done. Sign in to favorite this Contact Us Receive News e-alerts More like this story Gov.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print GOP REBUFFS CALL FOR SPECIAL PROSECUTOR – Burr defends Comey amid Trump criticism – ROSENSTEIN INVITED TO BRIEF SENATORS – Brown convicted of corruption 05/12/17 08:12 AM EDT By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope) With an assist from Burgess Everett and Daniel Lippman Story Continued Below A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS? Senate Republicans continue to reject Democrats’ demands for an independent prosecutor to investigate Russian meddling in the election, even after the abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey this week. Democrats had hoped enough Republicans would finally break their way given that President Donald Trump dismissed Comey in the middle of an active investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. But most GOP senators say agreeing to an independent investigation would only hamper the House and Senate probes that are already underway. “It’s a familiar dance between Donald Trump and the congressional GOP: Trump does something widely seen as a brazen violation of political norms. Even as some Republicans call him out, most defend Trump’s actions or decline to take action directly challenging his administration," Seung Min and Burgess report. Most Republicans are unmoved, even after this week’s events: Comey was fired just days after asking for more resources for the Russia investigation; the White House and Trump have offered multiple contradictory explanations for Comey’s dismissal; the president told NBC’s Lester Holt Thursday he openly asked Comey whether he was under investigation; and the New York Times reported Trump demanded (and didn’t receive) a promise of loyalty from Comey during a private dinner in January. So far, only Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) have called for an independent probe — but they did so five months ago. And even they don’t support a special prosecutor but rather a select committee. “Asked about the dearth of Republican support for that idea, Graham said: ‘You’ve got me and John.’” End your work week with Seung Min and Burgess: http://politi.co/2qc3jXO On the House side, Michigan Rep. Justin Amash became the second Republican Thursday to sign onto a Democratic bill calling for an independent commission, BuzzFeed reports. But Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) shut down the idea again during a stop at a manufacturing plant in Racine, Wis., on Thursday. “He told reporters that the investigation involves ‘deeply classified’ intelligence collection and should not be turned over to independent investigators,” the Wisconsin State Journal reports. MARK YOUR CALENDARS: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has invited Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to the Capitol next week for an all-senators briefing on Comey’s firing. “Rosenstein has been meeting with members and has made himself available to the leadership as well,” McConnell spokesman David Popp told Huddle. “Once we have more information we’ll be sure to make an announcement.” The potential all-senators briefing (DOJ still won't say if Rosenstein has accepted) comes after Senate Intelligence leaders abruptly interrupted a hearing with acting FBI Director David McCabe Thursday for a meeting with the deputy AG. Senate Intel Chairman Richard Burr told reporters afterwards that Comey did not come up during the confab, CNN reports. Also possible next week: Senate Intel leaders have invited Comey to testify in a closed-door briefing Tuesday. As of Thursday, Comey had not responded. BURR DEFENDS COMEY — Burr offered a forceful defense of Comey yesterday, deeming him “ethical, upright, straightforward” after Trump blasted the former FBI director in a TV interview as a “showboat” and a “grandstander.” McCabe also rebuffed the White House Thursday, saying despite the administration’s claims otherwise, Comey had and still has “broad support” within the FBI. McCabe also told senators the Russia investigation was “highly significant.” Austin and Martin Matishak with more: http://politi.co/2qckh8e ANOTHER FRIDAY, WHICH MEANS ANOTHER WEEKEND ON THE HORIZON. Welcome to May 12 and thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. Today and Saturday are expected to be rainy ones here in D.C. but Sunday is looking hopeful with a little sun and mid-70’s temps. See y’all Monday. THURSDAY’S MOST CLICKED: The story about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejecting call’s for a special prosecutor in the Russia probe, written by Burgess, Austin and Seung Min, won the day. TWEET DU JOUR: @jmartNYT: New name making the rounds tonight as potential FBI director: @JohnCornyn ! Former Tex AG & Sup Court, easily confirmable But, as the Texas Tribune’s Abby Livingston reports, Cornyn demurred when asked about the possibility earlier this week. SHELBY ENDORSES STRANGE — Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, who fought off a primary himself in 2016, said in an interview he’s backing his new Alabama GOP colleague Sen. Luther Strange in his contest primary later this year. “I’m for him. He’s a friend. I’m helping him raise money,” Shelby said. “He and I have hunted together for 30 years.” But, Shelby added somewhat ominously: “He has to win his race.” Former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore has announced he is taking on Strange and the GOP establishment is getting Strange’s back. DON’T @ ME SIR — Sen. Richard Blumenthal doesn’t really want to talk about President Donald Trump’s frequent Twitter attacks on him. After taking the Senate floor to further discuss the saga of Trump firing Comey, the oft-chatty Blumenthal chose his words carefully. “This issue is not about me. It’s about the integrity of our justice system.” Asked why Trump singles him out, Blumenthal shrugged and declined to comment further as he boarded an elevator. WHO’S IN CHARGE HERE? The White House is butting heads with House Republicans’ campaign arm over who gets to run the show when it comes to the 2018 midterms, Jonathan Martin reports for the New York Times. The tension spilled out into public after NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers told the Times the White House had ignored his petition to appoint House Democrats in GOP-leaning districts to posts in the administration with hopes that Republicans could then flip those districts. “After reading the Times article, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, complained angrily to associates that Mr. Stivers was not treating the White House with respect and should not have publicly shared his request …Officials close to Mr. Priebus also called one of the top aides to Speaker Paul D. Ryan to vent about Mr. Stivers’s statements.” J-Mart with more: http://nyti.ms/2qcKPWT WEEKEND READING: How Democrats take back the House — Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos did what no other Democrat was able to do in 2016: She handily held onto her seat in a Trump-won district, winning in a 20-point landslide. While 11 other Democrats are sitting in Trump seats, nobody else won with a Bustos margin (save for Rep. Ron Kind, who ran unopposed). Democrats think Bustos’ type of playbook could be key to winning back the Rust Belt working class and securing the House majority along the way— but that all depends on if they can execute it the right way. Michael Kruse traveled to her district shortly before Trump’s inauguration and again around 100 days into the president’s term. His report: http://politi.co/2qcMbRL HMM, WHERE HAVE I HEARD THIS BEFORE? Senate Republicans might be on the cusp of a potential breakthrough in their quest to repeal Obamacare by agreeing to peg tax credits in the House plan to income and making them more generous for the needy. But the idea, which sounds similar to the Obamacare subsidies the GOP has railed against for years, will be a tough sell for House conservatives, Jen Haberkorn reports. More: http://politi.co/2qcxs92 BROWN CONVICTED IN CORRUPTION CASE — Former Rep. Corrine Brown was found guilty on Thursday of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from a charity that was supposed to be giving scholarships to needy students. “She was convicted of 18 of the 22 charges against her, including lying on her taxes and on her congressional financial disclosure forms,” the AP reports from Jacksonville. Brown's former chief of staff Ronnie Simmons and the charity's president, Carla Wiley, had both previously pleaded guilty to related charges and testified against Brown.

Chaka Fattah (D-Pa.), Rod Blagojevich (D-Ill.) and William Jefferson (D-La.). Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and former Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) are currently under indictment. KEEPING TRACK OF THE HOUSE SPECIALS, via our friends at Morning Score — Vice President Mike Pence will be in Montana with Republican Greg Gianforte today, the appearance coming after Gianforte rallied with Donald Trump Jr. again Thursday. Bernie Sanders will be in the state next weekend, he announced in an email to Our Revolution. And Paul Ryan has a GOTV rally coming up with Karen Handel in GA-06 on May 15.

It can be expected that many Skylake-X/Kaby Lake-X motherboards will be on display at the show. And then later on likely an Intel launch later in June. The teaser screenshot doesn't show much other then a number of M.2 SSD slots the unit is utilizing, three of them. Well, that enad LEDs of course.  It will use the upcoming LGA 2066 socket, gets MSI's own Audio Boost VI technology and MSI will reportedly be implementing a 6-pin PCIe power connector above the first PCIe x16 slot to assist multi-GPU configurations.     X299 will be the platform for four core Kaby Lake-X CPUs rather or later on mega-core Skylake-X processors.  Why release both Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X at the same time and what is the difference? Simple, Skylake-X can offer 10, 8 and 6 core processors, the other  (Kaby lake-X) remains to be a quad-core part. Skylake-X are the extreme edition like the 6950X series currently on Skylake-X. The i7 7740K is a quad-core, eight-thread CPU with a 4.2GHz base clockspeed and a 4.5GHz Turbo. Kaby Lake-X specs: Core i7 7740K Core i7 7700K Core i5 7640K Core i5 7600K Architecture Kaby Lake-X Kaby Lake Kaby Lake-X Kaby Lake CPU cores 4 4 4 4 Threads 8 8 4 4 Base clockspeed 4.2GHz 4.2GHz 4GHz 3.8GHz Turbo 4.5GHz 4.5GHz >4GHz 4.2GHz Cache 8MB L3 8MB L3 6MB L3 6MB L3 Integrated graphics No Yes No Yes TDP 112W 91W 112W 91W Socket LGA 2066 LGA 1151 LGA 2066 LGA 1151 Chipset KBL PCH-X KBL PCH-H KBL PCH-X KBL PCH-H Memory support Dual channel DDR4 Dual channel DDR4 Dual channel DDR4 Dual channel DDR4 The X299 chipset will be compatible with Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X Intel Core X series processors. Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X, will include 12, 10, 8, 6 and 4 core products.   Kaby Lake Broadwell-E Kaby Lake-X Skylake-X CPU cores 4 6, 8, 10 4 6, 8, 10, 12 Cache 8MB Up to 25MB 8MB 13.75MB PCIe support PCIe 3.0 (16 lanes) PCIe 3.0 (40/28 lanes) PCIe 3.0 (16 lanes) PCIe 3.0 (44/28 lanes) Integrated graphics Yes No No No TDP 95W 140W 112W 140W Socket LGA 1151 LGA 2011-v3 LGA 2066 LGA 2066 Chipset KBL PCH-H X99 KBL PCH-X KBL PCH-X Memory support Dual-channel DDR4 Quad-channel DDR4 Dual-channel DDR4 Quad-channel DDR4   The X299 will bring quad-channel DDR4 support to compatible 14nm processors and 40 PCIe 3.0 lanes with Skylake-X procs. Kaby Lake-X procs will support dual-channel DDR4 and 24 PCIe 3.0 Lanes. Before you ask, why release both Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X at the same time and what is the difference? Well, Skylake-X thus can offer 12, 10, 8 and 6 core processors, the other (Kaby lake-X) remains to be a quad-core part. Skylake-X are the extreme edition like the 6950X series currently on Skylake-X. These processors will get a 140 Watt TDP, the quad-core Kaby Lake-X is rumored to be a 112 Watt part. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

So the new 7740K will be compatible with the new X299 platform, have the exact same specs as a 7700K without a iGPU. Not even the the quad channel memory will be supported ot the 7740K.... Looks like a stupid upgrade if you go X299 with a 7740K. You will just pay more for the same or even less.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech Reviews / Corsair One Pro (USA version) Corsair One Pro (USA version) Leo Waldock 23 hours ago Featured Tech Reviews, Gaming PC, PC, Reviews Rating: 9.0. Corsair One started life as a concept for a new case and evolved into a fully built gaming PC. We have previously seen the Corsair Bulldog barebones but Corsair One is different as it is a fully functioning Windows 10 PC that requires no assembly. The aluminium tower is considerably smaller than you might expect and only stands 380mm high, which means you should have little difficulty finding room for it near your TV or stood on your desk. Inside you’ll find an Intel Core i7 and Nvidia graphics which each have their own liquid cooling set-up. Watch the video via our VIMEO Channel (Below) or over on YouTube at 2160p HERE Specification: (UK model) CPU Intel Core i7-7700K Quad-Core Processor CPU cooler Corsair liquid cooler GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 DRAM 16GB DDR4-2400MHz Storage 480GB SSD, 1TB HDD Motherboard Z270 Mini-ITX Networking Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11ac Power Supply 400W SFX 80 Plus Gold External Connections 1x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type C 3x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type A 2x USB 2.0 Type A PS/2 Port 1x HDMI 2.0 2x DisplayPort S/PDIF Operating System Windows 10 Home Edition Dimensions 200mm x 176mm x 380mm Weight 7.2kg Warranty Two years There are three versions of Corsair One. The basic model is called Corsair One and uses a Core i7-7700 with GTX 1070 graphics and a 240GB SSD with 1TB HDD. The more powerful option is the Corsair One Pro with an unlocked Core i7-7700K, GTX 1080 graphics, 480GB SSD and a 2TB HDD. Our review sample is the US Corsair One Pro that increases the SSD capacity to 960GB and does away with the HDD. We are told this super One Pro will be launched outside the USA when Corsair is able to supply sufficient components. In practical terms this means the UK Corsair One Pro is very similar to the USA Corsair One Pro, however they are not absolutely identical. As you will see in our video the design of the Corsair One Pro is imaginative with a Mini-ITX MSI motherboard that stands vertically. The CPU is on one side of the PC and the graphics card is on the other side. The CPU and GPU each have a dedicated liquid cooler that employs a radiator that looks similar to the Corsair H100i but which is markedly slimmer. The neat touch about Corsair One Pro is the way the cooling system doesn’t mount fans on the radiators in the usual way but instead uses a Corsair ML140 fan at the top of the chassis. Cool air is drawn in through the ventilated side panels of the chassis, across the two radiators and upwards to the exhaust fan where it is expelled at the top of the case. In our video we didn’t dwell on the absence of air filtration, which was an oversight. Adding filters would be sensible but as they are not installed you will simply have to accept that every once in a while you will be getting busy with the vacuum cleaner. It’s not ideal and we hope that Corsair will tweak this aspect of the design in time. Other aspects of the design, such as the lack of RGB lighting may seem like an oversight but we disagree. The case lighting is single colour Cyan and you can use Corsair Link to adjust brightness or set the light to Static, Breathing, Flashing or Off. That seems perfectly sufficient to add some visual interest without driving you crazy when a club light show is running next to your TV. Testing We used Corsair One Pro to play games at 4K and while it managed the task it struggled at high image quality settings. Drop the resolution to 1440p or 1080p and it will haul along but be aware that 4K is a stern test, even for Core i7 and GTX 1080. Cooling Performance. We were impressed by the low temperatures for both CPU and GPU but note that at least one other reviewer suffered from a toasty CPU. The only explanation we can offer is that Intel clearly has problems with the thermal interface on certain CPUs while we appear to have struck lucky with the CPU in our particular example of Corsair One Pro. Acoustics performance. If you listen carefully you can hear the two cooling pumps but they simply are not an issue. Similarly the single 140mm fan is very quiet indeed. If you place the Corsair One Pro on your desk close to hand you will surely hear it working. If you site it next to your TV it is effectively silent. Closing Thoughts. The Corsair One Pro uses an exciting new design and is considerably better than we first expected. The use of dual cooling systems for CPU and GPU is very clever and the way that Corsair has packed so much hardware in such a small case is impressive. For example the SFX power supply is much smaller than an ATX unit but comes straight out of Corsair’s catalogue. It is a neat balancing act where they use regular desktop components in an unusual configuration that keeps everything tidy and compact without the need to develop bespoke hardware, apart from those Asetek radiators. This is a clever approach that works superbly well, although it effectively precludes the possibility of upgrading your hardware over time. Corsair One Pro is not a sealed unit like the Mac Pro but requires an enthusiast to work inside the casing and we doubt many people will want to take the risk.

Adam SchiffAdam SchiffRyan declines comment on Trump’s warning to Comey Trump's warning to Comey deepens White House crisis Top Intel Dem demands release of Trump's 'tapes' on Comey MORE (D-Calif.) says that “nobody buys” President Trump’s explanation for firing former FBI Director James Comey. Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Thursday on CNN’s "OutFront" that "there's no mystery" that "Democrats have a big problem with what Comey did and how he handled the [Hillary] Clinton investigation." “Had the president agreed with those criticisms during the campaign, that would have been one thing,” Schiff said of Democrats' criticism about the former FBI chief's handling of the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server while serving as secretary of State. “But for a president who applauded the director’s actions at the time, now months later and months further into this investigation into Russia, an investigation that the director was pursuing, to use that as the justification – nobody buys it.” ADVERTISEMENT Trump on Thursday undercut statements from White House officials about the circumstances of Comey's firing. Vice President Pence and senior White House officials had initially said Tuesday that Trump had fired Comey on the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff SessionsJeff SessionsDeputy AG sees no need for special prosecutor on Russia: report Robert Gates on Comey: Trump should have had his 'ducks in a row' Dem on Comey firing: ‘I’ve got real concerns about a coverup’ MORE and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein. The Trump administration circulated Rosenstein's assessment that "the FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage" under Comey since last year. The document criticized Comey's handling of the FBI's probe into the private email server Clinton used before becoming the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee. But Trump broke from that narrative during a Thursday interview, arguing he had made up his mind without Justice Department input. “I was going to fire regardless of the recommendation,” he told NBC News’s Lester Holt. Deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders insisted later that the White House’s account of the events surrounding Comey’s ouster was “consistent.” Comey’s ouster came amid the FBI’s probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential race, including possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign. “It would be one thing if this was credible, it was done at a different time,” Schiff said of Trump's decision to fire Comey. “But plainly this is being used, or at least it was up until today, as a dodge ...

The makers of the cars are working to teach them to better adapt to human tendencies and local traffic customs, like the “California Stop” and the “Pittsburgh Left.” THE ASSOCIATED PRESS A self-driving Uber car stops at a red light on Liberty Avenue in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Sept. 14. Experts say teaching autonomous vehicles the habits of human drivers will take years but eventually, they will coexist on roadways. DETROIT (AP) — In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15 mph — just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn’t dare cross a double-yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there’s the “California Stop,” where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the “Pittsburgh Left,” where it’s customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Michigan, drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left turn onto a freeway. “There’s an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules,” said Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school’s autonomous car research. Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That’s because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment. “Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don’t understand social graces,” said Missy Cummings, director of Duke University’s Humans and Autonomy Lab. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing’s giant traffic jams. In India’s capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they’re equipped with automatic emergency braking. “It’s hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology,” said John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota’s autonomous car unit. Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter said. Programmers are optimistic that someday the cars will be able to handle even Beijing’s traffic. But the cost could be high, and it might be a decade or more before Chinese regulators deem self-driving cars reliable enough for widespread public use, said John Zeng of LMC Automotive Consulting. Intel’s Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That’s equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle, Zeng said. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday, autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the “Pittsburgh Left” by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out if a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually, there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes. Still, some skeptics say computerized cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. “You’ll never be able to make up a person’s ability to perceive what’s the right move at the time, I don’t think,” said New Jersey State Police Sgt. Ed Long, who works in the traffic and public safety office. Copyright 2017 Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Sen. Dianne FeinsteinDianne FeinsteinDeputy AG sees no need for special prosecutor on Russia: report Feinstein calls for deputy AG to name special prosecutor or resign Key Senate Democrat wants hearings on Comey firing MORE (D-Calif.) said in a statement that she supports "Senator Durbin’s call for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to resign if he is unwilling to appoint a special counsel. These investigations are far too important to risk disruption, delay or interference." Feinstein's comments were part of a larger statement calling for the Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on President Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey. Feinstein is the ranking Democrat on the committee. ADVERTISEMENT Democrats have doubled down on their push for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to name a special prosecutor in the wake of Comey's firing this week. But Sen. Dick DurbinDick DurbinDeputy AG sees no need for special prosecutor on Russia: report Feinstein calls for deputy AG to name special prosecutor or resign Deputy attorney general to brief Senate next week after Comey firing MORE (Ill.), the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, went further earlier Friday in calling on Rosenstein to either name a special prosecutor or resign "to preserve his reputation as a credible prosecutor." Rosenstein is increasingly under a spotlight for his role in Comey's firing. Rosenstein wrote the memo this week that the White House initially used as its public rationale for Comey's firing. But Trump told NBC News that he would have fired Comey "regardless" of the DOJ's recommendation. Feinstein and Durbin's statements come less than a month after senators voted 94-6 to make Rosenstein the No. 2 DOJ official. Both Feinstein and Durbin supported his nomination. Democrats pressed Rosenstein during his committee hearing to weigh in on their push for a special prosecutor to look into Russia's election interference. But Rosenstein sidestepped, noting that he didn't have the underlying facts. "I'm simply not in a position to answer that," he said in response to a question from Feinstein.  Tags Dianne Feinstein Dick Durbin   View the discussion thread.

Get a cup of coffee. This article is a big geeky at points by virtue of using a lot of acronyms. But be patient! It contains important information about the restructuring of the US workforce. By William Lazonick, professor of economics at University of Massachusetts Lowell. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website How the U.S. New Economy Business Model has devalued science & engineering PhDs This note comments on Eric Weinstein’s, “How and Why Government, Universities, and Industries Create Domestic Labor Shortages of Scientists and High-Tech Workers,” posted recently on INET’s website. At the outset of his paper, Weinstein argues that: Long term labor shortages do not happen naturally in market economies. That is not to say that they don’t exist. They are created when employers or government agencies tamper with the natural functioning of the wage mechanism. The contention, written from the perspective of the late 1990s, is that in the first half of the 1990s an oversupply (“a glut”) of science and engineering (S&E) labor that depressed the wages of PhD scientists and engineers was primarily the result of the promotion of a government-university-industry (GUI) agenda, coordinated by the National Science Foundation under the leadership of Erich Bloch, head of the NSF from 1984 to 1990. Beginning in 1985, the NSF predicted a shortfall of 675,000 S&E personnel in the U.S. economy over the next two decades. According to a study by the NSF’s Policy Research and Analysis (PRA) division, quoted by Weinstein, salary data show that real PhD-level pay began to rise after 1982, moving from $52,000 to $64,000 in 1987 (measured in 1984 dollars). One set of salary projections show that real pay will reach $75,000 in 1996 and approach $100,000 shortly beyond the year 2000. Weinstein argues that the GUI agenda (inspired by Reaganomics) sought to prevent these salary increases. He contends that the legislation that enabled this oversupply was the Immigration Act of 1990 that expanded the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program and instituted employment-based immigration preferences. Given that most of these foreigners came from lower-wage (Asian) nations, it is assumed that they were attracted to work in the United States by what for them were high wages, whereas Americans with S&E PhDs began to shun S&E careers as the salaries became less attractive.1 There is a lot missing from Weinstein’s perspective, which is also the perspective of demographer Michael Teitelbaum, who Weinstein cites extensively and who was at the Sloan Foundation from 1983 to 2013, rising to Vice-President in 2006. Weinstein and Teitelbaum view the salaries of scientists and engineers as being determined by supply and demand on the labor market (“the natural wage rate” and “the natural functioning of the labor market”). From this (neoclassical) perspective, they completely ignore the “marketization” of employment relations for S&E workers that occurred in the U.S. business sector from the mid-1980s as well as the concomitant “financialization” of the U.S. business corporation that remains, in my view, the most damaging economic problem facing the United States. This transformation of employment relations put out of work large numbers of PhD scientists and engineers who previously had secure employment and who enjoyed high incomes and benefits as well as creative corporate careers. The marketization of employment relations brought to an end of the norm of a career with  one  company  (CWOC)—an  employment norm  that was  pervasive  in  U.S.  business corporations from the 1950s to the 1980s, but that has since disappeared. 2 The “financialization” of the corporation, manifested by massive distributions to shareholders in the forms of cash dividends and stock buybacks, undermined the opportunities for business-sector S&E careers. The major cause of marketization was the rise of the “New Economy business model” (NEBM) in which high-tech startups, primarily in information-and-communication technology (ICT) and biotechnology, lured S&E personnel away from established companies, which offered CWOC under the “Old Economy business model” (OEBM). As startups with uncertain futures, the New Economy companies could not realistically offer CWOC, but instead enticed S&E personnel away from CWOC at Old Economy companies by offering these employees stock options on top of their salaries (which were typically lower than those at the Old Economy companies). The stock options could become extremely valuable if and when the startup did an initial public offering (IPO) or a merger-and-acquisition (M&A) deal with an established  publicly-listed company. The rise in S&E PhD salaries from 1982 to 1987, identified in the NSF study that Weinstein quotes, was the result of increased demand for S&E personnel by New Economy companies, with some of the increase taking the form of stock-based pay, which in the Census data drawn from tax returns is lumped in with salaries.3 Competing with companies for S&E personnel, the rise of the NEBM in turn put pressure on salaries at Old Economy companies as they tried to use CWOC to attract and retain S&E labor in the face of the stock-based alternative. By the last half of the 1980s, this New Economy competition for talent was eroding the learning capabilities of the corporate research labs that, in many cases from the early twentieth century, had been a characteristic feature of Old Economy companies in a wide range of knowledge-intensive industries. 4 The CWOC norm under OEBM had provided employment security and rising wages from years-of-service with the company and internal promotion of S&E personnel (significant proportions of whom in science- based companies had PhDs). As I show in my book Sustainable Prosperity in the New Economy?, the beginning of the end of CWOC was the transformation of IBM, the world’s leading computer company, from OEBM to NEBM from 1990 to 1994. In 1990, with 374,000 employees, IBM still bragged about its adherence to the CWOC norm (calling it “lifelong employment”), claiming that the company had not laid off anyone involuntarily since 1921. By 1994 IBM had 220,000 employees, and, with senior executives under CEO Louis Gerstner themselves getting fired for not laying off employees fast enough, CWOC was history. Over the course of the 1990s and into the 2000s, other major Old Economy companies followed IBM’s example, throwing out of work older employees, many of them highly educated and with accumulated experience that had previously been highly valued by the companies. Already in the early 1990s, the marketization of employment relations was responsible for a precipitous decline of employment at the corporate research labs that had underpinned the twentieth-century growth of Old Economy high-tech companies, of which IBM was an exemplar. In 1993, a conference held at Harvard Business School decried the “end of an era” in industrial research, with papers from the conference appearing in a volume Engines of Innovation, published in 1996.5 In the introductory chapter, entitled “Technology’s Vanishing Wellspring,” conference organizers and volume editors Richard Rosenbloom and William Spencer argued that industrial research (as distinct from product development) of the type that had been carried out by corporate labs in the “golden era” of the post- World War II decades “expands the base of knowledge on which existing industries depend and generates new knowledge that leads to new technologies and the birth of new industries.” In the more competitive environment of the 1980s and 1990s, however, in the new industries of “biotechnology, exotic materials, and information products (and services based on them)”, Rosenbloom and Spencer observed that it was more difficult for companies “to keep new technologies fully proprietary”, and hence “research activities have been downsized, redirected, and restructured in recent years within most of the firms that once were among the largest sponsors of industrial research.” 6 There is little doubt that S&E PhDs were major victims of this transformation. But the problem that they, along with most other members of the U.S. labor force, have faced is not simply the marketization of employment relations. For reasons that I have fully described in my publications cited above, the transition from OEBM to NEBM was accompanied by the “financialization” of the U.S. business corporation as, from the last half of the 1980s, U.S. boardrooms and business schools embraced the ideology that, for the sake of superior economic performance, a business enterprise should be run to “maximize shareholder value” (MSV). Instead of retaining employees and reinvesting in their productive capabilities, as had been the case when CWOC had prevailed, MSV advocated and legitimized the downsizing of the company’s labor force and the distribution of corporate revenues to shareholders in the forms of both cash dividends and stock repurchases. 7 With the demise of CWOC, older employees were the most vulnerable, not only because they tended to have the highest salaries, but also because the shift from OEBM to NEBM was a shift from proprietary technology systems, in which employees with long years of experience were highly valued, to open technology systems that favored younger workers with the latest computer-related skills (often acquired by working at other companies). Under CWOC, older employees were more expensive not because of a “natural wage rate” that was the result of supply and demand on the S&E labor market, but because of the internal job ladders that are integral to a “retain-and-reinvest” resource-allocation regime. The salaries of S&E employees tended to increase with years of experience with the company, with a defined-benefit pension (based on years of service and highest salary levels) in retirement. These types of secure employment relations, and the high and rising pay levels associated with them, were the norm among established high-tech companies in the mid-1980s, but, as exemplified by IBM’s transformation, started to become undone in the early 1990s, and were virtually extinct a decade later, as Old Economy companies either made the transition to the NEBM, or disappeared.8 The culprit in the weakening in the demand for, and earnings of, S&E PhDs from the early 1990s was the demise of CWOC—a phenomenon that Weinstein (and Teitelbaum) entirely ignore. With the rise of NEBM, companies wanted employees who were younger and cheaper, and that was the major reason why at the end of the 1980s the ICT industry pushed for an expansion of H-1B nonimmigrant visas and employment-based immigration visas. It is not at all clear that an influx of PhDs from foreign countries via these programs was undermining the earnings of S&E PhDs in the early 1990s. Most H-1B visa holders had Bachelor’s degrees when they entered the United States. At the same time, large numbers of non-immigrant visa holders entered the United States on student visas to do Master’s and PhD degrees, and then looked to employment on H-1B visas to enable them to stay in the United States for extended periods (up to seven years).9 It was in response to the availability of advanced- degree graduates of U.S. universities that in 2005 an additional 20,000 H-1B visas were added to the normal cap of 65,000. Without the influx of foreign students into U.S. S&E Master’s and PhD programs, many of these programs would not have survived. Through this route, the H-1B visa program has made more foreign-born PhDs available to corporations for employment in the United States. But I posit that it has been the demise of OEBM and rise of the NEBM, not an increased supply of foreign-born PhDs, that has placed downward pressure on the career earnings of the most highly educated members of the U.S. labor force. Besides giving employers access to an expanded supply of younger and cheaper high-tech labor in the United States, the H-1B visa along with the L-1 visa for people who had previously worked for the employer for at least one year outside the United States have another valuable attribute for employers: the person on the visa is immobile on the labor market—he or she can’t change jobs—whereas under NEBM the most valued high-tech workers are those who are highly mobile. This mobility of labor can boost the worker’s pay package but is highly problematic for a company that needs these employees to be engaged in the collective and cumulative learning processes that are the essence of generating competitive products. Under OEBM, CWOC was the central employment institution for college-educated workers precisely because of the need for collective and cumulative learning. But it was the rise of NEBM, not the Immigration Act of 1990, that undermined CWOC. The growing dominance of NEBM with its open systems architectures then led employers to make increased use of H-1 and L-1 visas in the 1980s, prompting them to get behind an expanded cap for H-1B visas in the Immigration Act of 1990. 10 Once OEBM was attacked by NEBM, with its offer of stock-based pay, these corporations became fertile territory for the adoption of the ideology that a company should be run to “maximize shareholder value” (MSV). This momentous transformation in U.S. corporate governance occurred from the late 1980s, legitimizing the transition from a “retain-and-reinvest” to a “downsize-and-distribute” corporate- governance regime. In the 1990s and beyond, this corporate-governance transformation laid waste to CWOC across corporate America, knowledge-intensive companies included. 11 With corporate research eroding as high-tech personnel responded to the lure of stock-based pay from NEBM companies— including not only startups but also those such as Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, and Cisco Systems that during the 1990s grew to employ tens of thousands of people, most of them with stock- based pay—senior executives at the Old Economy high-tech companies began to see their company’s stock price as not only key to the size of their own stock-based pay packages but also as an instrument to compete for a broad-based of high-tech personnel. As exemplified by IBM in the 1990s and beyond, a company’s stock price could be raised by laying off expensive older workers and using the resultant “free” cash flow (as the purveyors of MSV called it) to do stock buybacks. 12 As I have documented in detail, over the past three decades this legalized looting of the U.S. business corporation has only gotten worse. As shown Table 1, driven by stock buybacks, net equity issues by U.S. nonfinancial corporations were, in 2015 dollars, minus $4.5 trillion over the decade 2006-2015. In 2016 net equity issues were minus $586 billion. Net equity issues are new stock issues by companies (in this case nonfinancial corporations) minus stock retired from the market as the result of stock repurchases and M&A deals. The massively negative numbers in recent decades are the result of stock buybacks. I have calculated net equity issues as a percent of GDP by decade to provide a measure of the value of buybacks done relative to the size of the U.S. economy. In both absolute inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percent of GDP, buybacks have become a prime mode of corporate resource allocation in the U.S. economy. Contrary to popular belief, in aggregate U.S. corporations fund the stock market, not vice versa. Note that almost all of the buybacks in the decade 1976-1985 occurred in 1984 and 1985 after in November 1982 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted Rule 10b-18 that gave license to massive buybacks, in essence legalizing systemic stock-price manipulation and the looting of the U.S. business corporation. Table 1: Net equity issues of nonfinancial corporations in the United States, 1946-2015, by decade, in 2015 dollars, and as a percent of GDP Decade Net Equity Issues, 2015$ billions Net Equity Issues as % of GDP 1946-1955 143.2 0.56 1956-1965 110.9 0.30 1966-1975 316.0 0.58 1976-1985 -290.9 -0.40 1986-1995 -1,002.5 -1.00 1996-2005 -1,524.4 -1.09 2006-2015 -4,466.6 -2.65 Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Statistical Release Z.1, “Financial Accounts of the United States: Flow of Funds, Balance Sheets, and Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts,” Table F-223: Corporate Equities, March 9, 2017, at    https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/. Over the years 2006-2015, the 459 companies in the S&P 500 Index in January 2016 that were publicly listed over the ten-year period expended $3.9 trillion on stock buybacks, representing 53.6 percent of net income, plus another 36.7 percent of net income on dividends. Much of the remaining 9.7 percent of profits was held abroad, sheltered from U.S. taxes. Mean buybacks for these 459 companies ranged from $291 million in 2009, when the stock markets had collapsed, to $1,205 million in 2007, when the stock market peaked before the Great Financial Crisis. In 2015, with the stock market booming, mean buybacks for these companies were $1,173 million. Meanwhile, dividends declined moderately in 2009, but over the period 2006-2015 they trended up in real terms. Among the largest repurchasers are America’s premier high-tech companies. Table 2 shows the top 25 repurchasers over the decade 2006-2015. Among the companies that one would expect to employ large numbers of S&E PhDs are Exxon Mobil, Microsoft, IBM, Apple, Cisco Systems, Hewlett Packard, Pfizer, Oracle, Intel, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips. We do not know the historical numbers of S&E PhDs at these companies, but I hypothesize that numbers would be much higher than they are if the companies were not financialized. Many of America’s largest corporations routinely distribute more than 100 percent of net income to shareholders, generating the extra cash by reducing cash reserves, selling off assets, taking on debt, or laying off employees.13 As I have shown, the only logical explanation for this buyback activity is that the stock-based pay that represents the vast majority of the remuneration of senior corporate executives incentivizes them to manipulate their companies’ stock prices, leaving most Americans worse off. 14 Table 2: The 25 largest stock repurchasers among U.S.-based corporations, 2006-2015, showing net income (NI) stock buybacks (BB), and cash dividends (DV) Source: Calculated from data downloaded from Standard & Poor’s Compustat database. The Weinstein-Teitelbaum focus on a GUI design to expand the supply of S&E PhDs ignores the transformations of corporate governance and employment relations that have decimated career employment for this group of workers over the past three decades. At the same time, the channeling of trillions of dollars of value created in U.S. nonfinancial corporations to the financial sector has opened up jobs on Wall Street that can provide quick income bonanzas for highly-educated members of the U.S. labor force, many of whom might have otherwise pursued S&E careers. Among the wealthiest of these Wall Street players are corporate predators—euphemistically known as “hedge-fund activists”—who have billions of dollars in assets under management with which they can attack companies to pump up their stock prices through the implementation of “downsize-and-distribute” allocation regimes and, even if it takes a few years, dump the stock for huge gains.15 In the case of Apple, we have shown how Carl Icahn used his wealth, visibility, hype, and influence to take $2 billion in stock-market gains by buying $3.6 billion of Apple shares in the summer of 2013 and selling them in the winter of 2016, even though he contributed absolutely nothing of any kind to Apple as a value-creating company.16 Apple CEO Tim Cook and his board (which includes former U.S. Vice President Al Gore) helped Icahn turn his accumulated fortune into an even bigger one by having Apple repurchase $45 billion in shares in 2014 and $36 billion in 2015—by far the two largest one-year stock buybacks of any company in history. Imagine the corporate research capabilities in which Apple could have invested, and the S&E PhDs the company could have employed, had it looked for productive ways to use even a fraction of the almost unimaginable sums that it wasted on buybacks.17 From 2011 through the first quarter of 2017, Apple spent $144 billion on buybacks and $51 billion on dividends under what it calls its “Capital Return” program. But the company is “returning” capital to shareholders who never gave the company anything in the first place; the only time in its history that Apple has ever raised funds on the public stock market was $97 million in its 1980 IPO. 18 A number of “hedge-fund activists”—Nelson Peltz of Trian, Daniel Loeb of Third Point, and William Ackman of Pershing Square are among the most prominent—have been able to put up one or two billion dollars to purchase small stakes in major high-tech companies, and, with the proxy votes of pension funds, mutual funds and endowments, have been able put pressure on companies, often by placing their representatives on the boards of directors, to implement “downsize-and-distribute” regimes for the sake of “maximizing shareholder value.”19 In the summer of 2013, Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management bought DuPont stock worth $1.3 billion, representing 2.2% of shares outstanding. In May 2015 Peltz lost a proxy fight to put four of his nominees on the DuPont board, but in October 2015 DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman, who had opposed Peltz, resigned, and the new management began to implement Peltz’s plans to cut costs and hit financial targets, to be done in the context of a merger with Dow Chemical, which had fallen into the hands of another corporate predator Daniel Loeb. Meanwhile, in October 2015, Peltz bought 0.8 percent of the shares of General Electric (GE), and began to pressure another iconic high-tech company to cut costs and increase its stock price. GE was already a financialized company that had done $52 billion in buybacks in the decade 2006-2015 (see Table 2)—a massive amount of money for the purpose of manipulating its stock price. Undoubtedly responding to additional pressure from Peltz, during 2016, GE, with profits of $8.0 billion, paid out $8.5 billion in dividends and spent another $22.0 billion on buybacks. This financialization of U.S. high-tech corporations undermines, among other things, the employment of S&E PhDs. We need research on this subject to quantify its impacts. I submit, however, that such a research agenda must focus on transformations of regimes of corporate governance and employment relations. Relying on the neoclassical economist’s notion of a “natural wage rate” determined by the interaction of supply and demand, Weinstein, a mathematician, and Teitelbaum, a demographer, missed the transformations in corporate governance and employment relations that marked the late 1980s and early 1990s—and beyond—and as result, in my view, failed to understand the changing fortunes of S&E PhDs in the marketized, globalized, and financialized New Economy. Given the dominance of what I have called “the myth of the market economy”20 in the thought processes of economists, Weinstein and Teitelbaum were by no means alone in erroneously focusing on supply and demand on the PhD labor market while failing to recognize the centrality of corporate governance and employment relations in determining the earnings and career prospects of S&E PhDs. It is time for new economic thinking on these critical questions.

Reply ↓ David McClain May 12, 2017 at 10:10 am As one who actually lived this process, I can tell you that the premise of this article must be basically true. Back in the early ’90s I set out to fill in the gaps of my own computer science background (I’m actually an astrophysicist). And my classes were filled entirely by people from Asia, except for myself and one other Anglo. Job ads in the journals were already beginning to ask for PhD level CompSci with emphasis on, e.g., voice recognition, for a pay rate of $26K (1992 !). That was definitely appealing to the foreign students and unappealing to American STEM students. During that period, the only job market for native PhD STEM students became the American Defense and Intelligence agencies, because they required security clearances and US Citizenship. I found myself driven in those directions too. Now, after many years doing my own thing, I look around at the STEM marketplace and I am shocked to find large numbers of compatriots being pressured into the GIG Economy, and pay rates are appalling by former standards. There is a serious lack of expenditure on research and development today. Reply ↓ tony May 12, 2017 at 10:44 am There is a serious lack of expenditure on research and development today. From another perspective this is just over investment in education. Technology for the most part is just increasing complexity and increasing complexity has diminishing returns. With energy becoming less available, we probably need a lot less complexity. Reply ↓ anonymous in Southfield May 12, 2017 at 6:15 pm I was reading the article earlier at work and thought I would finish reading the comments With energy becoming less available, we probably need a lot less complexity. Relevant in many ways. Take intensive horticultural methods which could increase yields on agricultural products. Organic gardening (a garden is anything smaller than a field (about 40 acres)) can yield up tremendous amounts per square yard because the soil is tilled intensively and carefully. The organic content of the soil in commercial farming districts is very low as the methods used (particularly intensive nitrogen implants) destroy the Soil microorganisms thereby lessening the amount of nutrients available to vegetative methods in the roots. So by taking the technology level down (small equipment and lots of loving labor, lots of mulching a careful cohabitation of plants) the yields per acre can be in fact astronomical with organic methods.

Reply ↓ Ranger Rick May 12, 2017 at 1:14 pm I wouldn’t say that there is a lack of R&D — it just isn’t done in-house any more. Gone are the Bell Labs and the Xerox PARCs; welcome to the brave new world of university partnerships and non-profit R&D shops (most famous: the Southwest Research Institute). Reply ↓ Altandmain May 12, 2017 at 10:21 am Basically the rich are waging class war. That’s the problem no matter how you slice and dice this one. This whole “New Economy” has been one big war on wages. I mean look at the collusion too between Google, Apple, and Intel to keep wages low. https://www.wired.com/2015/01/apple-google-tech-giants-reach-415m-settlement-poaching-suit/ Considering how slap on the wrist this was, what incentive is there to not do it again? They know they can get away with this. Not to mention, this H1B and L1B program has become a way to keep wages low in the technology sector. In many sectors, there really isn’t a “shortage” of Americans. Oh and for all the talk of these companies being “innovative”, if they are prioritizing money on stock buybacks over R&D, that’s not really innovative as much as it is trying to boost salaries by capitalizing on the huge cash reserves they get for being the dominant companies in their sector. Same could be said about Exxon. Not much being spent on R&D means that they are more about rent seeking rather than innovation. Perhaps not yet as blatant as those patent trolls, which are little more than shell companies that sue other companies over patents, but that is their ideal business model. I think that at the end of the day, even though many engineers in the tech companies are in the top 10% in terms of income percentile, their interests are closer aligned with working class people. The other issue is that I bet when many of these engineers turn into their 40s, they are going to witness first hand the very real age discrimination that exists in the technology industry. Basically it comes down to, the rich are really greedy. The issue right now for the rich is that they are desperate to keep the looting from happening, while people are increasingly aware that the system is against them. Bernie Sanders got a lot of support in the Valley and while it is a very Democratic leaning area, I cannot imagine that Trump’s anti-H1B and L1B stance would have been opposed by the average employee. I think that the rich are not going to concede anything and that there needs to be some sort of solidarity union amongst all workers.

I’ll go first: three investment banks under my belt and one was a giant fnancial and moral sucking machine called Citi. The other two were wannabe’s but certainly did not add value. Reply ↓ Sluggeaux May 12, 2017 at 11:12 am While “maximizing shareholder value” is the huge problem wrecking our economy, having watched the genesis of New Economic Paradigm through the experiences my wife and most of my friends going through the Silicon Valley start-up Tulip-mania from the mid-’80’s through the first decade of th e 2000’s, the author is hitting important points while over-simplifying and missing other equally important points, such as the role of the “Peace Dividend” in the collapse of aerospace and research funding, and the role of the Reagan and Clinton “tax reforms” in driving stock-based compensation systems. Early on, the use of stock-based compensation drove down wage-based compensation and increased the role of financial speculators. Today, the speculators get the stock, but wages remain suppressed and only foreign workers will accept them. The author is correct: the causes are complicated, but the result drove down wages and job security for STEM workers. Reply ↓ mary May 12, 2017 at 11:30 am I got my Ph.D. in biology in 2000. It was absolutely the worst decision in my life. In fact, it actually destroyed my life, reducing me to near homelessness and starvation because—GASP—-regular employers (like office jobs, retail etc.) will not hire Ph.D.s. There there is the lovely student debt that has grown exponentially, as my wages could not make the smallest dent. Convicted felons make more that I do. So to make a long story short, I started a small on-line business 9 years ago and got the FFFFF OUT of the rotten POS United States and moved to Ecuador, one of the most progressive countries in the world.

The world is just changing too fast now to really be able to advise our children on what careers to take. Besides, one of the advantages of studying engineering as you can work anywhere in the world. I bought houses for each of my children and told them if they wanted to go to college they could trade the house in for the education.

Reply ↓ cr May 12, 2017 at 12:01 pm Post WWII labor overplayed its hand by the 1970’s. Corporations and their decided they had had it. Corps and management proceeded to change the rules of the game on everything–courts, trade, taxation and regulation. These countermeasures have had disastrous long term consequences. Corporations now run the country in a fascist manner. Government capture has created myriad problems beyond financialization, only one tool in the corporate quiver. Oligopolies across most to all industries comes to mind. Rail, air, health insurance, banking, defense, telecom, entertainment…. But this paper is also lamenting a lack of business capex, which is directly correlated to public investment. When you decided to offshore manufacturing and fail to invest in infrastructure you get a double whammy that hits business capex. Increasing regulation and taxation on small and midsize companies has lead to consolidation. Approximately 5000 public companies have likely been consolidated. Sarbanes-Oxley added millions to compliance costs making it highly uneconomical to be a public company with less than $300 million in revenue. Dodd-Frank has created increases in cost for financial firms that had nothing to do with the crisis. In fact, the big banks have benefited enormously from implementation of this legislation. Reply ↓ Vatch May 12, 2017 at 12:20 pm For anyone else who was confused by the terminology, as I was briefly, capex = capital expenditure. Reply ↓ Altandmain May 12, 2017 at 1:13 pm Not sure about the labor part overplaying their hand. They just wanted an even wage and productivity rise. It is capital IMO that has overplayed its hand and the rise of neoliberal economics which has led to declines in public R&D spending. There isn’t anything like the Space Race anymore. Reply ↓ tony May 12, 2017 at 3:20 pm Frankly, labour underplayed its hand. At one point it had capital by the throat, and should have finished it off then. If peace is not an option, you should utterly and permanently destroy your enemy. Reply ↓ Sluggeaux May 12, 2017 at 4:53 pm Labor did NOT overplay its hand after WW2 — Taft-Hartley was a HUGE smack-down to labor after the privations of the Depression followed by the war effort. The decent wages during the post-war period were part of a concerted effort to convince workers that they didn’t need unions and to be complacent. Labor leadership certainly became corrupt from all the money sloshing around without global competition due to war devastation of Europe and Japan, the Cold War, and the death throes of colonialism, but this was not due to “overplaying” their hand. Reply ↓ allan May 12, 2017 at 12:15 pm Reply to cr@May 12, 2017 at 12:01 pm Sarbanes-Oxley … Dodd-Frank … The trends described in the post predate by decades the communist tyranny [/s] imposed by those bills. The wholesale closing or offshoring of corporate research labs already started in the 1980s, driven in part by corporate raiders like Milken, Pickens and Icahn. IBM, GM, Kodak, Xerox, GE … they all had labs that provided jobs to STEM graduates and a stream of discoveries and inventions to generate more jobs. Now these are largely gone or substantially off-shored. What has happened to corporate R&D shouldn’t be used as an excuse to make life easier for the Wall Street culture largely responsible for it. Reply ↓ Vatch May 12, 2017 at 12:22 pm Yes, any burdens imposed by Sarbanes Oxley are the fault of numerous unethical business executives over recent decades, and not the fault of people in government. Reply ↓ visitor May 12, 2017 at 3:02 pm When I was a student in IT, the shining stars at the firmament of industrial computer science and engineering R&D were Xerox PARC, DEC SRC, ATT Bell Labs and IBM Yorktown Heights. They are gone or a shadow of their former selves. Reply ↓ Science Officer Smirnoff May 12, 2017 at 12:36 pm Contrary to popular belief, in aggregate U.S. corporations fund the stock market, not vice versa. Note that almost all of the buybacks in the decade 1976-1985 occurred in 1984 and 1985 after in November 1982 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted Rule 10b-18 that gave license to massive buybacks, in essence legalizing systemic stock-price manipulation and the looting of the U.S. business corporation. William Lazonick, “Stock Buybacks: From Retain-and-Reinvest to Downsize-and-Distribute,” Center for Effective Public Management, Brookings Institution, April 2015 at http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2015/04/17-stock-buybacks-lazonick. See Lazonick’s footnoted paper for many loving particulars. Especially note the details of how Rule 10b-18 offers no protection from abuse and (no news to NC readers) is a pillar of general corporate asset-stripping.

Tremendous article! Reply ↓ Socal Rhino May 12, 2017 at 12:59 pm Engineering long-term career arc has been an issue since at least my father’s generation (those born during WWI). Longer tenure (mid to late mid career) engineers were being eased out for young grads. When I was in a ChemE program in the 70s, advice was to follow the engineering degree with either law or a business degree because the odds of a long career doing engineering was not great. No one advised going for a PhD in engineering. Reply ↓ Arizona Slim May 12, 2017 at 2:19 pm My father had a PhD in chemical engineering. When I asked him why he got the degree, which didn’t seem necessary for someone who spent much of his career in industrial R&D, he said, “I’m like Mallory climbing Mount Everest. I got that degree because it is there.” So, there you have it. My old man getting that degree because he wanted to. And because my mother was willing to support both of them while he worked on it. Reply ↓ shinola May 12, 2017 at 1:02 pm To me, this is the money quote (literally): “Many of America’s largest corporations routinely distribute more than 100 percent of net income to shareholders, generating the extra cash by reducing cash reserves, selling off assets, taking on debt, or laying off employees … the only logical explanation for this buyback activity is that the stock-based pay that represents the vast majority of the remuneration of senior corporate executives incentivizes them to manipulate their companies’ stock prices…” This not only applies to the STEM sector, but nearly every large corp. in America. “Earnings quality” (i.e stock price) takes precedence over everything else leading to the crapification of products & services and devaluation of employees. Thank gawd this type of thinking wasn’t around when Jonas Salk was working on the polio vaccine. Reply ↓ nowhere May 12, 2017 at 2:30 pm Which begs the question: what discoveries are we missing out on now because of this short sighted approach? Reply ↓ LT May 12, 2017 at 8:51 pm There’s probably not a discovery to be made that this economic system couldn’t turn to crap. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood May 12, 2017 at 1:27 pm “In November 1982 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted Rule 10b-18 that gave license to massive buybacks, in essence legalizing systemic stock-price manipulation and the looting of the U.S. business corporation.” How can you have “looting” without lootees? The stockholders aren’t complaining. If any party is being disadvantaged by borrowing to fund stock buybacks, it’s existing bondholders. As David Swensen describes in an extended example in Pioneering Portfolio Management, managers compensated by stock options tend to treat corporate debt holders quite shabbily by piling on more debt, compromising the interest coverage ratio. High tech companies use stock buybacks to offset their widespread granting of stock options which — absent Rule 10b-18 — would badly dilute existing stock holders over time. Trying to paint the well-disclosed practice of stock buybacks as “looting” is histrionic ax grinding on Lazonick’s part. Over-leveraged companies are going to regret it in the next recession. But that’s a lamentable social phenomenon in a bubble-driven economy. Those who disagree with it are free to sell short over-leveraged stocks — perhaps a more meaningful way of expressing dissent than scribbling academic screeds. Reply ↓ Science Officer Smirnoff May 12, 2017 at 1:41 pm And political dissenters are free to emigrate. Reply ↓ fritter May 12, 2017 at 2:22 pm Well Jim, ponzi schemes work pretty well for those at the top. I suppose we shouldn’t worry about it until we start getting complaints.. Actually though, watching the train wreck that is the outlook for the youngest generation today, provides some grim amusement. For instance noting that the “bubble-driven” economy composed of companies desperate to prevent their stock becoming “badly diluted” by having fire sales on capitol and expertise that probably took their predecessors decades to build can really only have one outcome. Depression, misery, socialism. Maybe we skip the Mao route this time, maybe not. Reply ↓ Alejandro May 12, 2017 at 2:38 pm Here’s some related “histrionics” of your channeling D.D…. an excerpt of a debate about “creative destruction” (emphasis mine) from 1991(context), chronologically, roughly following the tandem of Ronnie and Maggie. Gregory Peck: “The Robber Barons of old at least left something tangible in their wake — a coal mine, a railroad, banks. THIS MAN LEAVES NOTHING. HE CREATES NOTHING. HE BUILDS NOTHING. HE RUNS NOTHING. And in his wake lies nothing but a blizzard of paper to cover the pain. Oh, if he said, “I know how to run your business better than you,” that would be something worth talking about. But he’s not saying that. He’s saying, “I’m going to kill you because at this particular moment in time, you’re worth more dead than alive.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJRhrow3Jws Danny Devito: “Let’s have the intelligence, let’s have the decency to sign the death certificate, collect the insurance, and invest in something with a future…”Ah, but we can’t,” goes the prayer. “We can’t because we have responsibility, a responsibility to our employees, to our community. What will happen to them?” I got two words for that: WHO CARES? Care about them? Why? They didn’t care about you. They sucked you dry. You have no responsibility to them. For the last ten years this company bled your money. Did this community ever say, “We know times are tough. We’ll lower taxes, reduce water and sewer.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62kxPyNZF3Q Reply ↓ oho May 12, 2017 at 1:29 pm IBM. Poster child of everything wrong at the executive-level and the shareholder-level. Reply ↓ David Barrera May 12, 2017 at 2:09 pm Oho, Yes, the IBM reference is interesting.The author gives an ordinal lead to IBM as a mover from the OEBM to NEBM. I ask myself if, from a mere one large corporation managing perspective, this was IBM’s 11th hour response to the by then devastating rise of its competitors like Apple & Microsoft. Also the irony that it did not help IBM at least in the midterm. So, IBM was the prime mover to initiate some aspects of a model change -change which every major player adhered to- in response to a new technological disadvantage vs. competitors, and in turned did not seem to do much for IBM in the immediate years. Although, if I recall well, IBM was immersed in many political battles and internal problems, legal and otherwise. Nevertheless, I doubt there was a historic inevitability on IBM’s ordinal force. Outstanding work by Lazonick Reply ↓ Trout Creek May 12, 2017 at 3:23 pm Let me quote a noted tech analyst on IBM : “IBM is the poster child for shenanigans. Last month, IBM reported its 20th quarter in a row of declining year over year revenues….. a 13% drop in earnings, profit margins that declined in every business segment ( much worse than expected ), free cash flow that plummeted over 50% year over year and an earnings “beat” of 3 cents per share. How could this “beat” happen? ….. a negative tax rate of -23%…. This is why they pay the CEO Rometti the big bucks ( estimated at $50 to $65 million last year).” And this is one of the Bluest of the Blue Chip companies in the world. Reply ↓ Sue May 12, 2017 at 6:12 pm I read IBM spent a fortune at that time defending itself against monopolistic claims litigation. This was happening while Microsoft and Apple were clearly consolidating their oligopolistic empires. I read reports stating Oracle initial breakthroughs were taken from IBM’s research work.

You’re a potential pure play. It’s not about how much you earn, it’s about what you’re worth. And who’s worth the most? Companies that lose money. Pinterest, Snap chat… No revenue. Amazon has lost money every fucking quarter for the last 20 fucking years, and that Bezos motherfucker is the king. Reply ↓ Wisdom Seeker May 12, 2017 at 5:50 pm Just wanted to point out that there is one more link in the chain to be followed: the financiers would not have such an easy time playing Nero with our economy, if the banking sector were still properly constrained by a gold standard (=limited supply of printed credit), the risk of bank runs by outraged consumers, the Glass-Steagall separation of commercial from investment banking, personal rather than corporate punishment for fraud and abuse, antitrust enforcement, etc. In addition, the rise of 401(k) based investing, in which workers are tax-incentivized to buy in to the corporate stock scheming, but lack the normal shareholder voice in corporate governance, has taken the chains off the looters as well. It’s time to end the impunity. The government has been corrupted by the corporations, so only a populist uprising will produce reform. The uprising will require sacrifices of time, income, security. It will require boycotts of products that people like, but whose producers and vendors are evil. The products will not disappear while demand persists – but the producers and vendors must be brought to heel. Consider the following inductees into the Corporate Hall of Shame: Wells Fargo – customer abuse United Airlines – customer abuse UBER – employee abuse; legal system abuse Mylan (Epi Pens) – Monopolistic price abuse Hewlett Packard (spyware on laptops) – customer abuse … pick an industry, you’ll find a Hall of Shame candidate. Hit them all in the wallet until they reform.

Add A Comment For those that haven't yet switched over to the newly-stable Mesa 17.1 series, last quarter's Mesa 17.0 series was just updated with the v17.0.6 point release. As usual for Mesa point releases, this bi-weekly point update is mostly about delivering stable bug fixes. But there is also some new back-ported material with Mesa 17.0.6 such as the basic changes needed for Polaris 12 support in the RADV driver, which should allow the Radeon RX 550 to work with this open-source Vulkan driver. Mesa 17.0.6 has core fixes, the Gallivm LLVM code has seen a fix for Big Endian architectures, various RadeonSI and Intel driver fixes, an EGL fix, and more.

That reinforces a more-cautious view of the market offered by PC chip-maker Intel. By Tiernan Ray Updated May 12, 2017 7:05 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large HP EliteBook 725 notebook computer for business. Illustration: HP Inc. Cowen & Co.’s Timothy Arcuri today reports that the trend for the personal computer market that he’s observing in shipments thus far is not good for Q2, and that Intel’s (INTC) own forecast for a 5% decline in total for this calendar year is looking more and more like the right assessment. Counting the reported shipments in April of original design manufacturers, or “ODMs,” such as Quanta, firms, primarily in Taiwan, that make the bulk of the world’s notebook computers, Arcuri writes that Q2’s results are looking very weak, even assuming some improvement in May and June: April was weak, but CQ2:17 ODM notebook production should be heavily back-end loaded w/ our field work pointing to a much stronger than seasonal May and June (by 500bps each). Even so, April was so weak that CQ2:17 ODM notebook production looks up 4% Q/Q (+5% Y/Y) – about 150bps below seasonal – following our extensive supply chain work. Given very strong correlation (85%) and R2 (73%) between ODM and global notebook shipments, we think notebooks/ultramobiles could decline 2% Q/ Q in CQ2 (+1% Y/Y) that is 100bps below our current estimate but in-line w/ 10-year seasonal. We note that for CQ2, ODM shipments have outgrown PC sell-in numbers (reported by Gartner) the last 7-years in a row; therefore, our expectation for a 2% Q/Q decline also makes sense in this context. Arcuri cut his outlook for the PC market this year from a 4% decline to a 5% shipment decline, which, he writes, "coincidentally is now in-line w/ INTC’s PC outlook and does imply seasonal growth for CQ3 and CQ4 (+6% Q/Q and +3% Q/Q, respectively)." Microsoft’s (MSFT) Windows 10 will help a little bit this year to juice purchases, he writes, but “beyond 2017, we do not assume any heroic expectations for the PC market as we expect units to decline low single digits through 2020."

Human drivers Associated Press • May 11, 2017 at 10:30 AM DETROIT — In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15 mph — just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn’t dare cross a double yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there’s the “California Stop,” where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the “Pittsburgh Left,” where it’s customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Michigan, drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left-turn onto a freeway. “There’s an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules,” said Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school’s autonomous car research. Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That’s because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment. “Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don’t understand social graces,” said Missy Cummings, director of Duke University’s Humans and Autonomy Lab. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing’s giant traffic jams. In India’s capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks, and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they’re equipped with automatic emergency braking. “It’s hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology,” says John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota’s autonomous car unit. Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter says. Programmers are optimistic that someday the cars will be able to handle even Beijing’s traffic. But the cost could be high, and it might be a decade or more before Chinese regulators deem self-driving cars reliable enough for widespread public use, said John Zeng of LMC Automotive Consulting. Intel’s Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1 ½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That’s equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle, Zeng said. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or to speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the “Pittsburgh Left” by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out if a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes. Still, some skeptics say computerized cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. “You’ll never be able to make up a person’s ability to perceive what’s the right move at the time, I don’t think,” said New Jersey State Police Sgt. Ed Long, who works in the traffic and public safety office. Recommended for You Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Quanta Reports Best Q1 sales since 2012 Due to Strong MacBook Pro sales, Considers Dropping Apple Watch | Main May 12, 2017 The FTC Responds to Qualcomm's Motion to dismiss their case about Monopoly Power, Samsung & Intel File Amicus Briefs   In January Patently Apple posted a report titled "The U.S. Fair Trade Commission Sues Qualcomm for Forcing Apple to use its Chips in iDevices." The report noted that the U.S. Fair Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm accusing the biggest maker of mobile phone chips of illegally maintaining a monopoly over semiconductors used in cellphones and pocketing elevated royalties from customers. Earlier today the FTC responded to Qualcomm's motion to dismiss the case.   The FTC argued that Qualcomm's customers "accept elevated patent royalties they otherwise would refuse" only because they are forced "to negotiate in the shadow of Qualcomm's threat to withhold chips." As a result, "Qualcomm collects far more in royalties than other licensors in the industry with comparable patent portfolios."   Amicus Brief: Samsung   C/NET's report noted that "It's also being reported that Samsung, Samsung, the world's biggest handset maker, hasn't filed any lawsuits against Qualcomm, but it did file an amicus brief in support of the FTC on Friday, saying the court shouldn't dismiss the antitrust suit. In it, the company noted that it's a Qualcomm customer (it uses Qualcomm's chips in devices like the Galaxy S8), and it's also a potential competitor (Samsung builds and sells chips).   'In both capacities, Samsung has directly experienced, and been directly harmed by, the exclusionary conduct alleged in the FTC's complaint,' it said in a court filing Friday. '"Qualcomm refuses to license its [standard essential patents] on fair, reasonable, and on-discriminatory ... terms so that Samsung can make and can sell licensed chipsets. Given its position, Samsung is uniquely situated to assist the court in understanding the important antitrust principles at stake in this case.'   Samsung said in its filing that Qualcomm agreed to fairly license its technology if standards bodies adopt tech that required the use of Qualcomm patents. But the South Korean company said Qualcomm hasn't kept its side of the bargain. Instead of licensing its standard essential patents to rival chipmakers, it only gives licenses to handset manufacturers.   'Because Qualcomm does not license [chipset] competitors, handset manufacturers have no choice but to accept Qualcomm's onerous terms,' Samsung said. 'Qualcomm directly excludes competitors and harms competition.'   Amicus Brief Intel   Intel, one of Qualcomm's main rivals in semiconductors, also filed an amicus brief on Friday. The company, which was late and has struggled in the mobile chip market, became a supplier of iPhone mobile chips in Apple's latest models, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.   'Although Qualcomm has driven nearly all of its competitors out of the premium LTE chipset market, Intel has not thrown in the towel,' Intel said in a court filing.   The company noted that Qualcomm's business dealings with Apple 'put Intel's commercial success at risk and will do so in the future if Qualcomm is allowed to persist in its anticompetitive tactics. As the only remaining competitor in the premium LTE chipset market ... any harm to Intel's premium chipset business will have profound anticompetitive effects on the market as a whole.'"   For more on this, you could also check out FOSS Patents report here.

Security experts say the attack that holds computer data for ransom grew out of vulnerabilities purportedly identified by the National Security Agency (NSA). Story continues below READ MORE: Beginner’s guide to protecting your information online The vulnerability (specifically a SMBv2 remote code execution in Microsoft Windows) was exposed by The ShadowBrokers, a mysterious group that has repeatedly published alleged NSA software code. Over 45,000 attacks in 70 countries were recorded by Russian security firm Kaspersky — with the most attacks occurring in Russia. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at the Helsinki-based cybersecurity company F-Secure, called it “the biggest ransomware outbreak in history.” Geographical target distribution of the WannaCry ransomware attack for the first few hours of the attack on May 12, 2017, according to Kapersky security firm.

A spokesperson said over 1,000 computers were affected in the attack. Closer to home, FedEx confirmed to Forbes that the U.S. company was a victim of the attack. There is a fix for the vulnerability — but since many people or companies don’t regularly install updates, or use older versions of Windows, they remain susceptible to the attack. WATCH: UK PM May says no evidence patient data compromised in ‘ransomware’ attack How does it work? WannaCry is a form of “ransomware” that locks up the files on your computer and encrypts them in a way that you cannot access them anymore. Usually your files are held until money is paid to the hackers. How does it spread? Ransomware is a program that gets into your computer, either by clicking on or downloading the wrong thing, and then it holds something you need to ransom. In the case of WannaCry, the program encrypts your files and demands payment in bitcoin in order to regain access. READ MORE: Dozens of Canadian firms have paid ransoms to regain control of data, study finds Security experts warn there is no guarantee that access will be granted after payment. Some ransomware that encrypts files ups the stakes after a few days, demanding more money and threatening to delete files altogether. There are different variants of what happens: Other forms of ransomware execute programs that can lock your computer entirely, only showing a message to make payment in order to log in again. There are some that create pop-ups that are difficult or impossible to close, rendering the machine difficult or impossible to use. How to protect yourself Ransomware attacks were on the rise in 2016, and Canada was fourth on the list of countries most commonly hit by ransomware and social media scams in 2015, according to security firm Symantec. READ MORE: Ransomware on the rise in Canada: How to protect your data The best way to protect yourself from any sort of ransomware is to maintain up-to-date anti-virus or anti-malware software and ensure you are backing up your computer regularly to prevent losing any of your important files. Since ransomware can be spread by emails, users should be wary of any unsolicited emails or emails from addresses they may not know. A good way to know if the link provided in an email is legitimate is to check the URL by hovering your mouse over the link — if the email appears to be from a business (say, UPS, for example) and the URL is not the company’s official web address, then it’s likely a fraudulent email. — With files from Nicole Bogart, Reuters and the Associated Press © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

In an early-morning tweetstorm Friday, Trump suggested there might be recordings of his conversations with Comey that could be used to undercut anything the former director might tell the public. “James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” Trump tweeted.  The stunning pronouncement gave more ammunition to critics who say Trump fired Comey to thwart his bureau’s investigation into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.  Later Friday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly refused to say whether Trump secretly recorded his conversations with Comey — or has done so with any other White House visitors, including members of Congress and foreign dignitaries. “I’ve talked to the president. The president has nothing further to add on that," Spicer told reporters. Democrats quickly demanded that Trump turn over any tapes, if they exist. “For a president who baselessly accused his predecessor of illegally wiretapping him, that Mr. Trump would suggest that he, himself, may have engaged in such conduct is staggering,” said Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffRyan declines comment on Trump’s warning to Comey Trump's warning to Comey deepens White House crisis Top Intel Dem demands release of Trump's 'tapes' on Comey MORE (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. “The president should immediately provide any such recordings to Congress or admit, once again, to have made a deliberately misleading — and in this case threatening — statement,” he added. The remark deepened the sense of crisis surrounding the White House since Trump’s dismissal of Comey on Tuesday evening.  His suggestion that he taped conversations with Comey played right into the hands of critics who were already comparing his actions to that of President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. Nixon secretly monitored visitors at the White House complex and Camp David using an elaborate recording system, which was ultimately exposed in 1973 and helped lead to his downfall. No president is known to have used such a system since. Trump has also vented his frustration with media coverage focusing on the White House’s often-contradictory accounts of how and why he decided to fire the FBI director amid the active Russia investigation.  The president has rarely been seen at the White House this week, but in his first question-and-answer session about Comey’s firing, he contradicted accounts offered by his press team and Vice President Pence that he acted on the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.  Trump told NBC News on Thursday that the decision was his alone and he would have fired Comey “regardless of the recommendation” from Rosenstein.  The president also suggested that the Russia investigation had played a part in firing Comey, something his aides had vehemently denied.  “And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story,’ ” he said. “It’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won. ... This was an excuse for having lost an election.”  Those comments, plus another Friday tweet claiming his aides can’t be expected to convey his views with “perfect accuracy,” raised new questions about the credibility of his top spokespeople: Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Clearly frustrated, the president on Friday threatened to scrap the daily White House briefings for reporters.  Asked by host Jeanine Pirro if he’s moving too fast for his press team, Trump replied, “yes.” “We don’t have press conferences ... just don’t have them,” the president said. “Unless I have them every two weeks and I do them myself, we don’t have them. I think it’s a good idea.”  At the same time, he defended Spicer, whose job is said to be in jeopardy. “Well he’s doing a good job but he gets beat up.” “Again you know they don’t show the 90 questions that they asked and answered properly,” Trump continued. “I’m saying if they’re off just a little bit, just a little bit, it’s the big story.” Spicer and Sanders have been tasked with rebutting damaging leaks of Comey’s conversations with Trump, including reports that the president demanded the director’s personal loyalty during a late January dinner. This week’s events have made their task harder; Sanders conceded Wednesday that at least one discrepancy in the dueling accounts of Comey’s firing happened because she did not speak with the president. Trump’s shoot-from-the-hip style has served him well in the past, and especially during the 2016 campaign, when he was able to keep his foes on the defensive.   But Trump’s unpredictability has at time inflicted damage to his presidency, and is now putting him in dangerous legal waters. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a liberal ethics watchdog, on Friday called on the Justice Department to investigate whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey. “That tweet shows very, very poor judgment,” said Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush and CREW board vice chairman. “I don’t think he did anything illegal with the tweet. If he is trying to influence Comey’s possible testimony to Congress, however, then he could get into serious trouble.” Comey declined an invitation to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week, but leaders of the panel still hope to bring him in on another date. Lauren Ouziel, a Temple University law professor and former federal prosecutor, said not enough facts are known to determine whether obstruction occurred, but that Trump’s firing of Comey combined with his “threat” on Twitter should be enough to pique the interest of investigators. “There’s enough there that makes it worth looking into, based on what’s been publicly reported,” she said. “It raises a significant question as to whether obstruction took place.” Spicer on Friday insisted the tweet was “not a threat.” “He simply stated a fact. The tweet speaks for itself," he said. Ouziel said Trump’s conduct with regard to Comey “clearly amounts to an egregious flouting of the constitutional norms of the office of the presidency, and an abuse of the power of that office.” Comey hasn’t spoken publicly since his surprise firing Tuesday. But those who know him have told news outlets he’s confident any recording of the conversation would reflect well on him. “He hopes there are tapes,” one Comey confidant told NBC News. “That would be perfect.” Tags Adam Schiff   View the discussion thread.

After it appeared that President Trump was about to pull out of the Paris Agreement just ahead of a United Nations negotiating meeting this past week, the decision was abruptly postponed. Then, in a recent meeting of the eight nations of the Arctic Council, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated that the U.S. will now take its time to consider its approach to ensure that it is in line with U.S. interests: “We’re not going to rush to make a decision. We’re going to work to make the right decision for the United States.” Author Nathan Hultman Nonresident Senior Fellow - Global Economy and Development Twitter @natehultman A decision on Paris is now expected after the upcoming G-7 summit in Taormina, Italy, from May 26 to 27 where world leaders will likely present a united front in pressing for the U.S. to remain engaged. While the administration’s orientation toward international coordination on climate change has remained largely opaque, an approach that carefully considers the benefits to the U.S. would be a significant improvement over making this portentous decision simply based on a politically expedient campaign promise. As the White House mulls its decision, it should keep in mind how the world has evolved rapidly beyond problems that have plagued the economic, technological, and political approaches to climate policy in the past. Despite this, recent Trump administration statements have been erratic and have posited a number of outdated arguments that could easily be dated to the early George W. Bush administration or earlier. Just as today’s global climate toolkit has transformed, the domestic opportunities and logic of the current international approach should also change. If the White House does in fact intend to consider carefully its options, it should consider six shifts that have occurred over the past 20 years: America’s clean energy revolution makes new U.S. targets achievable. We are in a completely different energy market now compared to 20, 10, and even 5 years ago. Developments in the American energy technology portfolio have been rapid and surprising, as deployment and innovation has accelerated. Levels of clean energy deployment that would have been thought borderline infeasible 20 years ago are now not only in reach but can now be cost-competitive with, and in many situations cheaper than, fossil energy sources. And these trends will continue. Clean energy technologies like PV and LED light bulbs, and to some degree wind, are mass-manufactured and like similar items (e.g., smartphones) tend to become cheaper and better over time. As deployment of such technologies has accelerated globally over recent years, in large part due to clean energy policies in the U.S., Germany, U.K., India, and China, the increased production volumes have helped drive down costs. With many countries planning further rapid clean energy deployment in the coming decade to address climate change, we can expect continued improvements in the costs of clean energy technology. There are two implications of this trend. First is achieving ambitious climate goals in the U.S. is feasible and cost effective, since these technologies in many cases do not come at a premium and also bring benefits for health and climate. There are two implications of this trend. First is achieving ambitious climate goals in the U.S. is feasible and cost effective, since these technologies in many cases do not come at a premium and also bring benefits for health and climate. Second, there are opportunities in technology and innovation for the American economy. In expanding technological options in rooftop solar, battery storage, and electric vehicles, Tesla is just one example of the kind of clean energy business that can both innovate and generate employment. Figure 1: Cost reductions in clean energy costs since 2008 Source: US DOE https://energy.gov/revolution-now Most businesses support the Paris Agreement. The American business community, across almost all sectors, is widely in favor of continued international engagement on climate. Unlike previous eras, businesses are not “polarized” or split roughly 50-50 for or against climate policy. Instead, a small number of narrow interests (e.g., the coal industry, which employs roughly only around 0.1 percent of U.S. workers) oppose engagement against a much broader swath of the economy who support a careful U.S. policy approach and an international approach coordinated under the Paris Agreement. To make this point, large groups of American and multinational companies have organized to send messages of support for engagement. One group of 1,000 large and small companies with a market capitalization of $3.4 trillion signed a “Business Backs Low Carbon USA” letter; other groups have sent letters of support directly to Trump or have taken out advertisements publicizing their support. The companies are a “who’s who” of businesses and include Apple Inc., DuPont, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Hilton, Hewlett Packard, Intel Corp., Johnson & Johnson, Facebook, Google, Microsoft Corp., Morgan Stanley, BP, General Mills Inc., Novartis, Rio Tinto PLC, Shell, Unilever, and Walmart, to name just a few. General Electric Co. CEO Jeff Immelt has repeatedly expressed his support. As an indication of the breadth of support, American oil companies Exxon Mobile and Conoco Phillips have also argued for engaging in the Paris process. Clean energy jobs are outpacing traditional fossil jobs. A close counterpart of business engagement and clean energy costs is the potential impact of climate engagement on jobs and the economy. Recent data from the U.S. Department of Energy give a sense of relative sizes of employment. These data indicate that 3 million jobs are linked to clean energy, which includes 475,000 jobs in solar and wind energy. These are also quickly growing categories, having enjoyed growth of 25 percent and 32 percent respectively from 2015 to 2016. In contrast, coal supports about 160,000 jobs including 52,000 in mining. Natural gas and oil industries employ about 915,000 people, bioenergy about 130,000, and nuclear about 76,000. The numbers are clear in demonstrating a large segment of the U.S. energy sector moving into cleaner technologies. A majority of Americans, majority of Democrats, and majority of Republicans support Paris. Polling has shown marked growth in support for international climate action over recent years. A recent poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs showed a relatively strong 71 percent support for staying in Paris, with 57 percent support even for Republicans. Another study by the Yale Program on Climate Communication and the George Mason Center for Climate Communication shows 69 percent support for participating in the Paris Agreement, with 51 percent of Republicans supporting. Perhaps even more surprisingly, that study also showed that even among conservative (i.e., non-moderate) Republicans, fully 34 percent support engagement via Paris against 40 percent opposed, with the rest undecided. The polling evidence demonstrates that, as with the business community, a large portion of the American public supports engagement in climate-smart policies, and specifically an international approach under Paris. Other polling has shown that public support becomes even stronger when the health benefits of cleaner energy (avoided deaths, fewer heart and asthma conditions, lost school and workdays, etc.) are included in the overall framing of options. With even many in the Republican Party looking for solutions, continued engagement offers more opportunities for constituents to have their voices reflected and recognized in advance of upcoming elections. The flexibility of the Paris Agreement favors U.S. interests in negotiations. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt recently stated that under the Paris Agreement, China and India had no obligations until 2030 even though they were polluting more. This assertion is simply untrue (and indeed earned a full “Four Pinocchios” from the Washington Post’s Fact Checker). The reason is that the Paris Agreement was designed with the express purpose of solving this particular problem—and by including all major polluters in a common framework, the Paris Agreement includes both China and India (as well as all other key emitters) who have both opted to set emissions targets that require substantial near-term action on their part. Pruitt mounted a criticism used commonly 20 years ago—and was typically applied to bash the Kyoto Protocol. In the interim, the world listened to the critique and acted to create an international agreement that addresses these concerns. Quite simply, it’s about as good a structure as we are ever going to get in that it encourages international action while respecting that overall policies will always be set at the national level. Specifically, the new international agreement struck in Paris was expressly designed with a robust, flexible structure based on the principle of national determination and global transparency. Quite simply, it’s about as good a structure as we are ever going to get in that it encourages international action while respecting that overall policies will always be set at the national level. It therefore does not (contrary to some fears reportedly in the Trump administration) bind the U.S. to an externally imposed plan, and it does in fact provide a framework in which all countries participate and set emissions goals on an equal footing—including China and India. As such, although Secretary of Energy Rick Perry recently called for a “renegotiation” of Paris, he and the rest of the Trump administration will likely discover that there is nothing more to be gained from renegotiating. Anything the U.S. would want to do regarding our approach to climate can be done within the context of Paris. Remaining part of that process gives us the best leverage to ensure that other countries are participating on terms that the U.S. believes provide the fairest playing field and the best chance for a positive climate outcome. Withdrawing from Paris would cause severe international fallout. The science of climate change is now well known and the implications of this science are both harrowing and widely understood in countries around the world. While countries have differing approaches to the near-term strategies to reduce emissions in their own economies, both major powers and smaller countries have become concerned about the impacts of climate change on their own populations and economies. The global initiative to negotiate the Paris Agreement, which required substantial effort from many countries (not least the U.S.), is a testament to this broad support for coordinated climate action. In this light, many countries view an American pullout from Paris as an aggressive action against their own populations. Many have expressed anger and dismay that the anti-climate actions of the U.S. would make such outcomes more likely. Whether or not Trump agrees, many countries will nevertheless interpret a U.S. pullout not as simply a domestic issue but as a deliberate, unnecessary, and hostile act against their own interests. This situation creates geopolitical consequences. When many countries weigh engagement with climate heavily, a U.S. withdrawal would squander a large amount of political capital in bilateral and multilateral relations for a fleeting and inconsequential domestic political benefit. World leaders have prioritized this issue and are not sitting still. For example, when Trump called to congratulate newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron, Macron immediately used the opportunity to press Trump to keep the U.S. in the Paris Agreement. The next day, Chinese President Xi Jinping also discussed the issue with Macron and agreed to, in his words, “defend” the Paris agreement. China in particular has a great interest in portraying itself as defending developing, vulnerable countries against climate change globally, which will also support its broader efforts to cultivate favor in a number of developing countries (for example, in Africa, Asia, and Latin America) with which it is seeking greater economic and political influence. Trump has been deploying 19th century technology and 20th century political arguments in the face of a 21st century problem. In addition to these six areas of change, there is of course one more development that is important: Trump is now president with the power to shape the U.S. federal regulatory environment and international engagement. So far, when it comes to climate change, Trump has been deploying 19th century technology and 20th century political arguments in the face of a 21st century problem. The good news is that the world has already fixed the critiques that Trump administration officials have levied at the Paris Agreement. The big developing countries are also taking steps to reduce their emissions, and U.S. engagement has given us political benefits internationally. In this context, withdrawing would be a Pyrrhic victory for Trump, producing a temporary talking point, temporarily increased support from a small group of political actors in the U.S., but creating tremendous international blowback and long-term damage to U.S. interests. Moreover, and most importantly, it would slow global efforts to address the issue and make riskier and more damaging climate outcomes—to both U.S. and global interests—more likely. The rational calculus for American interests is clear, but it remains the president’s decision.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Pair of Intel patents pitch new ways to find a… Pair of Intel patents pitch new ways to find a lost phone, keep messages private By Adam Ismail — May 12, 2017 9:08 am Subscribe Share Tom Grundy/Shutterstock Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you We've all lost our phones with the ringer conveniently switched off, but Intel's patent looks to solve that problem once and for all. As far as mobile technology has come, it’s still fair to say the best way to find a phone you’ve misplaced in your home or somewhere else nearby is to simply call it. Even as our devices have gotten smarter, this hasn’t really changed. However, it’s never been a surefire solution. For example, what if your phone’s battery has died, or you left it in silent mode before losing it? In such an instance, calling wouldn’t necessarily help track it down — which is why an Intel patent, published Thursday, could make all the difference. Intel is calling it a “low-power voice trigger for finding mobile devices,” and the name is quite self-explanatory. An audio processor, which would act independently of the device’s main processor, would be capable of listening for a predetermined phrase even when the phone is powered off or in standby mode. Once it detects the phrase — the example used in the application is “Hello phone” — the device could play a tone to help the owner locate it. That’s a basic overview of how the system would operate, but Intel goes into much greater detail in the application. The company lists some potential problems with its proposal, the first and foremost being how it would interact with wireless headsets. Theoretically, the phone would default to the onboard microphone and speaker even in situations when it is still connected to an external device, like Bluetooth headphones. The low-power location pitch was just one of two Intel patents brought to light this week. On the same day, an application for a “face-based secure messaging” scheme broke cover. Put simply, the proposal would allow an individual to send a message to another that would only unlock and be visible if the second user was present. The device would determine that by recording video of the recipient’s face, and matching that against a provided screenshot. Many new phones today, like Samsung’s Galaxy S8, are using face detection and iris scanning as a means for authentication — allowing you to unlock your handset simply by looking at it. Therefore, it’s not surprising that Intel would look to extend this technology to messaging as well. Mobile-based chat apps are perpetually under the scrutiny of privacy advocates for not doing enough to protect their users and the contents of the media they share, so Intel’s patent is especially relevant now. Speaking of which, it’s important to remember that patents are exactly what these ideas are — not guarantees of features you can expect to see on your smartphone in the immediate future, or possibly ever. However, as far as patents are concerned, they’re not far-fetched. In fact, they’re technically possible now, so it’ll be interesting to see if and how they materialize.

Microsoft Surface Laptop hands-on (2:26) More like this Surface Laptop vs. Surface Pro 4: We compare prices, features and more Surface Laptop: Everything you need to know Surface Book vs. Porsche Design Book One: A specs comparison Video Windows 10 S hands-on With the debut of the Surface Laptop, Microsoft has a stylish cousin to its brawny Surface Book—similarly shaped, but very different otherwise. It can be a tough choice if both premium products have caught your eye.  We haven't tested the Surface Laptop yet, but it's on preorder leading up to its June 15 ship date. Until we can review it, we can take a look at the specs and help you consider the two choices more closely. Some powerful components boost the Surface Laptop Let’s start by talking about what makes each Surface its own device. The features table below (click to enlarge) lays out the details for the regular Surface Book, the Surface Book with Performance Base, and the Surface Laptop.  [ Further reading: Our picks for best PC laptops ] IDG The operating system is a big difference. Microsoft built the Surface Book around Windows 10 Pro, with a suite of productivity components. The Surface Laptop, on the other hand, ships with Microsoft’s new Windows 10 S operating system, designed to straddle the divide between an educational environment and the working world. Microsoft also provides an upgrade path from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro. Microsoft The Surface Book’s hinge folds almost flat, but the laptop will feel too thick for some. Design involves more dramatic differences. Because the Surface Book’s signature Dynamic Fulcrum hinge doesn’t fold flat, the Book can feel somewhat thick and clunky, especially compared to the Surface Laptop's svelte 0.57-inch profile. Weight follows suit: Compared to the Surface Book with Performance Base (3.63 pounds), the 2.76-pound Laptop shaves off nearly a pound.  The Surface Book's advantage, of course, is that it's a 2-in-1 whose display detaches to become a tablet. The Surface Laptop has no tablet option, not even a 360-degree hinge to enable a tablet mode. Habitual pen users should also be aware that the Surface Book includes a Surface Pen, while the Surface Laptop does not. Microsoft The Surface Laptop reclines about as much as the Surface Book, but it can't turn into a tablet like the Surface Book can. Newer components are one way the Surface Laptop shines. Microsoft’s Surface Book was originally built in 2015 and uses an older Skylake processor. Microsoft's 2016 Performance Base refresh affected only the discrete GPU. The Surface Laptop opts for Intel’s most current Kaby Lake chip, but graphics are integrated. Other cut corners on the Surface Laptop include smaller storage options, plus a lower-resolution display and camera. Finally, there’s battery life. Microsoft promises a whopping 14.5 hours of battery life from the Surface Laptop. If you opt for the high-end Surface Book (with the Performance Base) you’ll actually get more: 16 hours. In either case, though, you’ll probably be a very satisfied customer. Surface Book offers more choice in pricing Frankly, neither the Surface Book nor the Laptop is particularly affordable. At $999, though, Microsoft has positioned the Surface Laptop as an alternative to the Apple Macbook Airs that are a common sight around campus. The Surface Book, meanwhile, ranges from pricey to insanely expensive. Even though this story compares the Surface Book to the Surface Laptop, anyone willing to spend upwards of $3,300 should also seek out other, more updated options. IDG Right now, the Surface Book offers many more choices than the Surface Laptop. Although we have yet to test it, we would advise you to avoid preordering the two cheapest Surface Laptops, if only because their 4GB of RAM is merely adequate for today's apps, let alone tomorrow's. As my colleagues have pointed out, collegiate life is about exploration, and skating by with 4GB of memory over the course of four years seems risky. For that reason, we’d recommend starting with the $1,599 Core i7/8GB/256GB Surface Laptop as your minimum option. That puts it much more on a par with the Surface Book, which offers 8GB of memory from top to bottom.  Jorge Arzac/IDG The Surface Laptop comes in four colors: Burgundy, Platinum, Cobalt Blue, and Graphite Gold. The Surface Book offers just one color, aluminum. Though there’s no version of the Surface Laptop that directly compares to the Surface Book, on paper the former seems to offer better bang for the buck. Consider the Core i7 (Kaby Lake)/8GB RAM/256GB SSD model of the Laptop: At $1,599, it’s about $800 cheaper than an “identical” Surface Book model. We'd vastly prefer that Surface Book because of its discrete GPU (something the Laptop doesn’t offer), but it's also stuck with that older Skylake chip. The $800 difference is a ton. Eventually, we hope Microsoft adds a Core m option to the Surface Laptop—nudging down performance a bit, certainly, but probably lowering the price as well. Competing laptops like the HP Spectre x360 (2017) arguably offer a far better option at the $1,200 to $1,300 price point.  Both feel great under your fingers We can already make some preliminary assessments of the Surface Laptop's user experience based on our brief time with it at the launch. Both the Surface Book (which we've used extensively) and the Surface Laptop feel solid in the hand, and can be supported by holding the base. I can’t say yet how well the Laptop handles lap typing, though it certainly seems sturdy enough. I have no issue with the Surface Laptop's Alcantara-clad keyboard, which reminds me of the Surface Pro 4's Premium Type Cover. The trackpad and keyboard on both are excellent.  Mark Hachman / IDG The Surface Laptop’s touchpad and keyboard feel very much like the Surface Pro 4. A significant downside to the Surface Laptop is its limited connectivity, especially the single USB 3.0 Type-A port (and no USB-C). More and more devices—heck, even Microsoft’s aged Lumia 950XL phone—have moved to USB-C for both charging and I/O connectivity. The Surface Book has no USB-C, but at least it has two USB 3.0 Type A connectors. Mark Hachman / IDG Unfortunately, the Surface Laptop has a distinct lack of expansion slots.  Microsoft remains committed to its Surface connector, which allows Surface owners to share chargers and connect to Microsoft’s Surface Dock. That accessory adds an additional four USB 3.0 ports, two miniDP ports, and gigabit ethernet—but it costs an additional $200, too. Inking works well with the Surface Pen that's included with the Surface Book, but you’ll have to buy one for the Surface Laptop. Both devices also work with the Surface Dial, though you’re not able to use the Dial onscreen with either. Note that the Book also has a higher-resolution front-facing camera as well as a rear camera. If you plan to take pictures with a tablet, that may affect your decision. Conclusion: Two pricey, well-engineered Surfaces Choosing between the Surface Book and Surface Laptop may come down to price for most people, but there's far more nuance to their differences: brawny vs. thin-and-light design, feature-stuffed vs. curated configuration, and distinctive features like the Surface Book's detachable display or the Surface Laptop's Alcantara-clad keyboard. Clearly, the Surface Laptop offers a more up-to-date mix of components, an advantage the Surface Book could eliminate if Microsoft did a major refresh. Further consideration awaits our full review, which we hope to post in June.  To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against then-HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt and me on Jan. 17, 2009 — just three days before our political appointments expired — to establish a beachhead for their efforts to upend certain laws they didn’t like.   Fast forward eight years and the same thing happened, but this time the litigious liberals were the political appointees, and this time their suits were directed at people and companies they didn’t like rather than at irritating laws. A prime example of this: a mere three days before to the inauguration of President Trump, then-Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairwoman Edith Ramirez filed suit against the technology company Qualcomm because she didn’t like the contracts it had negotiated with computer giant Apple (a company 10 times as large as Qualcomm). Shortly after Chairwoman Ramirez filed her midnight litigation, she quit her job to let others pick up the shattered pieces caused by her hubris. Former Chairwoman Ramirez’s lawsuit is indicative of the regulatory agenda employed by the previous administration. For eight years, we watched as governmental agencies increasingly infringed on the ability of industries and businesses to flourish. If allowed to proceed, her suit will endanger intellectual property protections and put free market principles at risk. Senate Intel hold impromptu meeting with deputy AG Rod Rosenstein https://t.co/ljjioS619K pic.twitter.com/WGoJdkg0U2— The Hill (@thehill) May 11, 2017 President Trump has made clear that he intends to put a stop to government abuse and instead allow free market incentives to spur innovation and economic growth. Despite the new president’s commitment to strengthening those ideals, a handful of companies recently urged him to allow the litigation against Qualcomm to move forward. Not surprisingly, those chosen as winners by the Obama government are reticent for the era of big government to end, at least for now, hoping that an Obama-appointed judge will decide that $800-billion Apple needs special protection from its chip supplier. The grousing companies fail to acknowledge the dangerous precedent that would be established by using antitrust policies to weaken intellectual property rights. IP rights are grounded in Article I of the U.S. Constitution and are a fundamental building block for a thriving economy. (Indeed, the “right” of inventors to the exclusive use of their ideas is the only right the Founders enshrined in the Constitution). And there’s very good reason why the Founders valued intellectual property to such a high degree. As Abraham Lincoln explained, "The Patent System added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius." But, companies have no incentive to invest in the development of new technologies or to share cutting edge ideas if they are not assured that those ideas will be protected from theft and abuse. Senate Intel hold impromptu meeting with deputy AG Rod Rosenstein https://t.co/ljjioS619K pic.twitter.com/WGoJdkg0U2— The Hill (@thehill) May 11, 2017 On top of all this, the FTC case is without merit. As clearly demonstrated by FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen in her dissent, the complaint is “based on a flawed legal theory … that lacks economic and evidentiary support, that was brought on the eve of a new presidential administration, and that, by its mere issuance, will undermine U.S. intellectual property rights in Asia and worldwide.” The risk this lawsuit poses is not to just one company but to our nation’s ability to maintain our global competitiveness and position as a technology leader. This suit establishes a clear path for foreign governments to utilize frivolous enforcement actions to strip patent rights from U.S. companies, ultimately allowing Chinese, South Korean and European governments to use our own strength against us. If allowed to move forward, the FTC’s midnight litigation will limit our country’s ability to innovate, stimulate the economy and create jobs. Considering that IP-related industries accounted for 27.9 million jobs and contributed $6.6 trillion to GDP in 2014, according to a report from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, there is much at stake. It is critical that now-Acting Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen be given the necessary tools to end the FTC bullying so she can instead pursue the regulatory agenda that the American people endorsed when they elected President Trump. It should be the people’s will that governs this outcome, not the litigious appointees of the prior administration.

Human drivers Tom Krisher, Associated Press Writer Leave a comment 6 reads In this Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2016, file photo, a self-driving Uber car stops at a red light on Liberty Avenue through the Bloomfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh.  (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) DETROIT (AP) — In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15 mph (16 to 24 kph) — just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn’t dare cross a double yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt.   In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there’s the “California Stop,” where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the “Pittsburgh Left,” where it’s customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Michigan, drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left-turn onto a freeway. “There’s an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules,” says Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school’s autonomous car research. Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That’s because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment. “Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don’t understand social graces,” says Missy Cummings, director of Duke University’s Humans and Autonomy Lab. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing’s giant traffic jams. In India’s capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks, and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they’re equipped with automatic emergency braking. “It’s hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology,” says John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota’s autonomous car unit. Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter says. Programmers are optimistic that someday the cars will be able to handle even Beijing’s traffic. But the cost could be high, and it might be a decade or more before Chinese regulators deem self-driving cars reliable enough for widespread public use, says John Zeng of LMC Automotive Consulting. Intel’s Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1 ½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That’s equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle, Zeng says. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or to speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the “Pittsburgh Left” by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out if a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes. Still, some skeptics say computerized cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. “You’ll never be able to make up a person’s ability to perceive what’s the right move at the time, I don’t think,” says New Jersey State Police Sgt. Ed Long, who works in the traffic and public safety office. ____ Allen G.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Laptops Microsoft Surface Laptop vs. 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro Emily Ferron May 12, 2017 Microsoft has added a Windows 10 S-running laptop to its line of Surfaces. How does it stack up against the 13-inch MacBook Pro? View gallery - 27 images Microsoft just announced the newest addition to its Surface line, the Surface Laptop, which seems to be a well-rounded, premium but not-quite-pro-grade device. Let's take a look at how its specs and features compare to those of the 13-inch MacBook Pro (both the Touch Bar and non-Touch Bar versions). Size NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW The Surface is about 5-percent taller and one-percent wider than the MacBook Pro, though the Mac is just a hair thicker when closed. Weight Despite being the ever-so-slightly smaller device, the MacBook is nearly 9-percent heavier with a 0.12 kg (0.26 lb) difference. Build (case) With the Surface Laptop, Microsoft abandoned the magnesium alloy it has been using in other devices like the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4. Both of these machines have aluminum bodies. Colors When it comes to phones and tablets, Apple usually has the biggest selection of color choices, but that's not the case with laptops. Here, the Surface has four options and the MacBook offers two. Display size The 13.3-inch MacBook, with a 16:10 aspect ratio, offers 95-percent of the overall screen area that the Surface does with its 13.5-inch, 3:2 display. Touchscreen While we couldn't call the Surface Laptop a 2-in-1 – it doesn't have a 360-degree hinge or any other kind of tablet mode – it still borrows from those tablet-inspired devices and includes a touchscreen display. Display resolution Display resolution is very similar, but the MacBook sneaks in more pixels per inch. Alcantara keyboard The Surface Laptop has an Alcantara fabric-covered keyboard. This synthetic microfiber, often seen in auto interiors, gives the keyboard a soft touch and sound. However, some are wondering whether it will be prone to wear and tear issues. Touch Bar The MacBook Pro is available with or without a Touch Bar – a touch-sensitive area that replaces the Fn keys at the top of the keyboard with dynamic navigational shortcuts. Not all applications have Touch Bar support, but it is supported by Office for Mac, Logic Pro X, Final Cut Pro, iMovie, GarageBand, Evernote and others, with more expected on the way. Stylus support It's hard to imagine using a stylus on a typical clamshell-style laptop, but the Surface does support one. It's compatible with the Microsoft Surface Pen, which sells separately for US$60. Fingerprint sensor The MacBooks with Touch Bars also have a TouchID fingerprint sensor for easy logins. Face recognition But if you like the idea of biometric logins, the Surface still has you covered. It supports Windows Hello's face recognition feature, so you can log in just by showing your face. Processor The Surface Laptop contains the newest 7th-generation Intel core i5 or i7 chipsets. Microsoft hasn't posted clock speeds, so we'll have to wait until the devices hit the market for those. Both the Touch Bar and non-Touch Bar MacBook Pros start off with a 6th-generation Intel core i5 processor, but the Touch Bar model gets a little bit more speed out of it. You can also upgrade to a 6th-generation i7 processor if you order a special configuration directly from Apple. Graphics There are no upgrade options here – we're looking at embedded graphics only. RAM The Surface Laptop comes with either 4, 8 or 16 GB of RAM. The MacBook Pro comes with 8 GB, but can be configured to 16 GB (that is, you won't find this option off-the-shelf, but you can order it directly from Apple). Storage The Surface Laptop is available with either 128, 256 or 512 GB of built-in storage (at the launch event, a 1 TB option was mentioned, but we haven't seen it hit the product page yet). The entry-level MacBook Pro starts with 256 GB, configurable to 512 GB or 1 TB. Ports These two makers take very different approaches to expansion ports. The Surface Laptop has one legacy USB 3.0 and a mini DisplayPort. The MacBook Pro opts for the newer Thunderbolt/USB-C standard, with two ports on the entry-level model and four on the Touch Bar model. SD card reader Neither device accommodates DSLR photographers with a built-in SD card reader. Charging port The Surface Laptop has a dedicated Surface Connect charging port, but with the MacBook Pro you'll have to occupy one of those precious USB-C ports to get a charge. Headphone jack Both have standard headphone jacks, so no matter what, there's at least one accessory you can plug in without worrying about a dongle or adapter. Speakers The so-called "omnisonic" Dolby Audio Premium speakers on the Surface Laptop are actually below the keyboard. The MacBook Pro has a set of stereo speakers with high dynamic range. Battery Microsoft hasn't published the battery size for its Surface Laptop, but it promises an impressive 14.5 hour maximum battery life. Of course, manufacturers' estimates should be taken with a grain of salt, but if it comes close in practice, we will be impressed. The non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro actually has a larger battery than the Touch Bar edition, but Apple gives an "up to 10 hours wireless web" estimate for both of them. Webcam Both have 720p webcams which should be adequate for most video conferencing applications. Software The Surface Laptop is the first device to ship with Windows 10 S, Microsoft's recently announced walled operating system. It looks and functions much like Windows 10, with the notable exception that it only runs apps downloaded from the Windows Store. If that doesn't appeal to you, Microsoft is offering free upgrades to Windows 10 Pro until the end of the year. After that, it will reportedly cost $50 to upgrade to the full operating system. The MacBook Pros run Apple's latest desktop OS, macOS Sierra. Release The recently announced Surface Laptop is available for pre-order now to start shipping and hitting shelves June 15. This edition of the MacBook Pro was released last October/November. Starting price The Microsoft Surface Laptop starts at $999, but you can expect to pay about $500 more than that for even the entry-level MacBook Pro. It might be worth it for Apple fans loyal to the ecosystem, but for many others, the value will fall short. For the kind of info you won't find on a spec sheet, revisit our takes on the Touch Bar and non-Touch Bar MacBook Pros. We'll conduct a full-length review of the Surface Laptop when the time comes.

It showcases the broad forefront of autonomous vehicles generally, but in-flight in particular, and there were plenty of expanded capabilities and expanding applications on display. In one of several keynotes over the course of the four-day show, Intel Corporation CEO Brian Krzanich predicted that in the oncoming era of driverless cars and autonomous aircraft, the most important aspect of such vehicles will be the data they collect rather than their performance. Big data and cloud processing are somehow tied into UAVs in his vision of things. Sometime soon, he forecast, autonomous devies “will have the ability to make decisions.” Swarming drones have military potential, according to a 33-year career Marine who now works at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies. Bill Powers described how a Navy program, the Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST) uses drones to jam enemy communications and waste its resources by drawing fire. The Naval Research Laboratory dploys Close-in Covert Autonomous Disposable Aircraft (CICADA), with onboard sensors that relay atmospheric conditions as well as possition, time and altitude relating to battlefield conditions. Watching the Watchers With all the drones in the air, managing them and keeping the commercial airspace safe and uncluttered has become a towering problem. Several companies at AUVSI introduced unmanned traffic management (UTM) systems. Unmanned traffic management becoming a priority (image courtesy Gryphon Systems). Among them, Gryphon Sensors introduced Mobile Skylight, an operational mobile UTM system designed for rapid deployment. Drone security applications span, according to the company, airport security, critical infrastructure protection, VIP security, embassy protection and border security. In the beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) realm, UTM applications to be enabled by Mobile Skylight include: first responders (EMS, fire and police), precision agriculture, delivery, utility and infrastructure inspection, media and entertainment, mapping and surveying, construction and mining. In short, everywhere drones go, they will need to be tracked and managed. Mobile Skylight combines multiple technologies and an array of self-contained sensors, to serve as a mobile command center. The system is provided in a four-wheel drive van with off-road capabilities. It also integrates with third-party sensor inputs, and automatically records essential data for post-mission analysis and playback. Using a dual-band mesh network, Mobile Skylight is capable of forward deploying a multispectral suite of sensors. Its integrated radar has been designed for 3-D detection of low-flying, small UAS and general aviation at ranges out to 10 kilometers and 27 kilometers, respectively. The system has built-in target tracking and classification to help quickly identify cooperative and non-cooperative targets. It also tracks multiple, simultaneous targets, providing a comprehensive picture of the airspace. See related story, Traffic management systems for unmanned aircraft requested. Yeah, Heavy One novel application is heavy-lift drones for the construction and perhaps open-pit mining, quarrying and other weighty sectors. Griff Aviation, a Norwegian company that has set up a manufacturing plant in Florida, displayed its Super Heavy-Lift model, the Griff 300. Super Heavy-Lift Drone from Griff Aviation The GRIFF 300 is an unmanned aircraft with customizable payload options that make it suitable for a variety of professional applications. The company states that it can lift 225kg (496lbs) in addition to its own 75kg (165lbs) weight. It features a flight time of 30-45mins, depending on payload. “The next model that will be produced will be able to lift 800kg (1,764lbs). Then we will continue to increase lifting capacity even further,” said CEO Leif Johan Holand. Skylift Global drone prepping for flight. Several aisles over on the show floor, Skylift Global also featured a drone in the heavy lifting class.  “Current prototype is 100 pounds and carried an additional 100 pounds easy. Currently undergoing testing for up to 400 pounds,” says its CEO Amir Emadi. Skylift has signed agreements with companies in southern California to start deliveries of cold-chain logistics. Its heavy-lift capability can carry the added weight of refrigeration (think Amazon Fresh, says Emadi). Skylift also is in collaboration with JPL and Caltech to showcase a platform to DARPA for autonomous sense and avoid. Neither company has GPS aboard their workhorses yet but see no problem and plenty of opportunity in adding it as their business develops. Experienced GNSS Companies NovAtel had on display its range of high-precision GNSS receivers, antennas, and augmented systems for ground, marine and airborne unmanned applications. Its equipment meets requirements for military and commercial applications, and specific to UAV applications the company offered the OEM625S SAASM GPS+civil RTK receiver, GAJT anti-jam antennas, TerraStar PPP correction services and SPAN GNSS+INS for 3D position, attitude and velocity. The latter will be featured in the cover story of GPS World’s June issue, differentiating performance of various grades of IMUs in a tightly-coupled inertial/GNSS integration. Exploring IMU specifications and correlating them to performance of a final product can be daunting, as differences between MEMS sensors are not always apparent. The article will present achievable performances in fusion technology across a range of IMUs among the best in their respective performance categories. Spirent Communications took a dual approach, displaying what they termed an entry-level simulator (although fully upgradeable as needs develop) for UAV manufacturers who are new to GPS signal testing, and even the need for it. They also had on hand their fully configured GSS7000 for multi-frequency testing, also with a modular approach to enable the precision GNSS simulation system to expand with users’ needs. The GSS7000 series offers emulation of all civil GNSS systems and regional augmentation systems, and allows devices to be tested under a multitude of operating environments and error conditions, the company said. The GSS7000 has the flexibility to reconfigure satellite constellations, channels and frequencies between test runs or test cases. Four software control variants are offered.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Electronics With Toyota, Nvidia Racks Up Another Autonomous Car Design Win With Toyota, Nvidia Racks Up Another Autonomous Car Design Win By Bill Howard on May 12, 2017 at 12:09 pm Comment Nvidia has another design win for its Drive PX artificial intelligence platform for autonomous driving: Toyota. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made the announcement this week in the opening keynote of the company’s GPU Technology Conference in San Jose. Coming on the heels of Nvidia hookups with Mercedes-Benz and Audi, it’s a clear sign that the once-just-a-graphics-card company is serious competition in the automotive sector for the likes of Intel, which plans to invest $15 billion on autonomous driving. Helping self-driving cars get smarter The Nvidia system would mean Toyota could have self-driving cars available for sale “in the next few years,” Huang said Wednesday. That jibes with what some automakers–those working with NVidia and those aligned elsewhere–have said. 2020 is the earliest date bandied about. Others in the industry have said privately that serious self-drive cars may need another 5-10 years for ones that would never ever need someone behind the wheel just in case. Nvidia first announced its Drive PX platform in 2015. Drive PX 2 was announced a year later at CES 2016. Nvidia describes Drive PX as an open AI car computing platform that enables automakers and their tier 1 suppliers to accelerate production of autonomous vehicles: “It scales from a palm-sized, energy efficient module for AutoCruise capabilities, to a powerful AI supercomputer capable of autonomous driving.” A simpler, single-processor version allows for “AutoCruise,” or automated highway driving and HD mapping. Multiple platforms in parallel would allow for fully autonomous driving, meaning self-driving on any road. Previously, Mercedes-Benz and Audi agreed to work with Nvidia on autonomous driving. Now comes Toyota, the world’s second-largest automaker, with 10.2 million vehicles produced last year, just behind Volkswagen (which includes Audi) with 10.3 million vehicles produced. Nvidia AI lets cars make own decisions At CES 2017 in Las Vegas, Audi showcased an Nvidia-equipped, self-driving car that made unassisted loops around a nearby parking. Nothing tricky there, until an Audi tech ran onto the track and stuck a big Road Closed sign with arrows pointing left. Encountering the changed road conditions, the car responding by taking a left turn and diverting itself through a set of cones and then back on-course. Virtually every automaker is working on autonomous cars. All are doing significant R&D work on their own, but none appear ready to create all the optical, radar, and lidar hardware from scratch, let alone the special-purpose CPUs and algorithms. It is not unusual in the auto industry to work with third parties to provide significant parts of the car, such as transmissions, infotainment head units, lane departure warning, blind spot detection, and adaptive cruise control. Nvidia’s competition includes Intel and Qualcomm. There are also others creating or pondering autonomous driving technology, including Apple, Google, and Amazon. It’s possible some of their work could be licensed to automakers. Where Tesla built its own cars from scratch, Apple in the past has looked for a partner to manufacture its autonomous car if it goes ahead.

But one thing that stood out among the various announcements by Microsoft was a renewed focus on the Windows Store, which is increasingly looking like a central piece of the future of Microsoft’s operating system. A renewed focus on the Windows Store When the Windows Store launched back in 2012 alongside Windows 8 and Windows RT, things were very different. Fueled by the massive success of Apple’s iOS App Store, tech companies were running to create storefronts of their own to keep up (including Apple, who released the far less successful Mac App Store in 2011), and Microsoft wasn’t going to get left out. But the Windows Store was a confusing mess in 2012. Windows 8 ran on Intel’s x86 / x64 architectures, while Windows RT ran on ARM, but the two shared a store, meaning that the apps on offer had to be ARM compatible since everything in Windows Store had to also run on RT. That meant that the Windows Store of old was essentially just Metro-ized, tablet-focused applications that were designed to compete with Apple’s iPad, instead of allowing the store to serve as a repository of traditional Windows programs. Additionally, software built with the popular .NET and Win32 frameworks wasn’t eligible for the store, making it virtually impossible for many popular programs to be available without fundamentally remaking things from scratch specifically for Windows 8 / 10. Microsoft has learned a lot since the initial lackluster launch of the Windows Store But Microsoft has learned a lot since the initial lackluster launch of the Windows Store. Windows 10 introduced the Universal Windows Platform, which made it easier for developers to create applications that would work on multiple platforms. And last year at Build 2016, Microsoft announced a Desktop Bridge Tool that would help port traditional .NET and Win32 Windows desktop applications to Windows Store-compatible versions. And of last year, all future first-party Xbox One games will be offered as cross-compatible Windows 10 options through the shared Windows Store as part of the Xbox Play Anywhere program, giving Microsoft a viable incentive for users to use the Windows Store over competitors like Steam. The recent news from Microsoft builds on that: Windows 10 for ARM — in essence, Microsoft’s second shot at RT — will be able to run almost any x86 application through emulation whether installed through the Windows Store or not, fixing one of RT’s biggest flaws. Microsoft seems so confident that it can get developers to put real desktop applications on the Windows Store that the new Windows 10 S operating system will only be able to run store apps. And the company is wasting no time on corralling some big names to the Windows Store, including iTunes, Spotify, and even several Linux distros. Instead of the store serving as the lowest common denominator of basic ARM apps, Microsoft is rebuilding it as the core of any Windows software experience. You may have to go farther afield to install something like Photoshop, but most of what you need should be right there on the store. Microsoft is rebuilding the store as the core of any Windows software experience If Microsoft can really convince users and developers alike to take another chance and embrace the Windows Store, it could change Windows as we know it. Installing and uninstalling software would be dramatically easier for users (rather than requiring a user to download an executable file, install it, and hope that the developer included some kind of uninstaller for when they want to get rid of it). A central store would also make software updates easier. Additionally, Microsoft recently added an option in the Windows 10 Creators Update to optionally block installing applications that aren’t from the Windows Store, similar to Apple’s Gatekeeper feature on OS X. In a world where the Windows Store is robust enough to offer all the programs you need, Windows then becomes significantly more secure for end users. Image via MSPoweruser Oh, and there are some big benefits for Microsoft if it can pull this off, too, given that the company gets a nice 30 percent cut of app purchases. (And if Apple’s iOS App Store revenue is anything to go by, this could translate into a pretty big windfall.) Microsoft is fighting an uphill battle Of course, Microsoft is fighting an uphill battle. Remember, Apple tried a similar tactic with the Mac App Store, which never had the problems of Microsoft’s multiplatform confusion. But between sandboxing restrictions that limit what apps can do, and the fact that it was tough to convince developers to fork over 30 percent of their profits when they could just as easily sell it on their own, the Mac App Store has yet to become an indispensable part of the operating system. Whether or not Microsoft and its more lenient policies can succeed where Apple failed is still up for debate, but taking all the recent news from the company together, it’s clear that the Windows Store is going to be a major focus point for Microsoft going forward. Now Microsoft has to get its developers and users to follow step.

But is it for you? Let's see. By: Steven Bassiri | Touchscreen Laptops in Laptops | Posted: 17 hours, 41 mins ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 92%Manufacturer: Dell Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Physical Overview] Page 3 [Physical Overview Continued] Page 4 [Software and BIOS] Page 5 [System Performance Benchmarks] Page 6 [System IO and Battery Performance] Page 7 [Thermal Performance] Page 8 [What's Hot, What's Not & Final Thoughts] Introduction     I have looked at Dell's Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme notebook with extreme water and ingress protection, and today I am taking a look at one of Dell's slightly less rugged tablets meant for heavy duty use. While the tablet is technically a tablet since it doesn't have a keyboard, it has more powerful hardware than some notebooks and uses a Windows 10 OS.     The Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet is certified MIL-STD-810G for everything from drop height to tactical standby and solar radiation. It can operate in extremes from -29C to 63C. It also carries IP-65 ingress protection, MIL-STD-461F electromagnetic interference, and ANSI/ISA.12.12.01 hazardous location certifications. It's very rugged, and while the certifications are on paper, I did have a chance to use one as a real-time GPS enabled map strapped to a jet ski. It survived hours and hours of intense water, sun, and vibration. Today I am not evaluating its ruggedness, but instead its performance.     Specifications     Our configuration is the Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet used a 2C/4T Intel Core M-5Y71 Broadwell-Y based processor, 8GB (dual channel) 1600MHz DDR3 memory, 256GB SanDisk X400 M.2 drive, Intel HD5300 Graphics, Intel 7265 Wireless-AC, Realtek based audio, TPM 2.0 module, and NFC sensor. Our unit also came with a magnetically detachable keyboard and kickstand, which are optional accessories. It's equipped with notebook level hardware and uses some of the most reliable controllers. The reason this tablet uses Broadwell instead of Skylake is because Broadwell has been tested thoroughly to ensure there are no issues that might pop up down the line with the microarchitecture.     Our unit uses Windows 10. The unit has two 26Wh batteries, a fingerprint reader, a 11.6" daylight visible 1366x768 resolution touch display, front and rear webcams, a NFC proximity sensor, TPM 2.0, a BayHubTech/O2 MMC/SD card reader, a Smart Card Reader, a USB 3.0 port, mini-HDMI, a headphone jack, and Serial Port #1/COM1 port.     Pricing   The Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet starts at $1849.

Posted 11 May 2017 Ruth HollowayFeed 11up 1 comment Image credits :  Tony Smith via Flickr (CC BY 2.0) Brad Fitzpatrick, a software engineer at Google working on the Go programming language, is a life-long nerd. His father worked at Intel, so he grew up steeped in technology. He started writing software in middle school, and he has been building and working with open source software for 19 years—over half of his life. Fitzpatrick's keynote at OSCON this year was based on bits of wisdom from half a life in open source.  Don't bash other technologies. The "other" ones might have been the only choices at the time or might have been chosen because of necessary engineering tradeoffs. The cost of factoring in a new technology can be too high. Your heroes are just people. They are good at some things, and suck at others, just like you. Learn from them, but don't worship them. And remember, you could be someone's hero one day! Accepting user-generated content means you should prepare for abuse. Fitzpatrick's first website was swarmed with abuse until it had to be shut down. His second was LiveJournal, for sharing stories. Know why you're making something open source. Laziness isn't a great reason; there are other ways to collaborate that are less maintenance-intensive. Don't be afraid to write something new, rejecting "current" tools and best practices. Brad wrote memcached (a distributed memory object caching system) to solve a specific problem, and it saved LiveJournal. People derided it as "not the way things are done," but Fitzpatrick's response was: "'My site doesn't work without it, so cool opinion." (Or, "thanks for reading.") You are going to abandon projects at some point, so have a plan for passing them on to someone else. "Easy" and "quick" are not synonymous. Many things are "easy" but end up costing a lot of time, especially when you factor in long-term maintenance. Any code you put online will somehow end up in someone else's production. Make sure that trivial jokes are flagged as such. Do you find something annoying about a piece of software? Fix it. Is it just too broken? Vote with your feet. There are a lot of great choices out there, and you can always write something new. All software kind of sucks (including your own) and everything can be fixed. You're welcome to do so, but if you touched it last you might finding yourself owning it. Give talks! It makes conferences cheaper to attend and makes them scarier, in a good way. There are tons of amazing low-profile people who are worth meeting at conferences, too, many of whom will never feel comfortable giving a talk. Fitzpatrick encourages people to share their own stories and the lessons they have learned. We'd love to hear from you! Learn how to share your story with Opensource.com.

Finding them requires that investors search for lesser-followed companies. Quite often, the under-the-radar stocks have low trading volume, are not well known in the markets and have a small market capitalization. Source: magicatwork via Flickr Such unknown stocks may have compelling value, so long as the market does not recognize the company’s growth potential or their dominance in a poorly understood sector. With that in mind, here are three overlooked tech stocks investors should consider buying for big-time gains later down the line. Tech Stocks to Buy: Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI ), with a price-to-earnings ratio of 20.8X and a forward P/E of 11.5X, offers the industry an innumerable number of server and storage system solutions. The server hardware chip refresh from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ), code-named „Skylake,” will drive sales for SMCI. The company began shipping X11 systems earlier this month. These solutions are special because of the number of memory, processor power and storage they support. For example, the X11 is powered by two Intel Xeon processors and allows for 24 DIMMs, along with all-flash NVMe for each node. Besides servers, SMCI benefits from the growth in Internet of Things (IoT): 10.5% of its revenue in Q3 came from the IoT market. The addressable market for embedded is around $10 billion. So as the market grows, Super Micro Computer’s revenue mix will include more from this space. Investors are familiar with Intel, but do not realize that the server computer providers like SMCI have the potential to grow in the quarters ahead. Tech Stocks to Buy: Cray Inc. (CRAY) Cray Inc. (NASDAQ: CRAY ) is another supercomputer maker. The company reported first-quarter revenue of $59.03 million, but lost $0.71 per share. Although the company started off the year with slow sales, management is confident that it is in a competitive position in the market. CRAY won a number of major contracts in the quarter. For example, it delivered a system solution to Laboratory Computing Resource Center at Argonne National Laboratory. It is expanding its market, a move that should drive revenues higher and deliver profits. CRAY holds $285 million in cash or $7.08 per share. The company’s expenses are not growing, so higher sales will add positively to earnings. Tech Stocks to Buy: Descartes Systems Group Inc (USA) (DSGX) Descartes Systems Group Inc (USA)  (NASDAQ: DSGX ) is a trusted supplier of a global logistics network („GLN”) infrastructure. For years, the company invested and made acquisitions to build this back-end platform. The investments are paying off. The company’s market capitalization is nearing $2 billion. In the fourth quarter, Descartes Systems generated $72.6 million in cash from operations, up from $54.2 million from the previous year. Services revenue grew 11% year-over-year. This is a preferred type of revenue, due to the rich profit margins and its recurring nature. Overall, gross margins remained steady at 72%. DSGX cash levels fell to $38.1 million, down around $2 million YOY due to acquisitions. The small but meaningful buyouts are clearly adding to the company’s revenue. 4Solutions is the company’s latest purchase, which brings Descartes an electronic document exchange network and entry in the Australian healthcare market. As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

"We want to settle the issues that we have had for a long time. For example, the military aid to YPG from the United States. It damages our strategic relations and during meeting with [US President Donald] Trump I will talk about that. We are clearly against this. To destroy one terrorist organization with the help of another is not an ideal policy," Erdogan said at a press conference in Ankara. On Tuesday, despite objections from Turkey, Trump approved a plan to arm YPG, the military branch of Syria's Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), in order to fight the Daesh terrorist group (Daesh, banned in Russia and in the United States) in Syria. The US plan was criticized by Ankara, since it considers the YPG militia to be affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is listed as a terrorist group in Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The two leaders are expected to meet in Washington on May 16. Before arriving to the United States, Erdogan will attend the "One Belt, One Road" summit in China, which is due to take place on May 14-15.

Whether you are looking for a short-term fix or to invest in a solid model from last season's batch, there are some key points to consider.  Here's our guide to make sure you get the model that is right for you.   What do I want my laptop for? If you only want a quick stand-in or portable device you can easily pick up a Windows laptop or Chromebook for £250 or even less. There are plenty of brands out there built for those who just want something simple, and cut price Dell, Acer and Lenovo laptops can all be found for just a couple of hundred pounds. If you want a device that is a little more powerful for running run several programs without feelings the heat you will need to spend a bit more. You can find good deals on laptops with slightly cheaper Intel or AMD processors. Often last year’s models will still be highly viable everyday laptops, and you can find a decent machine for around £500. Even for gaming laptops there are plenty of deals. While you are unlikely to see many going for less than £750, you can still find models that have had their prices slashed and will still perform well on the latest games. For all the details on the kind of things you should be looking for when buying a new laptop, take a look at our best laptops to buy article for a full buying guide. Where can I get a good laptop deal? Most major retailers will offer deals around the year. One-off events such as the January sales, Amazon Prime Day in July or Black Friday can also be the answer to securing a great deal. UK retailers such as John Lewis, Currys, PC World, Argos and Tesco all offer deals and discounts on laptops, often with options to throw in cases, hardware, security systems and programs such as Microsoft Office. Several of the main manufacturers have their own websites offering outlet price models at a discount and online retailers such as Amazon, Very and AO all have discounted deals and bundles. What are the best laptop deals for students? Many major laptop providers offer an education discount for students buying a laptop. This can help save you around 10% or better on even high-end models. While you may be tempted to just go for the cheapest model, even top of the range Apple products offer a 10% discount to students, as does Microsoft for its Surface Book and Surface Laptop. Other manufacturers including Dell, Lenovo and HP all offer chunky savings if you buy using an education discount. Should I buy a new or refurbished model? Buying a new model is the safest bet to get decent performance and specs up to the level of what the developer called for. However, it is easy to pick up a refurbished model online. Generally these will be memory wiped, cleaned and factory reset, but there is no clear standard for buying a refurbished laptop. Some major suppliers such as Dell will resell their own refurbished models in outlet stores or online. With a major developer you can have some guarantee of quality, but you should always check what warranty the model comes with and what operating system will be installed. Jargon buster | A rough guide to tech terminology Under £250 Cheapest Windows laptop: Lenovo Ideapad 100s Credit: Lenovo Screen size: 11.6 inches Weight: 998g Battery life: 8 hours This little laptop is not going to blow anyone away in terms of power, but for price and size it is designed to compete against Chromebooks and you can pick up a used one in white now for just over £100. For a new one, the asking price online is currently starting out at around £170. If you want a Windows laptop for the lowest price, this is your starting point. Lenovo Ideapad 100s Best Chromebook deal: Acer Chromebook 11 Credit: Acer Screen: 11.6 inches Weight: 1.25 kg Battery life: 9 hours One of the best budget Chromebooks you can buy, the Acer 11 has now dropped under £200 from some retailers. While this version lacks the flexible flip screen of its big brother the Acer R11, it runs on the same processor so will deliver similar results. It’s not very powerful and uses Chrome OS, meaning limited storage, but for simple web-based tasks and portability it is a bargain. Acer Chromebook 11 Best big Chromebook deal: Acer Chroomebook 15 Credit: Acer Screen: 15.6 inches Weight: 2.2kg Battery life: 9 hours While it is large and chunky for a Chromebook, this Acer is a bargain if you want a bigger screen but only want a budget model. Asking prices have now fallen to around £240 on some major retailers for a new model, making this 15 inch Chromebook a bargain if you just need a stopgap laptop for simple tasks. Acer Chromebook 15 Under £500 Best everyday deal: Asus X555YA Credit: Asus Screen size: 15.6 inches Weight: 2.3kg Battery life: 6 hours Grab a cheap deal with £30 off on this Asus X555 for under £300. This model features an AMD A6 Quad Core processor which will be ample for everyday needs and comes with a 15.6 inch screen and 1TB of hard drive capacity. While big laptops at this price won’t excel at every task, and the screen resolution on this one could be said to be on the cheaper side, this is definitely a deal if you need a cheap model now. Asus X555YA Best deal for practicality: HP Pavilion 15 Credit: HP Screen size: 15.6 inches Weight: 2.3kg Battery life: 9.5 hours You can now save £150 on this HP Pavilion 15, which is a bargain for a decent laptop with a large screen size. Designed for everyday tasks with a 9 hour battery life and large enough that you could watch films or Youtube videos with ease and with three USB slots, an HDMI connector and a SD card reader it is fairly connective. The new base price has now dropped to around £350, down from around £150 at the start of this year, which makes this a good time to pick up this still fairly recent release. HP Pavilion 15 Best deal for a hybrid: Lenovo Yoga 510 14 Credit: Lenovo Screen size: 14 inches Weight: 1.75kg Battery life: 5 to 6 hours This two-in-one laptop has now dropped well below £500 in its most basic form, which uses a Intel Pentium 4405U processor for managing most simple tasks. With a 128GB SSD it will run smoothly, although this version only features 4GB of RAM may mean the laptop lacks power for some people. Prices on this model have now fallen to £379, making this a cheap tablet/laptop convertible you can pick up which will still deliver decent performance. Lenovo Yoga 510 14 Under £1,000 Best deal for gaming: Asus ROG GL552VX Screen size: 15.6 inches Weight: 2.4kg Battery life: up to 6 hours A gaming laptop for less, this Asus Republic of Gamers (ROG) model is now down below £700. A highly respectable build, this model has a 15.6 inch screen and a 6th generation Intel Core i5 processor and a 128 SSD. This heavy beast is highly connective for gaming headphones and gaming mouse, but white it has the specs to perform as a decent mid-range gaming laptop, the only drawback here is the battery life, unlikely to push more than 6 hours or so. Asus ROG GL552VX Best deal for performance: Dell XPS 13 Credit: Dell Screen: 13.3 inches Weight: 1.29kg Battery life: 13 hours By shopping around you can now find almost £200 off the brilliant XPS 13 laptop, considered one of the main current challengers to Apple's Mac range. The XPS 13 features a virtually borderless 13.3 inch Infinity Edge display, which is available with touch. Dell also claims the laptop offers up to 22 hours of battery life, although in practice this is more like 12 to 13 hours when streaming video. This latest model runs on Kaby Lake processors, Intel's newest and more powerful seventh generation processor. Dell XPS 13 (2017) Best deal for Apple: Macbook Air Credit: Apple Screen: 13.3 inch Weight: 1.35 kg Battery life: 12 hours Apple's highly successful Air has just had a price cut in the UK, bringing it down to around £850, perhaps in anticipation of the launch of Microsoft's competitor laptop the new Surface Laptop in June. This does, however, only bring the price of the Air closer in line with what it was on release date, with Apple having since hiked up prices in the UK. You can also get Apple products from the Apple Store with a 10% discount for students.

WTF, NYT? 39 Emergent Tech Space upstart plans public cloud in low Earth orbit Moving VMs in fleet of micro-sats for virtual geosynchronous satellites 12 May 2017 at 07:18, Simon Sharwood Last week we talked to a space startup that wants to let satellites run XenServer so they can run virtual machines, which sounded intriguing enough that we decided to learn more. And we’re glad we did, because – without going all gadget-mag OMG! about it – this stuff sounds cool. The company plotting to put VMs in space is called Vector Space Systems. It says it will fly a range of rockets. The baby of the company’s fleet, the “Vector-R,” is a deliberately small vehicle that can lift payloads of up to 60kg to low-Earth orbit. And it’s simple enough that Vector thinks it can be launching 100 times a year. Today, satellites are mostly bespoke, so to keep up with a hundred-a-year launch cadence, Vector’s also designed a “GalacticSky satellite hardware and payload compute environment”. As explained to The Register by Shaun Coleman, the GM of the GalacticSky unit of Vector, the design results in satellites “about the size of a loaf of bread” but still packing two discrete computers. One runs a real-time OS on ARM or PowerPC silicon and gets the job of keeping the satellite humming. The other will be air-gapped [vacuum-gapped? – Ed] from the main board and will offer “x86 Intel-based, multi-core hardware including several terabytes of high-speed solid state storage”. Coleman explained the plan is to “effectively 'rent' satellite resources on a per-minute, per-orbit basis.” “For example, when a particular satellite is over the US, Customer A has use of the satellite using its VMs, and when it’s over Europe, Customer A’s VM is paused/snapshotted while Customer B’s VM is enabled and starts processing. This can all be done within seconds, or as fast as a revert to snapshot today in Xen, without the need to build, own or launch a satellite.” Vector hopes to operate a fleet of satellites and allow live VM migration between them to create virtual satellites comprising several physical satellites. Here’s how Coleman explains that scenario: VMs will move horizontally from one satellite to another, based on time, orbit and events (like the failure or reboot of a satellite) maintaining monitoring of a particular object or location on Earth through orbits. Passing from one satellite to the next as it moves past its region of interest, information and analytics, creating the effect of a stationary 'pseudo geo-synchronous satellite' with low-cost low Earth orbit micro-sats. At this point, space-savvy Reg readers are probably saying, “But small low-Earth orbit satellites don’t last long.” You’re right to worry, but Vector thinks its sats should last between two and five years. Or as Coleman puts it, “Think standard PC/Server refresh rates for an enterprise customer.” And because the Vector-R has a base price of just US$1.5m, Coleman says “the cost of the satellites is low enough that we can take advantage of Moore’s Law and replenish the GalacticSky satellite constellations as the satellites de-orbit.” Vector has cooked up its own CentOS-based “GalacticOS”, which it says is nicely lightweight and otherwise optimised to use on its satellites. But if you want to use another OS it won’t object as it will use vanilla XenServer. Coleman says Vector will also provide “helper VMs ... routing or networking VMs like Netscaler from Citrix optimised for space”. Vector’s satellites will be optimised for either imaging or communication. Imaging satellites benefit from on-board VMs for scenarios like pre-analysing captured images so users need download only the snaps they think will be useful. Coleman thinks the comms sats can become a “switching fabric for space by performing the functions we take for granted here on Earth, like space-based network routing, caching, QoS, firewalling, load balancing and others.” Vector thinks that it has a shot at becoming the equivalent of a public cloud, but for space. Coleman says that investors are currently leery of space startups because of the colossal costs and risks of building one’s own bird. But if developers can send a VM into space and try it on some customers, they’ll get the kind of springboard that public clouds offer terrestrial startups. That’s some nicely blue-sky thinking, but not the work of space cadets. Vector has conducted successful engine tests and a sub-orbital launch. It plans to fly a Vector-R “as early as this summer,” has a customer for 21 launches, and thinks it can start regular commercial launches in 2018. So brush up those CVs, XenServer admins.

In the past 12 months, its share price has almost quadrupled. Since 9 May the share price has increased 22%, from US$102.94 to US$126.50 a share. Why? You may know about the competition that exists between NVIDIA and Intel Corporation [NASDAQ:INTC]. You see, Intel is the main producer of central processing units (CPUs). CPUs are basically the brain of the computer, the one that coordinates how all the parts work together. NVIDIA, on the other hand, provides interactive 3D graphics to personal computers. 72% of its share market is in graphic processing units (GPUs), which are chip processors that allow a computer to take in loads of images at quick pace. A GPU is basically an accelerator for a CPU. They are usually used for interactive video games. Yet, lately, they are also being used in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires the processing of large amounts of data. If you want to quickly understand the difference between a CPU and a GPU, Mythbuster’s does a great job in explaining it in under two minutes. You can watch the video here. You see, for some time, Intel almost had a monopoly of the computer and server market by making the most powerful CPUs. You may remember the ‘Intel Inside’ sticker on almost every computer. The thing is, with the rise of AI, CPUs — and Intel — are struggling to keep up. While NVIDIA took advantage from the AI push and diversified its business from gaming to data centres, professional visualisation and the automotive space — yep, NVIDIA provides GPUs for Tesla — Intel concentrated on making its CPUs more powerful. The problem is that CPUs are not keeping up fast enough with AI machine learning and applications. Why? They need to process huge amounts of data. And with AI tech in self-driving cars and deep learning on the rise, NVIDIA is gaining momentum. Intel is still doing OK, but NVIDIA’s accelerator sales are growing. And this week, NVIDIA stepped it up a notch. On 9 May they reported their Q1 2018 earnings. Revenue is up 48% from a year ago, and there has been broad growth across all platforms. Their data centre GPU computing business nearly tripled from last year with more of the world’s computer scientists engaging in deep learning. Demand in cloud service providers has been growing with Amazon and Alibaba using NVIDIA GPUs for their cloud services. But it is not just earnings. At the GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, California, the company released several exciting programs aimed at expanding its presence in the AI sector. One of the developments is the Tesla Volta V100, a new GPU that increases a computer’s power. It is also growing its interests in robotics with ‘Isaac’. Isaac is a simulator platform which helps developers train their robots virtually by creating test scenarios. As the system is completely virtual, there is no risk of robots creating damage or injury. While NVIDIA’s stock is up, Intel’s fell over 2.5% following NVIDIA’s announcement. If AI continues to develop at an accelerated speed, NVIDIA’s shares will continue to soar. Can Intel keep up?

It showcases the broad forefront of autonomous vehicles generally, but in-flight in particular, and there were plenty of expanded capabilities and expanding applications on display. In one of several keynotes over the course of the four-day show, Intel Corporation CEO Brian Krzanich predicted that in the oncoming era of driverless cars and autonomous aircraft, the most important aspect of such vehicles will be the data they collect rather than their performance. Big data and cloud processing are somehow tied into UAVs in his vision of things. Sometime soon, he forecast, autonomous devies “will have the ability to make decisions.” Swarming drones have military potential, according to a 33-year career Marine who now works at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies. Bill Powers described how a Navy program, the Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST) uses drones to jam enemy communications and waste its resources by drawing fire. The Naval Research Laboratory dploys Close-in Covert Autonomous Disposable Aircraft (CICADA), with onboard sensors that relay atmospheric conditions as well as possition, time and altitude relating to battlefield conditions. Watching the Watchers With all the drones in the air, managing them and keeping the commercial airspace safe and uncluttered has become a towering problem. Several companies at AUVSI introduced unmanned traffic management (UTM) systems. Unmanned traffic management becoming a priority (image courtesy Gryphon Systems). Among them, Gryphon Sensors introduced Mobile Skylight, an operational mobile UTM system designed for rapid deployment. Drone security applications span, according to the company, airport security, critical infrastructure protection, VIP security, embassy protection and border security. In the beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) realm, UTM applications to be enabled by Mobile Skylight include: first responders (EMS, fire and police), precision agriculture, delivery, utility and infrastructure inspection, media and entertainment, mapping and surveying, construction and mining. In short, everywhere drones go, they will need to be tracked and managed. Mobile Skylight combines multiple technologies and an array of self-contained sensors, to serve as a mobile command center. The system is provided in a four-wheel drive van with off-road capabilities. It also integrates with third-party sensor inputs, and automatically records essential data for post-mission analysis and playback. Using a dual-band mesh network, Mobile Skylight is capable of forward deploying a multispectral suite of sensors. Its integrated radar has been designed for 3-D detection of low-flying, small UAS and general aviation at ranges out to 10 kilometers and 27 kilometers, respectively. The system has built-in target tracking and classification to help quickly identify cooperative and non-cooperative targets. It also tracks multiple, simultaneous targets, providing a comprehensive picture of the airspace. See related story, Traffic management systems for unmanned aircraft requested. Yeah, Heavy One novel application is heavy-lift drones for the construction and perhaps open-pit mining, quarrying and other weighty sectors. Griff Aviation, a Norwegian company that has set up a manufacturing plant in Florida, displayed its Super Heavy-Lift model, the Griff 300. Super Heavy-Lift Drone from Griff Aviation The GRIFF 300 is an unmanned aircraft with customizable payload options that make it suitable for a variety of professional applications. The company states that it can lift 225kg (496lbs) in addition to its own 75kg (165lbs) weight. It features a flight time of 30-45mins, depending on payload. “The next model that will be produced will be able to lift 800kg (1,764lbs). Then we will continue to increase lifting capacity even further,” said CEO Leif Johan Holand. Skylift Global drone prepping for flight. Several aisles over on the show floor, Skylift Global also featured a drone in the heavy lifting class.  “Current prototype is 100 pounds and carried an additional 100 pounds easy. Currently undergoing testing for up to 400 pounds,” says its CEO Amir Emadi. Skylift has signed agreements with companies in southern California to start deliveries of cold-chain logistics. Its heavy-lift capability can carry the added weight of refrigeration (think Amazon Fresh, says Emadi). Skylift also is in collaboration with JPL and Caltech to showcase a platform to DARPA for autonomous sense and avoid. Neither company has GPS aboard their workhorses yet but see no problem and plenty of opportunity in adding it as their business develops. Experienced GNSS Companies NovAtel had on display its range of high-precision GNSS receivers, antennas, and augmented systems for ground, marine and airborne unmanned applications. Its equipment meets requirements for military and commercial applications, and specific to UAV applications the company offered the OEM625S SAASM GPS+civil RTK receiver, GAJT anti-jam antennas, TerraStar PPP correction services and SPAN GNSS+INS for 3D position, attitude and velocity. The latter will be featured in the cover story of GPS World’s June issue, differentiating performance of various grades of IMUs in a tightly-coupled inertial/GNSS integration. Exploring IMU specifications and correlating them to performance of a final product can be daunting, as differences between MEMS sensors are not always apparent. The article will present achievable performances in fusion technology across a range of IMUs among the best in their respective performance categories. Spirent Communications took a dual approach, displaying what they termed an entry-level simulator (although fully upgradeable as needs develop) for UAV manufacturers who are new to GPS signal testing, and even the need for it. They also had on hand their fully configured GSS7000 for multi-frequency testing, also with a modular approach to enable the precision GNSS simulation system to expand with users’ needs. The GSS7000 series offers emulation of all civil GNSS systems and regional augmentation systems, and allows devices to be tested under a multitude of operating environments and error conditions, the company said. The GSS7000 has the flexibility to reconfigure satellite constellations, channels and frequencies between test runs or test cases. Four software control variants are offered.

It's Thursday evening here in Washington and after this crazy week I think we're all ready for Friday.    THE BIG STORIES Senate GOP targets insurer regs: Senate Republicans are looking for ways to toss out ObamaCare regulations that dictate what services must be covered by insurance plans. As The Hill's Peter Sullivan reports, Sen. John CornynJohn CornynFour candidates interviewing for FBI director job Saturday Cornyn, Gowdy on shortlist to replace Comey at FBI: report Where is the line between national security and economic prosperity? MORE (R-Texas) told reporters Thursday that Republican senators are looking into repealing the provision.  ObamaCare's essential health benefits mandate that insurance plans cover a minimum set of services, such as prescription drugs and mental healthcare. Republicans argue the mandate drives up costs. "I think we're going to leave it up to consumers to decide what they want to buy and what they need," Cornyn said.  But it is unclear whether Senate rules governing the fast-track reconciliation process being used by Republicans to repeal-and-replace ObamaCare would allow the essential health benefits mandate to be repealed. Reconciliation requires provisions be budget-related in order to be repealed using the process.  The House-passed ObamaCare repeal and replace bill includes an amendment that would let states seek waivers for the essential benefits mandate. But some conservatives are calling for states to be able to opt in to ObamaCare regulations, rather than opt out. Under that idea, a state could decide which ObamaCare regulations it wanted to keep or get rid of, including potentially essential health benefits as well as other provisions like community rating, which prevents insurers from charging premiums based on customers' health. Read Peter Sullivan's full story here.    Dems hit Treasury chief over banking regulator: Senate Democrats say a new banking regulator is inexperienced and hasn't been properly vetted, reports The Hill's Sylvan Lane. Six Senate Banking Committee Democrats told Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a letter Thursday that they were "deeply concerned" with his appointment of former Wall Street lawyer Keith Noreika to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) without Senate confirmation. "You have chosen to replace the current head with an acting head who is unvetted, has obvious conflicts of interest, and lacks the experience to run [OCC]," wrote the senators. The letter was signed by Banking Committee ranking member Sen.

Mnuchin appointed Noreika, who represented Wall Street banks as a lawyer at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, to be the OCC's first deputy earlier this month. Noreika's appointment lined him up to lead the OCC, which oversees the U.S. banking system, once Trump ousted former chief Thomas Curry. Trump removed Curry on May 5, making Noreika the interim OCC chief. His ascent is considered highly unusual, since Trump hasn't nominated a replacement for Curry yet and the interim chief is usually a veteran staff member, not a special government employee.

CPSC said emergency rooms treated 33,400 table saw-related injuries in 2015, and 92 percent were likely related to the victim making contact with the saw blade.  Under the proposed rule, manufacturers will have to limit how deep the saw can cut to 3.5 millimeters in tests when a fake human body part comes in contact with the spinning blade at a radial approach of 1 meter per second. The proposed rule would address an estimated 54,800 medically treated blade-contact injuries annually. The agency estimates the rule could produce annual benefits between $625 million to about $2.3 billion in injuries prevented. The rule is expected to cost industry between $170 million to $345 million annually. The public has 75 days to comment on the proposed rule.   NEWS RIGHT NOW  Liberal group: Trump 6th Circuit nominee 'incredibly troubling'  EPA chief: Obama was no 'environmental savior'  Lawsuits are piling up against Trump  Cable industry poll: Majority support net neutrality rules Pro-net neutrality group skeptical of FCC cyber attack claim Donald Trump has no idea what health insurance costs – Vox  U.S. judge in D.C. signals readiness to become third to order halt to revised Trump travel ban – The Washington Post  U.S. candymakers band together to reduce calories – Reuters    BY THE NUMBERS  7: Proposed rules  11: Final rules  (Source: Thursday's Federal Register.)   We'll work to stay on top of these and other stories throughout the week, so check The Hill's Regulation page (http://thehill.com/regulation) early and often for the latest.

By: Abhinaya Prabhu Updated: Friday, May 12, 2017, 7:20 [IST] There are three factors to consider to choose the right CPU and these are performance, price and power consumption. While the first two are major ones, the last one is not as important as those. You will be able to choose the right CPU only if you have a good understanding of your requirements and workload. It is for that reason that we have come up with this content on how you can choose the right CPU for your computer. Do take a look at the different factors involved in choosing a CPU from below. Workloads There are two types of workloads that are to be considered. One is single-threaded and the other is multi-threaded. Wondering what's the difference between the two? Single-threaded workloads involve simple tasks such as listening to music, word processing, browsing the web, etc. These are done better on CPUs with higher per-core dock speed and not by those that have many cores. When it comes to multi-threaded workloads, it includes tasks such as gaming, video encoding, photo editing, etc. These are usually handled well by processors that have multiple cores. There are technologies such as Intel's Hyperthreading that are designed to accelerate some multi-threaded workloads such as video editing and encoding by letting two threads to be executed on a single core interchangeably. Also read: Microsoft Windows 10 Creators Update is free: Here's how to download the update Some processors may involve many cores to handle the multi-threaded workloads, but these might give lesser results than expected. In fact, most consumer level software including games are not designed to be handled by multiple processor cores. It is for this reason that Intel despite being the largest maker of desktop CPUs refrains from making mainstream CPUs with more than four cores. Overclocking The other major factor that you need to consider is overclocking of the CPU. Overclocking is a process of increasing the processor's clock speed beyond its targeted limit. This often yields a considerable performance benefit, but not all CPUs can be overclocked. Those that can be overclocked need a special chipset and a motherboard that will make it expensive. In the case of Intel processors, you will need the more expensive K-series CPUs to benefit from overclocking and you will need a motherboard with the Z series chipset to overclock in an efficient way. On the other hand, the AMD processors are trickier as they can be overclocked. In simple terms, the expensive chipsets can be overclocked in a better way than their inexpensive peers, but you need to ensure that there is a motherboard to support overclocking. As a downside, overclocking results in increased heat as well as power consumption. Power Consumption Now comes the last factor - power consumption. Though this is not a primary concern while choosing a CPU, it needs to be kept in mind if you indeed to overclock. The faster the processor, the higher will be the power consumption. As the power consumption increases, the concerns regarding noise and cooling will also increase. Though there are stock cooling fans to handle these issues, these work fine only with the stock processor speeds. If the processor is overclocked, then this fan becomes inadequate. Eventually, you will have to invest in cooler for the laptop so that the additional heat that is generated due to overclocking is handled better. Taking a decision Once you are aware of your needs, then you need to browse through the lists of best CPUs in the market based on your requirements. On analyzing the above mentioned factors, you will be able to come to a conclusion of what kind of needs you have.

Owens Published: May 12, 2017 12:16 p.m. ET Share Analysts cheer new data-center processor, investors send Nvidia market cap past $75 billion Nvidia The Tesla V100 chip is the result of $3 billion in R&D expenses, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang said Wednesday. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor Shares of Nvidia Corp. established record highs for a second consecutive session Thursday, after analysts cheered the chip maker’s new data-center offering that Chief Executive Jensen Huang called “the most expensive computer project the world has ever done.” At the keynote address of Nvidia’s NVDA, +1.10%  annual GPU Technology Conference on Wednesday, Huang showed off the new Tesla Volta server processor architecture, the latest offering for Nvidia’s booming data-center business. He highlighted the gigantic expense of developing the Tesla V100 chip, which leverages Nvidia’s recent advances in deep learning. “The R&D budget was $3 billion and this is the first one, so if anyone would like to buy it, the price is $3 billion,” Hung said while holding the first V100 off the assembly line. Lots of fancy stats about Tesla Volta V100 processor. I like the $3 billion number, but programmers will like this:https://t.co/1L5Q9BddKs— Jeremy C. Owens (@jowens510) May 10, 2017 The Volta unveiling was one of the highlights of Nvdia’s GTC conference, which has grown in stature as the Silicon Valley company has become a leader in artificial intelligence, which it is marketing for data centers, high-performance computing and autonomous vehicles. Huang also announced a new partnership with one of the world’s largest car makers, Toyota Motor Corp. TM, -0.36%  , to incorporate the Drive PX platform into future Toyota self-driving automobiles. Huang’s speech came a day after Nvidia’s quarterly earnings report, which sent the stock to its second-largest one-day gain of all time as well as intraday and closing record highs as analysts frantically raised price targets. Shares gained another 4.3% to more records Thursday after analysts again praised the company for its new data-center offering and other efforts announced at GTC, sending Nvidia’s market capitalization higher than $75 billion for the first time. Nvidia’s market cap is now approaching chip companies like Qualcomm Corp. QCOM, +1.17%  and Texas Instruments Inc. TXN, +0.36%  , both of which are valued at roughly $81 billion. Nvidia stock is now up more than 250% in the past year, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.15%  has increased 16% in the same time. RBC Capital Markets raised its price target on Nvidia to $150 from $138 on Thursday afternoon, thanks to “increased confidence around data-center growth” after an event for analysts at GTC. Analyst Mitch Steves also said he thinks total artificial-intelligence applications can grow faster than even the current rise for Nvidia’s server business, potentially at a rate of more than 200%. “For data center, we see no slowdown in sight and believe the segment can continue its torrid triple-digit growth in 2017 and beyond,” wrote Steves, who has an outperform rating on the stock. Don’t miss: Nvidia surges as AI drives deeper into the cloud In its session with analysts, Nvidia said that the total addressable market for its server chips will grow to $30 billion by 2020, giving plenty of opportunity for more growth. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts were skeptical of that figure, noting it is 60% larger than Intel Corp.’s INTC, -0.45%  industry-leading data-center group, but said they would “take some time to analyze the feasibility of such a ramp.” Still, Nvidia’s GTC presentations convinced those analysts on two important points. “While AI technology is nascent today, it will likely become pervasive in the future in fields ranging from transportation to medicine to security to finance, and Nvidia’s massive parallel architecture that forms the basis for GPUs makes the company uniquely (perhaps luckily) positioned to lead with technology (from chips to software to systems) to support the rapid growth of AI,” they wrote, while maintaining a hold rating and $124 price target. See also: Nvidia proves why it is the hottest stock on Wall Street J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur has a similar view of the company, maintaining a $122 price target and hold rating based on his belief that shares are “fully priced at current levels” while seeing a large growth opportunity. “We expect the data-center segment to grow strongly going forward as hyperscale customers continue to embrace GPU-accelerated deep learning for processing large data sets,” Sur wrote Thursday morning. “We are encouraged by strength in the automotive and enterprise segments as well, although strong adoption of autonomous driving in the market remains to be seen.” Sur called the Toyota partnership a “significant win,” and Susquehanna Financial Group’s Christopher Rolland concurred by calling it a “big win” that should be viewed as a negative for Mobileye NV MBLY, +0.00%  and its eventual owner, Intel. Pacific Crest Securities analysts also mentioned a threat to Intel, but in the data-center field. “Nvidia is actively touting its Tesla GPUs as able to replace hundreds of traditional servers with only CPUs in terms of deep learning computing performance, according to its internal estimates,” they wrote. “This could become a headwind to Intel’s DCG business until it releases its Crest family of AI chips.” Pacific Crest retained an underweight rating on Nvidia with a $99 price target, while Susquehanna maintained a neutral rating and $110 target.

Shlain, whose eye-opening Shatterbox film 50/50 illuminates history’s often-overlooked female leaders, created the event to inspire activists from across the world to bring vital dialogues about this ongoing battle back to the places where change matters most: their homes, offices, schools, and everywhere in between. With a little help from powerhouse celebs like Eva Longoria and tireless organizations ranging from Intel to NARAL Pro-Choice, 50/50 Day spurred a conversation about women's rights that crossed continents and cultural barriers, fueled by screenings of Shlain's film, discussion groups, and a 24-hour panel that linked participants in their joined advocacy for equality. Ahead, check out the myriad ways 50/50 Day pushed this essential fight forward. And don't forget to visit Shlain's website for more information about how to join the global initiative. Advertisement 1 of 8 50/50 Day was all about connecting global communities to consider the concrete steps we can take to advance the cause of gender equality. With 11,020 gatherings worldwide, the event activated thinkers, leaders, and organizers in 65 countries with an urgent call for change, challenging them to brainstorm the ways they can protect women's rights. 2 of 8 Eva Longoria spoke out about the Latina wage gap and how education can be one of the most powerful tools for progress. As we learned from her game-changing op-ed, more than 25% of Latinas live in poverty — a socio-economic disenfranchisement that impacts women leaders from boardrooms to Congress. Yet by working to close the gender divide permeating the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, Longoria charts new avenues for women of color to increase their power and representation. This is especially important since the tech industry will have 1.1 million job openings by 2024, with more than half lacking the skilled workers to fill them. By investing in programs that bring Latina women to the burgeoning world of STEM studies, the Eva Longoria Foundation is committed to breaking the cycle of poverty that keeps female students from having a real seat at the table. 3 of 8 Refinery29 hosted a live discussion about gender equality with a group of the media world's most diverse feminist thought leaders. Moderated by our own Ashley Ford, this panel brought together renowned advertising exec Cindy Gallop, CNN political commentator Sally Kohn, media blogger Rachel Sklar, and entrepreneur Dee Poku for a ground-breaking conversation about the real steps women can take to change the ways we're treated at work and represented across our culture. 4 of 8 We also launched a wage-gap calculator in partnership with WIP — to help you know your worth and demand more.

As Councilwoman Blondell Reynolds Brown (pictured) told Refinery29, "we will not have true equality until women achieve parity with men in earning power and potential. Many women remain clustered in occupations considered 'women’s jobs' — clerical work, nursing, and many caring professions. When compared to jobs traditionally held by men that require similar levels of education training and experience, women’s work always pays less, simply because it is women who are doing the work. In fact, women earn less than men in every occupational classification for which data is available." Reynolds Brown also emphasized the importance of increasing the number of powerful women holding office and participating in politics; how else can we guarantee access to abortion, contraception, equal pay, and fair representation? Advertisement 6 of 8 The fact that Hispanic women make as little as 54% of what men doing the same job earn gives us the urge to scream about wage inequality from the rooftops, so we did just that — with a billboard in the heart of Time Square. Partnering with the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (NARAL), Refinery29 brought the staggering truths of the pay gap to 43rd and Broadway, where our beautiful sign educated pedestrians about the distance we still have to go to ensure fair compensation.

Check out our #WeWantMore initiative here. 7 of 8 Salt Lake City's Leonardo Da Vinci Museum hosted multiple showings of 50/50 and celebrated the opening of its latest exhibit, Human Rights Gallery: Woman/Women, with targeted discussions for female leaders. The museum also invited students from the Salt Lake City Public School District for lunch and further conversations, and even featured comments from Mayor Jackie Biskupski and one of 50/50's executive producers, Jacki Zehner, who runs Women Moving Millions. 8 of 8 Shlain also teamed up with Six Word Memoirs, The Intentional Creatives Guild, and Big Picture Arts to turn 50/50 Day's social media campaign into a live art installation in downtown Oakland, California. People from all over the world used Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to send in their six words that outlined what a gender-balanced world looked like to them. They then printed these out and wrote them onto a billboard, which will be displayed in downtown Oakland for several months.

About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Reply ↓ russell1200 May 12, 2017 at 8:49 am Most State AGs can only go after civil penalties. New York is one of the (very) big exceptions. So having the State AGs leading the charge was always problematic at best. They had a hammer, civil penalties, and that’s what they used. Criminal indictments would have had to come from somewhere else. Reply ↓ Stormcrow May 12, 2017 at 10:23 am Independent Probe: The Game Plan The Democratic game plan is evident Sic Semper Tyrannis 11 May 2017 It is not going to be possible to remove President Trump from office by declaring him unfit for office. … The next best possibility from the POV of the “resistance,” (with HC and the mookies in the lead?) is impeachment and trial in the senate. … Essential to this course of action is the campaign for Congressional investigations, an independent prosecutor or a commission to investigate and “expose” Trump’s treason and malfeasance in office. … Once this is accomplished the Republican weaklings in the senate could perhaps be intimidated into conviction. http://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/2017/05/the-democratic-game-plan-is-evident.html#comments The thread is worth reading.

Reply ↓ Rik May 12, 2017 at 7:38 am You may have missed this one from David Roberts at Vox. Seems the best analysis of Trump to date. 40 tweets in all; ones that stand out are no.9 and no. 26. I’ll just quote no. 9 here: 9. Here’s the thing: Trump, by all indications, does not have beliefs, intentions, etc. that are stable, persistent across contexts. See also Heidi N.

Another psychiatric assessment from 140 word from all of 40 tweets. /snark Reply ↓ jrs May 12, 2017 at 12:30 pm it’s moderately interesting, not bad for a twitter stream. One can criticize twitter as a means of communication, it short circuits full evaluation the message IMO, but we have Presidency by tweet at this point so … the medium is the presidency .. So call it speculation. I don’t think we can always fully know the motive of the powerful, though many will write books on it. Was Obama evil, corrupt, just not too bright? I don’t know. His actions like drone killing were harmful. And the same is true of Trump, his policies are harmful, only in spades and getting worse by the day.

Reply ↓ reslez May 12, 2017 at 2:00 pm You can’t judge Trump from his words. He contradicts himself too much. I agree with Roberts’ argument that Trump is highly focused on appearing dominant at all times. That was how he crushed his opponents in the Republican primary. “Low energy” Jeb, “Little” Marco. Primary voters loved that. They ate it up. To properly evaluate Trump you have to disregard his statements — he disregards them too. The only metric for Trump is what he does. And 5 months into his first term, his actions show he’s either failing or declining to do what he campaigned on. What disturbs me most is Trump pushing for the AHCA. It shows a total lack of awareness, an investment in the mendacious Republican party line. This is not a man who’s going to get re-elected. Trump actions: Withdrew from TPP Failed to ban Muslims Increased military spending 10% while pushing cuts to Medicaid Nominated Gorsuch Bombed Syria Heightened tensions in North Korea Expanded bombings and troops in America’s multiple, failed, on-going wars Pushed terrible AHCA through House Fired Flynn and Comey (The reasons behind them we can’t evaluate, because that would require examining Trump’s unreliable statements. However, Flynn is a nutjob who wanted to bomb Iran and Comey had it coming) So far the evidence is that Trump’s instincts on foreign and economic policy are pretty awful, that he has no intention of abiding by his campaign promises, and that he’s not competent enough to execute on most of his goals.

Other industries became victims of technological progress, such as the demise of the American Locomotive Company and later Kodak.  The local, state, federal governments played no small role in killing industry in NYC. The feds closed the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1966 killing thousands of industrial jobs, the state (Nelson) wasted enormous sums of money on Empire State Plaza, Roosevelt Island, and other boondoggles rather than on industrial infrastructure, while the city did all it could to zone industry out of Lower Manhattan and the waterfronts of both Manhattan and Brooklyn. The only industries still going strong in NYC are grift, propaganda, and artisanal pickle making. And the Prisons. More on how NY led the way on that at: Prison Industrial Complex Here in Upstate Hudson Valley NY there are also all the prisons which seem to be a main source of work. When I mentioned that we had 1/5th the world’s population and incarcerate more people than Russia or China to a local, he was surprised.

Reply ↓ Montanamaven May 12, 2017 at 2:49 pm Montana has always been a colony rather than an industrialized state like Maine or New York with their good ports for transport of goods easily. I first heard Montana described as a colony by Brian Schweitzer when he was running for the Senate in 2002. We export lumber, copper, coal and cattle and have to import most food and dry goods. Hence, a colony. He ran in 2002 and then successfully for Governor in 2004 on trying to bring industry like furniture making and slaughter houses to Montana. He wanted our own health care system like our neighbor to the North. He became popular for driving bus loads of Seniors across the border to Canada for cheaper medicine.

It is not a presidential system but the party leader seemingly has to have the expected presidential persona. We had that with Blair and that got us Afghanistan and Iraq. Of course, Trump has knocked “presidential” into a cocked hat – and a very entertaining one at that. I think that the main issue is that Corbyn got his position as leader in a non-traditional manner – voted in by the party membership – not by the Labour Party members of parliament – the people he has got to wrangle if Labour does win power. Legitimacy is in question. The interesting thing for me in comparing the British scene with the US system is that us Brits know exactly who the political leaders are. Who leads the Dem.s now? Don’t tell me who it is in the congress or senate, or potential presidential candidates, but who the Leader is. Reply ↓ Altandmain May 12, 2017 at 10:44 am Strictly if you think about it, Labour’s way of voting in by membership is more democratic than Parliament members of Labour.

Reply ↓ PlutoniumKun May 12, 2017 at 8:39 am I can’t explain it entirely, but I don’t think its too hard to understand in broad terms. I think Sanders is something of a genius communicator, with an ability to de-idiologize contraversial ideas without ever pandering, patronising, or over-simplifying. And he’s a sort of loveable grandfather figure who is hard, even for opponents, to dislike (it seems that even the Republicans who have dealt with him in the Senate like him personally). Attempts to demonise him by the media have failed miserably because quite simply, he comes across much nicer than the people attacking him. He has also been politically smart enough to sidestep issues which label him in regular peoples mind with classic urban liberalism, such as gun control, abortion, etc. Corbyn, on the other hand, seems incapable of breaking out of the mould of the ideological lefty backroom operator, always breaking into jargon when he should be explaining things clearly. He has wasted too much political capital on issues with matter a lot with the left, but don’t resonate with the public (such as nuclear disarmament). His incoherence on issues like Brexit have turned off many potential supporters. He does not come across on TV as particularly likeable. His personal traits, such as his casual dress and cycling everywhere therefore comes off as wierd and stubborn, rather than rather loveable eccentricities as they would if they were done by Sanders. So attacks on him by the media have stuck in the way they’ve just bounced off Sanders. Personality really does matter. Just look at the Clintons – they are true partners in everything they have done politically, but BC’s personality makes him hard to dislike even for those who hate much of what he did, while HRC’s personality (or lack of one) attracts a level of bile (especially from the left) that Bill rarely had to face. I know people ascribe it to misogyny, but I think this is simplistic. Bill, like Sanders, has a likeable personality, HRC and Corbyn for various reasons don’t. It would be nice to say that only policies should matter, not personalities, but there are plenty of psychological studies which show that even very informed people can be swayed by people they like and respect far more than they can be by rational arguments put forward by people who they don’t like. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner May 12, 2017 at 9:20 am A few thoughts on polls: -pollsters create expectations of the electorate often missing non-governmental phenomenons. Polling in 2016 was based on expectations of a 2008 turnout ignoring changes in 2010, 2012, and 2014. Brexit’s surprise was largely a surprise because of expectations created by pollsters who used previous election data to set a baseline instead of calling a representation of the populace and breaking it down from there. -position of questions in polls. People who stay on the phone longer are looking to give the correct answer which is “yes.” I believe this is why Obama and Clinton remained personally popular while their party’s fortunes soured. -polls also suffer from constantly changing political titles such as “liberal. ” Democrats pointed to Obama’s popularity with self described “liberal Democrats” to paint lefty or liberal critics as not a problem for their electoral fortunes. About personality, Bill Clinton had 43% of the vote and saw noticeable decline in youth and minority voting in 1992 and 1996 when the GOP faced major conservative defections to a third party or non voting. Perhaps, Bill was never that popular and was entirely reliant on Team Blue tribal loyalty? After all, he lost majorities, and his VP and wife have now lost three times in their quest for the White House. Narratives about the real Hillary who was very liberal seem to be flat out rejections of Bill even by loyalists.

Also, the symbolic monarch being a glorified celebrity is actually cheaper than the President’s pomp.

Meanwhile the dethroned Clintonites take all their loyalists in the press with them and spend most of their waking hours whining to them. Continue for two years, then stir. Also we shouldn’t forget that Corbyn’s foreign policy is far outside the mainstream whereas Sanders still signs AIPAC letters from time to time.

Reply ↓ Jeff W May 12, 2017 at 6:06 pm The short answer that Corbyn takes more of an anti-imperialist stance than Sanders does. Corbyn (rightly or wrongly) advances foreign policy positions that are unpopular in addition to—or, perhaps, ahead of—taking positions on domestic economic issues that are popular with his base. Reply ↓ JohnnyGL May 13, 2017 at 12:45 am I wanted to shoot a quick “thank you” comment to those who chimed in on my question from this morning. I think it’s an interesting one because there may be possible lessons that can be learned from the relatives successes and failures that we see from Sanders and Corbyn. Some of the highlights for me were: Darius and Carolinian pointing out that the Dems would have McGovern-ed Sanders pretty hard, had he won the nomination. And if he won the presidency, I think they would have Carter-ed him, too. AbateMagic pointed to contextual difference in party structure, asking who leads political parties in the US, and questioned what it means to be a ‘leader’ and be ‘presidential’. PlutoniumKun says it’s at least partially personal and Sanders is more charismatic. JeffW and generic pointed to foreign policy differences, Corbyn being much more overtly anti-imperialist. I’ll put my thoughts below: 1) generic also pointed out that Corbyn won and Sanders didn’t. I think this is right that it makes him more of a lightning rod for the establishment. Corbyn grabbed(or maybe was handed) control of a major political party. That means the establishment smells danger. For Corbyn, himself, I get the feeling he didn’t really have a plan he was prepared to implement as he’s spent so much time as an activist and protest candidate. The same might have happened to Sanders, had he triumphed. 2) PlutoniumKun is right about personal differences. He might be onto something with the point about Corbyn talking about nuclear arms giving the vibe that he’s a bit out of touch. Sanders is clearly a grandmaster of kitchen table issues. He’s been incredible with his ability to maintain focus on what he sees as the important stuff like higher wages, publicly funded higher education and healthcare. Without Sanders, the news would be all palace politics about Russia investigations and inside baseball in congress and in Trump’s team (of course, it still is, but Sanders just keeps hammering away). I actually think Sanders repeated disappointment on foreign policy issues partially comes from his incredible focus on the stuff that he’s confident in. I also think Sanders is more of a deal-maker who sits on the periphery, but is still influential and knows how to score understated, but important victories (like on ACA). Sanders immediately found himself in a very comfortable position after the election. He was still on the periphery, but much less so and now had more of a brand and a bigger megaphone. He clearly observed that what he was doing in 2016 was working and decided that he needed to do more of it. It’s still working. 3) Societal context. I think the skimpier welfare state in the USA, especially the massive student debt problem creates circumstances where someone like Sanders finds a more receptive audience. 4) The Trump factor creates fractured opposition whereas Corbyn is up against the entire British establishment. I think this is working to Sanders’ advantage here. Trump derangement syndrome is clearly a real thing and is deeply corroding the brain power of coastal media elites that cheer for team blue. They still haven’t come to grips with the reality that they lost to Trump and are obsessed with the idea of impeachment as a way of cutting short this ongoing ego-bruising they’re having to endure. It’s like Dems are okay with losing to another Bush or even an unelected Pence, but losing to Trump is an insult and an affront that they still can’t handle. This makes the Dem elite look more foolish to the public and reinforces the notion that they’re out of touch. To counteract this, they need to keep Sanders no more than arm’s length away because they quietly, reluctantly have to admit to themselves that they need Sanders’ voters to win elections, at least while they continue their long term project of lusting after wealthy suburban republican voters. Whenever it looks like Sanders is getting the better of the elites of team Dem, the knives come out for Sanders again. However, it doesn’t seem to be denting the popularity of Sanders. Corbyn is in a much tougher set of circumstances. Blairites in the Labor Party are, for the moment, happy to sabotage their own party as they focus on regaining control. They seem perfectly comfortable with May as PM and don’t mind waiting their turn. It’s too early to say Corbyn is failing. We’ll get a better read after the election, but facing a united British establishment is a much more difficult task.

A country under the gold standard is not a full monetary sovereign – but it keeps its own currency. A Eurozone member lacks both sovereignty and a currency. That makes it much more a type of inmate of a prison with no exit than would be the case under gold. Reply ↓ John k May 12, 2017 at 5:16 pm I fear it. Recessions prior to 1933 were depressions. GD was neither the longest or deepest in the previous century. Recession/ depression happened every 3.5 years. Banks and deposits can’t be saved… liquidate, liquidate, liquidate was the only solution, offering great opportunities to those not extended in the previous expansion. Totally disastrous system. And country size does not matter, if you can’t save the banks and depositors every few years you get routine chaos. During GD farmers were very near armed insurrection. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 12, 2017 at 9:39 pm During the Great Depression, the government removed gold from the private sector. FDR should have distributed gold from Fort Knox. Also, part of the reason for bank runs was not deposit insurance. If the government wants to give you and me gold, we should not fear that. Reply ↓ financial matters May 12, 2017 at 10:49 am Yes, agree that that’s nonsense. But Stephanie Kelton wasn’t even able to get through to Bernie Sanders. Also would be nice for Tulsi Gabbard to adopt a more MMT oriented economic stance. (understanding that money is available for useful projects.) Naomi Klein made it clear that political progress isn’t all that useful without economic progress. Wealth inequality should be one of the major themes for progressives.

Ron Paul is largely the reason I ended up here at NC. Back when he ran in 2012, was the first time I was really exposed to non-mainstream worldviews especially on foreign policy and that was because Ron Paul actually said (and I think more importantly) believed in an alternative to imperialism and reached a mainstream audience (me) with those views. That led me to Greenwald back when he was at the fairly decent Rusbridger Era guardian. And from there I wound my way from Washingtonblog and zerohedge, to here. While I now disagree with most of Paul’s economic views, his foreign policy is still amazing, and without his impetus I’m wary to think about where I might be on the political spectrum.

Maybe I’m wrong. https://brandnewcongress.org/plan Basically, we want to do what we have to do as a country and remove ‘politically impossible’ as a reason not to do it. It will take at least until 2020 to achieve all of that, but the first step is to achieve a majority in the House and win as many of the 33 seats up for re-election in the Senate as possible in 2018. Our plan to accomplish this is to recruit over 400 extraordinary ordinary Americans to challenge both Democrats and Republicans in congressional primary races across the country in order to replace almost all of Congress in one fell swoop. These will be people who have track records of integrity and service in their communities and who are not all career politicians — we’re looking for nurses, teachers, engineers, scientists, factory workers, and so on. They will represent not just all the various professions in our country (unlike our current Congress which represents mostly lawyers), but also be representative of our population’s demographics — more than half of them will be women and we will have just representation for people of color. Every candidate we recruit, regardless of party, will be a firm believer in the Brand New Congress platform and pledge to work to enact it once elected to office. Reply ↓ Lambert Strether Post authorMay 12, 2017 at 2:27 pm I don’t see Justice Democrats adopting this strategy at all.

In regional dialects the words for “eight” and “fortune” are also similar, e.g., Cantonese “baat3” and “faat3”. The word is also phonetically similar to the word for a hundred (百), alluding to greater wealth. Note as well, this particular symbol matches the mathematical symbol of infinity. While Chinese does have other words for luck, this full understanding of luck that includes the infinity concept marries into a Chinese understanding of this particular word. There is also a visual resemblance between two digits, “88”, and 囍, the “shuāng xĭ” (“double joy”), a popular decorative design composed of two stylized characters 喜 (“xĭ” meaning “joy” or “happiness”). The number 8 is viewed as such an auspicious number that even being assigned a number with several eights is considered very lucky. In 2003, A telephone number with all digits being eights was sold for CN¥2.33 million (approximately US$280,000) to Sichuan Airlines in Chengdu, China.[2] The opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Beijing began on 8/8/08 at 8 seconds and 8 minutes past 8 pm local time (UTC+08).[3] China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia and Singapore use the time zone UTC+08:00. A man in Hangzhou offered to sell his license plate reading A88888 for ¥1.12 million (roughly $164,000).[3] A Chinese man in Las Vegas purchased bulb #8 and #88 from the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign on 8/8/2008. The Petronas Twin Towers in Malaysia each have 88 floors. The minivan that GM makes for the Chinese market is called the Buick GL8, but the minivans it sold in other countries didn’t have that name. The Air Canada route from Shanghai to Toronto is Flight AC88. The KLM route from Hong Kong to Amsterdam is Flight KL888. The Etihad Airways route from Abu Dhabi to Beijing then onwards to Nagoya is Flight EY888. The United Airlines route from Beijing to San Francisco is Flight UA888, the route from Beijing to Newark is Flight UA88, and the route from Chengdu to San Francisco is Flight UA8. The Air Astana route from Beijing to Almaty is Flight KC888. The British Airways route from Chengdu to London is Flight BA88. One of Cathay Pacific’s flight numbers from Hong Kong to Vancouver and New York is CX888. Singapore Airlines reserves flight numbers beginning with the number 8 to routes in China. SriLankan Airlines reserves flight numbers beginning with the number 8 to routes in China. The US Treasury has sold 70,000 dollar bills with serial numbers that contain 4 eights.[4] Boeing delivered the 8,888th 737 to come off the production line to Xiamen Airlines. The airplane, a Next-Generation 737-800, features a special livery commemorating the airplane’s significance.[5] In Singapore, a breeder of rare Dragon fish (Asian Arowana) (which are “lucky fish” and being a rare species, are required to be microchipped), makes sure to use numbers with plenty of eights in their microchip tag numbers, and appears to reserve particular numbers especially rich in eights and sixes (e.g., 702088880006688) for particularly valuable specimens.[6][7] As part of grand opening promotions, a Commerce Bank branch in New York’s Chinatown raffled off safety deposit box No. 888. An “auspicious” numbering system was adopted by the developers of 39 Conduit Road Hong Kong, where the top floor was “88” – Chinese for double fortune. It is already common in Hong Kong for ~4th floors not to exist; there is no requirement by the Buildings Department for numbering other than that it being “made in a logical order.”[8] A total of 43 intermediate floor numbers are omitted from 39 Conduit Road: those missing include 14, 24, 34, 54, 64, all floors between 40 and 49; the floor number which follows 68 is 88. Similar to the common Western practice of using “9” for price points, it is common to see “8” being used in its place to achieve the same psychological effect. So for example menu prices like $58, $88 are frequently seen. You wouldn’t expect a socialist country to be so superstitious as to open the Olympics at a certain time.

Usually I hear something between $50 and $100 seems reasonable. The mental math going on here is that you have to pay something in order to get a plan that will cover doctor visits and hospital trips and prescription drugs. They know, from their experience, that health coverage is not as cheap as $15, and have more realistic assumptions than the one Trump makes in this answer. Is she seriously suggesting that $50 or $100 per month is more “realistic” than $15, or that obamacare defenders, who routinely ignore un-meetable deductibles and narrowing networks, do have “an idea what health insurance ‘costs’?” This is just pure piling-on, which seems to be preferable, these days, to making substantive, constructive suggestions that might actually address the issues.

Look at Pelosi, Feinstein, and Waters in recent days. 77, 83, and 78. You can see their anger over Trump, but they don’t seem to be as credible as they used to be. Pelosi unlike most Congress Critters has a real job in Speaker. She actually has to do stuff everyday. She works for 180 or so people in a way. I checked this yesterday, but if ballotpedia is up to date, Waters is serving on one committee the last few years. A 77 year old run that is serious and not Mike Gravel style (which was awesome) would be a terrible idea. Assume Bernie Sanders will not run for President unless he is suffering from old age’s effect on the mind. If Bernie had not been actively searching for people to run against Hillary, his eventual run might have been easy to dismiss as an old man. Given Sanders almost did it, it would be best if he wasn’t encouraged. He’s a Senator. Hes still a narcissist. Sanders age was a legitimate concern in the Spring of last year, just not next to a 69 year old. Hillary’s mother (how old was she? 147?) was alive in 2008 if I recall, and she seemed alert on tv. That alone probably diffused question about Hillary’s age this cycle. Reply ↓ marym May 12, 2017 at 12:11 pm It’s extremely important IMO to reference HR 676 and to keep concepts like public financing, public administration, and not-for-profit in the discussion. HR 676 addresses most of the mostly false or alarmist trolling of single payer, for example. in today’s Health Affairs “Premium Support” post, the claim that it would raise taxes (without analyzing the kinds of taxes or savings on out-of-pocket costs, or claiming it wouldn’t be as good as employer based coverage). In addition HR 676 has provisions for salary continuation and priority job placement for insurance company workers; migration of private provider entities to strictly public or non-profit; and price negotiation. All are much better grounds for discussion than just a reference to single payer. Sanders has introduced a bill in the past that was similar to HR 676, but with some differences. One was that it was a state-by-state plan, not a national plan. I think during the presidential campaign he may have been persuaded to change his recommendation to a national plan. Reply ↓ Elizabeth Burton May 12, 2017 at 3:32 pm My thoughts on Bernie’s wanting his own bill in the Senate is that having two provides more wiggle room. It also keeps the opposition having to expend time, effort, and money attacking two targets, which might not be a bad thing. Finally, given the ratios of GOP to Dems in both houses, he may be thinking that if 676 gets shot down in flames, there’s still a chance of finding enough courageous moderate Republicans fearful of losing their seats to help support it.

We only have about 200 years of topsoil left, 1inch of topsoil takes 100-500 years to form naturally (if you are bringing in soil or anything external to the area of degradation you are not renewing you are externalizing).

Reply ↓ Jim Haygood May 12, 2017 at 10:18 am Jihad on Drugs redux: Attorney General Jeff Sessions overturned the sweeping criminal charging policy of former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. and directed his federal prosecutors Thursday to charge defendants with the most serious, provable crimes carrying the most severe penalties. The Holder memo, issued in August 2013, instructed his prosecutors to avoid charging certain defendants with drug offenses that would trigger long mandatory minimum sentences. Defendants who met a set of criteria such as not belonging to a large-scale drug trafficking organization, gang or cartel, qualified for lesser charges — and in turn less prison time — under Holder’s policy. But Sessions’s new charging policy, outlined in a two-page memo and sent to more than 5,000 assistant U.S. attorneys across the country and all assistant attorneys general in Washington, orders prosecutors to “charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense” and rescinds Holder’s policy immediately. http://tinyurl.com/n3j57lh What a horror: fill the Gulag to bursting; bust up families; ruin lives — all to act out Ku Klux Jeff’s medieval fanaticism regarding forbidden substances.

Some cock-ups are inevitable for a completely new party, of course, but these mistakes are bound to have an impact on Macron’s image: he has so far been uncritically presented by the media as a kind of boy-wonder savior of the nation. The interesting point is Bayrou though. There was a lot of speculation at the time of his declaration of support for Macron about what he was getting in exchange. As of today, it looks like nothing at all. Had Bayrou run in the first round, he might well have peeled off enough of Macron’s support to stop the young chap getting into round two. It now looks as if Macron has stiffed him, just as he hung Valls out to dry. This looks like turning into a government of Me, Myself and I.

Somehow, by disregarding that advice, owning a few shares in the company one slaves for will stop jobs from being shipped overseas? Does he believe the government should nationalize banks or drug companies? Reply ↓ jrs May 12, 2017 at 12:59 pm There is a difference between owning a few shares and ownership. Employee ownership would be full ownership. It’s true employee stock plans might be just a few token shares (which may or may not be a good investment for an employee, but have absolutely nothing to do with ownership and control). So equating employee ownership with ESOP, as these proposals might, doesn’t seem to make sense. Nationalizing banks and drug companies isn’t even designed to address the same issue that employee ownership is, which is working conditions, not the whole of every possible thing that might be wrong with the economic system (including externalities), but primarily the workers powerlessness in this economic system. Something nationalizing banks and drug companies might not do (they still might be terrible places to work afterall). It’s true worker owned businesses are a very small part of the economy, which is a decent reason for some skepticism IMO. But maybe favorable bills could help as long as they aren’t equivocating between owning a few shares and real daily control over the business. Because worker owned businesses do I think need some government help to become a larger share of the economy. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 12, 2017 at 1:41 pm I ask the questions because the economy is dominated by big corporations. Is it possible for workers to have full ownership of Apple, Amazon or Chase bank by buying shares themselves? It’s good the corner pizza place is employee owned and I will do business there. The real impact is with the big companies, who will send jobs overseas. If workers had the money, why hadn’t they bought up Amazon already? I can see a socialist or communist government nationalize a humongous corporation and turn it over to the workers. Reply ↓ Jeff W May 12, 2017 at 7:49 pm “It’s true worker owned businesses are a very small part of the economy…” In the US, worker-owned businesses have very little support, politically or financially. In Italy, by contrast, the Marcora Law allows a group of ten unemployed workers to receive a lump sum of money as capital for a cooperative, instead of the monthly payments they could receive as individuals. As a result, two out of every three people in the Emilia Romagna region of northern Italy belong to worker coops which produce about one-third of that region’s GDP. (I’m not sure what to make of the fact that two-thirds of the workers produce one-third of the GDP.)

The short version — [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1fqRigFtTw]. Chomsky the linguistics professor has been speaking to punctuate his concepts of the innate capabilities of the human cognition coupled with the theme how innate capabilities are innate limitations on what we can truly know and understand. There are several hour plus lectures on youtube exploring these themes and calling attention to recent work substantiating what is one of Chomsky’s life works. I haven’t been able to parse it all yet but what I have grasped is extremely intriguing — relating to questions of consciousness, AI, what makes us human and how remarkably recent and homogeneous humankind is relative to other creatures. “What happened in the origin of human consciousness?” [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.b.10041/full] “The precedence of syntax in the rapid emergence of human language in evolution as defined by the integration hypothesis” [https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00271] “Language as a Critical Factor in the Emergence of Human Cognition” [http://www.humanamente.eu/PDF/Issue27_Papers_Tattersall.pdf] Reply ↓ Susan the other May 12, 2017 at 1:48 pm I really enjoyed that article/research too. And yes, reading it was like incipient brain damage – because I didn’t have the words! But I got the drift. I suspect the origin of human consciousness is just finding the right word ;-). When it said that “ancestries (variations in genes) fluctuated but remained distinct long enough to correlate with language” I thought that was the coolest sentence I had almost ever read. And the conclusion to all those correlations was to point out that evolution of the genome is kinda socio-cultural. So which came first, the gene variation or the word? Hmmm.

I think lack of trust leads to inequality, not the other way around (or maybe they reinforce each other, but I think lack of trust comes first). In that case, what causes lack of trust? Trust but verify. If you verify, you don’t need trust. If everything is written down and verified, you don’t need trust. When you are Robin Hood and men in tights, you have to be able to trust each other. In simpler times, there is more trust. When the other guys are too learned, too educated, you have to be careful…well, you have to respect them…their chess moves…Not simpler times, less trust…but more smart men. Reply ↓ Jeff W May 12, 2017 at 9:35 pm I’m not sure that lack of trust leads to inequality but inequality can leads to lack of trust in the following way: Person A has more money, time, resources than person B. In given situation, A can “spend more” to arrange the contingencies so that the outcome favors A (or is adverse to B) than he might otherwise if A and B were on an equal footing. So, for example, the Koch brothers can spend more to get the outcomes they favor than you (presumably) or I can. They can “buy outcomes” where, ostensibly, the outcome is something that is determined by that is not subject to buying, i.e., one person/one vote. I’m not so sure, in a theoretical sense, you need to actually see something like the influence that the Koch brothers have on affecting outcomes for trust to be eroded. It might be that just the presence of the inequality (in the absence of some countervailing force, like publicly-financed campaigns) is enough to erode trust. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 12, 2017 at 9:46 pm Assuming lack trust occurs first before inequality, your example shows the subsequent ‘they reinforce each other.’ I think lack of trust occurs before when people become apathetic, stop caring for people in general. It becomes easier to take advantage of others. That leads to concentration of wealth and inequality. Then comes the reinforcing each other part.

Pre-order: Surface Laptop Matt Damon: The Game Enjoy Cities: Skylines? Paradox's 'Surviving Mars' will take city building to space By Jez Corden Friday, May 12, 2017 at 12:57 pm EDT 23 Comments Paradox Interactive (Cities: Skylines, Stellaris) is taking their expertise for city builders into space. Announced today on Xbox Wire, Paradox Interactive and Haemimont Games are working on an all-new city builder dubbed Surviving Mars, which revolves around establishing a colony in the harsh landscapes of the Red Planet. Here is everything we know so far, including screenshots and the game's announcement trailer. Main Features Building a sustainable colony in space: Building on a planet not fit for human life challenges you to build a smart, functional colony. Bad planning isn't about traffic jams, it's about survival of your colonists. You really don't want rolling blackouts in a city constructed in a place without oxygen. Individually simulated colonists: Each colonist is a unique individual with problems and strengths that influence the needs and behavior of the other colonists. Things can get really interesting if your chief scientists develops alcoholism after one too many long nights in the lab. Futuristic Space Dome construction: Retro-futuristic super structures housing colonists, factories and commercial buildings with their own "neighborhood personality." Create colonies that value science over everything else, while tired workers drink their pay away at a local bar, or attempt a utopia among the stars. Exploration of Mars' secrets: Inspired by the classic sci-fi of Asimov and Clarke, Surviving Mars holds many secrets. During each playthrough, players may encounter one of Mars' individually crafted mysteries. Uncovering these secrets might bring your colony great fortune, or terrible ruin. What is that sphere that manifested itself outside colony HUB B, and is it friendly? Randomized research tree: Combine static and random research through experimentation, which allows for a different experience for each journey through the game. Attain new scientific breakthroughs by exploring the uncharted terrain of Mars's surface. Unique retro-futuristic aesthetic: A sleek, modern take on the bright futurism of the 1960s. A time of exploration and adventure. Expansive mod support (PC): Craft your own fantastic buildings, parks or even a mystery to share through Surviving Mars's extensive and convenient modding tools. Share your finest creations with the community to build the perfect society. Unlike Cities: Skylines, Surviving Mars has a "hardcore" designation. Your colonists will die if they're not adequately supplied. For example, power outages can lead to asphyxiation, Total Recall style. Similarly to Paradox Interactive's Stellaris, it looks as though the personality of your inhabitants will have an affect on gameplay too. In Stellaris, your leaders can develop traits, both negative and positive, such as drug addiction, and the same is true in Surviving Mars. When's it coming out? Surviving Mars is coming to Xbox One, PC, and PS4 in 2018. It will be hitting Xbox under ID@Xbox, similarly to Paradox Interactive's Cities: Skylines. PC specs Minimum: OS: Windows 7 64-bit or newer, Processor: Dual-core CPU, Memory: 4 GB RAM, Graphics: 1 GB video RAM, Intel integrated video HD 4000 or higher Recommended: OS: Windows 7 64-bit or newer, Processor: Fast quad-core CPUs, Memory: 8 GB RAM, Graphics: 4 GB video RAM, GeForce 970-level GPU Paradox Interactive are known for consistent quality and post-launch support across all of their games. Europa Universalis IV is still getting fresh expansion packs years after launch, with Stellaris and Cities: Skylines also seeing the same treatment. Cities: Skylines already has several expansions on PC, with a new one, "Mass Transit" planned for launch in the near future.

Lacks removable battery. Bottom Line The Lenovo ThinkPad T470s isn't revolutionary, but is a reliable and travel-friendly business laptop loaded with modern features and ports, making it a worthy upgrade to its predecessor. By Matthew Buzzi The time-tested ThinkPad continues to serve business users reliably, updating a core concept with the latest technology and design trends. The ThinkPad T470s (starts at $1,556.10; $1,628.99 as tested) is the latest evolution of the "S" line, which is moving ever closer to ultraportable territory. It's not quite the slim ThinkPad X1 Carbon or one of the convertible ThinkPad Yoga options, but this thinner take on a general productivity laptop combines portability with more computing power than its T460s predecessor and plenty of current-generation features for an all-around competent machine. The X1 Carbon is our Editors' Choice for business laptops given its superior performance and form factor, but the T470s may better suit your needs with features like a touch screen and adapter-free Ethernet connectivity. //Compare Similar Products Compare Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2017)   %displayPrice%%seller% HP EliteBook 1040 G3   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell Latitude 14 7000 (7480)   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell Precision 15 5000 Series (5510)   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkPad 13   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Chromebook 13 G1   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkPad X260   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple MacBook Pro 13-Inch (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Getac S410   %displayPrice%%seller% HP EliteBook Folio G1 (1080p HD)   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell Latitude 13 3000 Series 2-in-1 (3379)   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook 14 for Work   %displayPrice%%seller% Carbon Inspired The T470s borrows the carbon fiber material from the X1 Carbon family, which makes it feel light and high quality without going for a metal body. It measures 0.74 inches at its thickest point and tapers down to 0.67 inches, while 13.03 inches wide and 8.93 inches deep. It weighs 3.1 pounds, not putting it among the true featherweights on the market, but still light by any standard, especially for a business laptop. For comparison, the latest X1 Carbon measures 0.6 by 12.7 by 8.5 inches (HWD) and weighs just 2.45 pounds, while the HP EliteBook 1040 G3 is 0.65 by 13.3 by 9.2 inches and 3.64 pounds. The T470s is practically identical in size and weight to the T460s, with most upgrades on the inside or with new ports and features. View All 7 Photos in Gallery That lighter carbon fiber design doesn't compromise durability: The T470s passes the same military-grade certifications (MIL-STD 810G) as the T470. As such, it's resistant to humidity, low and high temperatures, high vibrations, shocks, sand, and high altitude. That may not be applicable to many office dwellers, but it's useful to anyone taking their laptops into the field. The top-notch ThinkPad keyboard is one of the main elements that stays the same in each iteration, and such is the case with the T470s. The keys have a good amount of bounce and travel without feeling squishy, making for a reliable and comfortable typing experience, even for long hours of use. There are two options for cursor control: The small, circular TrackPoint stick is still present in the center of the keyboard, while the touchpad looks the same as ever. Dedicated left and right click buttons are located just over the touchpad, which are starting to look a little dated, but performance is dependable. There are changes beneath the surface, though, as Lenovo has implemented Microsoft's Precision Touchpad technology into this laptop. Precision touchpads let Windows 10 handle driver updates, multitouch input, and gesture commands, and receive raw touchpad input, rather than leave all of that to each manufacturer's drivers. Ideally, all computer makers will integrate this technology and leave the software features and updates to Microsoft, making a more unified market with less finicky controls from laptop to laptop, so kudos to Lenovo for implementing it. The 14-inch touch display won't turn any heads, but it's perfectly serviceable with its Full HD (1,920 by 1,080) resolution, and touch capability is a big plus for some users (while others may never use it at all—the X1 Carbon has no touch screen option). Its In-Plane Switching technology makes for wider viewing angles, and the screen does a good job of minimizing glare. At 14 inches, the display is a nice size for this type of system—small enough to remain portable, but the extra room over 11- and 13-inch systems means you'll have more real estate for multiple windows and seeing more within each program. The speakers are similarly unremarkable, loud at full volume but without much deep bass. The sound isn't overly tinny or weak, though, so while the T470s won't become your media center, it can play clips and voice chat audio with no issue. The port loadout is strong, with everything a business user will likely need in the office or on the road. Its left side includes a USB 3.0 port, a 4-in-1 card reader, the power adapter, and a headphone jack. On the right, there's a USB-C port with Thunderbolt 3, two more USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI connection, a smart card reader, a micro-SIM slot, and an Ethernet jack. The X1 Carbon doesn't have a dedicated Ethernet jack, so you'd have to carry a proprietary dongle with you for that, while the T470s removes that worry. Whether you're attaching displays, adding storage, or connecting peripherals and external drives, the T470s has the connections to support it. For storage, there's a 256GB SSD on board. That's not a lot if you need to store many video files or other large projects, but that capacity is fairly standard for a lighter system (the X1 Carbon has the same amount). Extras include a Match-in-Sensor fingerprint reader, anti-fry protection, Windows Signature Edition, and Windows Hello. This style of system-on-chip fingerprint reader is meant to be more secure, as it relegates your fingerprint records and biometric matching within the sensor module itself, rather than having it processed by the machine. Anti-fry protection prevents untested third-party USB-C chargers from harming your system, while Signature Edition means no pre-installed anti-virus software or other bloatware like toolbars or third-party services are present on your laptop. Windows Hello is Microsoft's facial recognition feature, which allows you to sign in with a quick facial scan though the 720p front-facing webcam once you set it up by registering a picture of your face on the laptop. The T470s also includes dual-band 802.11ac wireless and Bluetooth 4.1, and is supported by a one-year warranty. Steady Performance Since you'll be looking to the T470s for efficient multitasking and number crunching for yourself or your company's work force, general processing speed is important. While the 2.6GHz Intel Core i5-7300U processor isn't a Core i7 dynamo, it is of the latest Kaby Lake CPU generation from Intel, and combined with 8GB of memory, the T470s is pretty quick. It scored 3,255 points on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional test, which measures general productivity. That score just edges out the EliteBook 1040 G3 (which has a Core i7 from the last generation), is almost identical to the X1 Carbon's score (which makes sense, since they use the same processor), and doesn't lag too far behind the Dell Latitude 14 7000 (7480). It was also quicker than the EliteBook on the multimedia tests, shaving about a minute off the timed Photoshop test, and again performed similarly to the X1 Carbon, with the Latitude 14 the best of the bunch. Battery life is strong, with the laptop lasting 11 hours and 13 minutes on our rundown test, an impressive result, but much longer than the EliteBook 1040 G3's 6:55 time, and in line with the 2016 15-inch Apple MacBook Pro's 11:19 result. The X1 Carbon managed 15:59 and the Latitude 14 for 13:03, so the T470s isn't at the top of the heap, but it can rightly claim all-day battery life, which is important if you're out of the office or often away from your desk. Other options, like the ThinkPad X Series, feature removable batteries to virtually double your laptop's lifespan if you swap on the go, which would be nice to see here. Alas, the battery is sealed in. See How We Test Laptops Performance is weaker when it comes to 3D and gaming, but that's to be expected on a system with integrated graphics. None of these business-focused laptops are equipped for high-fidelity 3D rendering, and work computers designed for thoses use will incorporate a discrete workstation graphics card. Improved Iteration The ThinkPad T470s doesn't bring any real innovation to the field, but rather, incrementally improves on a proven concept with some smart updates. It has a current-generation processor, the latest ports, a travel-friendly design, and new security features like biometric sign in. Performance isn't top tier, but quicker systems are a little more expensive, and it's fast enough to do your daily multitasking without slowing you down. The T470s ultimately isn't specialized for portability or power users, so the similarly priced alternatives may hold higher appeal depending on your specific needs. The Latitude 14 we reviewed is faster, but the configuration will cost you extra, while the Editors' Choice ThinkPad X1 Carbon is still our top business laptop pick for its slim form, long battery life, and speedy components for around the same price.

(WVVA) U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, (D) West Virginia, has joined a growing chorus of lawmakers calling for a special independent prosecutor to look into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential Election.  Sen. Manchin, a member of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, was in Beckley Friday touting the inclusion of health benefits for retired miners in the Senate's most recent budget.  Despite President Donald Trump's firing last week of F.B.I Director James Comey, Sen. Manchin said the Russian probe is moving forward.  "If there's something more there, it'll come out. I can tell you that the intelligence committee, Democrats and Republicans, are working for what's good for Americans and that's to put our country first," said Sen. Manchin. "There won't be any person protected. There won't be any party protected. It'll be the United States and American people that are protected."  Also on Friday, Former Dir. Comey declined an invitation to appear before the Senate Intel Committee next week. President Trump claims Comey was fired over his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But some lawmakers believe Trump was trying to disrupt the FBI's investigation into his campaign and connections with Russia.  NEWSMore>> Suspects sought in Mercer Mall theft Suspects sought in Mercer Mall theft The West Virginia State Police need your help identifying three people involved in a theft at Mercer Mall.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > AMD schedules press event for Computex, with Vega… AMD schedules press event for Computex, with Vega the most likely topic By Mark Coppock — May 12, 2017 10:35 am Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Your wait to learn all about AMD's new Vega GPU architecture is likely to end soon. While it is common knowledge that AMD will be releasing its Vega next-generation GPU architecture in the second quarter of 2017, the company has been cagey in terms of specifics. While some potential events for such a reveal have come and gone, there’s one remaining this quarter that is a likely candidate. We’re talking about Computex, of course, and this year’s event is scheduled for May 30 through June 3 in Taipei. And AMD has now officially confirmed an event on May 31 at 10 a.m. local time that’s as likely as any for Vega to finally see the light of day, as Wccftech reports. The news came via an official AMD press statement: “Computex 2017 is fast approaching so we wanted to share a save-the-date for the AMD press conference, scheduled for May 31st from 10 a.m. – 11 a.m. “Hosted by AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su and other key AMD executives, you will have the opportunity to hear more about the latest products and leading-edge technologies coming from AMD in 2017. The past year has seen AMD bringing innovation and competition back to the high-performance desktop market with the release of Ryzen processors and we look forward to providing new details on 2017 products and the ecosystems, both OEM and channel, that will support them.” AMD has already made some noise with its recent launch of the Zen CPU architecture and its Ryzen processors, which offer solid performance at competitive price points. Ryzen has given Intel something to think about, and AMD is hoping that Vega will provide the kind of price-performance ratio that will help break Nvidia’s hold on the GPU market. The company has recently released another generation of its Polaris GPU architecture to hold a place in line for Vega, and the Radeon RX 500 series does offer some decent performance at competitive pricing. However, AMD fans and gamers, in general, are mostly looking forward to Vega, which the company hopes will finally let it compete at the high end against Nvidia’s Pascal architecture. While there’s no guaranteed that AMD will announce Vega at its upcoming Computex press event, smart money says it will. That means that we don’t have too much longer to wait to see exactly what AMD has in mind to shake up the GPU marketplace.

Camillia Dass from Yahoo! Singapore writes, „With their vibrant energy and electrifying colours, the Blue Man Group took to the stage and blew the crowd away. Their thundering sound and otherworldly behaviour came together to form one of the most magical and heart stopping experiences that I have ever experienced.” „When we first began creating performances centered on this innocent, curious character called Blue Man, we never dreamt where he would lead us. It’s exciting to see the places around the world where that show brings us. We believe the Blue Man’s universal message of joyful exuberance and euphoric celebration resonates within all of us,” said Blue Man Group Co-founder, Chris Wink.

(QCOM) Stock Is Facing Qualcomm stock is cheap, but not cheap enough to take on a number of material risks By Vince Martin, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 12, 2017, 9:50 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: 10 Hot Stocks to Sell Before They Hit the Wall 3 Reasons Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Will Rebound 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Market’s Next Big Rally Recent Posts: Why Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock Isn’t As Ugly As It Looks The 3 Key Risks Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock Is Facing 3 Stocks to Buy Thanks to Big Post-Earnings Discounts View All Posts If you believe in the contrarian arguments for “buying when there’s blood in the streets” and the like, Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a stock for you. QCOM stock has tanked over the past few months amid a torrent of bad news. The most well-covered dent to the bull case for Qualcomm stock is a royalty dispute with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), but there are other concerns as well. Source: Shutterstock The change in sentiment has pushed QCOM stock down 15% since the beginning of the year. That weakness is amplified by the fact that other large-cap tech stocks, including AAPL, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), have been on torrid runs so far this year. AAPL stock is up 32% year-to-date, for instance, adding insult to injury for Qualcomm stock. There is a case for buying the stock at the lows. QCOM stock now yields over 4%. Earnings multiples suggest barely zero growth going forward. Regulatory and legal issues could be resolved in Qualcomm’s favor — at least not move against the company en masse. However, I’m not buying that case … at least not yet. There are three key risks facing QCOM stock at the moment. And if all three converge, which isn’t likely, but is possible, the impact could be severe. And even with Qualcomm stock looking “cheap,” it’s not cheap enough to take on all of these risks. The QCOM-AAPL Dispute The most covered challenge for Qualcomm is its royalty dispute with Apple. AAPL ramped up that fight by directing suppliers, including well-known contract manufacturer Foxconn, to cease royalty payments to QCOM. That development led the company to pull down its Q3 guidance, and sent the stock down about 4%. The issue is larger for Qualcomm stock than just the money owed. Q3 guidance, for instance, was only pulled down by about $0.5 billion dollars, while QCOM has a market cap of over $80 billion. And one would think at some point that the dispute will be resolved; for all its bluster, Apple still needs Qualcomm products for the iPhone and AAPL remains perilously dependent on that product for growth. The longer-term concern is whether Apple will minimize, or outright displace, QCOM’s positioning in the iPhone. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has positioned itself as a potential replacement supplier for cellular modems. Qualcomm reportedly generates $12 for each iPhone modem, meaning billions of dollars of high-margin annual revenue are at risk. And that’s not revenue the company can just replace. The iPhone has roughly 18% market share globally. The proportion of high-dollar phones (as opposed to lower-end models from Chinese manufacturers) is much higher. QCOM already has extensive penetration into Android manufacturers — there’s nowhere else to go. A loss or elimination of Apple revenue comes right off its bottom line. And it significantly impacts the forward-looking valuation of Qualcomm stock. QCOM Stock: The NXPI Acquisition May Not Close While the AAPL-QCOM debate has made news, it’s not as if concerns are new to the company’s stock. QCOM stock hasn’t moved for basically five years now, after peaking in early 2014. The primary driver of the weakness in the stock has been a sense that Qualcomm’s best days are behind it. Its revenues come predominantly from the wireless business, and with growth slowing and ‘commoditization’ on the horizon, those revenues will be stagnant at best. So QCOM decided to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) in an effort to diversify away from wireless. NXP most notably has a solid presence in automotive, where Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY), recently acquired by Intel, and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are projecting substantial growth opportunities. But that deal may not go through — E.U. antitrust regulators will decide on its clearance by June 9. With regulatory issues already swirling around Qualcomm, including fines in China and Korea and FTC charges in the U.S., clearance is not guaranteed. And if that merger is blocked, Qualcomm stock probably has further to fall.

In fact, it has been more than eight years since the S&P 500 hit an ominous intraday low of 666 in March of 2009. While everybody has been caught up in the Trump rally that has pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to almost 21,000, the fact of the matter is we appear to be very overbought on a short-term basis and could be in for a sizable correction. With that in mind, if you have money to put to work, or have tax-loss selling that could raise funds, there are some good blue chip dividend stocks that are reasonably safe and offer good dividends. We screened the JPMorgan research database and found five that look good for the slow summer trading and the rest of 2017. Bristol-Myers Squibb This top company remains a favorite on Wall Street. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY) is a global pharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, licensing and marketing chemically synthesized drugs or small molecules and biologics in various therapeutic areas, including virology comprising human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), oncology, neuroscience, immunoscience and cardiovascular. The company recently announced that Biogen will pay $300 million upfront to Bristol-Myers to license a palsy drug with a $2 billion market opportunity and the potential to use that to treat Alzheimer’s. The company will pay a total of $410 million in milestone payments and a tiered double-digit royalty to license a drug known only as BMS-986168. The drug just completed Phase 1 testing in progressive supranuclear palsy. Shareholders receive a 2.83% dividend The JPMorgan price objective for the stock is $66, and the Wall Street consensus target price is $57.18. The shares closed trading on Thursday at $55.14 apiece. Home Depot This company remains the undisputed leader in the home improvement retail category. Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD) is the world’s largest home improvement specialty retailer, with 2,270 retail stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, 10 Canadian provinces and Mexico. Home Depot stores sell various building materials, home improvement products, and lawn and garden products, as well as provide installation, home maintenance and professional service programs to do-it-yourself (DIY), do-it-for-me (DIFM) and professional customers. Home Depot could continue to be a benefactor from the huge, ongoing rebuilding efforts across the United States as a result of flooding and tornadoes that have caused extensive damage over the past year. With summer right around the corner, there is always a chance for more storms. Home Depot investors receive a 2.28% dividend. JPMorgan has a $167 price target, and the consensus price objective is $158.54. Shares closed Thursday at $156.20. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is a big part of the shift. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments.

Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman, and Sen. Mark Warner, the committee’s Democratic vice chairman, issued a joint statement saying the panel decided to issue the subpoena after Flynn, through his lawyer, declined to cooperate with an April 28 request to turn over the documents. Flynn and other associates of President Trump have received similar requests from the committee for information and documents over the past few weeks. Copies of request letters sent to longtime Trump associate Roger Stone and former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page were shared with The Associated Press. Those letters, which were nearly identical, sought emails, text messages, letters, phone records or any other relevant information they have about meetings or contacts that they or any other individual affiliated with the Trump campaign had with Russian officials or representatives of Russian business interests. They also ask for information about any financial or real estate holdings related to Russia, including any since divested or sold. Stone, Page, Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort all received similar requests for information, a person familiar with the Senate investigation said. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the details of the committee’s investigation. The requests sent to Stone and Page covered documents and information from June 2015 through Jan. 20 of this year. During that period, Flynn accepted tens of thousands of dollars from a Russian state-sponsored television network. He later worked as a foreign agent on behalf of a Turkish businessman, while serving as a top Trump campaign adviser. It also covers the postelection time period in which Trump and his transition team decided to appoint Flynn as national security adviser. Stone said today that he will “fully comply” with the Senate intelligence committee’s request for information and documents relating to its Russia investigation. Stone told NBC’s “Today” he wants to testify, since members of congressional panels involved in the Russia probe “have disparaged me publicly.” Flynn was fired by Trump after less than one month on the job. The White House said Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top officials about his communications during the presidential transition with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. The subpoena comes as both the Senate committee and its counterpart in the House are investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump associates colluded with those attempts to sway the election. Flynn’s Russia ties are also being scrutinized by the FBI as it conducts a similar investigation. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena or say why Flynn declined to provide the information earlier. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a “story to tell,” but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without “assurances against unfair prosecution.” Other congressional committees and the Pentagon’s inspector general are also separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. The top Democrat and Republican on a House oversight committee have said Flynn likely broke federal law by failing to get approval from the U.S. government to accept foreign payments and not disclosing them after accepting them. Among the payments they cited were more than $33,000 from RT, a Russian state-sponsored television network that U.S. intelligence officials have branded as a propaganda front for Russia’s government. The network paid Flynn for attending a December 2015 gala in Moscow during which Flynn was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Turkish payments under scrutiny are part of $530,000 worth of lobbying and investigative work that Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, performed for a Turkish businessman. In March, Flynn and his firm belatedly registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for the work, acknowledging it could have benefited the Turkish government. On Wednesday, the AP reported that Flynn is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn’s firm sent back last year to the client. Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told the AP that the payments from Flynn’s firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn’s foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries.

The Corsair Dominator Platinum Special Edition Torque DDR4 RAM is inspired by the power, speed and design of vintage hotrod cars. The high performance memory chips under the bonnet are complemented by a brushed black aluminium heatsink, built-in lighting, orange accents, plus a unique heat treated top bar. Let's consider the new product appearance first. The most interesting aspect of the design, I don't recall seeing before, is a heat-treated finish to the RAM top bar. If you've ever heated metal and observed bluing (with oil) and other colour effects, this will be familiar to you. At the periphery of the bar there's a nice rainbow effect which isn't perfectly uniform and each memory module is thus 'one of a kind'. The memory modules are individually numbered. Elsewhere the memory module design adds hotrod inspired built-in lighting and orange accents but the bulk of the aluminium heatspreader returns to classic Corsair design being made with brushed black aluminium. Furthermore, the modules use Corsair DHX cooling tech design for lower temperatures. Corsair has created the Dominator Platinum Special Edition Torque DDR4 RAM kits to be fully compatible with the latest Intel X99, 100-Series, and 200-Series motherboards. The firm claims to have individually hand-screened the modules, which are constructed using a 10-layer PCB and provide "superior signalling for greater overclocking potential". All the kits are sold as 3,200MHz rated but Corsair assures us that they can be "safely overclocked to at least 3,600MHz." Intel XMP 2.0 compatibility should ensure you get the best safe speeds. Corsair Dominator Platinum Special Edition Torque DDR4 RAM is available (in limited quantities) right now. The 2x16GB kit is priced at £380, and the 4x8GB module kit is priced at £430 for UK dwellers. SKUs Description Price CMD32GX4M2C3200C14T 32GB (2X 16GB), DDR4 3200, Torque $399.99 Exc.

For example, the proposed border-adjustment tax (BAT) in the House would raise the cost of imports by 20 percent, costing the average U.S. household up to $1,700 in the first year alone, according to analysis by the National Retail Federation. The administration is launching several reviews that single out the role that trade deficits — and presumably the role imports cause in creating those mathematical imbalances — play in U.S. job losses. “Buy American” requirements seem to be in vogue with Congress and in the executive branch. Additionally, new tariffs have been threatened on imports in connection with individual countries, industries and companies.  The piling on against imports during the first few months of 2017 seems unprecedented, hitting levels that haven’t been seen in Washington since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act ushered in the Great Depression.  But in some respects, this is nothing new. Many of the most ardent trade promoters often have a blind spot when it comes to imports. Privately, they will acknowledge the amazing power of imports to create millions of high-paying U.S. jobs; deliver benefits to consumers through affordable choices; support U.S. manufacturing through materials and parts that might not be available domestically and stimulate foreign demand for U.S. products. Publicly, politicians and policymakers prefer to dote primarily over exports and their ability to create high-paying U.S. jobs. Exports are good, but imports are too. What’s particularly fascinating is that this anti-import mood has gripped the Beltway at a time when trade enjoys record-high levels of support among ordinary Americans. Poll after poll shows that Americans like trade — both imports and exports — and believe it creates opportunities and jobs. While support in many of these polls took a dip during 2016 — no surprise since most of the presidential candidates were doing their best to complain about trade policies — it is rebounding nicely in 2017.  That’s to be expected. Americans know what many politicians are afraid to admit — trade flows, including imports, work for America. We encounter imports everywhere we go. When we get dressed, when we eat, when we drive to work, when we text our families and friends, when we go on vacation and when we relax, we benefit from our ability to import. Look around and you will see what we mean: Ninety-eight percent of the clothes and shoes Americans wear are imported. Those imports support four-million U.S. jobs — in design, logistics, retail, supply chain and so on. These U.S.-based workers contribute, on average, about 70 percent of the value of each of these imported articles. Are you reading this on an imported iPhone? Look on the back and you’ll see it was designed in California. How about your U.S.-made car? More than likely, it was made in several locations throughout North America, using a mixture of domestic and imported parts and a supply chain that employs hundreds of thousands of Americans. Is that car running on gas? We import that too. You know that handbag, tote, backpack, or briefcase you carry all of your wonderful imported products to work or school? It was imported too. Enjoying a cup of coffee or eating a banana? Yup, imported. The list goes on. We are a nation of importers. That is a good thing, because those imports save us money, keep us employed, feed us, help us get around, support our economy and give us access to cool, fun stuff. Because those imports also keep people employed in other parts of the world, they directly support the ability of those foreign workers to buy goods made in and exported from the United States. Five years ago, former World Trade Organization Director-General Pascal Lamy recognized this when he said, “To shoot at imports is to shoot yourself in the foot, because you are undermining your exports as well.”  Fortunately, some have chosen to defend imports close to home because they understand that raising the costs of imports means higher prices Americans have to pay for everyday products. Such policies also trigger copycat behavior by our trading partners. Back in January, Sen. Lindsey GrahamLindsey GrahamThe Hill's 12:30 Report An ode to imports — the critically undervalued side of trade Trump lawyers: Tax returns show no income from Russia with few exceptions MORE (R-S.C.) labeled tariffs on Mexico a huge barrier to economic growth, noting that, “Any tariff we can levy, they can levy. Any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad.” Others, such as Sens.

The last few months have presented significant concerns for U.S. communities that depend upon imports, and the coming months may be equally challenging. But in May, as we celebrate World Trade Month, let’s take a moment to remind ourselves — and those who represent us — of the innumerable ways that imports continue to work for America.

Velodyne says one of the driving forces behind their under-construction “megafactory” is an increased demand for LiDAR sensors in unmanned vehicles, and aircraft company Airbus announced the opening of a new drone-centric facility in the United States. French company Airbus, known for commercial jets, announced the opening of commercial branch Airbus Aerial on May 11. “Using an integrated combination of assets, from UAS platforms to satellite imagery, Airbus Aerial is rolling out a wide range of new imagery services,” says Dirk Hoke, chief executive officer of Airbus Defence and Space. The outpost will focus on cargo drone services and connectivity services incorporating drones, satellites, and ground stations. "Drones are only a piece of a much larger picture for us," says Kallman. "Airbus Aerial brings together a variety of aerospace technologies – including drones and satellites – combines them in a common software infrastructure, and applies industry-specific analytics to deliver tailored solutions to our customers’ biggest challenges.” Airbus is partnering with Intel, which will provide drone platforms with Airbus’s software to deliver aircraft inspection services. At AUVSI Xponential in Dallas, where the partnership was announced, Intel also demonstrated the Falcon 8+ drone, the latest platform from Intel and one which can easily swap payloads out depending on the needs of the customer. Airbus Aerial is actively looking for other business partners to help bring their data services to market in areas such as surveying, agriculture, oil and gas, and state and local government. Airbus Aerial will be headquartered in Atlanta.  Related Reads Researchers Mitigate Soldier Stressors With Science New Laser-Based Aircraft Tracking System Aids Disaster Relief Mining Social Media Can Help Improve Disaster Response Efforts This UAV Transmits 4G Cell Phone Service Megan Crouse Real-Time Digital Reporter @abmdigi Full Bio > Advertisement Advertisement View the discussion thread.

Tech companies and investors have recently been piling money into artificial intelligence—and plenty has been trickling down to chip maker Nvidia. The company’s revenues have climbed as it has started making hardware customized for machine-learning algorithms and use cases such as autonomous cars. At the company’s annual developer conference in San Jose, California, this week, the company’s CEO Jensen Huang spoke to MIT Technology Review about how the machine-learning revolution is just starting. Nvidia has benefitted from a rapid explosion of investment in machine learning from tech companies. Can this rapid growth in the use cases for machine learning continue? We’re very early on. Very few lines of code in the enterprises and industries all over the world use AI today. It’s quite pervasive in Internet service companies, particularly two or three of them. But there's a whole bunch of others in tech and other industries that are trying to catch up. Software is eating the world, but AI is going to eat software. What industry will be transformed by machine learning next? One is the automotive industry. Ten of the world’s top car companies are here with us at the conference. The second is health care, and the impact on society is going to be very great. Health information is messy and unstructured, but now computers can understand it to augment doctors’ diagnoses and predictions. Which industries do you think will be most impacted by AI? Tell us in the comments. Recent research results from applying machine learning to diagnosis are impressive (see “An AI Ophthalmologist Shows How Machine Learning May Transform Medicine”). But it’s not clear how regulators will test and approve these new kinds of systems. When we're talking about human lives, there are always regulatory challenges. But we can't ignore the impact of a technology that brings 10 or 1,000 times better results. I have confidence that reasonable minds will realize the benefits of this technology and put it in the hands of doctors and clinicians and radiologists so that they can do better work. Arterys recently got FDA approval for their cardiac imaging [which annotates scans of the heart], and I know of many others that are in the pipeline. Using machine learning in cars will also create new challenges for regulators. Nvidia has demonstrated software that learns to drive just by watching what a human driver does—but it’s difficult to explain exactly how it works or would behave in different scenarios (see “The Dark Secret at the Heart of AI”). Recommended for You An Algorithm Summarizes Lengthy Text Surprisingly Well A Single Autonomous Car Has a Huge Impact on Alleviating Traffic The World’s Largest Electric Vehicle Maker Hits a Speed Bump Mind-Reading Algorithms Reconstruct What You’re Seeing Using Brain-Scan Data This Mega-Sensor Makes the Whole Room Smart The power and promise of this end-to-end approach is very enticing. We really believe that long-term, the way AI will drive is similar to the way humans drive—we don't break the problem down into objects and vision and localization and planning. But how long it will take us to get there is questionable. Getting it to do everything properly is a great challenge, [and] when it doesn't do one thing right, how do you patch it, because you're trying to train the whole thing together. We probably have to break down some of these problems into smaller chunks. Your chips are already driving some cars: all Tesla vehicles now use Nvidia’s Drive PX 2 computer to power the Autopilot feature that automates highway driving. Does that function use the hardware’s full capacity? Could it power fully autonomous driving? Drive PX 2 is a computing platform with a lot of computation capacity reserved—the idea is to have enough so that you can continuously update the software and be delighted with enhancements over time. For full autonomy, meaning a driverless car, there are still some unknowns, but there's a lot of software development that's going on. I'm not exactly sure, but we'll find out. Intel, Google, and several other companies are now working on chips designed to accelerate machine learning (see “Battle to Provide Chips for the AI Boom Heats Up”). How will you stay ahead?

We're going to steer our years of investment in our GPU chips, and a two and a half billion dollar R&D budget, into deep learning. And we will make our architecture available everywhere: in PCs, in servers, in the cloud, in cars, in robots. You agree with researchers who say that the physical challenges of making transistors smaller and more power-efficient are slowing progress in the power of computer processors (see “Moore’s Law Is Dead. Now What?”). But you claim Nvidia’s chips can keep advancing because they are specialized to particular use cases. Surely you can’t resist physics forever. No question about it, we can’t. Right now we’re recapturing the inefficiencies of CPUs and software into our more specialized GPUs. My sense is we'll continue to benefit from that for a couple of decades. But somewhere we’ll have to find something new. We have an amazing engineering team in the company pushing the limits of device physics and some great partners in manufacturing. Between all of us we will find the way. Tech Obsessive? Become an Insider to get the story behind the story — and before anyone else.

(NYSE: RHT), the world’s leading provider of open source solutions, today announced Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11, the latest version of Red Hat’s massively-scalable and agile cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Based on the OpenStack “Ocata” release, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 delivers enhanced support for upgrades with composable roles, new networking capabilities, and improved integration with Red Hat CloudForms for cloud management. As OpenStack deployments grow in scale and scope, enterprises need a clear path forward to embrace new innovations without sacrificing their existing deployment structure. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 helps to provide this path forward, with Red Hat OpenStack Platform Director helping to maintain stability through the upgrade process, while also adding new networking features, management capabilities, and storage support, bringing the powerful innovations of the OpenStack community to mission-critical enterprise deployments. -RADHESH BALAKRISHNANGENERAL MANAGER, OPENSTACK, RED HAT Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 delivers a reliable cloud platform built on the proven, enterprise-grade backbone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Based on OpenStack community code, Red Hat OpenStack Platform is a tested, certified and fully-supported version of OpenStack that provides the agility to scale and more quickly meet customer demand without compromising availability, performance or IT security requirements. Red Hat OpenStack Platform also includes Red Hat CloudForms to ease day-to-day management operations. It serves as a hybrid cloud management and monitoring platform to oversee not only OpenStack infrastructure components but also the workloads running on a given Red Hat OpenStack Platform cloud. Additionally, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 maintains its tight integration with Red Hat Ceph Storageand introduces the co-location of Red Hat Ceph Storage with OpenStack compute nodes. Previously in tech-preview, this release also enables storage mirroring to help simplify data replication between sites, improving disaster recovery for customers. Improved Upgradability Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 introduced composable roles, which allow operators to create customized profiles for individual services and processes to suit their unique needs. This helps to improve operation and efficiency by allowing operators to scale and manage the individual services they need at any moment, rather than scaling the entire cloud.t While this makes it easier for enterprises to customize OpenStack deployments to fit their specific needs at scale, it also introduces challenges in upgrading to new versions of the platform. To address this, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 now supports upgrades for composable roles, making the deployment and upgradability of Red Hat OpenStack Platform more adaptable and consistent while retaining the important aspects of lifecycle management. In addition, OpenStack services can now be composed individually and assigned, enabling operators to place components such as databases, proxies, or messaging services on specific nodes based on their unique requirements. This includes adding customized roles post-deployment to a running cloud, providing more flexibility to customers or partners as they become more successful with their cloud services. Expanded networking and network function virtualization support Networking and network function virtualization (NFV) support remains a key function of OpenStack deployments, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 delivers several new capabilities, designed for standard networking use cases as well as extreme workloads such as those required by information and communication technology services providers. New features include: Full support for VLAN-aware virtual machines (VMs), OpenStack-based VMs can now send and receive VLAN encapsulated traffic while being deployed over Open vSwitch (OVS) or OVS Data Plane Development Kit (OVS-DPDK). Additional telecommunications provider enhancements with upgrades to OVS and DPDK to provide latest features and functions, resulting in increased performance optimizations. Enhanced management with Red Hat CloudForms Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 improves its integration with Red Hat CloudForms, Red Hat’s open hybrid cloud management solution, to better support management requirements for day-to-day operations of a Red Hat OpenStack Platform-based cloud. Included with Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11, Red Hat CloudForms can now access and control OpenStack regions, multiple domains, and host aggregates for a more unified controller view of cloud health and efficiency. Storage management has also been enhanced, as Red Hat CloudForms can now perform volume snapshot management functions like creation, listing and deletion, further streamlining the overall management of the cloud platform. Partner and customer success Red Hat OpenStack Platform provides a proven, enterprise-grade solution for building, deploying and scaling cloud deployments across geographic and industry boundaries.

Three bald and blue men explore our cultural norms with wide-eyed wonder, poking fun at our collective quirks and reminding us how much we all have in common. Backed by a live rock band, the Blue Men unify the audience for the show’s celebratory finale — an unforgettable, euphoric dance party.

Their thundering sound and otherworldly behaviour came together to form one of the most magical and heart stopping experiences that I have ever experienced.” „When we first began creating performances centered on this innocent, curious character called Blue Man, we never dreamt where he would lead us. It’s exciting to see the places around the world where that show brings us. We believe the Blue Man’s universal message of joyful exuberance and euphoric celebration resonates within all of us,” said Blue Man Group Co-founder, Chris Wink.

Beyond the stage show, they are Grammy-nominated recording artists, known for their contributions to various film and TV scores and multiple Blue Man Group albums, including their most recent, THREE. Their „Megastar World Tour” rock concert parody played arenas across the globe. The group’s recently published first-ever book, Blue Man World, is a visually stunning anthropological exploration of the curious bald and blue character.

After performing in New Zealand, China, South Africa, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, fourteen new cities have been added for 2017.  Blue Man Group performances are a celebration of human connection. Mixing art, music, comedy and state-of-the-art technology, the show encourages audiences to reconnect with their inner (and outer) child and see the world through a new perspective. Three bald and blue men explore our cultural norms with wide-eyed wonder, poking fun at our collective quirks and reminding us how much we all have in common. Backed by a live rock band, the Blue Men unify the audience for the show's celebratory finale -- an unforgettable, euphoric dance party. Blue Man Group is continually refreshed with new music, fresh stories and custom instruments and the World Tour is no exception. Tickets for Blue Man Group's World Tour are on-sale now and can be purchased at www.blueman.com.  Initial dates are as follows, with additional cities and countries to be announced soon: Tel-Aviv The Mann Auditorium Aug. 7 - 26, 2017 Zurich, Switzerland Theater 11 Oct. 3 - 29, 2017 Luxembourg Grand Théâtre Oct. 31, 2017 - Nov. 4, 2017 Milan, Italy Teatro Arcimboldi Nov. 8 - 12, 2017 Trieste, Italy Politeama Rossetti Nov. 22 - 26, 2017 Cologne, Germany Musical Dome Köln Nov. 29, 2017 - Dec. 17, 2017 Barcelona, Spain Auditori Forum Dec. 20 - 23, 2017 Birmingham, UK The ICC Hall 1 Dec. 27, 2017 - Jan. 6, 2018 Lausanne, Switzerland Théâtre de Beaulieu Jan. 10 - 21, 2018 Vienna, Austria Wiener Stadthalle Jan. 24 - 28, 2018 Bregenz, Austria Platz de Wiener Symphoniker 1 Jan. 30, 2018 - Feb. 4, 2018 Hamburg, Germany Mehr!

Camillia Dass from Yahoo! Singapore writes, "With their vibrant energy and electrifying colours, the Blue Man Group took to the stage and blew the crowd away. Their thundering sound and otherworldly behaviour came together to form one of the most magical and heart stopping experiences that I have ever experienced." "When we first began creating performances centered on this innocent, curious character called Blue Man, we never dreamt where he would lead us. It's exciting to see the places around the world where that show brings us. We believe the Blue Man's universal message of joyful exuberance and euphoric celebration resonates within all of us," said Blue Man Group Co-founder, Chris Wink.

It's been another week of Russian Roulette in the USA. The latest casualty? FBI boss James Comey, fired because he wasn't doing a good job according to the President. He also called him a "showboat" and a "grandstander" who mishandled the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails last year. In the end the President's confidence was lost. That's the gist of the official explanation anyway. Why now though? It was apparently Mr Comey's testimony before a Senate Intelligence Committee last week that was the straw that broke the camel's back for Mr Trump. In it the FBI boss stood by his handling of the email investigation. He also said he believes Russia is still, to this day, trying to interfere in US politics. He was apparently looking to escalate the FBI investigation. White House officials said the President was acting on a recommendation from the Deputy Attorney-General when he sacked the intelligence chief. But then Mr Trump unravelled the narrative when he told NBC that he had already planned to get rid of him. "I was going to fire Comey… I was gonna fire regardless of recommendation," he said. The President said Mr Comey had left the FBI in turmoil, and lacked credibility with both Republicans and Democrats as well as the American public. To be fair there was plenty of criticism of Mr Comey last year when he said he was re-opening the Clinton email investigation just days before the election potentially affecting the outcome. However in the New York Times' matrix of things Mr Trump has done and said on a scale of abnormal to important, this one rates above the rest — slightly ahead of his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud (there's a formal investigation into that now, by the way) and his unsubstantiated claims that he was wiretapped by his predecessor. Esteemed company. Carter Page, who is one of those Trump associates being investigated for his links to Russia . said he was encouraged by Mr Comey's dismissal The responses from House members and Senators were fast and furious Some Republicans ; Republican Justin Amash said he found Mr Trump's letter to Mr Comey "bizarre". were "troubled" Not surprisingly, . Democrats were calling for a special prosecutor It is surprising, in part because last year Attorney-General Jeff Sessions said Mr Comey had done good. External Link: Jeff Sessions interview (Although as the Attorney-General who recused himself from the investigation into Russia he probably shouldn't be involved.) Mr Trump loved him when he was a candidate. External Link: Kellyanne Conway interview (Shout out to Kellyanne Conway calling this irrelevant and then the Anderson Cooper eye-roll at 1:27. These guys really must like each other.) But the White House says we shouldn't conflate what then candidate Trump said with what Mr Trump does now as President. Which is what exactly?

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate intelligence committee on Wednesday subpoenaed former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn for documents related to the panel’s investigation into Russia’s election meddling. Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman, and Sen. Mark Warner, the committee’s Democratic vice chairman, issued a joint statement saying the panel decided to issue the subpoena after Flynn, through his lawyer, declined to cooperate with an April 28 request to turn over the documents. Flynn and other associates of President Donald Trump have received similar requests from the committee for information and documents over the past few weeks. Copies of request letters sent to longtime Trump associate Roger Stone and former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page were shared with The Associated Press. Those letters, which were nearly identical, sought emails, text messages, letters, phone records or any other relevant information they have about meetings or contacts that they or any other individual affiliated with the Trump campaign had with Russian officials or representatives of Russian business interests. They also ask for information about any financial or real estate holdings related to Russia, including any since divested or sold.  Stone, Page, Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort all received similar requests for information, a person familiar with the Senate investigation said. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the details of the committee’s investigation. The requests sent to Stone and Page covered documents and information from June 2015 through Jan. 20 of this year. During that period, Flynn accepted tens of thousands of dollars from a Russian state-sponsored television network. He later worked as a foreign agent on behalf of a Turkish businessman, while serving as a top Trump campaign adviser. It also covers the post-election time period in which Trump and his transition team decided to appoint Flynn as national security adviser. Flynn was fired by Trump after less than one month on the job. The White House said Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top officials about his communications during the presidential transition with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. The subpoena comes as both the Senate committee and its counterpart in the House are investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump associates colluded with those attempts to sway the election. Flynn’s Russia ties are also being scrutinized by the FBI as it conducts a similar investigation. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena or say why Flynn declined to provide the information earlier. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a “story to tell,” but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without “assurances against unfair prosecution.” Other congressional committees and the Pentagon’s inspector general are also separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. The top Democrat and Republican on a House oversight committee have said Flynn likely broke federal law by failing to get approval from the U.S. government to accept foreign payments and not disclosing them after accepting them. Among the payments they cited were more than $33,000 from RT, a Russian state-sponsored television network that U.S. intelligence officials have branded as a propaganda front for Russia’s government. The network paid Flynn for attending a December 2015 gala in Moscow during which Flynn was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Turkish payments under scrutiny are part of $530,000 worth of lobbying and investigative work that Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, performed for a Turkish businessman. In March, Flynn and his firm belatedly registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for the work, acknowledging it could have benefited the Turkish government. On Wednesday, The Associated Press reported that Flynn is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn’s firm sent back last year to the client. Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told the AP that the payments from Flynn’s firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn’s foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries.

We know all of that thanks to an FCC listing from March. Now some more details have emerged about the upcoming notebook, in an Asus earnings report. There are also some details about a new Vivobook Flip TP401. The Zenbook Flip UX370UA will also reportedly go by the model number Q325UA and it’s positioned as a premium device with a 13.3 inch high-res display, Asus Pen support, and quad speakers. It also supports up to 16GB of RAM, up to 1TB of SSD storage, and Intel Kaby Lake-U processor options. The notebook is expected to be less than half an inch thick (12mm). Meanwhile, the Vivobook Flip TP401 is expected to feature a 14 inch display, a slightly thicker case (15mm, or about 0.6 inches), and a somewhat less sleek design. Unlike the Zenbook Flip though, the Vivobook model will be available with an NVIDIA graphics option. via Zenfone.org  Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 1 Comment on "More Asus Zenbook Flip UX370 details (and Vivobook Flip TP401)" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member A.i.

Saturday, 13th May 2017 Twitter Facebook RSS Home Top Stories Local Africa International Business Opinion & Analysis Crime & Courts Entertainment Sport Advertise Chief Ngezi hails Ndiraya UNWTO: It’s now or never for Africa USAID please leave Africa immediately May 12, 2017 silence muchemwa Features, Opinion & Analysis Obi Egbuna Jnr Simunye When the late pan-Africanist revolutionary leader of Burkina Faso, H.E. Comrade Thomas Sankara, expelled Western-based food NGOs from the nation he boldly stated: “Our country produces enough to feed us all. Alas, for a lack of organisation we are forced to beg for food aid. It’s this aid that instils in our spirits the attitude of beggars.” In this we witnessed the resurrection of the self-determination fervour that defined our anti-colonialist resistance from the 1950s to the 1980s. Let Mother Africa’s children both on the continent and Diaspora analyse very carefully why Eritrea, Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Venezuela, Dominica, Nicaragua and Russia arrived at the logical conclusion that the United States Agency for International Development must be shown the door. This despite the obstacles and initial suffering their citizens would be forced to endure on a short-term basis. We are well aware that each and every neo-colonialist and neo-liberalist government and advocate who define progress itself by the yardstick imposed on them by US-EU imperialism, would consider the decision to show USAID the door as rebel rousing and biting the hand that feeds you. The government of Eritrea made their decision in 2005, while Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Dominica, Nicaragua, Venezuela – under the banner of the ALBA (Bolivarina Alliance for the Peoples of Our America) – and Russia followed suite seven years later in 2012. The USAID workers involved in the Zun Zuneo scandal in Cuba, which is slang for a Hummingbird’s tweet, was a project to get Venezuelan, Peruvian and Costa Rican youth to get their peers in Cuba to begin a regime change campaign. This was in sync with USAID’s Public Safety Campaign that trained other countries’ police and military officers in counter-insurgency at the height of the Cold War. This diplomatic slap in the face came at a moment when USAID made no secret that Mother Africa had become their primary focus. “Nowhere in the world is development such an important part of US engagements as it is in Africa. “The changing tide on the continent requires a new kind of partnership. Today Africans are the architects of their own development not just beneficiaries. Donors support their plans, they do not dictate them. Our joint efforts reap benefits for both Africans and the US,” USAID stated. While we do not take pride in speaking the colonial languages forced down our throats both on our sacred land and slave plantations throughout the Americas, our former colonisers deserve full credit for ensuring that we have full comprehension of their mother tongues as well as the 5 000 indigenous languages Africans have given to the world. For this reason, US-EU imperialism makes a cardinal error when attempting to paint the picture that today’s African heads of state have a better ideological framework for development than the fathers of the anti-colonial movement like Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah, Ahmed Sekou Toure, Patrice Lumumba, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Ahmed Ben Bella, Modibo Keita, Julius Nyerere, Kenneth Kaunda nd Samora Machel, just to name a few. What severely compromises the narrative USAID spin-doctors are attempting to propagate is first and foremost, when they came into existence. The exact year was 1961 when US-EU imperialism carried out both the cowardly assassination of Cde Patrice Lumumba and the embarrassing debacle widely known as the Bay of Pigs invasion, which was the first official attempt to use unpatriotic and reactionary Cubans as ill-equipped toy soldiers to overthrow at the time a two-year-old revolutionary government who already was revered all over the entire world. When former US president John Kennedy created USAID by executive order it was predetermined that even though this organisation would give the appearance of an independent operator, there would be total adherence to foreign policy mandate of the president, Secretary of State and National Security Council. Because of USAID’S chameleonic nature the organisation can at the blink of an eye generate major dollars from Fortune 500 companies who are always looking to plant their flag like astronauts in other parts of the solar system. This explains why former US president Barack Obama had a huge smile in 2014 when he announced USAID would invest more than $38 million to the Young African Leaders Initiative for the establishment of four regional centres that will train the youth pen- marked as our new emerging leaders. The contributing companies are MasterCard Foundation ($10 million), Dow Chemical Company ($3 million), Atlas Mara ($25 million), Microsoft ($12 million), McKinsey & Company ($1,5 million), IBM ($500 000), General Electric and Procter & Gamble. The Mara Foundation would provide mentoring and the Intel Corporation would provide up to $5 million in training entrepreneurship and basic trends. Let us collectively make a parallel between this dynamic and when NBA and NFL athletes sign multimillion-dollar endorsement deals with billion-dollar companies like Nike, Adidas and Reebok. This makes it abundantly clear that YALI members who emerge as presidents of their respective nations will more than likely give these predatory and blood-sucking companies the green light to rape and plunder our sacred land and even worse let it emphatically known this is returning the favour for all their mentoring and goodwill during their formative years. When USAID boldly claims Africa is their new frontier, they should under any circumstances be accused of false advertising. They have 27 regional and bilateral missions in the following nations: Angola, Benin, DRC, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. This includes the four leadership centres for YALI in Ghana, Kenya, Senegal and South Africa. USAID lists their areas of priority as follows: Agriculture and Food Security, Democracy, Human Rights and Governance, Economic Growth and Assistance, Economic Growth and Trade, Education, Ending Extreme Poverty, Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment, Global Health, Water and Sanitation, Working in Crisis and Conflict. Africans are well aware we dwell in the court of public opinion, for that reason when turning attention to Zimbabwe and the SADC region, their disingenuous and nefarious attentions must be exposed at all costs. When USAID praises Southern Africa for popularising multi-party democracy we must ask is this a back-handed compliment or an indirect attack aimed at President Mugabe and ZANU-PF? USAID arrogantly states they are building the competencies of electoral officials to support free and transparent elections across the continent and regional institutions in 22 countries perhaps they can explain to Africans – who they deem savage and uncivilised – why the electoral college, not the popular vote, determines who becomes president in the US and why ultra-sexism prevents the so-called caretakers of democracy from making a woman president of the United States. USAID claims to have given $3 billion to Zimbabwe since independence that has been geared towards health systems, standards of living, supporting democratic institutions and actors and encouraging a free market economy. Does this sound like architecture without external interference? USAID claims to have provided food to 7,5 million people since 2009, allocated $54,5 million to Zimbabwe for drought relief in 2016, which represented 42,5 percent of the drought relief reserved for Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Madagascar, Lesotho and Swaziland. USAID claims their assistance aimed at eradicating HIV-AIDS in Zimbabwe is the main reason the rate has decreased from 26 percent to 14 percent. USAID boasts about spending $170 million in factories and farms to increase productivity of smallholder farmers. USAID claims to have sent thousands of Zimbabwean students to universities in the US. What has Zimbabwe done to deserve USAID’s unlimited empathy and benevolence? The answer is simple, to cover up the damages that US-EU sanctions on Zimbabwe have done for the past 16 years. USAID did not reclaim that land for Zimbabwean farmers, did not educate those Zimbabwean students from kindergarten to high school, did not create the world’s first national HIV-AIDS levy to eradicate the deadly pandemic. USAID adds insult to injury by posing as Mother Africa’s knight in shining armour.

While Nvidia attempted to hit every corner of the market with its broad-ranging line of Pascal-based cards, AMD attempted to gain ground by focusing on the lower end of the spectrum with its first generation of Polaris-based cards. At the top of the line was the AMD Radeon RX 480, a card aimed at delivering VR-ready performance at around $260. Below that was the RX 470, a solid 1080p performer priced below $240. Both were and remain solid cards, but low supply and high demand saw many buyers paying a premium price for what should have been an excellent value. Now we have the Radeon RX 500 line, AKA not the powerful cards featuring AMD's new Vega architecture everyone was hoping for. AMD is calling the RX 500 series the second generation of Polaris, though it's less of an upgrade and more of a refresh. The line consists of enhanced versions of the RX 460, 470 and 480, along with an $US80 (starting from $129 in Australia) RX 550 card, you know, for the kids. We're focusing on the very familiar Radeon RX 570 and 580. Most of the specs for the RX 570 and RX 580 are exactly the same as last year's RX 470 and RX 480. They're basically the same thing, only slightly more powerful. The RX 580 has had its clock speed upped to 1,257 MHz base and 1,340 MHz boosted over the 480's 1,120/1,266, while the RX 570 tops its predecessor at 1,168/1,244 Mhz to the older card's 926/1,206. Like I said, it's a small but significant improvement. Note that these specs are reference specifications, but AMD isn't releasing reference cards this time around. Instead we've got a slew of board partner offerings available, many of which provide even more of a boost. The Sapphire RX 580 Nitro+ 8GB card we tested (the RX 580 is also available in 4GB versions) kicks the boost clock up to 1,411 MHz, while the ASUS RX 570 Strix OC card we received boosts to 1,278 MHz. The Sapphire Nitro+ RX 580 is pretty on the bottom, plain on the top and outfitted with striking heat pipes on the inside. Here's a list of RX 570 and 580 partner cards available at launch. AU Editor's Note: All prices have been pulled from StaticICE, using the cheapest price from the largest major retailers (Umart, PC Case Gear, Scorptec, MSY, and so on). You can save a few extra dollars by going to smaller outlets, but this is the base level you can expect to pay. TUL's cards, which also go by the brand name PowerColor, aren't available in Australia, but I've included prices for XFX's range of cards. ASUS $339 for RX 570 STRIX OC 4GB (tested) $299 for RX 570 STRIX 4GB Gigabyte $429 for RX 580 Aorus OC 8GB $389 for RX 580 Aorus 8GB $385 for RX 580 Gigabyte Gaming 8GB $349 for RX 580 Aorus 4GB $339 for RX 580 Gigabyte Gaming 4GB $299 for RX 570 Aorus 4GB $289 for RX 570 Gaming 4GB MSI $409 for RX 580 Gaming 8G $289 for RX 570 ARMOUR 4G Sapphire $459 for RX 580 Nitro+ Limited edition 8GB $419 for RX 580 Nitro+ 8GB (tested) $339 for RX 580 Pulse 4GB $315 for RX 570 Nitro+ 4GB $299 for RX 570 Pulse 4GB XFX $409 for RX 580 GTR-S Black Edition 8GB Crimson $399 for RX 580 GTS Black Edition 8GB $379 RX 580 GTS XXX Edition 8GB It's 2017, and the Asus Strix card is sporting dual DVI ports. This will doubtlessly overjoy someone. Before we get into performance, let me say right off the bat that if you purchased an RX 470 or RX 480 last year, don't feel compelled to trade up to the newer, slightly more powerful models. You've still got a fine card. Save your cash for when the Vega cards come out later this year. AMD's target audience for the Radeon RX 500 series is the reportedly large number of gamers still playing on video cards two years old or older. AMD tells us that audience is more than 500 million strong, some 80 per cent of all PC gamers. The RX 570 is for those looking for a smooth experience on modern games at 1080p. The RX 580 is for those who might be up for pushing towards 1440p. As for the competition, AMD is pitting the RX 580 against NVIDIA $270 Geforce GTX 1060, while the RX 570 has its sights on the GTX 1050 Ti, priced at $185. Performance I took turns swapping the two cards out of my current work system, featuring an Intel Core i7 6700, 16GB of pretty old Corsair DDR4 memory and damn I really need to upgrade my testing PC. I've got a newer system with an AMD Ryzen 1700x and much newer memory, but I decided to stick to the more known quantity for the purposes of benchmarking. Since we already know a lot about how these chips are put together (everybody loves finfet) and in the interest of time, I stuck with the basics. Here come the frames per seconds. If you're looking for absurd numbers, look elsewhere. These are a couple of low to lower-middle range cards with modest goals in mind. Both do an admirable job of handling some of today's tougher games at unreasonably high settings. The Radeon RX 580 hovered around or at the 60 frames per second mark for the more demanding titles, the average dropping below that for Ashes of the Singularity, which is mean, and Metro Last Light Redux, which is always kind of a dick. The RX 570 did its best, keeping its distance from the scores of its more powerful sibling but still putting up a good fight. Richard Leadbetter over at Eurogamer ran a comparison between the newer cards and last year's releases, and the RX 570 performs about the same as last year's RX 480. That's quite a nice bump. The Radeon RX 580 would love to be a card for reliable 4K gaming, but it's probably not going to be that if you stick to ultra settings. Hitman running DirectX 12 managed to break the 60 frames per second barrier here, while the rest hung out in the high 40s, early 50s. Except Metro Last Light Redux. I don't even known why I include it anymore. And look at that Radeon RX 570! If you don't mind 30 frames per second, you'd be hard-pressed to find a card in its price range to handle 4K as well. Final Thoughts That's the key, isn't it? The price range. Before I started swapping in the new Radeon RX 500 series cards, I had a NVIDIA Geforce 1080 Ti in my system, blowing most games out of the water at 4K resolution. But that's a $1000 card. The Radeon RX 580 starts at around $385 for the 8GB version, and it either keeps up with or outperforms NVIDIA's similarly priced GTX 1060 6GB. It's hard to say what's going to happen when AMD starts rolling out its new Vega cards later this year, but that's a worry for another time and likely another price bracket. Things at the lower end of the price pool are heating up as AMD introduces a pair of strong swimmers. This article was originally published on Kotaku.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Our vision is to enable affordable microelectronics that improve the quality of life. To achieve this, our mission is to invent, develop, manufacture and service advanced technology for high-tech lithography, metrology and software solutions for the semiconductor industry.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Kellyanne Conway on Comey: The president expects people who work for him to be loyal to the country and administration posted at 8:41 pm on May 11, 2017 by Allahpundit Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES He wanted an FBI director who was investigating his own campaign associates to be “loyal” to the administration? If that doesn’t mean “He wanted Comey to tank the probe,” what does it mean? The weirdest thing about the last 52 or so hours isn’t the fact that Comey was fired (although the timing is pretty weird), it’s the completely self-defeating spin that keeps coming from the White House. After the news broke and the White House cited Rod Rosenstein’s memo as a key factor in the firing, critics turned around and yelled, “Liar! Trump wanted Comey out, not Rosenstein!” So, earlier today, Trump goes on NBC and says … right, I wanted Comey out. Rosenstein didn’t matter. Then the critics yelled, “You only wanted Comey out so that you could stop the Russia investigation!” So here’s Sarah Huckabee Sanders at today’s White House briefing: The White House said Thursday that removing FBI Director James Comey from his post may hasten the agency’s investigation into Russian meddling. “We want this to come to its conclusion, we want it to come to its conclusion with integrity,” said deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders, referring to the FBI’s probe into Moscow’s interference in last year’s election. “And we think that we’ve actually, by removing Director Comey, taken steps to make that happen.” “All you wanted was a lackey at the FBI who’d be loyal to the president,” the critics hollered, “not an independent investigator who’d find the truth!” So Kellyanne Conway goes on Fox and insists that one of the problems with Comey was his … lack of loyalty. Not the first time we’ve heard that this week, either. The DOJ isn’t supposed to show “loyalty” to the White House when it’s investigating something, particularly if the investigation may involve, uh, the White House, so what’s she talking about? Why can’t they just settle on “Comey had lost the public’s trust after last year” as their message and stick with it, for cripes sake? Here’s the latest. So … Comey was fired because of the Russia investigation? Trump to NBC: "When I decided to [fire Comey], I said to myself, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story." — Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) May 11, 2017 The key bit with Conway comes at 7:10 of the clip below. Sanders also claimed at today’s briefing that she’s heard from “countless” FBI agents who support Trump’s decision to fire Comey. I’m sure some do support it, but agents typically don’t chatter approvingly to people at the White House (let alone to a high-ranking press person) about a major political decision precisely because they’re not supposed to show political “loyalty.” Intel people interviewed by the media are far less approving of Comey’s firing, although a press that’s hostile to Trump can go out and find hostile sources with ease. We’ll know from the scope of the leaks in the weeks to come how angry the feds are about it. For what it’s worth, though, the visit to FBI headquarters that Trump had considered making tomorrow is reportedly off.

Trump suggested in a tweet sent Friday morning that he might have recordings of conversations with former FBI Director Comey, who was fired by the president earlier in the week. The New York Times reported Thursday night that Trump unsuccessfully asked for Comey's loyalty during a dinner at the White House in January. “James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” Trump tweeted.  ADVERTISEMENT When pressed by Wisconsin reporters about the warning to Comey, Ryan turned to an often-invoked strategy he uses whenever asked about an inflammatory comment made by Trump on Twitter. "I've decided I'm not going to comment on the tweets of the day, or of the hour," Ryan said, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "I haven't seen them all, to be candid with you." "I'm going to leave the president to talk about and defend his tweets." Ryan said it’s Trump’s right to fire the FBI director. "He made that decision. It's been made. I think what's important now is that we make sure there is a qualified and capable person that people have confidence in to take over the FBI," Ryan said. "It's also important that the professionals there keep doing their jobs." White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer refused to confirm if Trump has secretly recorded conversations with Comey or other visitors to the White House. “I’ve talked to the president. The president has nothing further to add on that," Spicer said at the daily press briefing. Top Democrats on the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees demanded the White House provide the tapes to Congress, if they exist.  “For a president who baselessly accused his predecessor of illegally wiretapping him, that Mr. Trump would suggest that he, himself, may have engaged in such conduct is staggering,” Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffRyan declines comment on Trump’s warning to Comey Trump's warning to Comey deepens White House crisis Top Intel Dem demands release of Trump's 'tapes' on Comey MORE (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. “The president should immediately provide any such recordings to Congress or admit, once again, to have made a deliberately misleading - and in this case threatening - statement.” When asked by Wisconsin reporters if he’d be okay with Trump recording their conversations, Ryan replied, “I’ve never given any thought to that.” Tags Adam Schiff Paul Ryan   View the discussion thread.

Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini argues Mehrotra has a chance to "change the narrative" about Micron, by selling more parts of a finished system, not just chips. For that purpose, he thinks the company may want to consider buying Pure Storage. By Tiernan Ray May 12, 2017 3:25 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large DRAM and flash memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) this week formally welcomed its new chief executive, Sanjay Mehrotra, to the top spot, replacing retiring CEO Mark Durcan, and Susquehanna Financial’s Mehdi Hosseini sees good things in store for the company with the new regime. Mehrotra’s appointment had been announced on April 27th after a CEO search following Durcan’s announcement of his retirement back in February. Mehrotra ran NAND flash maker SanDisk from 1988 until it was bought out last year by Western Digital (WDC). A bunch of background is provided about Mehrotra on Micron’s Web site. Hosseini, who has a “Positive” rating on Micron stock, likes Mehrotra’s experience in NAND, writing that “while DRAM accounts for ~60-65% of MU's revenue (and >65% of total OP), it is Mehrotra's NAND background and experience that could position MU for long-term secular growth." Specifically, Hosseini thinks Micron can and should “go up the stack,” meaning, incorporating more of the parts of a finished storage system, rather than just selling the chips. Such a change “may be what it needs to alter the narrative from being a cyclical component vendor heavily exposed to DRAM to a vertically integrated storage solutions provider." He compares that to the way Western has become a vendor to cloud computing rather than just a storage component vendor. And Hosseini thinks maybe Micron should buy Pure Storage (PSTG), the vendor of flash-based storage equipment and software. "In this light, we argue that Positive-rated PSTG ($15 PT) would be an attractive target for MU, given: 1) PSTG is a first-mover in the growing All- Flash Array (AFA) space with a market-leading cost structure (~65% product margins) that can be vertically integrated to extend cost leadership, 2) PSTG's expertise in firmware and system software can be leveraged to help MU strengthen its SSD product portfolio to better compete with WDC, Intel, and Samsung." Pure could add 25 cents a share to Micron earnings in 2019, he reckons. Buying Pure “would be a good first step in changing the narrative on Micron." Micron shares today are down 20 cents, or 0.7%, at $28.83. Pure stock is down 9 cents, or 0.8%, at $11.38.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Windows 10 ARM is less locked down than Windows 10 S (supports non-Store Win32 apps) 05/11/2017 at 4:00 PM by Brad Linder 11 Comments Microsoft has two new versions of Windows 10 on the way. Windows 10 S is a streamlined version of Windows that will only run software downloaded from the Windows Store in order to improve security, performance, and the software update process. Designed with the education market in mind, it will also be available for mainstream users, and Windows 10 S is the operating system that will ship on the upcoming Surface Laptop… although you can upgrade to Windows 10 Pro if you find the stripped down operating system too restrictive. But you know what else isn’t particularly stripped down? The new version of Windows 10 designed to run on ARM-based processors. First announced last year, Microsoft provided an update on Windows 10 ARM at the MS Build developer conference today. And the company confirmed that not only would Windows 10 ARM be able to run legacy apps developed for computers with x86 processors… but you’d be able to just download any old Win32 app from the internet, install it, and run it on a computer running Windows 10 ARM. In other words, Windows 10 S runs on devices with ARM or x86 processors, but only supports Windows Store apps. Windows 10 ARM only runs on devices with ARM chips… but supports apps from pretty much any source. Developers don’t need to convert their software in any way, because Windows 10 ARM includes a built-in emulation layer that allows Win32 apps to run on an ARM-powered system. But Microsoft demonstrated how you could download a common program like 7zip from the internet and simply install it on a device with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. Of course, developers can also package software optimized for ARM as Universal Windows Platform apps for distribution in the Windows Store. But they don’t necessarily have to. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chip is expected to be one of the first to support Windows 10 on ARM, and while it’s Qualcomm’s most powerful mobile processor to date, it’s still not exactly a speed demon by PC standards. Like any PC with a relatively slow processor, systems with ARM chips will probably be unable to compete with the machines featuring the latest high-end Intel or AMD processors when it comes to gaming or other complex tasks like video rendering. But devices with this sort of chip get many of the benefits of ARM-based processors including relatively low power consumption and integrated wireless connectivity features. That could made ARM-based systems a good choice for hybrid devices like 2-in-1 tablets… or maybe even 2-in-1 smartphones that also offer PC-like functionality when docked to a mouse, keyboard, and display.       Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 11 Comments on "Windows 10 ARM is less locked down than Windows 10 S (supports non-Store Win32 apps)" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest Joe Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

UMPC) with always on and connected features (Atom plus WWAN chips don’t cut it).

That would be spectacular. Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 1 day 2 hours ago Guest GuestInBlack Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Both possible, but both unlikely. Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 23 hours 23 minutes ago Guest Max Siegieda Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

The Tinkerboard while beefy uses a 32 bit ARM processor, Windows 10 ARM requires 64bit. How can you tell? 32bit is ARM v7 while 64bit is v8, e.g. cortex A53, A57, A72, A73 Vote Up1Vote Down  Reply 22 hours 14 minutes ago Guest Generalkidd Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. Another problem with ARM is that even if you have a 64 bit ARM board that technically means the system requirements for Windows, it still probably won’t work because OS’s need special specific drivers for every ARM chipset and hardware. That’s because ARM doesn’t have very good legacy compatibility and universal drivers. It’s different with x86 though since the architecture is designed for legacy support and compatibility which is why it doesn’t matter whether your x86 board has a CPU manufactured by Intel, AMD, or VIA. Windows, Linux, even OS X (hackintosh) will run universally on all x86 hardware for the most part. But with ARM, you’ll need special builds for specific sets of hardware.

All in the name of security of course. /s Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 20 hours 33 minutes ago Member zdanee Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Or maybe it’s time to slap a low-power ARM core next to some x86 ones and let the OS run on the power-efficient ARM core while apps can use the x86 cores. Low idle power and still decent performance.

Miss-leading article and headline, this is not some special Arm only build of Windows 10 it is Win10 Pro for Arm PC’s, there is nothing stopping MS from providing a Win10 S version for Arm systems too. If you actually bother to watch the video you see the Microsoft engineers state this is regular Win10 Pro with all the same USB drivers that Win10 has.
